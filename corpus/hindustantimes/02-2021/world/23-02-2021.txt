And the number of new infections went up by 56,079 over the same period to 28.1 million, which is nearly 9% of the population.The first Covid-19 case was reported in the US on January 21, 2020 and the first death a fortnight later on February 6.“Today, we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone: 500,071 (official figures can be different depending on the cut-off time and tracker agency),” President Biden said. “That’s more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. That’s more lives lost to this virus than any other nation on Earth.” Brazil, India and the United Kingdom are next.“As a nation, we can’t accept such a cruel fate. While we have been fighting this pandemic for so long, we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,” he added.Biden has ordered the US flag to be flown at half-mast for the entire week in memory of those who died of Covid-19.President Biden’s response to the pandemic and the attendant fallout has been in marked contrast to that of his predecessor Donald Trump, who had tried to downplay the crisis and frequently questioned mitigation measures such as social distancing and masking.Even in the best of circumstances, the pandemic would have been a serious problem. “However, that does not explain how a rich and sophisticated country can have the most percentage of deaths and be the hardest-hit country in the world,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a top adviser to Biden, told Reuters. “That I believe should not have happened.”With just 4% of the world population, the United States accounts for a fifth of the 2.5 million global deaths and a fourth of all infections.But the situation has improved despite the threat of new strains of the virus from South Africa and Brazil. Vaccinations are up and new infections and deaths are declining. Both Biden and Fauci are hopeful of the country returning to normalcy around Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-marks-grim-milestone-of-500-000-covid-deaths-101614102100971.html
23-02-2021||World||UK to push at G-7 for global standard on 'vaccine passports'||Britain plans to use its presidency of the Group of Seven economic powers to push for an internationally recognized system of vaccine passports that could allow world travel to resume, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged Tuesday that the idea raises “complex” ethical issues.The British government previously said it was not considering issuing vaccine passports to people who had been inoculated. But it has now set up a review into “Covid status certification” that will examine ways people can prove they don’t have the coronavirus, either through vaccination or by showing a negative test result.The government said it would “look to introduce a system to allow vaccinated individuals to travel more freely internationally.” It added it would work with other countries through the World Health Organization, the G-7 -- whose presidency the UK holds this year -- and other bodies on “a clear international framework with standards that provide consistency for passengers and industry alike.”“Introducing such a system also needs to be fair and not unduly disadvantage people who have yet to be offered — or gain access to — a vaccine,” the government said in a document outlining its plans to lift Britain’s pandemic restrictions. “That being the case, the government does not expect this solution to be available quickly, and restrictions like those in place across the world are likely to continue for the near future.”The British government is also looking at how such proof might be used by employers, venue owners or organizers of large events. One option under consideration is using the National Health Service contact-tracing app, which millions of people in Britain have on their phones, to display Covid-19 test results.Johnson said Tuesday that “there are deep and complex issues that we need to explore” before making a decision.“We can’t be discriminatory against people who for whatever reason can’t have the vaccine,” he said. “There might be medical reasons why people can’t have a vaccine. Or some people may genuinely refuse to have one. I think that’s mistaken, I think everybody should have a vaccine, but we need to thrash all this out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-push-at-g-7-for-global-standard-on-vaccine-passports-101614100003431.html

Each of those variants has been found in the US, adding urgency to the country’s effort to understand how they’re spreading.About 3% of all cases are being sequenced to find variants, Walensky said. “That obviously needs to scale up,” she said.The CDC is working with seven academic institutions to sequence about 4,000 samples a week, and commercial labs are sequencing about 6,000 cases a week, Walensky said. They are expected to further expand capacity.Congress is proposing $1.75 billion in additional funding to expand sequencing as part of President Joe Biden’s economic stimulus plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-key-genetic-analysis-for-coronavirus-variants-by-5500-101614099902199.html

The illness was not related to the coronavirus and royal officials called it a precautionary measure.Philip's youngest son, Prince Edward, told Sky News that his father was “a lot better.”Edward said "he’s looking forward to getting out, which is the most positive thing, so we keep our fingers crossed.”Other members of the royal family have continued their official duties during Philip’s hospitalization.Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, retired from public duties in 2017 and rarely appears in public. During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, he and the queen had been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London.Both Philip and Elizabeth, 94, received COVID-19 vaccinations in January.The queen performed her first face-to-face event of the year on Thursday, when she knighted a royal aide during a private, socially distanced ceremony at Windsor.Philip, whose 100th birthday is in June, married Elizabeth in 1947 at London's Westminster Abbey five years before she became queen. He is the longest-serving royal consort in British history.He last stayed in the hospital in December 2019, when he was treated for a “pre-existing condition” and discharged after four nights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-has-infection-will-stay-in-hospital-palace-101614097755832.html
23-02-2021||World||How rich is Saudi Arabia? Kingdom does the math in balance sheet overhaul||The kingdom is working on creating a consolidated balance sheet of its assets and liabilities which will include items currently kept off the oil-rich economy's books, including the investments and debts of its powerful sovereign wealth fund."The main purpose of this programme is to have a financial equivalent of an MRI of the government balance sheet," a Finance Ministry spokesman told Reuters, adding that it would include assets and liabilities that are currently "off-balance sheet".Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman has put Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, at the centre of reforms aimed at diversifying the economy of the world's top oil exporter away from fossil fuel.Under the prince's chairmanship, PIF has transformed from a sleepy sovereign wealth fund into a global investment vehicle making multi-billion dollar bets on hi-tech companies such as Uber as well as other equity investments and pledging tens of billions of dollars to funds run by Japan's Softbank.Its financial statements are not published and it does not feature in the kingdom's budget, which is publicly available.Gulf countries don't typically publish information about their overall debts and assets but the PIF's riskier investment profile and infusion of state funding have made its opacity an issue for some investors."Transfers of wealth from liquid pools of assets like central bank reserves into PIF's less liquid (and less transparent) investments increases the overall risk profile of the public sector balance sheet," said Kirjanis Krustins, a director in Fitch's sovereign team."Debt investors would tend to see the government and its key government related entities such as PIF as representing substantially the same risk. Thus the levering up of the broader Saudi complex could at some point impact the government's own borrowing costs," he said.The government media office did not respond to a request for comment.ARAMCO BILLIONSThe government started working in the second half of last year on the so-called Sovereign Asset and Liability Management (SALM) framework and the spokesman said it was a 'long-term project' with no decision yet made on when and how its results would be disclosed."If we use benchmarks we will see countries spent a couple of years to implement the consolidation phase," he said of the project.The PIF's finances are formidable.Its assets have swelled to $400 billion as of 2020 from $150 billion in 2015, with the fund bolstered by an expected $70 billion payday from Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, for PIF's stake in a petrochemical giant and a $40 billion transfer from the central bank's foreign reserves.It was also the recipient of nearly $30 billion in proceeds from Aramco's initial public offering in 2019.The fund has raised $21 billion in loans between 2018 and 2019, and is finalising a new facility expected to be over $10 billion in size, sources have said.THE 'NORMAL' WAYDespite Saudi's oil wealth, creating enough jobs for the kingdom's young population is one of the biggest challenges facing Prince Mohammed, known in the West as MbS.The government has been pushing through economic policies since 2016 aiming to create millions of jobs and reduce unemployment to 7% by 2030. But fiscal austerity to contain a yawning deficit has slowed investment, and the coronavirus crisis last year pushed unemployment up to a record 15.4%.To get the deficit down from an eye-watering 12% of GDP last year to a shortfall of 4.9% by the end of this year, Riyadh has slashed capital spending.It is relying instead on the PIF to fund some of the major infrastructure projects to help boost growth, including NEOM, a $500 billion high-tech business zone, and the recently announced "The Line", a 1 million inhabitants carbon-free city in NEOM, expected to cost between $100 billion and $200 billion.PIF plans to inject at least 150 billion riyals ($40 billion) annually into the local economy until 2025, and to increase its assets to 4 trillion riyals ($1.07 trillion) by that date, Prince Mohammed has said."MBS understands that unless the economy grows at a rate above 6.5-7%, the youth unemployment rate will stagnate or grow – and that is a ticking time bomb," said Khaled Abdel Majeed, MENA fund manager at London-based SAM Capital Partners, an investment advisory firm, commenting about transfers of state funds to PIF."Doing things the 'normal' way through 'normal' channels will take more time than is available."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-rich-is-saudi-arabia-kingdom-does-the-math-in-balance-sheet-overhaul-101614098697057.html
23-02-2021||World||US treasury nominee Adeyemo urges get-tough attitude on China||Wally Adeyemo, President Joe Biden's nominee for the No. 2 job at the US Treasury, on Tuesday said Washington should work with allies to hold China accountable to international rules to ensure a level playing field for companies in the United States and elsewhere."China is our top strategic competitor," Adeyemo told a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee."Where China is not willing to play on a level playing field, it's important that we hold them accountable in the international system," Adeyemo said, adding that taking such action with other countries would better "demonstrate to the Chinese that they're isolated when they violate the rules."Echoing comments from other Biden officials, Adeyemo struck a hardline tone on Beijing, vowing to fight what he called "unfair economic practices" in China and elsewhere, while working to rectify economic inequality at home.If confirmed as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's deputy, Adeyemo, 39, would play a key role in shaping US economic policy on issues ranging from financial regulation to relief for everyday Americans and US sanctions on foreign governments.A former senior adviser at asset manager BlackRock Inc and the child of Nigerian immigrants, Adeyemo would be the first Black deputy secretary of the Treasury. He served as a top national security and economic adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama and held senior jobs at the Treasury.Adeyemo underscored the importance of sanctions, and said Yellen had asked him to conduct a top-to-bottom review of US sanctions policy, if confirmed."Treasury's tools must play a role in responding to authoritarian governments that seek to subvert our democratic institutions; combating unfair economic practices in China and elsewhere; and detecting and eliminating terrorist organizations that seek to do us harm," he said.Treasury oversees a host of sanctioning tools, including a ban on US investment in alleged Chinese military companies that was introduced by former President Donald Trump.The ban, which has prompted market confusion since being unveiled late last year, takes effect in November and investors are eager to learn if Biden will revoke it or clarify its scope and use it to go after top Chinese firms.Adeyemo also called for targeted investments in critical US industries and technologies, and policies to protect workers and companies from anti-competitive trade practices, signaling a hardline stance on trade issues.He defended Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, and dodged questions about concerns that its passage could trigger inflation. Adeyemo also backed Biden's plans to raise corporate tax rates, and said he would work with international partners to end "a race to the bottom" in corporate taxation.Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and other members of the committee lauded Adeyemo's qualifications. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said he expected Adeyemo to be confirmed in the job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-nominee-adeyemo-urges-get-tough-attitude-on-china-101614098663211.html
23-02-2021||World||Donald Trump may soon have to answer rape allegations under oath||During a December visit to New York City, writer E. Jean Carroll says she went shopping with a fashion consultant to find the “best outfit” for one of the most important days of her life - when she’ll sit face-to-face with the man she accuses of raping her decades ago, former President Donald Trump.The author and journalist hopes that day will come this year. Her lawyers are seeking to depose Trump in a defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against the former president in November 2019 after he denied her accusation that he raped her at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. Trump said he never knew Carroll and accused her of lying to sell her new book, adding: “She’s not my type.”She plans to be there if Trump is deposed.“I am living for the moment to walk into that room to sit across the table from him,” Carroll told Reuters in an interview. “I think of it everyday.”Carroll, 77, a former Elle magazine columnist, seeks unspecified damages in her lawsuit and a retraction of Trump’s statements. It is one of two defamation cases involving sexual misconduct allegations against Trump that could move forward faster now that he has left the presidency. While in office, Trump’s lawyers delayed the case in part by arguing that the pressing duties of his office made responding to civil lawsuits impossible.“The only barrier to proceeding with the civil suits was that he’s the president,” said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor and now an adjunct professor of clinical law at the New York University School of Law.“I think there will be a sense among the judges that it’s time to get a move on in these cases,” said Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s attorney.An attorney for Trump and another representative of the former president did not respond to requests for comment.Trump faces a similar defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his reality television show “The Apprentice.” In 2016, Zervos accused Trump of sexual misconduct, saying that he kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting in New York and later groped her at a California hotel as the two met to discuss job opportunities.Trump denied the allegations and called Zervos a liar, prompting her to sue him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages and a retraction. Trump tried unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed, arguing that, as president, he was immune from suits filed in state courts. His lawyers appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, which is still considering the case. Zervos filed a motion in early February asking the court to resume the case now that Trump’s no longer president.Zervos and Carroll are among more than two dozen women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct that they say occurred in the years before he became president. Other accusers include a former model who claims Trump sexually assaulted her at the 1997 U.S. Open tennis tournament; a former Miss Universe pageant contestant who said Trump groped her in 2006; and a reporter who alleges Trump forcibly kissed her without her consent in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago resort.Trump has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated.In September, after several unsuccessful attempts by Trump’s lawyers to get Carroll’s case dismissed or delayed, U.S. Justice Department officials under his administration took the unusual step of asking that the government be substituted for Trump as the defendant in the case. Justice Department lawyers argued that Trump, like any typical government employee, is entitled under federal law to immunity from civil lawsuits when performing his job. They argued that he was acting in his capacity as president when he said Carroll was lying.Legal experts said it was unprecedented for the Justice Department to defend a president for conduct before he took office. When Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected that argument, the Justice Department appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has yet to rule on it.It’s yet to be seen whether Justice Department officials under President Joe Biden, who took office last month, will continue to defend the case on Trump’s behalf. The White House and the Justice Department declined to comment.If the appeals court upholds Judge Kaplan’s decision, it would likely clear the way for Trump to be deposed by Carroll’s lawyers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE DNACarroll’s lawyers are also seeking a DNA sample from Trump. Carroll says she still has the dress she was wearing when Trump allegedly attacked her.“I hung it in my closet,” she said.Carroll said she randomly crossed paths with Trump in the Bergdorf Goodman’s store in the mid-1990s. Carroll, who hosted a TV talk show at the time, said Trump recognized her. The two chatted, she said. Trump asked her to pick out a gift for an unidentified woman, and they eventually ended up in the lingerie department. After asking her to try on a body suit, Trump closed the door in a dressing room, pinned her against a wall, unzipped his pants and sexually assaulted her, according to the complaint.Carroll said she told two friends about the alleged attack shortly after it happened, but did not report Trump to police, fearing retribution from the wealthy and well-connected businessman. Decades later, Carroll went public with her story in a June 2019 New York magazine article, adapted from a new book, “What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.”She said she was inspired to recount the incident by the #MeToo movement, which emboldened women to share their experiences of sexual assault and harassment. In photos shot for that story, Kaplan, at the request of the magazine’s photography director, wore the same black Donna Karan dress that she said she had worn on the day that Trump allegedly assaulted her.When Carroll filed her lawsuit later in 2019, her lawyer, Kaplan, had a guard escort her to retrieve the dress from her closet for forensic testing. An analysis concluded no semen was found on the dress, but the DNA of an unidentified male was detected on the shoulder and sleeves, according to the Jan. 8, 2020 lab report, which was reviewed by Reuters.If the dress does contain traces of Trump’s DNA, it would not prove his guilt. But a match could be used as evidence that he had contact with the dress and to help disprove his claims that he never met Carroll, according to two forensic experts not involved in the case.“How his DNA got on that dress would be the argument,” said Monte Miller, a biochemist who runs a DNA analysis consultancy and previously worked at the Texas Department of Public Safety’s State Crime Laboratory. “It’s for the attorneys and the courts and everybody else to argue about why it’s there and how it got there.”Carroll said she’s confident the DNA on the dress belongs to Trump and wants her day in court. She said she now sleeps with a gun next to her bed because she has received death threats since publicly accusing Trump.“This defamation suit is not about me,” said Carroll, who meets regularly with other women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. It’s about every woman “who can’t speak up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-soon-have-to-answer-rape-allegations-under-oath-101614098126883.html

Governments are censoring journalists, manipulating information, attacking human rights defenders and eroding women's rights"I want to reiterate the European Union's call on China to comply with its obligations on the national and international law to respect and protect human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities in Xinjiang, in Tibet and in Inner Mongolia," Borrel said.He added, "Once again, we urge China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers including High Commissioner Bachelet. This is key to enable an independent impartial and transparent assessment of the grave concerns that the international community has."He also said that the Chinese Communist Party must respect the fundamental freedoms, the rule of law in Hong Kong amid the imposition of the draconian National Security Law."I also want to reiterate our call on China to respect fundamental freedoms, rule of law and democratic principles in Hong Kong and to ensure its high degree of autonomy under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle," he said.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.Meanwhile, China imposed the draconian National Security Law in Hong Kong last year.The law criminalises secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1. Since then, a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-demands-china-for-meaningful-access-to-xinjiang-for-rights-observers-101614097854750.html

The 34-year-old was sentenced at DundeeSheriff Court after he had pleaded guilty. According to the BBC, Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told Bowes-Lyon in court that he had repeatedly ignored his victim's pleas during the attack."Even now – one year on – she still, occasionally, has nightmares and feels panicked because of being sexually assaulted by you. This has also had an impact on her emotional wellbeing," said Sheriff Carmichael.Last month, Bowes-Lyon apologised for his actions after entering his guilty plea, saying he felt "greatly ashamed" for causing "such distress to a guest in my home".He said he had "drunk to excess" on the night of the assault, although he noted that this was "no excuse" for what transpired."I did not think I was capable of behaving the way I did but have had to face up to it and take responsibility," he said outside the court."Over the last year this has involved seeking and receiving professional help as well as agreeing to plead guilty as quickly as possible. My apologies go, above all, to the woman concerned but I would also like to apologise to family, friends and colleagues for the distress I have caused them," he said.Previously, Dundee Sheriff Court heard that the woman fled the castle the morning after the attack on February 13 last year and flew home to report the matter to police, following which Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police were involved in the investigation. Earl’s defence counsel John Scott said his client had shown "genuine remorse".Glamis Castle is the seat of the Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, who are both part of the family of the Queen Mother – the late mother of Queen Elizabeth II.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queens-relative-handed-10-month-jail-term-for-sexual-assault-in-uk-101614097665879.html
23-02-2021||World||US security officials cast blame for January 6 failures at Capitol||Testifying publicly for the first time about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, former security officials say that bad intelligence was to blame for the disastrous failure to anticipate the violent intentions of the mob. That left them unprepared for the attack that was unlike anything they had ever seen before.The officials, including the former chief of the Capitol Police, are blaming other federal agencies — and each other — for their failure to defend the building as supporters of then-President Donald Trump overwhelmed security barriers, breaking windows and doors and sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers.Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund described a scene that was “like nothing” he had seen in his 30 years of policing.“When the group arrived at the perimeter, they did not act like any group of protestors I had ever seen," the ousted chief said, arguing that the insurrection was not the result of poor planning but of failures across the board from many agencies.Congress was hearing for the first time from Capitol security officials about the massive law enforcement failures on Jan. 6, the day the violent mob laid siege to the building and interrupted the presidential electoral count.“We must have the facts, and the answers are in this room," Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said at the beginning of the hearing.Three of the four scheduled to testify Tuesday before two Senate committees resigned under pressure immediately after the deadly attack, including Sund.Much remains unknown about what happened before and during the assault. How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? How did the agencies share that information with each other? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online?Read | US Capitol security chiefs give differing accounts of January 6 riotAfter smashing through the barriers at the perimeter, the invaders engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke through multiple windows and doors, sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers and interrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.Former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving are speaking publicly for the first time since their resignations at the hearing, which is part of a joint investigation by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee. They are joined by Sund and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, who sent additional officers to the scene after the rioting began.The hearing is the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over one week after the Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Thousands of National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission to review the missteps, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement have arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riots would be a top priority.Congress needs to know, quickly, how failed security preparations and delays in the response led to “a mad, angry mob invading this temple of our democracy,” Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said in an interview with The Associated Press.Klobuchar, D-Minn., said senators are especially focused on the timing of the deployment of the National Guard, which eventually arrived to help the overwhelmed police, how security agencies shared information ahead of the attack and if the command structure of the Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, contributed to the failures. She said there may be legislation to address any inadequacies.“We are on a fast track here simply because decisions have to be made about the Capitol,” Klobuchar said.Klobuchar said Tuesday’s hearing is the first of at least two public examinations of what went wrong that day as the Senate panels undertake a joint investigation into the security failures. A second hearing, expected to be held in the next few weeks, will examine the response of the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.While there is broad agreement that security measures were inadequate that day, officials have pointed the blame at each other for the causes and disputed each others’ accounts. The day after the riot, Sund said that his force “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.” It soon became clear that while the Capitol Police had prepared for protests, they were vastly unprepared for a violent insurrection — and many were beaten as they tried in vain to keep rioters from entering the building.Interim Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, who has temporarily replaced Sund, last month apologized for failing to prepare despite warnings that white supremacists and far-right groups would target Congress. But she also said that Sund had asked the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, to declare a state of emergency beforehand and allow him to request National Guard support, but the board declined. The Defense Department has said it asked the Capitol Police if it needed the Guard, but the request was denied.A third member of the Capitol Police Board denied Pittman’s claim hours after her testimony was released. J. Brett Blanton, who serves as the architect of the Capitol, said that Sund did not ask him for help and that there was “no record of a request for an emergency declaration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-security-officials-cast-blame-for-january-6-failures-at-capitol-101614097434104.html
23-02-2021||World||UK PM Johnson suggests he left journalism because he was always abusing people in print||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested on Tuesday that he had left journalism for politics, because in his original profession he often found himself abusing people in print.Johnson, 56, has displayed a colourful, sometimes combative speaking and writing style both as a journalist and as a politician, a trait which has fuelled many controversies during his three decades in the public eye."When you're a journalist, it's a great, great job. It's a great profession. But the trouble is that you always, sometimes, you find yourself always abusing people, attacking people," he said during a visit to a school on Tuesday."Not that you want to abuse and attack them, but you are being critical. You're being critical when maybe you feel sometimes a bit guilty about that because you haven't put yourself in the place of the person you're criticising."Johnson concluded his off-the-cuff remarks by suggesting that it was those aspects of journalism that had driven him to give politics a go instead.Read | Prime minister Boris Johnson sets out plan for fully reopening UK in JuneThe opposition Labour Party said Johnson should apologise to journalists."We know from Donald Trump that these kind of assaults on the free press are dangerous and designed to stir up distrust and division," said Labour's media policy chief, lawmaker Chris Matheson."For Boris Johnson to say journalists are 'always abusing people' probably says more about his own career," he added.As a young man, Johnson was sacked from his first job in journalism, at the Times newspaper, for making up a quote.He went on to have a successful career at the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name as a Brussels correspondent lambasting the European Union in vivid if not always entirely accurate prose.He later pursued parallel media and political careers as editor of the Spectator magazine and as a member of parliament.Even in more recent years, when he has focused more on successive political jobs as mayor of London, foreign affairs minister and prime minister, he has written frequent newspaper columns in his trademark style.In the latest of a series of similar examples, he caused a major public row with a 2018 column in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-suggests-he-left-journalism-because-he-was-always-abusing-people-101614095155086.html
23-02-2021||World||French households have saved $146 Billion as Covid lockdown curtailed spendings||French households built up as much as 120 billion euros ($146 billion) in excess savings in 2020 as lockdowns curtailed spending and government aid maintained incomes, according to the Bank of France.When and how French consumers will spend the nest egg is key to determining the speed of the economic recovery after the pandemic. While there is no full lockdown in France, the prolonged closing of bars and restaurants and a nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. is keeping a lid on spending for now.With hospitalizations rising, there is little chance of an imminent lifting of restrictions.“It’s a question of confidence - that is what will transform savings into growth,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said Monday evening on BFM Business television.To estimate excess savings, the Bank of France compared actual savings in 2020 to the trend based on 2019 figures.The central bank also said that while there was a 217 billion euro increase in gross debt levels of non-financial companies in 2020, their cash positions also rose by 200 billion, indicating most firms are only spending a fraction of the emergency state-guaranteed loans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-households-have-saved-146-billion-as-covid-lockdown-curtailed-spendings-101614075448228.html

The then Minister of Advanced Education, government of British Columbia, Naomi Yamamoto, had termed Kumar a ‘gifted’ teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-30-founder-anand-kumar-s-inspiring-work-lauded-in-canadian-parliament-101614093904698.html
23-02-2021||World||Republicans working to block Biden's health care pick; Democrats unfazed||President Joe Biden’s pick for health secretary, Xavier Becerra, faces two days of contentious Senate hearings. Republicans are portraying the Californian as unfit, but Democrats are unfazed, accusing the GOP of playing politics despite the coronavirus pandemic.Now attorney general of the nation's most populous state, Becerra will be grilled by two panels. Tuesday, it's the health committee's turn, followed Wednesday by the Finance Committee, which will vote on sending Becerra's nomination to the Senate floor. If confirmed, he'd be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services, a $1.4 trillion agency with a broad portfolio that includes health insurance programs, drug safety and approvals, advanced medical research and the welfare of children.In his opening statement, Becerra said it's clear the coronavirus pandemic will be his top priority if confirmed.“The president has ambitious goals – 100 million vaccine shots in arms in his first 100 days, increasing access to testing, sequencing the virus so we’re prepared for the variants, and reopening schools and businesses. HHS has a central role in meeting these goals – safely and equitably,” he said.Becerra, 63, represented Hispanic neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the US House for more than 20 years before becoming his state's chief law enforcement officer, succeeding Vice President Kamala Harris after she won election to the Senate. His politics are liberal but his style is low-key and oriented toward problem solving. As a congressman he played a behind-the-scenes role steering President Barack Obama's health care law through Democratic divisions in the House.Republican opposition has grown louder ahead of his nomination hearings. On Monday, Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas released a letter in which they asked Biden to withdraw the nomination, calling Becerra “unfit for any position of public trust.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has called him “famously partisan.” And the political group Heritage Action for America launched a cable and digital ad campaign against Becerra.Republicans say Becerra is a radical supporter of socialized medicine, abortion and curbs on religious liberty and that he has no medical experience.Democrats are shrugging it off.Republicans are “just flailing around,” Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon said Monday. “They've done their best to try to find something that could stick in terms of their opposition, but there’s no ‘there’ there.”At a White House briefing, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Becerra is part of the team that Biden needs to execute his Covid-19 response plan.The pandemic is expected to dominate questioning at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing on Tuesday. Senators of both parties want to know about the administration's timetable for a return to near-normalcy, the progress of the vaccination campaign, the outlook for reopening schools, and the threat from more aggressive virus mutations.Becerra is expected to use as much of his time as possible to push Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan, which is on track to pass the House but faces major political and procedural challenges in the Senate.In many ways, Becerra was California’s early face of opposition to the Trump administration. He was appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown to replace Harris and took over as attorney general in early 2017 as Trump became president.Over four years, he filed 124 lawsuits, challenging the Trump administration on immigration, environmental and health care policies. His litigiousness and vocal resistance to Trump’s policies could allow Republicans to paint him as an overly partisan figure. California took pride in viewing itself as the resistance to Trump, and Becerra embodied that ethos.Democrats say he's not outside the mainstream of their party, which strongly supports women's access to abortion, and where single-payer government-run health care for all remains a popular policy position, even if Biden has made clear he doesn't support it.Lack of medical experience doesn't disqualify a nominee for HHS secretary, although it can be a plus. Recent secretaries have included one doctor but also a pharmaceutical executive, a White House budget director and three governors.Biden's pandemic response is being coordinated from the White House. While Becerra would be an important player, the administration's decision-making structure is already in place. Becerra is expected to play a central in broader health care policy issues, such as expanding insurance coverage and trying to curb prescription drug costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-working-to-block-biden-s-health-care-pick-democrats-unfazed-101614094215709.html
23-02-2021||World||US Capitol security chiefs give differing accounts of January 6 riot||The former US Capitol Police chief said the principal security officials for the House and Senate resisted calling in help from the National Guard before the Jan. 6 protests that turned into a mob assault on the building.Steven Sund, who resigned from his role as Capitol Police chief after the attack, plans to tell two Senate committees that the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who are also testifying in the same Senate hearing, didn’t adequately prepare for the planned rally by Donald Trump’s supporters. Sund also blames the other authorities for delaying a request for backup from the National Guard once the attack was underway.The joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Rules and Administration Committees on Tuesday is the first in a series of lawmaker inquiries into the origins of the Jan. 6 insurrection and the failure of the Capitol’s security forces to anticipate and then quell the riot, which left five people dead.Sund will testify along with former Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, offering conflicting and contentious recollections of how things went wrong.“We have a lot of questions,” Senator Gary Peters, the chairman of the Homeland Security panel, told reporters before the hearing. “What did they know and what did they expect? Why were they not really fully prepared to deal with what was a very large violent attack on the Capitol?”The assault on the Capitol was replayed in vivid detail at Trump’s Senate trial after he was impeached on a charge that he incited the mob. The Senate voted Feb. 13 to acquit the former president, but the bitter partisanship of the moment hasn’t dissipated, even as members of both parties are calling for a thorough examination of the riot.Two House hearings related to the riot also are scheduled this week, and retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré is conducting an independent security review commissioned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi also is proposing an independent commission, modeled on the panel that investigated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, to review the causes of the Capitol assault and the security failures surrounding it.Differing VersionsTuesday’s hearing isn’t the first time Sund has sought to shift blame to other officials.In a Feb. 1 letter to Pelosi other top House and Senate leaders, Sund also asserted that violence or threat assessments from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service and District of Columbia police were incomplete. And he said that Irving during the attack insisted on going through his chain of command, which technically includes Pelosi, to get approval to seek National Guard support, resulting in a nearly hour-long delay.Irving, the former House sergeant-at-arms, plans to offer a different version than Sund’s characterization of the events of Jan. 6. In his prepared testimony for Tuesday’s hearing, Irving says he doesn’t have any record of Sund’s call and request to call in help from the National Guard that afternoon.However, Irving does plan to day he agrees with Sund’s assessment that Capitol officials didn’t have all the information they needed to prepare.“The intelligence was not that there would be a coordinated assault on the Capitol, nor was that contemplated in any of the inter-agency discussions that I attended in the days before the attack,” Irving plans to tell the committees, according to his written remarks.Jan. 6 CommissionAny disagreement between the officials testifying Tuesday could feed into partisan narratives about who is to blame.Democrats and Republicans are haggling over the composition of the independent commission that Pelosi has proposed. Republicans have objected to a Democratic proposals for 11-seat panel that would give seven seats to Democratic appointees -- including three to be named by President Joe Biden -- and four to Republicans. GOP leaders want the panel evenly divided.Separately, some House Republicans have seized on Sund’s Feb. 1 letter to demand answers from Pelosi on her role in planning for Jan. 6 and the responses to the violence that day. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, has dismissed that as a “transparently partisan attempt“ to lay blame on the speaker while ignoring the role of Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who appointed Stenger.This week, there are two more House hearings related to the Jan. 6 riot -- including one involving testimony from the acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman and House Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett on Thursday. Both of them already have testified in a closed hearing before the House Appropriations Committee.Capitol Police officers are still reeling from the attack that left one officer dead and 140 Capitol and Metropolitan Police officers injured. A member of the Capitol force and a D.C. police officer committed suicide after the assault.D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee is a fourth witnesses invited to answer questions at the hearing Tuesday.David Schanzer, a terrorism and homeland security expert at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, said politically divisive hearings in Congress could get in the way of any independent attempt at fact-finding.“Sometimes public hearings that are held very close to an event without a lot of time and effort putting into the foundations of an investigation beforehand -- collecting documents, document review, interviewing lots of witnesses -- can tend to be more about political theater than getting to the ground truth,” he said.He said a bipartisan independent commission can have more credibility and “can take more time outside the cauldron of open, televised hearing to do the ground truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-security-chiefs-give-differing-accounts-of-january-6-riot-101614093565886.html

While governments around the world gradually lifted restrictions on the entry of foreigners, many of them announced their own set of requirements that inbound travellers must fulfil to board a plane.The IATA sees the digital travel pass, a mobile app developed by the association, as an essential tool for the reopening of international borders without having the risk of importing the infectious disease. Several airlines, including Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Air New Zealand, are conducting trials of IATA travel pass in an attempt to seamlessly manage the digital travel documentation of passengers."We are currently working with a number of airlines worldwide and learning from these pilots. And the plan is to go live in March," Vinoop Goel, IATA’s regional director of airports and external relations, told BBC. “So basically we expect to have a fully functional working system over the next few weeks.”Here’s all you need to know about the IATA travel pass:The travel pass is a standardised solution to validate and authenticate all country regulations regarding passenger travel requirements related to Covid-19.The global registry of health requirements will enable passengers to find accurate information on travel, testing and vaccine requirements for their journey.The trial app includes a global registry of testing centres and labs at the departure and/or arrival location which can conduct Covid-19 tests in accordance with the type of test required for the journey.Read | Vaccination passport: Air New Zealand to trial digital travel pass amid Covid-19The app will enable passengers to create a ‘digital passport’, verify their test/vaccination meets the regulations, and share test or vaccination certificates with authorities to facilitate travel.The travel pass communicates with governments, airlines, and test centres/vaccination providers to get verified information to those who need it.The IATA travel pass will be free for passengers to download and use on their iOS as well as Android platforms.According to IATA, the travel pass does store any data centrally and simply links entities that need verification with the test or vaccination data only when travellers authorise it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iata-expects-to-roll-out-covid-travel-pass-within-weeks-all-you-need-to-know-101614092512761.html

23-02-2021||World||In year of pandemic, Home Depot became supplier to millions||The housing market was among the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in the year of the lockdown and Home Depot became its supplier, racking up an unprecedented $132 billion in sales for 2020.Sales grew even stronger in the final quarter of the year, surging 25% to $32.26 billion. That is up from $25.78 billion in the same period last year and exceeded even the lofty projections for $30.66 billion on Wall Street, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.Home improvement stores became a beehive during the pandemic with millions working and attending school remotely. Many families concluded that bigger homes, or at least different homes, were the answer in 2020. The U.S. Commerce Department has estimated that 811,000 new homes were sold in 2020, up nearly 19% from the previous year.While Home Depot was not alone in meeting the resulting demand for hammers, paint or appliances, the sheer volume of goods sold this year were staggering.Attempting to put it into context, Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, calculated that in 2020 the equivalent of every single person in the United States spent $402 at Home Depot.“It is easy to look at Home Depot’s numbers and chalk up its success to the pandemic,” Saunders said Tuesday. “However, sustaining three quarters of growth above 20% is extremely difficult in terms of the pressure it puts on the whole operation from supply chains to stores.”Global sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer's health, climbed 24.5%, and by 25% if only U.S. stores are counted.Home Depot Inc. earned $2.86 billion, or $2.65 per diluted share, for the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with $2.48 billion, or $2.28 per diluted share, a year earlier.Earnings, adjusted for costs related to mergers and acquisitions, were $2.74 per share. That handily beat the $2.63 per share Wall Street was calling for.The Atlanta company on Tuesday said that it was not providing annual guidance for the year, citing the uncertainty of the pandemic. Given the huge numbers Home Depot put up in 2020, that dispirited investors, and shares fell more than 2% before the opening bell.However, in a show of confidence, the nation’s biggest home improvement chain boosted its quarterly dividend 10%, to $1.65 per share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-year-of-pandemic-home-depot-became-supplier-to-millions-101614088452718.html
23-02-2021||World||Britons rush to book holidays amid plans to end lockdown||Stir-crazy Britons rushed to book overseas vacations after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to slowly ease a national lockdown, boosting optimism that travel restrictions will be removed in time for the summer holiday season.TUI, the UK’s largest tour operator said bookings increased six-fold on Monday, the company’s busiest day in more than a month. Discount airline easyJet said demand for flights more than tripled, and package holiday company Thomas Cook said traffic on its website increased 75%. International travel has nearly ground to a halt globally, so the increases are a sign of hope for the beleaguered industry.“We have consistently seen that there is pent-up demand for travel, and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what U.K. consumers have been waiting for,” easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement. “The Prime Minister’s address has provided a much-needed boost in confidence for so many of our customers in the U.K.”While the plans, which Johnson announced Monday, were welcomed by travel companies, many business leaders were disappointed at the slow pace of re-opening as some restrictions are expected to remain in place until June 21. Others criticized the government for failing to guarantee current levels of support for businesses hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Office for National Statistics said Tuesday that the U.K.’s unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in December, up 0.1% from the previous month and 1.3% from a year earlier. The number of people on company payrolls has dropped by 726,000 since the pandemic began last February, with 58.5% of the decline coming among people under 25.But the figures don’t show the full impact of COVID-19 restrictions. Some 1.9 million workers remain on furlough, a government program that covers 80% of the wages for people who aren’t working but remain on their employer’s payroll.“The sheer longevity of the crisis is taking its toll on firms, and young people in particular who have borne the brunt of jobs losses,” said Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on improving conditions for low-income people. The government “will need to address this in next week’s budget by both extending emergency support to firms while restrictions are still with us, and announcing fresh stimulus to power Britain’s economic recovery.”Airlines and hospitality businesses have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with restrictions all but shutting down international travel and closing pubs and restaurants for much of the past year.The government is now considering the possibility of introducing some type of “COVID status certification” to give business owners and consumers confidence about the safety of reopening theaters, restaurants and other venues this year.So-called vaccine passports, which could include information on whether a person has been vaccinated and recent COVID-19 test results, raise difficult questions about privacy in Britain, which doesn’t have a tradition of national identification cards.“There are deep and complex issues that we need to explore, and ethical issues about what the role is for government in mandating for people to have such a thing,’’ Johnson said Tuesday after visiting a school. “We can’t be discriminatory against people who, for whatever reason, can’t have the vaccine … I think everybody should have a vaccine, but we need to thrash all this out.”Britain has had Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 120,000 deaths attributed to the disease.Faced with a new variant of the virus that scientists say is both more transmissible and more deadly than the original, the country has spent much of the winter under a tight lockdown, the third since March 2020.Schools, bars, restaurants, gyms, hair salons and nonessential shops are closed, people are expected to stay at home except for exercise and essential shopping, and foreign holidays are banned.But Johnson announced plans to ease those restrictions as the rapid rollout of vaccines helps drive down new infections and hospitalizations.On March 8, children in England go back to school and people will be allowed to meet one friend or relative for a chat or outdoor picnic. Three weeks later, people will be able to meet in small groups outdoors for sports or relaxation.Under the government plan, shops and hairdressers will reopen April 12. So will pubs and restaurants, though only for outdoor service. Venues such as theaters and cinemas, as well as indoor seating at bars and restaurants, are scheduled to open May 17. That is also the earliest date Britons may be allowed foreign holidays.The final stage of the plan, in which all legal limits on social contact are removed and nightclubs can reopen, is penciled in for June 21.The government says these dates may be postponed if infections and hospitalizations surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britons-rush-to-book-holidays-amid-plans-to-end-lockdown-101614091447926.html

23-02-2021||World||Nepal's Supreme Court orders reinstatement of Parliament||Nepal’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the reinstatement of Parliament after it was dissolved by the prime minister, in a ruling likely to thrust the Himalayan nation into a political crisis.The order came in response to several cases filed with the court charging that Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli's decision to dissolve the legislature was unconstitutional. The court said a meeting of the reinstated Parliament must be called within 13 days.The order will cause political trouble for Oli since he will not have a majority of votes in a reinstated Parliament.Since Parliament's dissolution in December, there have been regular street protests against Oli by tens of thousands of people in Kathmandu and other cities.Oli decided to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections because of an escalating feud within his governing Nepal Communist Party.He became prime minister after the party won elections three years ago. Oli’s party and the party of former Maoist rebels had merged to form a strong Communist party to win the elections.However, there has been a power struggle between Oli and the leader of the former Maoists rebels, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also co-chair of the party. The two had previously agreed that they would split the five-year prime minister’s term between them, but Oli has refused to allow Dahal to take over.A splinter group led by Dahal is organizing the street protests and his supporters are among those who filed cases with the Supreme Court.Other opposition parties have repeatedly accused Oli’s government of corruption, and his administration has faced criticism over its handling of the coronavirus.Oli also has been accused of moving closer to China and drifting away from Nepal’s traditional partner, India, since taking power. This has caused problems between India and Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-top-court-orders-reinstatement-of-parliament-court-official-101614088465946.html

A German interior ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-tried-to-intimidate-hong-kong-activists-in-germany-berlin-says-101614086054488.html

The agreement allowed the IAEA to carry out short-notice inspections.The state-run daily newspaper Iran criticised hardline lawmakers who protested on Monday at Tehran’s decision to permit “necessary” monitoring by U.N. inspectors for up to three months, saying this broke a law passed by parliament in an apparent effort to pressure the United States to lift sanctions.The law requires ending snap inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog from Tuesday if sanctions are not lifted."Those who say Iran must take swift tough action on the nuclear accord should say what guarantee there is that Iran will not be left alone as in the past... and will this end anywhere other than helping build a consensus against Iran?" the daily Iran said.To create room for diplomacy, the U.N. watchdog IAEA on Sunday reached a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of Tehran’s reduced cooperation and refusal to permit short-notice inspections.On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran might enrich uranium up to 60% purity if the country needed it, while repeating a denial of any Iranian intent to seek nuclear weapons.Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, which it has been breaching since the United States withdrew in 2018, caps the fissile purity to which Tehran can refine uranium at 3.67%, well under the 20% achieved before the agreement and far below the 90% suitable for a nuclear weapon.A U.S. State Department spokesman said Khamenei's comments "sounds like a threat" but reiterated U.S. willingness to engage in talks with Iran about returning to the 2015 nuclear deal.Washington said last week it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.Tehran said last week it was studying a European Union proposal for an informal meeting between current members of the deal and the United States, but has yet to respond to it.Iran, which has resumed enriching to 20% in an apparent bid to heap pressure on the United States, has been at loggerheads with Washington over which side should take the initial step to revive the accord.Iranian leaders insist Washington must end its punitive campaign first to restore the deal, while Washington says Tehran must first return to full compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-stops-snap-nuclear-inspections-state-run-daily-urges-caution-101614062163658.html
23-02-2021||World||French researchers trial more accurate fast Covid-19 test||French researchers are using tiny antibody particles extracted from the family of animals that includes camels and llamas to produce a test they say can detect if patients have Covid-19 faster and more accurately than existing methods.The prototype test, called CorDial-1, has not been approved for use, but initial trials on 300 samples showed a 90% accuracy rate compared to a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, the most reliable commonly-used method of detecting Covid-19.The prototype test can deliver results within 10 minutes, and can be used outside the laboratory, according to the team developing it, while PCR testing typically takes hours and needs lab conditions.There are other quick and portable Covid-19 tests available, but scientists have raised doubts about their reliability.The CorDial-1 test uses antibody fragments called nanobodies. They are derived from camelids -- a group that includes camels, dromedaries, llamas and alpacas -- because they are more stable than antibodies from other creatures.For the Covid-19 test, the nanobodies are grafted onto the surface of an electrode. When those nanobodies come into contact with the "spike" protein of the Covid-19 virus, they interact to produce a change in the electrical current across the electrode.When the testing apparatus -- a device the size of a large USB stick -- is plugged into a smartphone, the current shows up as a signal on a graph."Depending on the height of the signal, you can say if you are Covidpositive or negative," said Sabine Szunerits, of the University of Lille, who is working on the project with scientists at the University of Marseille and the French National Centre for Scientific Research.The next phase of the project is to run a three-month trial on more than 1,000 people.Christophe Demaille, lead researcher in molecular electrochemistry at the University of Paris, who is not involved in the project, said tests that rely on electrical signals are highly portable."I am confident it will be usable anywhere," he said of the CorDial-1 project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-researchers-trial-more-accurate-fast-covid-19-test-101614074909125.html
23-02-2021||World||England’s medical officer thinks Covid-19 to remain a problem for ‘next few winters’. Here’s why||England chief medical officer Chris Whitty on Monday said that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is likely to remain a problem for the "next few winters" despite aggressive vaccination drive. The United Kingdom has administered more than 18 million doses with over 27 doses per 100 people, one of the highest in the world, and is expecting the end of all Covid-19 restrictions in England on June 21.However, the chief medical officer warned that the virus can still cause a significant number of fatalities as other respiratory diseases, for which vaccines are available, continue to cause deaths. He said that Covid-19 is going to be added to the list of diseases that puts vulnerable individuals at risk despite vaccination.“This is something that we have to see for the long term and, in my view, is likely to be a problem in particular during the winter for the next few winters,” he said. “We vaccinate against flu, we vaccinate against pneumococcal pneumonia and still there are cases and there are deaths.”Read | UK PM Boris Johnson optimistic of June 21 lockdown endMeanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johson has said that he is optimistic about the June 21 date earmarked to lift the Covid-19 restrictions amid concern over virus variants. "I'm hopeful, but obviously nothing can be guaranteed...I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to get there," Johnson told broadcasters.Over 212 million vaccine doses to provide immunity against Covid-19 have been administered, so far, in at least 107 countries and territories, according to Our World in Data. The United States, which has reported more than 28 million Covid-19 cases and over 500,000 related deaths, is the front runner of the vaccination drive in terms of absolute numbers. The worst-hit nation has administered more than 64 million vaccine doses, with nearly 20 doses per 100 people. Israel has the highest vaccination ratio in the world, with over 82 Covid-19 vaccine doses administered per 100 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-medical-officer-says-covid-19-to-remain-problem-for-next-few-winters-101614084144726.html

Tasnim reported that Khamenei answered a question posed by the news agency asking if observing compulsory hijab is necessary for characters in animated features.“Although wearing hijab in such a hypothetical situation is not required per se, observing hijab in animation is required due to the consequences of not wearing a hijab,” Khamenei said according to the report.A fatwa is a declaration or ruling on a point of Islamic law, which is not legally binding but is given by a recognised higher authority.Read more: Saudi women can join armed forces in latest widening of rightsPolitical activists in Iran condemned the fatwa, calling it 'toxic'. Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad wrote on Twitter: “This isn't a joke! The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran has announced women even in animations should wear hijab. Even female insects like bees have their hijabs on! Their obsession with the hair of female anything is toxic. These people are in power in Iran.”Academic Arash Azizi also criticised the decision. “In case you thought the Grand Ayatollah Khamenei wasn't focused on core issues of interest for Iran and Iranians,” Azizi tweeted.This kind of fatwa is not new in Iran as women in the country have faced persecution for not wearing a hijab before as well. Under Islamic law in force in Iran since the 1979 revolution, women must wear a hijab that covers the head and neck, thus concealing their hair. Violators are publicly admonished, fined or even arrested, often targeted by Iran's 'morality police’, also known as the "Gasht-e Ershad."Read more: Trans-people welcome the decision for separate toilets, but need gender-neutral toiletsUltra-conservative figures have also called for the end of foreign films being shown in theatres in Iran about which Khamenei himself has said that programs broadcast from the West led to 'misleading thoughts and factual misrepresentations'.Iran also has strict censorship laws in place on the country's film industry. Physical interactions between men and women on screen are banned and all scenes deemed immoral or offensive to the regime are often censored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/female-tv-cartoon-characters-must-wear-hijab-iran-s-khamenei-decrees-101614083700859.html

Shortly after the attack on Dec. 6, 2019, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz condemned it a "heinous crime" and said it "does not represent the Saudi people."Three US sailors were killed in the attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later found cellphone evidence linking the gunman, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, to the militant group al Qaeda, the US attorney general said.Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force trainee who was shot dead by a deputy sheriff, was on the base as part of a US Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies."None of the Royal Saudi Air Force trainees at the scene of the attack reported Al-Shamrani's behavior nor did they try to stop the NAS Terrorist Attack. Because they supported it", the lawsuit alleged.US President Joe Biden's administration has signalled a tougher stance on Saudi Arabia after mostly warm relations between former President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Biden, who took office last month, has declared a halt to US support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen and demanded an end to the war in Yemen, which is widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.The Biden White House has also been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to improve its record on human rights, including the release of political prisoners from jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-sued-by-families-of-victims-of-2019-florida-base-attack-101614083534760.html

Though the rate of its spread has slowed down in recent months - due to vaccines etc - one thing that has stood as a wall to keep everyone safe from the infection is face mask.Health experts across the world, including from the World Health Organzation (WHO), are advising people to continue wearing masks; many states in India are penalising people for not wearing masks.But in United States, the country worst-affected by Covid-19, a restaurant has sparked outrage on social media for its contoversial policy.“FACE DIAPERS NOT REQUIRED! EVERYONE WELCOME,” declares the sign at BeckyJack’s Food Shack in Florida. The image was posted by the restaurant on its Facebook page on Valentine's Day with the following post: "Howdy Folks! Happy Valentine's Day. A friendly reminder that we DO NOT require Face Masks."Since then, the post has been shared 1,000 times and elicited 3,800 comments on the social media platform.Some of the people who commented on the post early, said they love the restaurant and its food. "Love your restaurant and food!!! Thank you! We will be by soon," said Kristine Rowles Pepe.In fact, a few appreciated the post. "So glad you’re giving people the choice to wear or not wear a mask. Just like they have a choice to go or not go to your restaurant. I think we are all capable of making our own decisions when it comes to our health. Unfortunately there are those that think we need those decisions made for us!!" commented Ronda Shrigley Alley."This is fabulous! We will definitely be dining here!! Thank you for having common sense," said another user Troy Christine Woest.But others were aghast, calling the post a "cheap publicity stunt"."Enjoy your infamy while you can. Cheap publicity stunts are awesome. Team sports obviously not a thing your way. If you're locals feel sitting side by side without distancing and limited seating is cool, again, enjoy," said Adam Mullikin."Sad that egregious personal choice Trumps science based social responsibility," John Dvoracek said in his comment. Others also said that "people like these are the reason we’re still in a pandemic".After the uproar on social media, the restaurant defended its poster and in a follow-up post, asked those who are hurt by the post to "unfriend them"."My email address is right here on our page. Y'all know me. Okay some do, the rest of Y'all have no clue where Weeki Wachee is. Yes we do not require facemasks and yes we think of them as diapers. We strive to be transparent. And to our friends.. unfriend us now because being our friend will hurt you," the post on February 16 said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-restaurant-calls-masks-face-diapers-uproar-on-social-media-101614080009785.html

She didn't say whether the company was considering renaming the vehicles and didn't immediately reply to an email requesting that information.Hoskin says the best way to honor the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe is to learn more about its history.“The best way to honor us is to learn about our sovereign government, our role in this country, our history, culture and language and have meaningful dialogue with federally recognized tribes on cultural appropriateness," Hoskin said.The controversy comes amid a national reckoning over the use of Native American names and images, particularly in sports.After years of resistance and under pressure from corporate sponsors, the NFL's Washington, D.C., franchise announced last year that it was dropping its “Redskins” nickname and Indian head logo and would go by the name Washington Football Team until a permanent replacement was chosen. Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians also announced last year that it would change its name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-jeep-to-end-use-of-tribe-s-name-cherokee-chief-101614079678522.html
23-02-2021||World||Biden-Trudeau talks on Tuesday seek to ease strained relations||President Joe Biden will seek to repair relations with Canada that have been strained by disputes over trade and an oil pipeline as he meets virtually with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday.The two leaders plan to unveil a road map on how to improve cooperation on a range of topics, from global alliances to the coronavirus, according to a senior US official, who requested anonymity to preview the meeting.As part of that effort, Biden and Trudeau will announce a forthcoming ministerial meeting on climate and the resumption of the Cross-Border Crime Forum, an annual gathering of top law enforcement officials from each country to examine ways to collaborate on counterterrorism and efforts to combat smuggling, and organized crime.There are also plans for additional announcements related to Canada coming this week from the US State Department and Department of Transportation according to the official, who didn’t discuss the substance of those plans.The meeting, set for late afternoon, comes at a time when Canadians have become increasingly uncertain about where they stand with their closest ally. After four years of bruising trade battles with Donald Trump, the Biden administration already has canceled a permit for TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL oil pipeline and threatened new “Buy American” provisions for government procurement contracts.But the White House is hoping to improve the tenor of relations with a coronavirus-era variation of the longstanding tradition of the US. president making his first foreign trip to Canada.Traditional Talks, Virtual VersionWhite House officials have said it would likely be months until Biden could hold in-person meetings with foreign leaders, but the two leaders will try to approximate the beats of a traditional gathering.Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with their Canadian counterparts in a virtual session designed to get as close as possible to a traditional Oval Office meeting between world leaders.After about 45 minutes of conversation, an expanded group -- which will include Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and White House economic and coronavirus advisers -- will meet for broader discussions. After the private meetings, the leaders are expected to deliver joint remarks to reporters.“I look forward to renewing the strong friendship between the United States and Canada and working to tackle the shared challenges we face,” Biden tweeted over the weekend.Jobs, Climate ChangeTrudeau tweeted that the conversation would “focus on ending the pandemic, growing the middle class and creating jobs, and fighting climate change.”Relations between the US and Canada are expected to improve under the Biden administration, with the new American president more closely aligned with Trudeau’s Liberals across a series of policy initiatives. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday she expected Biden to “highlight the strong and deep partnership between the United States and Canada as neighbors, friends, and NATO allies.”Still, some areas of discussion could prove thornier. Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline -- linking oil-rich Alberta to Nebraska -- on his first day in office, saying the project isn’t “consistent with my administration’s economic and climate imperatives.”Trudeau has called the project -- which would have shipped more than 800,000 barrels of crude a day from Alberta’s oil sands to US refineries -- a key priority, and voiced his concern over the cancellation in a telephone call with Biden last month. The Canadian Parliament last week agreed to establish a committee to study he economic relationship between the two countries. And Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for retaliatory economic sanctions on the US over Biden’s move, though that effort has gained little traction.Officials in both Ottawa and Washington said they don’t expect the pipeline to play a major role in Tuesday’s talks -- a tacit acknowledgment that neither side appears likely to relent -- though they do expect the topic to be raised.‘Buy American’Trudeau may also press Biden on another early executive action: his “Buy American” order that strengthened requirements for federal spending, clamping down on contractors’ use of foreign suppliers. That could spell trouble for Canadian suppliers who sell to American companies that contract with the federal government.Trudeau is expected to seek waivers similar to those granted during the Obama administration to help protect Canadian businesses. But Psaki said Monday that although the administration is reviewing its procurement procedures under the executive order, it doesn’t anticipate making changes.Canada is also likely to again seek US assistance in pressuring China to release former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, who were detained in 2018 after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese executive with Huawei Technologies Co. The US has sought the extradition of Meng -- who is the daughter of the company’s founder -- to try her on fraud charges. Her extradition case remains pending in Canadian courts.Because Biden made a priority of the bilateral talks with Canada as the first such event since he took office, the discussions can be seen as the new president extending a peace offering, according to Sarah Goldfeder, a former US diplomat.“This is the Biden administration acknowledging they need to do better on the relationship with Canada,” said Goldfeder, a principal at government relations firm Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa and a former special assistant to US ambassadors to Canada.“It’s scaffolding to build on later,” Goldfeder said, adding she doesn’t expect there to be a lot of “deliverables or work done.”For Biden, she said, “This is a way of being nice and re-instituting that relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidentrudeau-talks-on-tuesday-seek-to-ease-strained-relations-101614077733311.html
23-02-2021||World||Paris raps Pakistan over Alvi's remarks on French Muslims||The French foreign ministry has summoned Pakistan's envoy to protest claims by President Arif Alvi that a French bill cracking down on radical Islam stigmatises Muslims.Addressing a conference on religion on Saturday, Alvi said: "When you see that laws are being changed in favour of a majority to isolate a minority, that is a dangerous precedent."Specifically referring to the legislation drafted after the beheading of a French teacher by an Islamist radical over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, Alvi said: "When you insult the Prophet, you insult all Muslims."I urge the political leadership of France not to entrench these attitudes into laws... You have to bring people together -- not to stamp a religion in a certain manner and create disharmony among the people or create bias."Pakistan was one of several Muslim countries that saw angry anti-French protests in October over President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the right to show cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.The country with the second-largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia does not have an ambassador in France.The French foreign ministry said late Monday it had called in Pakistan's charge d'affaires to mark "our surprise and our disapproval (over Alvi's remarks), given that the bill contains no discriminatory element."Read | French Assembly passes bill aiming to curb 'a rise in Islamism'- 'Constructive attitude' -"It is guided by the basic principles of freedom of religion and conscience, makes no distinction between the different religions and applies therefore equally to all faiths," the ministry said."Pakistan must understand this and adopt a constructive attitude for our bilateral relations," it added.The bill adopted by the lower house of the French parliament last week is dubbed the "anti-separatism" bill in reference to Macron's claim that Islamists are closing themselves off from French society by refusing to embrace secularism, gender equality and other French values.The legislation significantly expands the state's powers to close religious organisations and places of worship if they are found to air "theories or ideas" that "provoke hate or violence towards a person or people."It also creates a new crime of "separatism" -- described as threatening a public servant in order to gain "a total or partial exemption or different application of the rules" -- that is punishable by up to five years in prison.Pakistan's government has been particularly virulent in its condemnation of Macron's clampdown on radical Islam, which follow a wave of attacks that have killed over 250 people.Prime Minister Imran Khan in October accused Macron on Sunday of "attacking Islam" and chosing to "encourage Islamophobia" for defending the right to publish cartoons of Mohammed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-raps-pakistan-over-alvi-remarks-on-french-muslims-101614077721023.html

Thales, known as Thompson-CSF in 1999, has consistently said it has no knowledge of any transgressions having been committed by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contracts.The pre-trial hearing, which was broadcast on local television, began on Tuesday after it was postponed in December.Zuma was not present for the hearing.The case is ready to go to trial, the Pietermaritzburg High Court said, and asked all accused to be present on May 17 provided COVID-19 restrictions allow representatives of the French company to fly to the country.The trial will last from May until June, the court said.In another case, a South African inquiry into corruption during Zuma's time as president is seeking his imprisonment for two years, after he defied an order from the country's top court to appear and give evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corruption-trial-against-south-african-ex-president-jacob-zuma-to-start-in-may-101614076183997.html

It oversees the immigration processes and helps migrants as well as asylum seekers to settle in the country.INZ’s deputy head Catriona Robinson said they have to adapt to New Zealand’s Covid-19 economic recovery as well as focus on the changing work environments.“INZ has made the difficult decision to close our offices in Mumbai, Manila and Pretoria by March 2021 and bring more visa processing onshore. This is not a decision that we have made lightly. Our staff in these offices have made a significant contribution to INZ and New Zealand. However, these offices have been closed since March 2020 and with no certainty about when visa volumes may return to normal, INZ has had to make some tough decisions,” Robinson said.She said that it will gradually withdraw visa processing from its Beijing office and ‘strengthen its risk and verification presence.’ “The Beijing office reopened in September 2020 and is currently processing visa applications for individuals who are already in New Zealand. The timing of the withdrawal of visa processing from Beijing will depend on a number of factors including visa volumes and changes to New Zealand’s border restrictions. INZ will continue to monitor this over the next six months,” Robinson said in the statement.The statement pointed out that more than 300 employees will be affected by the closing down of the offices. New Zealand has been very restrictive about allowing people from entering the country due to the pandemic. A report on New Zealand-based news website, stuff.co.nz. said that INZ’s offshore offices have been closed since March 2020 after the Ardern-led government declared a Covid-19 lockdown.New Zealand reported three fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern had lifted the temporary lockdown in Auckland last week, which was imposed after a family of three - two adults and a child - were diagnosed with the more transmissible UK variant of coronavirus. Health authorities had conducted more than 70,000 tests to ensure that there was no community transmission before lifting the lockdown. The island nation also rolled out its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-shut-its-immigration-offices-in-mumbai-pretoria-and-manila-101614076882475.html
23-02-2021||World||Iran imposes curbs on UN nuclear inspections: State TV||Iran officially has begun restricting international inspections of its nuclear facilities, state TV reported Tuesday, a bid to pressure European countries and US President Joe Biden's administration to lift crippling economic sanctions and restore the 2015 nuclear deal.The state TV report gave little detail beyond confirming that Iran had made good on its threat to reduce cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.“The law has gone into effect from this morning,” said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, reiterating that Iran would no longer share surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities with the UN agency.“We never gave them live video, but (recordings) were given daily and weekly,” Zarif said of the IAEA's access to information recorded by camera monitors. “The tape recording of our (nuclear) program will be kept in Iran.”The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Tehran’s civilian nuclear agency, has promised to preserve the tapes for three months, then hand it over to the IAEA — but only if granted sanctions relief. Otherwise, Iran has vowed to erase the tapes.Iran announced its plans to cease implementation of the so-called “Additional Protocol,” a confidential agreement between Tehran and the IAEA reached as part of the landmark nuclear accord. The agreement grants the UN inspectors enhanced powers to visit nuclear facilities and watch Iran’s program.Nearly three years ago, former US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear accord and reimposed sanctions on Iran that have squeezed its economy.To create leverage over Washington, Iran has announced gradual breaches of the 2015 agreement over recent weeks. The country has started enriching uranium up to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels, as well as spinning advanced centrifuges and producing uranium metal.In a show of defiance, Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei outlined further developments in Iran's nuclear program on Tuesday. Over the last three weeks, he told reporters, Iran has installed an additional 148 high-tech IR2-m centrifuges at its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility and its fortified nuclear complex at Fordo, bringing the total number of centrifuges to up to 492. Another set of 492 centrifuges will be installed in the coming month, he said.He added that Iran has installed two cascades of even more advanced centrifuges at its nuclear enrichment facilities, but did not specify where.On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also signaled Iran would refuse to capitulate to US pressure over its nuclear program. Khamenei said that Iran could enrich uranium up to 60% purity if necessary, but stressed the country forbids nuclear weapons. Tehran has long insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, such as power generation and medical research.The Biden administration has said it’s ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the deal. Zarif responded to the overture cautiously on Tuesday, saying that Iran is “assessing the idea of an unofficial meeting" with the parties to the accord “in which America is invited as a non-member.”Tuesday's escalation followed IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi's emergency weekend trip to Tehran to negotiate the inspection restrictions. As part of a temporary deal, Grossi said the agency would maintain the same number of inspectors on the ground.But Iran's curbs would affect inspectors' ability to conduct so-called “snap” inspections of nuclear sites, Grossi said. Iran blocking access to IAEA cameras also means the agency can’t monitor Iranian actions when those inspectors aren’t physically at a site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-imposes-curbs-on-un-nuclear-inspections-state-tv-101614076160059.html

How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? How did the agencies share that information with each other? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online, in plain sight?The rioters easily smashed through security barriers on the outside of the Capitol, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke through multiple windows and doors, sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers and interrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.Former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving will speak publicly for the first time since their resignations at the hearing, which is part of a joint investigation by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee. They will be joined by former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, who sent additional officers to the scene after the rioting began.The hearing is expected to be the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over one week after the Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Thousands of National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission to review the missteps, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement have arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riots would be a top priority.Congress needs to know, quickly, how failed security preparations and delays in the response led to “a mad, angry mob invading this temple of our democracy,” Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said in an interview with The Associated Press.Klobuchar, D-Minn., said senators will be especially focused on the timing of the deployment of the National Guard, which eventually arrived to help the overwhelmed police, how security agencies shared information ahead of the attack and if the command structure of the Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, contributed to the failures. She said there may be legislation to address any inadequacies.“We are on a fast track here simply because decisions have to be made about the Capitol,” Klobuchar said.Klobuchar said Tuesday’s hearing will be the first of at least two public examinations of what went wrong that day as the Senate panels undertake a joint investigation into the security failures. A second hearing, expected to be held in the next few weeks, will examine the response of the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.While there is broad agreement that security measures were inadequate that day, officials have pointed the blame at each other for the causes and disputed each others’ accounts. The day after the riot, Sund said that his force “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.” It soon became clear that while the Capitol Police had prepared for protests, they were vastly unprepared for a violent insurrection — and many were beaten as they tried in vain to keep rioters from entering the building.Interim Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, who has temporarily replaced Sund, last month apologized for failing to prepare despite warnings that white supremacists and far-right groups would target Congress. But she also said that Sund had asked the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, to declare a state of emergency beforehand and allow him to request National Guard support, but the board declined. The Defense Department has said it asked the Capitol Police if it needed the Guard, but the request was denied.A third member of the Capitol Police Board denied Pittman’s claim hours after her testimony was released. J. Brett Blanton, who serves as the architect of the Capitol, said that Sund did not ask him for help and that there was “no record of a request for an emergency declaration.”Lawmakers hope to resolve some of those discrepancies by questioning the witnesses together on Tuesday. Klobuchar said she is pleased that they are all appearing voluntarily and hopes that the hearing will have a “constructive” tone.“It was a horror what happened, we all know that,” she said. “But if we are going to have solutions and a safer Capitol going forward, we have to identify what went wrong, what the issues were, and the answers we’ll get are part of that solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-to-question-us-capitol-security-officials-on-jan-6-siege-101614075330974.html
23-02-2021||World||Biden admin rolls back Trump-era stringent citizenship test in another policy reversal||The Biden administration on Monday announced another reversal of Trump-era policy by reverting to an earlier 2008 civics test module to make the path to US citizenship more accessible. The previous administration had introduced some changes to the naturalisation civics test, called the 2020 civics test, which increased the pool of questions from 100 to 128 and the correct answers in the multiple-choice questions had political and ideological overtones.Announcing the reversal, US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) said the agency has determined that the revised civics test, applicable for individuals who had applied on or after December 1, 2020, “may inadvertently create potential barriers” to the naturalisation process. It asserted that the action taken by USCIS is consistent with the framework of the executive order on “Restoring Trust in our Legal Immigration System”, which was signed by US President Joe Biden on February 2.“USCIS aspires to make the process as accessible as possible as directed by President Biden’s request to review the process thoroughly,” the immigration agency said in a statement.Read | What type of petitions USCIS still accepting after reaching H-1B visa cap?All individuals who apply for American citizenship through the process of naturalisation are required to take the civics test in which applicants have to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, principles, and form of government of the United States. Candidates who applied for naturalisation on or after December 1, 2020, and before March 1, 2021, will have the option to either take the 2020 civics test or the 2008 civics test. Those filing from March 1 will take the 2008 civics test.The latest announcement is a part of Biden’s policy for “New Americans” as the Democratic leader, in the executive order, called on his administration to improve the naturalisation process. He had directed the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan within 60 days to eliminate barriers in the existing naturalisation process by conducting a comprehensive review “with particular emphasis on...background and security checks, interviews, civics and English language tests, and the oath of allegiance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-rolls-back-trump-era-citizenship-test-in-another-policy-reversal-101614075054873.html

Anyone responding to peaceful protests with violence must be held to account," G7 foreign ministers said in a statement."We condemn the intimidation and oppression of those opposing the coup. We raise our concern at the crackdown on freedom of expression, including through the internet blackout and draconian changes to the law that repress free speech."The G7 called for an end to the "systematic targeting" of protesters, doctors, civil society and journalists and for the military junta to revoke its declared state of emergency.Also read: Western countries step up pressure on Myanmar junta as protesters defy warningsIt also urged Myanmar's military to allow full humanitarian access to support the most vulnerable."We remain united in condemning the coup in Myanmar. We call again for the immediate and unconditional release of those detained arbitrarily, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint and continue to stand with the people of Myanmar in their quest for democracy and freedom," the statement said.Myanmar's military leaders are facing renewed pressure at home and abroad after gradually ratcheting up their use of force against a massive and largely peaceful civil disobedience campaign against their coup.As the US, EU and UK tighten sanctions, demonstrations against the junta's rule have continued to grow -- alongside a violent response in return.Also read: EU prepares measures against Myanmar coup leadersThree anti-coup protesters have been killed in the demonstrations so far, while a man patrolling his Yangon neighbourhood against night arrests was also shot dead at the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-firmly-condemn-myanmar-military-attacks-on-protesters-101614069002546.html

The surge in pricing affects people who choose to pay wholesale prices for their power, which is usually cheaper than paying fixed rates during good weather. But owing to the storm, there has been a spike in the prices which is a result of the high demand for electricity.Here’s everything you need to know about the soaring electricity bills:What is the pricing system in Texas?Texas has a wholesale electricity pricing system which results in the prices fluctuating based on the demand. When natural gas pipelines and wind turbines froze up in Texas because of the snowstorm, there was less power available but the high demand of electricity resulted in the wholesale prices shooting up. People are able to pay wholesale prices in Texas because it’s one of the only states that lets people pick which company it buys power from.Read more: US President Biden approves Texas disaster declaration after deadly freezeAre the wholesale prices usually high?No, the wholesale prices are typically as low as a couple of cents per kilowatt-hour but spiked to $9 per kilowatt-hour after the storm. Fixed-rate customers pay a set amount that doesn’t rise as much which is around 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.What is Griddy?Griddy is one of the power supplier in Texas which was launched in 2017. The company charges $10 a month to give people a way to pay wholesale prices for electricity instead of a fixed rate. The company has 29,000 members and has a major role to play in the price surge in Texas.Read more: Texas freeze led to release of tons of air pollutants as refineries shutWhat will happen next?Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), Texas' utility regulator, said on Saturday that it is investigating "the factors that combined with the devastating winter weather to disrupt the flow of power to millions of Texas homes."Texas governor Greg Abbott also said in a statement that the high energy costs are unacceptable. "It is unacceptable for Texans who suffered through days in the freezing cold without electricity or heat to now be hit with skyrocketing energy costs," Abbott said. Although, no step has been taken to control the prices as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-snowstorm-the-next-challenge-facing-texans-high-energy-bills-101614071265695.html
23-02-2021||World||Yamani, the Saudi oil minister who brought the West to its knees||Saudi Arabia's Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the embodiment of the ascent of Arab petroleum power and the face of the 1973 oil embargo that brought the West to its knees, has died.Yamani was a witness to the 1975 murder of the Saudi king who had plucked him, a non-royal, from obscurity to be oil minister. Later the same year Yamani was kidnapped at an OPEC meeting by Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal.Yamani, 91, died in London, Saudi state media reported on Tuesday.Known for his elegant manner and trademark goatee beard, Yamani's 24-year tenure running the oil affairs of the world's biggest crude producer made him a global celebrity during the inflationary "oil shocks" of the 1970s.That ended with his abrupt sacking in 1986 after a costly attempt to prop up crude prices, a failed strategy which has cast a shadow over Saudi oil policy to this day.In December 1975, Yamani attended the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna, which ended in a hail of bullets fired into the ceiling from Venezuelan assassin Carlos and five cohorts. Three bystanders were killed.Carlos, promoting the Palestinian cause, targeted Yamani as the most valuable hostage, telling him repeatedly that he had been sentenced to death. Ministers were held for two days in a dynamite-charged room before the captors were granted a plane out of Austria with their hostages.A further 43 harrowing hours on board, flying from Algeria to Libya and back, created an intimacy between captive and hostage taker."It was odd, but as we sat together and talked, it was almost as if we had become friends," Yamani told biographer Jeffrey Robinson. "He was telling me so much, knowing that I would die."A deal was struck in Algiers and Carlos vanished, escaping arrest until 1994.Months earlier, Yamani was at the side of Saudi King Faisal in Riyadh, receiving a visiting delegation when a disaffected Saudi prince pulled out a revolver and shot the king dead.COMMONER AMONG ROYALSYamani's career was remarkable, for the time, as a commoner in a society dominated by the royal family.Born on June 30, 1930, the son of an Islamic scholar and judge in Mecca, Yamani was expected to follow his father and grandfather into teaching.After studying law in Cairo he left for New York University and Harvard. Returning to Saudi Arabia, he set up a law firm and took on government work, drawing the attention of the future King Faisal. He became oil minister in 1962.Yamani became a leading figure in the development of OPEC, founded in 1960. He extricated the Saudi oil industry from the grip of American companies in a series of steps that produced a deal on national ownership of Saudi Aramco in 1976.Aramco remains among the world's wealthiest companies by assets.In Yamani's early years as oil minister, Arab nationalism was on the rise and oil power was at the heart of it.By the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, Riyadh was ready to flex its economic muscle. Yamani announced a supply embargo against countries friendly to Israel. But the embargo did not bite. High inventories in the West and extra supply from Venezuela and pre-revolutionary Iran filled the gap.In 1973 the fourth Arab-Israeli conflict prompted Yamani to trigger another oil embargo. This time it worked - a fourfold increase in the price of crude marked the high point of OPEC power and sent western economies into recession as inflation soared in what became known as the first oil shock.OIL MASTERSYamani summed up that moment when oil producers took charge. "The moment has come," he said. "We are masters of our own commodity."With the end of the war and the embargo, Riyadh found an accommodation with the United States.Yamani was now a price moderate, espousing the view that high prices would ultimately destroy demand and encourage production from new exploration in places such as the North Sea.When the 1979 Iranian revolution triggered a second oil shock in the West, most in OPEC raised oil prices. Riyadh, close now to Washington, issued the "Yamani Edict", holding Saudi prices at official levels to ease the pain for importers.Yamani's new-found price moderation was to cost him. A supply glut born of the early 1980s recession in the West depressed fuel demand.Faisal's successor, King Fahd, called on Yamani to both protect Saudi market share and boost prices. Instead, he cut Saudi production to a 20-year low of only 2 million barrels per day in an effort to shore up prices.Fellow OPEC members were not as disciplined on production and Yamani was criticised at home as others increased their market share at Riyadh's expense. As the oil glut ballooned, crude prices crashed below $10 a barrel.Having disobeyed Fahd and failed, Yamani paid the price. In October 1986 he learned of his dismissal from a public announcement on Saudi television, apparently designed to embarrass him.Yamani retreated to his private life and became the figurehead for a consultancy, the Centre for Global Energy Studies. At its launch in London in 1989, with crude still worth only $20 a barrel, he predicted prices would eventually break $100, as they did eventually in the new millennium.Reuters interviewed Yamani in September 2000 to mark OPEC's 40th anniversary. Shale oil was little known at the time and renewables were in their infancy, but Yamani predicted that technology would hurt oil producers.“Technology is a real enemy for OPEC,” he said. “Technology will reduce consumption and increase production from areas outside OPEC. The real victims will be Saudi Arabia, with huge reserves which they can do nothing with.   "The Stone Age did not end because the world ran out of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yamani-the-saudi-oil-minister-who-brought-the-west-to-its-knees-101614068794768.html
23-02-2021||World||Rishi Sunak plans more Covid aid for UK as unemployment climbs||The UK’s finance minister Rishi Sunak is set to spend billions of pounds in extra support for the economy over the next four months, as pandemic curbs pushed unemployment to its highest level in almost five years.The chancellor of the exchequer will set out the details in his March 3 budget after Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a timeline for reopening the UK economy that keeps some businesses closed until at least June 21.“At the budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery,” Sunak said in an e-mailed statement. “I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone.”Johnson’s four-step road map for lifting the lockdown will influence how fast Treasury subsidies are withdrawn, according to people familiar with the matter. Key aid programs are currently due to end as early as next month but Sunak will extend assistance so that companies and individuals do not face a cliff-edge, they said.Sunak faces a daunting task to put the economy on a path to recovery after suffering its deepest slump in three centuries last year. Unemployment climbed to its highest rate in almost five years in the fourth quarter, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday.The budget deficit is already setting peacetime records after the chancellor committed to spending 300 billion pounds ($422 billion) to help the health service and businesses cope with the crisis, a sum that’s set to increase next week.On Monday, Johnson detailed his four-step plan gradually to lift restrictions that have damaged the economy and kept most children away from school since the start of the year. While schools will reopen in two weeks, people will be asked to work from home where possible until at least June 21.A snap poll of 3,900 adults in England by YouGov found the largest proportion -- 46% -- think the government has got the balance right on lifting the lockdown, whereas 26% think ministers are moving too fast and 16% too slowly.Sunak’s package of financial support will broadly track the exit strategy, while taking into account the fact that business will not immediately return to normal levels even when shops and pubs are allowed to reopen, according to the people, who spoke anonymously about unannounced plans.“People may be concerned about what these changes mean for the various support packages for livelihoods, for people and for the economy,” Johnson told members of Parliament Monday. “We will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic, the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK”That suggests assistance will last beyond the tentative date of June 21 set by Johnson to reopen the last sectors of the economy.The premier’s road map means businesses such as nightclubs will be shut until at least June 21, while theaters, concert halls and sporting venues will have limits on the crowds until then, rendering many of them unprofitable.Pubs and restaurants won’t be able to re-open until at least April 12, and then for outdoor service only. By the time indoor service is allowed in mid-May, many businesses will have been closed for nearly 200 days “with just a couple of weeks of heavily restricted trading in December,” said UKHospitality Chief Executive Officer Kate Nicholl.Clinging On“A major package of financial support is imperative,” Nicholl said. “This delay in reopening will make the job of survival all the more difficult for businesses only just clinging onto existence.”Government support policies currently due to expire by the end of April include Sunak’s benchmark program that pays furloughed workers up to 80% of their wages, a business rates holiday, and reduced sales tax for hospitality and tourism. The chancellor faces calls to extend all of them, both from business groups and politicians, including from two predecessors in his own Conservative party.“The chancellor must deliver on the prime minister’s ‘whatever it takes’ pledge,” said Federation of Small Businesses National Chairman Mike Cherry. “On one side of the coin we have continued restrictions – on the other, we need corresponding business support.”Members of Johnson’s own Conservative Party also called for the economy to be reopened more quickly, especially when the 32 million people most vulnerable to Covid-19 are due to have been vaccinated by mid-April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-plans-more-covid-aid-for-uk-as-unemployment-climbs-101614071103617.html

I have no doubt that so many other countries are looking at what is happening here in Australia."Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia, and that's why they have sought to get a code here that is workable."CAMPBELL BROWN, FACEBOOK VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL NEWS PARTNERSHIP"We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers."The government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation."It’s always been our intention to support journalism in Australia and around the world, and we’ll continue to invest in news globally and resist efforts by media conglomerates to advance regulatory frameworks that do not take account of the true value exchange between publishers and platforms like Facebook."TAMA LEAVER, PROFESSOR OF INTERNET STUDIES AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY, AUSTRALIA"It's not a draw."Even though Facebook managed to cover some concessions and the law is perhaps softer, I still think they were the big losers here simply because of the way that they tried to negotiate over the last week.

23-02-2021||World||Genocide vote pressures Canada PM Trudeau to take harder line on China||Canada’s legislature passed a motion designating China’s actions against its Uighur Muslim minority as genocide, increasing pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to toughen his approach to Beijing.Lawmakers approved a declaration Monday afternoon recognizing “that a genocide is currently being carried out by the People’s Republic of China.” Though non-binding, the decision represents a clear signal from lawmakers they want Trudeau to maintain pressure on China over human rights.The move will further strain relations between the two countries, already at their lowest point since diplomatic ties were established in 1970. Tensions have grown since the 2018 arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. executive in Vancouver on a US extradition request. Chinese authorities subsequently jailed two Canadians on national security charges.“Trudeau has been equivocating and passive in his approach to China, including on his position on the Uighur genocide, and I don’t think that approach is working,” Michael Chong, a member of the opposition Conservatives who sponsored the motion, said in a telephone interview.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday in Beijing that Canada’s motion “disregards facts and common sense.”“It is flagrant interference in China’s domestic affairs. We condemn and reject that,” Wang told a briefing. “We have lodged stern representations with the Canadian side.”‘Strong Message’The China file has become a major political vulnerability for Trudeau, who had sought to deepen ties with the Asian country early in his tenure only to see relations deteriorate dramatically. He’s facing pressure from all sides: opposition lawmakers wanting tougher action, and former Liberal ministers who want his government to free Huawei’s chief financial officer in exchange for the release of the two Canadians.Indicative of this balancing act, Trudeau and his cabinet abstained from the vote Monday even as most lawmakers in his Liberal caucus voted in favor. The motion -- which passed by a vote of 266 for and zero against -- also called on the government to push for the 2022 Olympics to be relocated from China.“We remain deeply disturbed by horrific reports of human rights violations in Xinjiang, including the use of arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture and forced sterilization,” Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement after the vote.“The Government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously. We have the responsibility to work with others in the international community in ensuring that any such allegations are investigated by an independent international body of legal experts,” he added.The tactic sent “a strong message that it’s a genocide” and brought Canada more in line with allies like the U.S. “without the prime minister personally shooting an arrow at the dragon,” Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Alberta’s China institute, said by phone.Business groups are worried the tensions threaten to undermine a trading relationship that has continued to deepen despite the rancor. The Conservative opposition is calling on the government to impose a ban on the import of products from the Xinjiang region, Chong said.“I’m certain there will be a lot of speculation about what might come next, but I’m not sure it will be very useful to the issues at hand,” said Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Notwithstanding the many reactions coming after today, the fact remains Canada will need to continue working with allies on how to engage with China.”China has been facing mounting international pressure over allegations of human rights violations of its Muslim minority, which the Chinese government denies. While Beijing says it’s fighting separatism and religious extremism among Uighurs, a United Nations assessment found that anywhere from tens of thousands to “upwards of 1 million” Uighurs have been detained in internment camps.Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed concern in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about what he said were China’s “coercive and unfair economic practices” as well as human rights abuses.“There has never has been so-called genocide, forced labor or religious oppression in Xinjiang,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the UN Human Rights Council by video on Monday. “Such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/genocide-vote-pressures-canada-pm-trudeau-to-take-harder-line-on-china-101614069961943.html
23-02-2021||World||Malaysian court halts deportation of 1,200 Myanmar migrants||Malaysian court Tuesday ordered a halt to the planned deportation of 1,200 Myanmar migrants to hear an appeal by two human rights groups, which say refugees, asylum seekers and minors were among those being sent back.The court order, following a legal bid by Amnesty International Malaysia and Asylum Access Malaysia, came just after the migrants were transported to a naval base where three Myanmar military ships were waiting to take them home.“In light of the court ruling, the government must respect the court order and ensure that not one of the 1,200 individuals is deported today," said Amnesty International Malaysia’s director, Katrina Jorene Maliamauv.Amnesty said the court will hear their appeal Wednesday and urged the government to reconsider its plans to send the migrants back home, where human rights violations are high following a Feb. 1 military coup that deposed the country's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.“It’s important to note that the stay of execution granted by the court does not mean the 1,200 are safe from being deported. They are facing life-threatening risks," Maliamauv said in a statement.Amnesty urged the government to give the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees access to the 1,200 migrants and all immigration detention centers in general, which Malaysia's government has denied since August 2019.Malaysian immigration officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. The department earlier said there were no UNHCR cardholders or ethnic Muslim Rohingya refugees in the group, who were held for offenses including not having valid travel documents, overstaying their visas and violating social visit passes.But the two rights groups in their legal filing named three people registered with the UNHCR and 17 minors who have at least one parent still in Malaysia. The UNHCR has separately said there were at least six people registered with it among the group due to be deported.Amnesty and Asylum Access have said the repatriation is tantamount to legitimizing ongoing human rights violations by Myanmar’s military and would put the migrants at risk of further persecution, violence and even death.A group of 27 Malaysian lawmakers and senators also sent a letter to Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Sunday urging him to halt the deportation. There was no response from the premier's office.Malaysia doesn’t recognize asylum seekers or refugees, but has allowed a large population to stay on humanitarian grounds. It is home to some 180,000 U.N. refugees and asylum seekers — including more than 100,000 Rohingya and other Myanmar ethnic groups.More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar since August 2017, when the military cracked down in response to attacks by a rebel group. The security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-court-halts-deportation-of-1-200-myanmar-migrants-101614062690650.html
23-02-2021||World||US looking forward to 'overarching' MoU to enhance health cooperation with India||The US has said it is looking forward to an "overarching" memorandum of understanding to enhance health partnership with India and asserted that the cooperation between the two countries on Covid-19 builds on decades of successful collaboration in health and biomedical research.The US on Monday crossed the grim milestone of 500,000 Covid-19 deaths. With 28,184,218 coronavirus cases and 500,172 deaths due to the disease so far, as recorded by Johns Hopkins University, America is the worst-affected nation."We look forward to an overarching MoU to enhance health cooperation between our two countries (US and India). We are working together on developing diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines to combat the disease (Covid-19) and to recognise the importance of manufacturing critical drugs during this time and making them accessible globally," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Monday.The total number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 1,10,05,850 -- the second in the world after the US. The death toll is 1,56,385 -- fourth globally.“India's pharmaceutical sector is strong and well-established and has long played a central role in manufacturing life saving vaccines for global use. We are pleased that the US pharmaceutical industry has been coordinating with Indian companies since the beginning of this pandemic,” Price said, responding to a question on India donating and supplying domestically manufactured Covid-19 vaccines to several countries across the globe.Known as the 'pharmacy of the world', India produces 60 per cent of vaccines globally. India has sent consignments of domestically manufactured coronavirus vaccines to several countries, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Seychelles, Myanmar, Mauritius, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.“When it comes to the broad issue of coordination between the United States and India on Covid-19, I would say that cooperation between our two countries builds on decades of successful partnership in health and biomedical research,” Price said.The US is partnering with India to strengthen the global response to Covid-19 -- ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks, strengthening health systems to securing global supply chains, he said.India and the US recently welcomed an initiative to collaborate on infectious disease, including Covid-19 and other emerging threats, through the International Centre of Excellence and Research, Price said.In a recent op-ed in Newsweek magazine, India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, wrote that in recent years, India has emerged as the "pharmacy of the world", with great capabilities in bulk production of generic drugs and vaccines, in addition to its experience immunising a large population.India recently stepped up to provide vaccines to neighbouring countries and other partners, including in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, he said.The US has resources and scientific capabilities that make it a natural, complementary partner in supporting a number of other countries seeking to fight the pandemic, Sandhu wrote.“Furthermore, from the provision of active pharmaceutical ingredients to generic medicines that have lowered drug prices and created jobs and investments, India has demonstrated its reliability as a supply chain partner, especially as de-risking from single country supplies has become a priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-looking-forward-to-overarching-mou-to-enhance-health-cooperation-with-india-101614041528748.html
23-02-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan to arrive in Sri Lanka on Tuesday||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will hold wide-ranging talks with Sri Lankan leaders on various issues such as trade, defence and technology during his one-day visit to the island nation.Khan, who is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on Tuesday evening, will hold deliberations with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa. He will meet President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Wednesday, the foreign ministry has confirmed.The bilateral talks are expected to focus on various sectors including trade, investment, health, education, agriculture, technology, defence and tourism.This is the first visit by a Pakistan prime minister to Sri Lanka since Nawaz Sharif visited the country in 2016.Khan’s last visit to Sri Lanka was in 1986 when he was the captain of Pakistan cricket team during the acrimonious Test series where he accused the local umpires of bias.Khan’s visit coincides the current controversy over the forced cremations of the island’s minority Muslim community members who die due to the COVID-19. The government continues its policy of forced cremations despite objections from rights groups.Khan congratulated Sri Lanka earlier this month when Prime Minister Mahinda made a comment in parliament that burials would be allowed for Muslim victims of Covid-19. However, the decision is yet to be implemented.International rights group Amnesty International in an open letter to Khan had urged him to take up the issue of forced cremations with Sri Lankan leaders during his visit.“We urge you to raise this issue of forced cremations at the highest levels possible during your visit to Sri Lanka, in solidarity with a minority community who has been stripped of any means of recourse. We urge you to call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to stop forced cremations and to bring to an end discrimination faced by the Muslim community in Sri Lanka,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-to-arrive-in-sri-lanka-on-tuesday-101614062208643.html

That was 15% lower than the previous year, but the report's authors noted with alarm a sharp uptick and historically high civilian casualties in the final three months of 2020, when peace talks began.Last year "could have been the year of peace in Afghanistan. Instead, thousands of Afghan civilians perished," said Deborah Lyons, head of UNAMA, reiterating calls for a ceasefire which has been repeatedly rejected by the Taliban. "Parties refusing to consider a ceasefire must recognise the devastating consequences."The Taliban on Tuesday issued a response critical of the report, saying "the concerns, precise information and accurate details that were shared by us have not been taken into account."The report said that for the first time since records began, deaths and injuries had escalated in the final three months of the year from the previous three months. Casualties for the fourth quarter were up 45% compared with the same period in 2019.The majority of were ascribed to non-government actors, predominately the insurgent Taliban, and more than one-fifth were attributed to government forces.A government spokesman did not immediately respond to request for comment.Both sides said on Twitter their chief negotiators met in Doha, the venue for talks, on Monday evening, adding that teams would continue work on an agenda.After a monthlong break over the new year period, negotiators returned to Doha briefly before many senior members of the Taliban left to hold meetings in Russia and Iran. Mujahid said they would hold further meetings soon.Zabihullah said that the lull was only a break and the Taliban were committed to talks, with further meetings expected in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-against-civilians-surges-in-afghanistan-after-peace-talks-un-report-101614063221717.html

Government critics and Western governments accuse Beijing of going back on its word and effectively ending the “one country, two systems" framework for governing the dynamic Asian financial hub.Lam said political strife and unrest in the city, including anti-government protests in 2019 as well as protests in 2014, showed there were always some people who are “rather hostile” to the central authorities in China.“I can understand that the central authorities are very concerned, they do not want the situation to deteriorate further in such a way that ‘one country, two systems’ cannot be implemented,” Lam said at a regular news briefing.A day earlier, Xia Baolong, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said Hong Kong could only be ruled by “patriots," which exclude those who lobby other countries for foreign sanctions or “troublemakers."The electoral changes are expected to be discussed and possibly passed at next month’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp legislature, and its advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.They will likely take the form of a redistribution of votes in the 1,200-member electoral commission that selects Hong Kong’s chief executive, subject to Beijing’s veto. The commission is composed of voting blocs intended to represent Hong Kong's various economic, educational and social sectors, along with its largely Beijing-dominated political institutions.The one exception are the 117 commission members drawn from among the city's 458 local district counselors, most of whom are directly elected by their constituents and tend to be more politically independent. Opposition figures swept district council elections following the 2019 protests and the Beijing authorities have since sought to prevent them from exerting influence on other aspects of the political system.With all other commission members deemed to be firmly under Beijing's control, speculation has risen that the 117 district council votes will be transferred to another bloc, possibly that of Hong Kong’s representatives to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, ensuring that they will follow Beijing’s directives.It remains unclear whether Lam, who is deeply unpopular among Hong Kong's population, will seek a second five-year term in next year’s poll.Another possibility is that China will close what it calls “loopholes” in the election for members of the Legislative Council, now entirely dominated by pro-Beijing legislators since opposition deputies resigned en masse last year after four were expelled for being insufficiently loyal to the government. Lam postponed elections for the council last year, citing concerns over Covid-19, in a move largely seen as designed to prevent an opposition victory.Of the 70 members of the council, half are directly elected from geographic constituencies while the rest are drawn from trade and other special interest groups. Changes could include preventing district counselors from also sitting in the body or simply raising the requirements for loyalty and patriotism above the already stringent levels they are set at now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carrie-lam-backs-hong-kong-electoral-changes-excluding-rather-hostile-opponents-101614066465539.html
23-02-2021||World||What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?||Indian American Neera Tanden, who was nominated by US President Joe Biden to head the White House Office of Management of Budget (OMB), faces a challenge as her nomination is due to be confirmed by the Senate. Senator Susan Collins and Mitt Romney said on Monday that they will oppose Tanden to lead the White House Budget Office, dealing a decisive blow to her hopes of confirmation.The first blow to Tanden’s bid came on Friday when Senator Joe Manchin announced that he would oppose her, citing her controversial tweets. Without support from Manchin in an evenly divided Senate, Tanden needs backing from at least one Republican in order to be confirmed.Who is Neera Tanden?Tanden is a former Hillary Clinton aide and has worked with Clinton during her first presidential campaign in 2008 as well as in 2016. The 50-year-old was nominated by Biden in November to take over as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a post which is responsible for managing the administration’s expenditure.Tanden is an American political consultant and the president of the Centre for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organisation. Apart from Clinton, Tanden has also worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns, including those of Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008. Notably, Tanden helped in drafting the Affordable Care Act under the Obama administration.Why is her nomination in jeopardy?Tanden is facing sharp opposition because of remarks that she made over the last four years, especially against Republicans. Tanden called Collins “the worst” and Senator Mitch McConnell, the top Republican, “Moscow Mitch” and “Voldemort”.Collins and Romney on Monday announced that they would not vote to confirm her nomination after Manchin, a Democrat also said last week that he would not support Tanden in her bid.In order to be approved, Tanden needs the support of all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided 100-member Senate, in the hope that vice president Kamala Harris will support her using the constitutionally mandated tie-breaker vote. After Manchin backing out, Tanden is down to 49 Democrats and desperately needs support from Republicans for her confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-controversy-around-neera-tanden-s-senate-confirmation-101614066712845.html
23-02-2021||World||Damage to United Boeing 777 engine consistent with metal fatigue: NTSB||Damage to a fan blade on an engine that failed on a United Airlines Boeing 777 flight is consistent with metal fatigue, based on a preliminary assessment, the chairman of the U.S. air accident investigator said on Monday.The Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engine failed on Saturday with a "loud bang" four minutes after takeoff from Denver, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters following an initial analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.He said it remained unclear whether the incident is consistent with an engine failure on a different Hawaii-bound United flight in February 2018 that was attributed to a fatigue fracture in a fan blade."What is important that we really truly understand the facts, circumstances and conditions around this particular event before we can compare it to any other event," Sumwalt said.The engine that failed on the 26-year-old Boeing Co 777 and shed parts over a Denver suburb was a PW4000 used on 128 planes, or less than 10% of the global fleet of more than 1,600 delivered 777 widebody jets.In another incident on Japan Airlines (JAL) 777 with a PW4000 engine in December 2020, Japan's Transport Safety Board reported it found two damaged fan blades, one with a metal fatigue crack. An investigation is ongoing.The focus is more on engine maker Pratt and analysts expect little financial impact on Boeing, but the PW4000 issues are a fresh headache for the planemaker as it recovers from the far more serious 737 MAX crisis. Boeing's flagship narrowbody jet was grounded for nearly two years after two deadly crashes.The United engine's fan blade will be examined on Tuesday after being flown to a Pratt laboratory where it will examined under supervision of NTSB investigators.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it had already been evaluating whether to adjust fan blade inspections in the wake of the December incident in Japan after reviewing maintenance records and conducting a metallurgical examination of the fan blade fragment.Boeing recommended that airlines suspend the use of the planes while the FAA identified an appropriate inspection protocol, and Japan imposed a temporary suspension on flights.Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies Corp., has recommended airlines increase inspections in a plan that is being reviewed by the FAA, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Pratt did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The FAA has said it plans to issue an emergency airworthiness directive soon that will require stepped-up inspections of the fan blades for fatigue."United Airlines has grounded all of the affected airplanes with these engines, and I understand the FAA is also working very quickly as well as Pratt & Whitney has reiterated or revised a service bulletin," Sumwalt said. "It looks like action is being taken."In March 2019, after the 2018 United engine failure attributed to fan blade fatigue, the FAA ordered inspections every 6,500 cycles. A cycle is one take-off and landing.Sumwalt said the United incident was not considered an uncontained engine failure because the containment ring contained the parts as they were flying out.There was minor damage to the aircraft body but no structural damage, he said.NTSB will look into why the engine cowling separated from the plane and also why there was a fire despite indications fuel to the engine had been turned off, Sumwalt added.Industry sources said that although the engine is made by Pratt, the cowling, or casing, is manufactured by Boeing. Boeing referred questions on the part to the NTSB.Nearly half of the global fleet of PW4000-equipped Boeing 777 jets operated by airlines including United, JAL, ANA Holdings, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines had already been grounded amid a plunge in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damage-to-united-boeing-777-engine-consistent-with-metal-fatigue-ntsb-101614063311693.html
23-02-2021||World||US arrests wife of Mexico cartel chief El Chapo on drug charges||The wife of Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was arrested and charged in the United States on Monday with helping her husband continue to run his drug trafficking cartel while he was behind bars.Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, a regular attendee at her husband's high-profile US trial two years ago where he was convicted of trafficking tons of drugs into the United States, was arrested at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.Her arrest is the highest profile US capture of a Mexican on drug charges since former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos was detained in October, and experts said it indicated a deterioration in bilateral security relations.Coronel was charged by the US Department of Justice with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamines for unlawful importation into the United States. She is expected to appear in a federal court in Washington on Tuesday.An affidavit attached to the charges also details Coronel's alleged involvement in her husband's escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 and a second attempted prison break in 2016 before the 63-year-old was extradited to the United States.A lawyer for Coronel could not immediately be identified, and lawyers in Mexico linked to the Guzman family did not respond to a request for comment.A Mexican official familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified, said Coronel's arrest appeared to be solely a US initiative and that Coronel was not wanted in Mexico."[It's] a sign of what's likely ahead," former Mexican ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan said, describing it as an example of US agencies acting with little coordination with Mexican counterparts.Joint efforts to fight drug trafficking were strained by Cienfuegos' arrest, with Mexico's government moving to restrict US agents' activities in Mexico in retaliation for what it called a breach of trust.The Justice Department unexpectedly dropped the Cienfuegos case the following month and let him return to Mexico, a move Mexico welcomed as restoring trust between the two countries. Two months later, Mexico dropped its own case against Cienfuegos.The investigation into Coronel was handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), rather than the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The charges relate to alleged trafficking activity between 2014-2107 prior to the high-profile Brooklyn trial where Guzman was convicted on drug trafficking offenses.The indictment documents said Coronel relayed messages on behalf of Guzman to facilitate drug trafficking after his arrest in 2014.Prosecutors said Coronel also conspired to aid her husband in his July 2015 escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico through a mile-long tunnel from his cell. An unnamed cooperating witness was paid $1 million to help facilitate a failed second escape a year later, according to the affidavit.POTENTIAL PRESSURE STRATEGYCoronel, who married Guzman as an 18-year-old beauty queen in 2017, is a dual US-Mexico citizen who lives in Mexico. It was unclear why she was in the Washington area at the time of her arrest.Prosecutors at Guzman's trial two years ago said he amassed power through murders and wars with rival cartels. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, which the sentencing judge said reflected Guzman's "overwhelmingly evil" actions. Guzman was sent to ADX Florence in Colorado, the nation's most secure "Supermax" prison.Tomas Guevara, an investigator in security issues at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said Coronel's arrest might be part of a "pressure strategy" to prompt cooperation from Guzman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-arrests-wife-of-mexico-cartel-chief-el-chapo-on-drug-charges-101614056007651.html
23-02-2021||World||'Like a soap opera': The glamorous life of El Chapo's detained wife||The arrest on drug trafficking charges of Emma Coronel Aispuro, a former beauty queen and wife of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, follows a telenovela-style life that straddled hyper-violent Mexican cartels, fame and motherhood.Coronel, 31, married young into infamy and had a front-row seat to Guzman's high-stakes cat-and-mouse game with Mexican and U.S. agents hunting him down.A US-Mexican dual national, Coronel was arrested on Monday at Dulles International Airport and is due to appear in a U.S. District of Columbia court on Tuesday charged with distributing cocaine, heroin and other drugs.Coronel caught the attention of Guzman, who is more than three decades her senior, when she was a teenaged beauty queen.They married after she turned 18 in 2007 and had twin daughters, spending their entire married life with Guzman either in jail or on the run as the leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel. Guzman is serving a life sentence in a U.S. jail.Coronel's fame soared during Guzman's 2019 trial in New York, where she became a media sensation with her designer outfits and the loyalty she showed her husband - even as prosecutors detailed how he kept a string of lovers.She even became a key character in the court drama when a former lieutenant of Guzman's alleged Coronel played a pivotal role in her husband's Hollywood-style escape from prison in a mile-long tunnel burrowed under his jail cell's shower in 2015.Piggybacking on her husband's fame and seeking to cash-in on her celebrity outside Mexico, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States in 2019 and even appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families."I consider myself a normal woman," Coronel said in VH1's Cartel Crew show, speaking aboard a yacht."It's sad that they judge us without knowing us. It's hard."In media interviews, Coronel emphasised her enduring loyalty to Guzman and her focus on bringing up their twin daughters."Emma is like the old narco families in Sinaloa," a former acquaintance told Reuters.'LOVE STORY'Steeped in the narco tradition from an early age, Coronel was raised in the mountains of Durango, part of Mexico's "Golden Triangle" of drug trafficking states that includes Sinaloa. Her father was jailed for trafficking drugs in 2017.Coronel first hit the headlines in Mexico after her 2007 church wedding in rural Durango to Guzman, who at the time was on the run from authorities.Coronel would be by Guzman's side during several near-misses as Mexican police and U.S. agents tracked him.At Guzman's trial, his former right-hand man, Damaso Lopez Nuñez, testified how Coronel, along with Guzman's sons, helped orchestrate the audacious 2015 prison escape.They got a plot of land near the prison, arranged weapons, brought an armoured truck and even had a GPS wristwatch smuggled into Guzman's cell so the tunnel engineers would have exact jail cell coordinates to help their digging, according to testimony.Guzman was captured again in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017.At Guzman's trial, whenever he entered the court, he would seek Coronel out and wave. They could not speak to each other but their glances caught the attention of the media."It was like a love story in complete silence as she wasn't allowed to say anything," said journalist Miguel Angel Vega of the Riodoce newspaper in Sinaloa who covered the trial."It's quite interesting to see what's happening in this new case," Vega said. "It's like a soap opera."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-a-soap-opera-the-glamorous-life-of-el-chapo-s-detained-wife-101614063301698.html

That's more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War One, World War Two and the Vietnam War combined," Biden said in emotional remarks at the White House."But as we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived. They’re people we knew."Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff marked a moment of silence around 6:15 p.m. (2315 GMT) outdoors at the White House after the president's remarks, bowing their heads somberly.Five hundred lit candles lined the White House steps to commemorate the dead and a military band played a soaring rendition of "Amazing Grace."Biden ordered that all flags on federal properties and military facilities be lowered to half-staff until Friday at sunset to commemorate the dead.The president called on Americans to remain vigilant in fighting the pandemic by continuing to wear masks, observe social distancing and receive vaccinations when it is their turn."We must end the politics and misinformation that has divided families, communities and the country, and has cost too many lives already. It's not Democrats and Republicans who are dying from the virus. It's our fellow Americans," Biden said."We have to fight this together as one people, as the United States of America."About 19% of total global coronavirus deaths have occurred in the United States, an outsized figure given that the nation accounts for just 4% of the world’s population.The country has the highest overall death figure, reflecting the lack of a unified, national response last year, when the administration of former President Donald Trump mostly left states to their own devices in tackling the greatest public health crisis in a century. Biden, a Democrat, took office on Jan. 20 after defeating Trump, a Republican, in the 2020 presidential election, in part by arguing he would do a better job of addressing the pandemic.Trump downplayed the pandemic in its early stages and repeatedly predicted rosier numbers about the expected death toll in the United States than came to fruition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-leads-americans-in-moment-of-silence-to-mourn-500-000-covid-19-deaths-101614062381700.html

At a speech earlier on Tuesday, Sims declined to answer questions about the standoff on the grounds that it was before parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-restore-australian-news-pages-after-tweaks-to-media-laws-101614058543241.html
23-02-2021||World||Canada’s parliament votes to label Chinese actions in Xinjiang as ‘genocide’||Canada’s parliament has passed a motion that labels Chinese actions against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province as “genocide”.The House of Commons voted 266-0 for the motion that was brought by the opposition Conservative Party. Not a single member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party cabinet voted for the motion. Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau was present in the House as the motion was voted upon, but he abstained. Many Liberal Party MPs backed it, though.Tensions between Canada and China are set to further escalate following the passage of an opposition amendment to a motion that calls on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from China to another country. That motion passed 229-29.Beijing is set to host the 2022 edition of the Winter Olympics from February 4-20.The Trudeau administration itself has not used the “genocide” label for the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang. Foreign minister Garneau’s office reacted to the motion on Xinjiang with a statement released by Global Affairs Canada that said, “The government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously. We have the responsibility to work with others in the international community in ensuring that any such allegations are investigated by an independent international body of legal experts.”It also called for a “credible international investigation in response to allegations of genocide” and that it “must be conducted by an international and independent body so that impartial experts can observe and report on the situation first-hand”.Even though the Trudeau government is taking a balanced stand on the Xinjiang issue, the motion is set to worsen relations between the two countries. In a sharp statement before the vote, the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa, Cong Peiwu, said Beijing expressed “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition over this”.Accusing those behind the motion of “spreading disinformation and even lies”, he said there was no genocide in Xinjiang and Chinese actions were “about combating violent terrorism and secession”.Calling upon the motions against China to be scrapped, he said, “We urge the Canadian side to take seriously China’s solemn position, respect the facts, discard prejudice, and correct mistakes, immediately cancel the relevant motions, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs by any means, so as not to cause further damages to China-Canada relations.”Relations between the two countries have suffered since Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver in 2018 in a US extradition request for allegedly circumventing sanctions imposed on Iran. In what Trudeau has described as “hostage diplomacy”, Beijing retaliated by arresting two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who remain jailed in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-parliament-votes-to-label-chinese-actions-in-xinjiang-as-genocide-101614057215265.html
23-02-2021||World||Petrobras shares slump as Brazil's Bolsonaro doubles down on intervention||Petrobras shares plunged 22% on Monday, wiping out 71 billion reais ($13 billion) in market value, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro again slammed its pricing policies after he replaced the state-controlled oil company's market-friendly CEO with a retired army general.The selloff, following a series of analyst downgrades, deepened after Bolsonaro said the company's fuel policy was only pleasing to financial markets and select groups in Brazil and should be changed as part of an effort to lower gasoline and diesel prices.Overall, the last few days have marked a dramatic about-face for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist whose interventionist instincts until now had been largely contained by economically conservative allies.Shares in state electricity company Eletrobras also plunged on Monday after Bolsonaro said it would be the next sector in which the government would "stick its finger."In comments to Brazil's Radio Bandeirantes on Monday, Joaquim Silva e Luna, the man tapped by Bolsonaro on Friday to take the reins from Roberto Castello Branco, floated the idea of a government fund, or "cushion", to lessen the effects of fluctuating fuel prices on consumers.Bolsonaro doubled down on his criticism of Castello Branco, mocking his decision to social distance since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the severity of which the president has repeatedly minimized."Now, the current Petrobras chief executive, let's be very clear, has been at home for 11 months without working, working remotely. Now, the boss has to be on the front line," Bolsonaro said, adding: "This is for me unacceptable."BONDS ALSO HITCredit Suisse, Santander, Scotiabank, Bank of America, Bradesco and XP analysts were among those who downgraded their recommendations on shares of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known."A good reputation is hard to earn and easy to lose," BTG bank analyst Thiago Duarte said in a note to clients.Dollar-denominated debt issued by Petrobras also suffered hefty losses with the 2043 bond dropping 7.6 cents to trade at a seven-month low of 98 cents on the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.Morgan Stanley removed its 'like' recommendation on Brazil sovereign bonds on Monday, citing fiscal concerns and potential spill over from the removal of Castello Branco.Petrobras' "all-important" pricing policy and its implications for cash generation and planned asset sales, particularly of its refineries, has clouded its debt reduction and dividend outlook, Santander analysts led by Christian Audi said in a note to clients. They downgraded their recommendation on the stock to "hold" from "buy."Director-General Rodolfo Saboia of Brazil's oil regulator ANP said that the CEO change would not affect the country's policy of opening up the refinery sector to private investment or pursuit of free markets. He declined to comment directly on Petrobras' refinery sales."The best way to attempt to reach a fair price is by opening the market ... and not depending on one actor to set the price a certain product should have," he told Reuters in an interview.In a Facebook post after the close of trading on Friday, Bolsonaro announced the nomination of Silva e Luna, a former defense minister who has been managing giant hydroelectric dam Itaipu, to replace Branco.The retired general, who lacks any oil and gas industry experience, said in the Radio Bandeirantes interview that he had not discussed and does not have an opinion on an eventual privatization of the company.On Saturday, Silva e Luna told Reuters that the company needed to find "balance" in fuel pricing, considering the impact on shareholders, investors, sellers and consumers.Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM on Monday announced the opening of an investigation on the change of leadership, confirming an earlier Reuters report on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/petrobras-shares-slump-as-brazil-s-bolsonaro-doubles-down-on-intervention-101614039259723.html
23-02-2021||World||Trump taxes, long guarded, will soon be in prosecutor’s hands||Donald Trump, who managed to keep his tax returns a secret the entire time he was in the White House, is about to see them fall into the hands of a New York prosecutor looking into possible criminal charges against him.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm for eight years of records in 2019, but the then-president took the case to the US Supreme Court, twice. On Monday, the justices abruptly rejected Trump’s final bid to block Vance, a Democrat.Trump’s refusal to release his taxes during the 2016 campaign, falsely claiming he couldn’t because he was under audit, marked a break with every presidential candidate of the last four decades. Once in office, he fought tooth and nail to keep them secret, challenging the oversight powers of the House tax committees that had previously been understood to have the power to examine any taxpayer’s return. Congress still doesn’t have Trump’s taxes.Many details of Trump’s taxes have emerged, notably in the New York Times last fall, but Vance will be receiving the returns as part of a criminal probe that looms as one of the biggest legal threats facing the former president and his company, the Trump Organization Inc. In August, Manhattan prosecutors suggested in court papers they may be looking into tax fraud, insurance fraud, and falsification of business records charges.New York Attorney General Letitia James is separately examining whether the Trump company inflated values of some of its properties, and Trump may also be part of a criminal probe in Atlanta over attempts to influence the 2020 Georgia vote count.‘They’d Find It’With Trump’s tax returns, Vance’s investigators will be able to compare statements made by the Trump Organization to the Internal Revenue Service with claims made to banks, insurers and other parties.“Now they have the evidence that the accounting firm and the corporation have,” said John Moscow, a former chief prosecutor for serious economic crimes at the Manhattan district attorney’s office. “At this point, Trump’s position has to be that he didn’t do anything wrong, because if he did, they’d find it.”Trump issued a statement on Monday calling Vance’s investigation “a continuation of the greatest political witch hunt in the history of our country,” connecting it to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election and two unsuccessful impeachment attempts. He suggested prosecutors in “far-left states and jurisdictions” were trying to “to take out a political opponent.”Vance has been beefing up his team in anticipation of receiving Trump’s tax records. Late last year, the district attorney hired FTI Consulting, a leading forensic accounting firm, to assist in the investigation. Earlier this month, Mark Pomerantz, a former federal prosecutor, came aboard as a special assistant district attorney, according to Vance’s spokesman, Danny Frost.Gotti ProsecutorAs head of the criminal division of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office from 1997 to 1999, Pomerantz oversaw complex fraud and organized crime prosecutions, including that of organized crime boss John Gotti Jr. Since then, he’s been a top corporate defense lawyer at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, from which he is taking a leave of absence to work with Vance.Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, isn’t contesting the subpoena. Mazars declined to comment on the Trump tax records Monday, but said it was “committed to fulfilling” its professional and legal obligations.Any material Vance receives from Mazars would be covered by laws protecting grand jury secrecy, meaning it isn’t likely to become public anytime soon.The public learned a good deal about Trump’s financial situation in September when the New York Times published an analysis of at least two decades of Trump’s tax records, reporting that he paid just $750 in federal income tax in 2016 and in 2017. The Times said Trump reported huge business losses, effectively wiping out all income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years as well.Lisa Griffin, a law professor at Duke University, said it was unclear there would be much more for the public to learn from Trump’s actual returns. “It’s entirely possible that we know the most significant facts about his indebtedness,” she said.Rejected ImmunityThe high court had deferred acting in the case for four months, waiting until Trump again became a private citizen to take a step that could boost a probe that initially focused on hush-money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and another woman who claimed to have sexual relationships with Trump years before he became president. Vance’s investigators have already gotten hold of some of the tax records from other sources, according to people familiar with the matter.Monday’s rejection effectively shut down the avenue the high court left open for Trump in July, when the justices rejected his claim of sweeping immunity for sitting presidents from state criminal subpoenas but said he could press more specific objections. Two lower courts rejected Trump’s contention that the subpoena was too broad and was issued in bad faith, prompting the now-former president to turn to the Supreme Court.Vance had agreed to hold off enforcing the subpoena while the Supreme Court considered Trump’s new arguments.Trump told the Supreme Court he will suffer “irreparable harm” if the materials are turned over. “Even if the disclosure of his papers is limited to prosecutors and grand jurors, the status quo can never be restored once confidentiality is destroyed,” his lawyers said in court papers.Vance said the year-plus delay has already hampered the investigation.‘A Lot to Do’Trump “has had multiple opportunities for review of his constitutional and state law claims, and at this juncture he provides no grounds for further delay,” Vance argued. “His request for extraordinary relief should be denied, and the grand jury permitted to do its work.”Following the Supreme Court order, Vance’s office said, “The work continues.”Given the complexity of Trump’s financial statements, the broad range of records that Vance’s office will now have to pore over and the political sensitivity surrounding an investigation of this magnitude, the process will take time, said Moscow.“There’s a lot to do,” he said. “It’s not going to be quick, it’s going to be thorough.”Congress could also soon get its hands on Trump’s taxes too. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen could theoretically turn over the returns at any time, but the new administration earlier this month told the judge overseeing the House suit demanding them that it needed more time to determine its position in light of the ongoing transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-taxes-long-guarded-will-soon-be-in-prosecutor-s-hands-101614041543862.html
23-02-2021||World||Chinese Official Signals Changes to Hong Kong Election Rules||China faces a “critical and urgent” task to overhaul Hong Kong’s electoral system, Beijing’s top official for the city said, in the latest sign that authorities were mulling major changes in the coming weeks.Beijing needed to reform the city’s electoral system “to ensure that Hong Kong’s governance is firmly controlled by patriots,” Xia Baolong, director of China’s cabinet-level Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said in a speech Monday.Speaking to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, Xia said that to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system, “relevant legal loopholes within the framework of the Constitution and the Basic Law” need to be closed -- and that it was up to the central government to communicate those changes to the local administration.The remarks follow a number of articles and comments in Chinese state media, and are the latest sign that China is contemplating further curbs to Hong Kong’s already-limited democracy, where a committee of 1,200 business and political elites selects the city’s leader and Beijing retains veto power.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference later Monday that Beijing needed to enact electoral reform to ensure everyone involved in governing the city was patriotic.Security LawBeijing intends to limit the influence of opposition groups on the committee that picks the chief executive, taking seats from pro-democracy politicians and assigning them to pro-China loyalists, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the proposal. The changes would pass during an annual session of China’s legislature in March, the report said.China has taken various steps to stamp out dissent in the former British colony since sometimes-violent protests erupted in 2019, most notably by imposing a sweeping national security law last year.Beijing also allowed the local government to disqualify lawmakers who were insufficiently patriotic. All opposition members of the Legislative Council resigned en masse after Lam’s administration used the new rule to kick out four lawmakers.In comments to Lam in late January, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Hong Kong should be governed by “patriots” in order to ensure the city’s stability following unprecedented unrest in 2019.Lam said Monday that reforms would not be designed to limit the influence of pro-democracy politicians but that no one in government should engage in unpatriotic activities, such as colluding with foreign powers to subvert China’s central government.“This need to change the electoral system and arrangements in Hong Kong is for one single purpose, that is to make sure that whoever is governing Hong Kong is patriotic,” she said. “It applies to various aspects of the political structure, including the executive, the legislative, the judiciary, the District Councils and the civil service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-official-signals-changes-to-hong-kong-election-rules-101614045288480.html
23-02-2021||World||Canadian MPs ask Trudeau to term China's treatment of Uighur's as 'genocide'||Canadian MPs passed a non-binding motion Monday calling China's treatment of its Uighur minority a "genocide" and calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to officially label it as such.The motion, introduced by opposition Conservatives, was passed unanimously in the House of Commons by 266 votes out of 338. The other MPs, including ministers from Trudeau's Liberal government, abstained.The motion recognizes that "Uighurs in China have been and are being subject to genocide."The MPs cited in particular reports of "political and anti-religious indoctrination," "forced labor" and "destruction of cultural sites" -- among other atrocities -- that the Muslim minority in Xinjiang has been forced to undergo.An amendment to the motion calling for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics to be moved if the "genocide" continues was also adopted.According to foreign experts, more than one million Uighurs are being held in political reeducation camps. Beijing has denied this and claims they are vocational training centers designed to guide Uighurs away from terrorism and separatism, following attacks attributed to the community."Now Conservatives are calling on the Liberal government to respect Parliament and officially recognize the genocide happening in China," said opposition leader Erin O'Toole, who for months has urged Ottawa to harden its stance towards Beijing."The Government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously," foreign affairs minister Marc Garneau said in a statement, noting that Canada favors a joint approach with its allies on this issue.Trudeau said Friday there had been significant human rights abuse reports coming out of Xinjiang.Following a G7 meeting, the prime minister said Canada was consulting with its international allies on the use of the term "genocide," already used by former US president Donald Trump's administration.Canada-China relations soured in late 2018 over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant, and China's detention of two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- in what Ottawa has called retaliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-mps-ask-trudeau-to-term-china-s-treatment-of-uighur-s-as-genocide-101614041578003.html
23-02-2021||World||'Goosebumps': NASA releases video of Perservance rover landing on Mars||NASA on Monday released the first high-quality video of a spacecraft landing on Mars, a three-minute trailer showing the enormous orange and white parachute hurtling open and the red dust kicking up as rocket engines lowered the rover to the surface.The quality was so good — and the images so breathtaking — that members of the rover team said they felt like they were riding along.“It gives me goosebumps every time I see it, just amazing,” said Dave Gruel, head of the entry and descent camera team.The Perseverance rover landed last Thursday near an ancient river delta in Jezero Crater to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. After spending the weekend binge-watching the descent and landing video, the team at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shared the video at a news conference.“These videos and these images are the stuff of our dreams," said Al Chen, who was in charge of the landing team.Six off-the-shelf cameras were devoted to entry, descent and landing, looking up and down from different perspectives. All but one camera worked. The lone microphone turned on for landing failed, but NASA got some snippets of sound after touchdown: the whirring of the rover’s systems and wind gusts.Flight controllers were thrilled with the thousands of images beamed back — and also with the remarkably good condition of the rover. It will spend the next two years exploring the dry river delta and drilling into rocks that may hold evidence of life 3 billion to 4 billion years ago. The core samples will be set aside for return to Earth in a decade.NASA added 25 cameras to the $3 billion mission — the most ever sent to Mars. The space agency's previous rover, 2012's Curiosity, managed only jerky, grainy stop-motion images, mostly of terrain. Curiosity is still working. So is NASA's InSight lander, although it's hampered by dusty solar panels.Deputy project manager Matt Wallace said he was inspired several years ago to film Perseverance's harrowing descent when his young gymnast daughter wore a camera while performing a backflip.Watching the video "I think you will feel like you are getting a glimpse into what it would be like to land successfully in Jezero Crater with Perseverance,” he said.Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s science mission chief, said the video and also the panoramic views following touchdown “are the closest you can get to landing on Mars without putting on a pressure suit.”The images will help NASA prepare for astronaut flights to Mars in the decades ahead, according to the engineers.There's a more immediate benefit.“I know it's been a tough year for everybody,” said imaging scientist Justin Maki, “and we're hoping that maybe these images will help brighten people's days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-mars-rover-chronicles-entry-descent-and-landing-on-red-planet-101614040787062.html
23-02-2021||World||Wife of drug kingpin 'El Chapo', Emma, arrested on US drug charges||The wife of Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was arrested Monday at an airport in Virginia on international drug trafficking charges, the Justice Department said, spelling out in detail how she helped plot her husband’s daring escape from a Mexico prison.Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, who is a dual citizen of the US and Mexico, was arrested at Dulles International Airport and is expected to appear in federal court in Washington on Tuesday.She is charged in a single-count criminal complaint with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the US The Justice Department also accuses her of helping her husband escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 and participating in the planning of a second prison escape before Guzman was extradited to the US in January 2017.Coronel Aispuro remained in custody, and it was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could comment on the allegations.As Mexico’s most powerful drug lord, Guzman escaped through an entry under the shower in his cell to a milelong (1.6-kilometer-long) lighted tunnel with a motorcycle on rails. The planning for the escape was extensive, prosecutors say, with his wife playing a key role.Court papers charge that Coronel Aispuro worked with Guzman’s sons and a witness, who is now cooperating with the US government, to organize the construction of the underground tunnel that Guzman used to escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico to prevent him from being extradited to the US The plot included purchasing a piece of land near the prison, firearms and an armored truck and smuggling him a GPS watch so they could “pinpoint his exact whereabouts so as to construct the tunnel with an entry point accessible to him,” the court papers say.Guzman was sentenced to life behind bars in 2019. His Sinaloa cartel was responsible for smuggling mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States during his 25-year reign, prosecutors said in recent court papers. They also said his “army of sicarios,” or “hit men,” was under orders to kidnap, torture and kill anyone who got in his way.Coronel Aispuro, a former teen beauty queen, regularly attended Guzman’s trial, even when testimony cast her in a harsh light. The two, separated in age by more than 30 years, have been together since at least 2007 and share twin daughters, who were born in 2011.Her father, Ines Coronel Barreras, was arrested in 2013 with one of his sons and several other men in a warehouse with hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border from Douglas, Arizona. Months earlier, the US Treasury had announced financial sanctions against Coronel Barreras for his alleged drug trafficking.After Guzman was rearrested following his escape, Coronel Aispuro lobbied the Mexican government to improve her husband’s prison conditions. And after he was convicted in 2019, she moved to launch a clothing line in his name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wife-of-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-emma-arrested-on-us-drug-charges-101614040284259.html
23-02-2021||World||Trump slams Supreme Court for not shielding his tax records||Former US President Donald Trump issued a statement in which he slammed the US Supreme Court for not blocking New York prosecutors from obtaining his tax records.Earlier on Monday, US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer declined to issue a stay for a lower court ruling in favour of former President Donald Trump disclosing his tax returns to a New York grand jury."The Supreme Court never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen, but they did," Trump said on Monday. "This is something which has never happened to a President before, it is all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location, New York City and State, completely controlled and dominated by a heavily reported enemy of mine, Governor Andrew Cuomo."Trump further said the New York Attorney General's investigation is a continuation of the greatest political hunt in US history, adding that the probe is similar to practices in Third World countries and represents a threat to the foundation of liberty in the United States. Trump also reiterated his stance that the 2020 US presidential election was rigged and stolen from him.Monday's decision significantly weakens Trump's ability to protect his tax returns from the grand jury subpoena, barring further - but unlikely - US Supreme Court interventions in the case.New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance is seeking Trump's tax returns dating back to 2011.Trump has contended that an August 2019 grand jury subpoena to his accounting form Mazars USA to provide his tax returns was overly broad and issued in bad faith.Last summer, the Supreme Court rejected Trump's earlier request to block the order, claiming that his position as US president did not shield him from complying with the subpoena.

Steamed rice in my bowl. Soft drink in my hand. Can’t fathom why sturdy soldiers die. I woke up in the middle of the night, startled to realize: They died for me.”The post was widely circulated online, the China Daily news report said.Pictures of the four soldiers and their funeral rituals were also widely circulated online. In one, Chen Xiangrong, one of the four deceased troops, is shown smiling at the camera with a half-peeled orange in his hands.Some other trending topics read: “10 details of the border clash scene”, “One soldier is one boundary marker”, “Not an inch of the motherland can be lost” and “The diaries and letters of the five border heroes”.Elsewhere, Chinese authorities have been quick to arrest at least three persons who had “slandered” online the PLA troops.Details of their comments were not shared.“The police stated that cyberspace is not a lawless void and the police will resolutely punish the behavior of slandering and insulting heroes without factual basis according to law,” an official Chinese military website reported.“In recent years, the persons involved in defaming heroes and martyrs have received severe punishment, fully showing that the Chinese rule of law has zero-tolerance for similar words and deeds,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiindia-propaganda-continues-online-in-china-101614018598464.html
