Later, he was expected to say at a security conference that “democratic progress is under assault” all over the world and democracies should work to “prove that our model isn’t a relic of our history”.Biden will announce the US contribution to Covax at a virtual meeting with leaders of the six other G7 countries - Canada, Germany, France, the UK, Japan and Italy.The first tranche of $2 billion from the US will go directly to the Gavi vaccine alliance, the White House said in a note. The remaining $2 billion will be released over 2021 and 2022. The first lot of $500 million will be paid after initial donor pledges are fulfilled and the first doses of coronavirus vaccines have been delivered.Covax is a collaboration involving the World Health Organization, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“In too many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault,” Biden was to say, according to excerpts released by the White House of his upcoming speech at the Munich Security Conference scheduled for later in the day.He will further say, “We must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people. That is our galvanising mission. Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to defend it. Strengthen it. Renew it. We have to prove that our model isn’t a relic of our history. It’s the single best way to realize the promise of our future.”Also on Friday, the US returned to the Paris Agreement on the climate crisis in a reversal of a major Trump era decision. “Now, as momentous as our joining the (Paris) Agreement was in 2016 - and as momentous as our rejoining is today - what we do in the coming weeks, months, and years is even more important,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-4bn-for-covax-programme-returns-to-paris-pact-on-climate-crisis-101613757179874.html

19-02-2021||World||Harry and Meghan permanently quit UK royal life||Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan have permanently quit royal duties, Buckingham Palace said Friday, just over a year after they rocked the British monarchy by announcing plans to "step back" from their roles.Queen Elizabeth II ordered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, to relinquish their honorary titles and patronages following the confirmation that they would not be returning as working royals.The couple relocated to the United States last year, in a move dubbed "Megxit" by the British press, and have since embarked on several commercial ventures there including lucrative tieups with the streaming platforms Netflix and Spotify.At an emergency January 2020 summit with the queen, Harry's father Prince Charles and brother Prince William, Harry agreed they would stop using their "Royal Highness" titles and the "Sussex Royal" brand.But the senior family members pledged to review the situation a year on -- with the move now made permanent, days after Harry and Meghan announced on Valentine's Day they are expecting their second child."The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have confirmed to Her Majesty The Queen that they will not be returning as working members of The Royal Family," Buckingham Palace announced."The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service."It noted their honorary appointments and patronages would be redistributed among the remaining working royals.'Service is universalHowever, it appears the pair will retain their official titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Harry remains sixth in line to the throne, with no change in the line of succession."While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family," the palace statement added.The decision means Harry, 36, who served as a soldier in Afghanistan and is passionate about veterans' welfare, must relinquish several honorary military titles related to the Royal Marines, air force and navy.Earlier this month he formally settled a libel claim against the publisher of The Mail On Sunday and MailOnline website over reports he had snubbed soldiers since stepping back from royal life.A spokesperson for the couple said Friday they had shown that they "remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world".The statement noted they had offered their continued support to the organisations they had represented "regardless of official role"."We can all live a life of service. Service is universal," it added.'Intimate' interviewThe couple's move to the US followed reports Meghan was deeply unhappy with life inside the centuries-old royal institution and increasing complaints from the couple about media intrusion.But its sudden nature jolted the monarchy and reportedly caused acrimony with Harry's brother William, who is second in line to the throne.Harry and Meghan have launched several legal cases against UK news outlets alleging invasion of privacy, with one lawsuit ending this month with a victory against Associated Newspapers.The couple are poised to give an "intimate" interview about their lives with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey.'Championed our work' Aside from his military titles, Harry also held Commonwealth appointments and some other patronages, including with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and Rugby Football League."The RFU has greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game," the organisation said on Twitter.Harry will remain as patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, the organisation for disabled military veterans confirmed.Meanwhile Meghan was also handed honorary roles after she wed Harry in a fairytale ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018, including becoming a patron of the National Theatre.The acclaimed theatre group also thanked her for the support offered during her briefer than expected tenure and said the process of appointing a new patron had begun.Jennie Bond, a former royal correspondent for the BBC, said the loss of titles would be a blow to the couple."This is going to upset Harry, obviously, particularly the military (losses)," she told the broadcaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-permanently-quit-uk-royal-life-101613755768518.html

19-02-2021||World||US should consult Taliban on any Afghan pullout delay: Pakistani envoy||The United States should consult the Taliban on any extension of a May 1 deadline for a full US troop pullout from Afghanistan and should not decide unilaterally, the Pakistani ambassador to the United States said on Friday.Ambassador Asad Majeed Khan's comments come as the Biden administration conducts a review of a February 2020 deal with the Taliban that is expected to determine whether it will meet the deadline to withdraw the last US soldiers from America's longest war.US and European officials say the Taliban have not fulfilled commitments they made in the accord and that conditions are not conducive to advancing the peace process amid a surge in violence blamed on the insurgents.The Taliban, seeking to reimpose Islamic rule in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster at the hands of US-led troops, deny the charges and indicate they will resume attacks on US and allied troops unless the May deadline is kept.Khan told an online forum sponsored by the Stimson Center that US officials should consult the Taliban before deciding whether to maintain the last 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan."That is where the process should start," Khan said. "To present this as a fait accompli, I think, will only create difficulty."Khan's comments were significant as Pakistan, which helped facilitate the US-Taliban negotiations in Doha that clinched the February 2020 deal, wields considerable influence with the insurgents.The insurgents have sanctuaries in Pakistan, whose main military-run intelligence service gives them support, according to US and Afghan officials. Pakistan denies the allegation."If there is strong justification and reasoning to have an extension for logistical or other reasons, the parties have overcome difficulties ... before in terms of reaching common ground," Khan said. "It's really also a question of the credibility of the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-consult-taliban-on-any-afghan-pullout-delay-pakistani-envoy-101613755088082.html
19-02-2021||World||Over 20 million years of life lost to Covid-19: Study | Here are some of the key findings||Over 20 million years of life have been lost to the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic globally, according to a new study aimed at understanding the mortality impact of the viral infection. Researchers analysed the premature mortality impact of Covid-19 by calculating the number of years of life lost (YLL) to the disease across 81 countries covering over 1.2 million deaths. They noted that the results of the study, published in the scientific journal Nature, confirm the “large mortality impact of Covid-19 among the elderly” and “call for heightened awareness in devising policies that protect vulnerable demographics losing the largest number of life-years.”Here are some of the key findings from the study:While the mortality rate for Covid-19 has been higher in the elderly, only a fraction of the years of life lost can be attributed to the individuals in the oldest age brackets. The researchers found that three-quarters of the YLL resulted from deaths in people below the age of 75 and almost a third from deaths below the age of 55. “Globally, 44.9% of the total YLL can be attributed to the deaths of individuals between 55 and 75 years old,” the study said.On average, Covid-19 took 16 years from each fatality and the majority of those years were from individuals with a significant remaining life expectancy. In high-income countries, a large proportion of the YLL was found to be borne by the oldest group but the pattern changed for low- and mid-income countries, where a large fraction of the YLL was from individuals dying at 55 or younger.The researchers also found gender disparity in the mortality rate for Covid-19 as well as in absolute years of life lost. After studying the sample of countries where death counts by gender are available, they concluded that men have lost 44 per cent more years to the pandemic than women. A higher average age-at-death of female Covid-19 deaths and, in terms of the absolute number, more male deaths than female deaths directly impacted the disparity.According to the study, there are two key sources of potential bias to the results that operate in different directions. The researchers said the study might underestimate Covid-19 YLL rates due to an undercount of the total death. On the other hand, people dying from the infection may belong to an at-risk population whose remaining life expectancy is shorter than the average person’s remaining life expectancy, and, consequently, the estimate of the total YLL due to Covid-19 may be an overestimate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-million-years-of-life-lost-to-covid-19-study-key-findings-101613751851747.html

We need to make progress on this, at home and abroad," Scholz said, adding that the additional money was meant to support the Covax program, the Word Health Organisation (WHO) and other international efforts."With today's announcement we make clear: We're standing side-by-side with the poorest countries," Scholz said. The German contribution would increase international funds for vaccines, drugs and tests by over 30 percent, he added."We'll only be safe if there is immunisation through vaccination all over the world," Scholz said.US President Joe Biden was expected to use his first meeting with leaders of Group of Seven advanced economies on Friday to announce an immediate $2 billion donation to the Covax program co-led by the WHO. Covax aims to ensure a fair supply of coronavirus vaccines around the world.The United States will provide an additional $2 billion over the next two years as other nations fulfil and make their own pledges, US officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-pledges-additional-1-5-bln-euros-for-covax-and-who-101613748621879.html
19-02-2021||World||EU to double Covax vaccine funding to 1 billion euros||The European Union's executive commission on Friday pledged to double its contribution to the World Health Organization’s Covax program, bringing the 27-nation bloc’s commitment to the initiative to deliver vaccines to poor nations to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised a “true moment of global solidarity" in a statement as leaders of the Group of Seven economic powers gathered in a virtual meeting.Von der Leyen also announced during the meeting an additional 100 million euros ($121.4 million) to support vaccination campaigns in Africa in partnership with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The funding will be used to strengthen health systems, ensure the cold chains, buy equipment and train staff," von der Leyen said. She added that the EU would discuss with drugmakers how they can ramp up their Covid-19 vaccine production capacity in Africa.“We are also exploring potential support to boost local production under licensing arrangements," she said.The EU is one of the leading donors to the Covax program, which aims to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 shots for low-and middle-income countries. Covax hopes to deploy some 336 million doses by the end of June, and around 2 billion doses by the end of the year.But the program has already missed the goal of starting vaccination in poor countries at the same time that doses were rolled out in rich countries.This week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, saying 10 countries have administered 75% of the vaccinations given worldwide so far and demanding a global effort to get all people in every nation vaccinated as soon as possible.Amnesty International said a failure to ensure global access to vaccines represents “an abject moral failure that will ultimately harm rich countries."“The leaders of G-7 nations are shooting themselves in the foot by failing to ensure the equal distribution of coronavirus vaccines globally,” Netsanet Belay, the research and advocacy director at Amnesty International, said as the G-7 leaders prepared to hold their first meeting of the year.The European Union has been criticized for its handling of the bloc’s vaccine procurement process. Despite the EU securing a portfolio of up to 2.6 billion doses that would be largely sufficient to inoculate its 450 million residents, vaccinations in Europe have been slowed down by delays in the production and deliveries of shots.In addition to its Covax contribution, the EU said it wants to share some of its doses with neighbors in Europe and Africa. Von der Leyen has regularly insisted that global solidarity is needed not only to help the world’s poorest countries but also to protect the EU, as “nobody is safe until everybody is safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-double-covax-vaccine-funding-to-1-billion-euros-101613747051913.html

19-02-2021||World||US states remain split on guns in capitols after armed protests||In the past year, insurrectionists have breached the US Capitol and armed protesters have forced their way into statehouses around the country. But the question of whether guns should be allowed in capitol buildings remains political, and states are going in opposite directions.In Montana, a new state law signed Thursday allows anyone with a permit to bring a concealed firearm into the statehouse, reversing a decades-long policy banning guns inside the Capitol and fulfilling a longtime hope of Republicans who took control of the governor's mansion as well as the Legislature this year. GOP-dominated Utah passed a law this month allowing people to carry concealed weapons into its Capitol building and elsewhere in the state without a permit.Guns are allowed in statehouses in some form in 21 US states, according to a review by The Associated Press. Eight states allow only concealed firearms inside their capitols, while two states allow only open carry.Montana and Utah are two of at least 13 states that do not have metal detectors at the entrance to their capitols. The statehouses are open to the public even as many have closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Several other states, though, are moving to restrict guns inside their capitols. In Michigan, where armed protesters forced their way inside the statehouse last year and the FBI said it uncovered a plot to kidnap the governor, a state panel banned the open carry of guns after the Jan. 6 riots in Washington, DC.Democratic state Sen. Dayna Polehanki said that “tensions are high” in Michigan following the assaults, and she's disappointed that concealed weapons are still allowed in the statehouse.“What they said is that weapons, guns, bullets are still welcome in our state capitol as long as we can’t see them. It doesn’t make anyone safer,” she said.Vermont lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering expanding their statehouse ban on guns to other government buildings. In Washington state, a bill that would ban open carry of guns in the statehouse and near permitted demonstrations has won early approval.“The purpose of openly carrying a weapon is to chill other people’s voices. And it works,” said its sponsor, Washington state Sen. Patty Kuderer, a Democrat.In nearby Oregon, crowds opposed to the building’s public closure during a pandemic-related session stormed the state Capitol, including at least one person armed with an AR-15. And in Idaho, self-styled “patriots,” anti-vaccination groups and others forced their way past police in August at the Capitol, shattering a window as they pushed and shoved into a gallery.In Montana, though, Republican Rep. Seth Berglee said the US Capitol riot didn’t affect his thinking about the law he sponsored.“People that have a permit are extremely law-abiding, and they are the type of people I would want to have around. I see them as being a deterrent to bad things happening,” he said.There’s a similar proposal this year in Oklahoma, where gun rights advocates are once again pushing to allow people to carry firearms inside the Capitol with a license. It hasn’t yet had a hearing.“A person needs to be able to protect themselves, no matter where they are,” said Don Spencer, president of the Oklahoma Second Amendment Association.Not everyone in Montana feels safer with the new measure in place, however. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott said more guns could add a chilling new dimension to debates in polarized times.“If you have more guns in the building when you’re talking about things that are so personal and intense ... you do worry about things escalating,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-remain-split-on-guns-in-capitols-after-armed-protests-101613744772125.html
19-02-2021||World||UK government broke the law by failing to disclose PPE contracts, court rules||The British government broke the law by failing to publish details of billions of pounds of spending on personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic, a London court ruled on Friday.As Covid-19 swept across the world last year, Britain scrambled to secure protective gear for medics and nurses on the front line.The Good Law Project, a campaign group, and three opposition politicians brought a judicial review seeking details of undisclosed deals with firms that had no medical procurement expertise and, in some cases, delivered defective protective equipment.A judge at a London High Court said the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, failed to comply with a public procurement law that requires the government to publish contract awards within 30 days."The Secretary of State spent vast quantities of public money on pandemic-related procurements during 2020," the judge said. "The public were entitled to see who this money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded."The health ministry said it had needed to move within very short timescales and against unparalleled global demand."This has often meant having to award contracts at speed to secure the vital supplies required to protect NHS (National Health Service) workers and the public," a spokesman said."We fully recognise the importance of transparency in the award of public contracts and continue to publish information about contracts awarded as soon as possible."The National Audit Office said last year there had been a lack of transparency and a failure to explain why certain suppliers were chosen, or how any conflict of interest was dealt with, in procurement deals between March and the end of July worth about 18 billion pounds.Opposition politicians have accused the government of running a "chumocracy" with contracts, including for the purchase of what turned out to be unusable PPE, and appointments made to those with family or business links to those in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-broke-the-law-by-failing-to-disclose-ppe-contracts-court-rules-101613743223364.html
19-02-2021||World||Trump Plaza brought down by 3,000 sticks of dynamite||Donald Trump’s failed business venture Trump Plaza and Casino was demolished Wednesday at 9 am with the push of a button on a detonator. The property had been shuttered since 2014 and was in a state of disrepair. The former US President had often mentioned his business ventures in Atlantic City while on the campaign trail for his infamous 2017 Presidential race.“Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me,” Trump had said in an interview. “The money I took out of there was incredible.”The Trump Plaza became Atlantic City’s 10th casino when it opened its doors in 1984. Though the Trumps have not been legally associated with the Plaza since 2009, after a series of bankruptcy filings, his name continued to appear on the building before it was closed in 2014.The 34-storied Trump Plaza was brought down with 3,000 pieces of dynamites by a Maryland-based professional demolition company, Controlled Demolition Inc. The other Trump businesses in the vicinity, including the crown jewel, Trump Taj Mahal, have all been sold.The New York Times reported that the implosion lasted only seconds, due to the lack of a basement and cavity space to absorb the debris. Atlantic City officials told reporters that the pile of rubble left behind is 70 to 80 feet tall and will be cleared by summertime.For the Democratic Mayor of Atlantic City, Marty Smalls, the way Trump’s businesses panned out in his city foretold the path United States took under the former President.“This is not about President Trump, because, quite frankly, the people here in the great city of Atlantic City knew how the presidency was going to play out on a national stage because we’re one of the cities that knew him best,” Small said to reporters after the implosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-plaza-brought-down-by-3-000-sticks-of-dynamite-101613744633796.html
19-02-2021||World||Water leaks indicate new damage at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant||Cooling water levels have fallen in two reactors at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant since a powerful earthquake hit the area last weekend, indicating possible additional damage, its operator said Friday.New damage could further complicate the plant’s already difficult decommissioning process, which is expected to take decades.Tokyo Electric Power Co. spokesman Keisuke Matsuo said the drop in water levels in Unit 1 and 3 reactors indicates that the existing damage to their primary containment chambers was worsened by Saturday's magnitude 7.3 quake, allowing more water to leak.The leaked water is believed to have remained inside the reactor buildings and there is no sign of any outside impact, he said.In 2011, a powerful magnitude 9.1 earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima plant's cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and nuclear fuel to fall to the bottom of their primary containment vessels.TEPCO will monitor the water and temperatures at the bottom of the containment vessels, Matsuo said.Since the 2011 disaster, cooling water has been escaping constantly from the damaged primary containment vessels into the basements of the reactor buildings. To make up for the loss, additional cooling water has been pumped into the reactors to cool the melted fuel remaining inside them. The recent decline in the water levels indicates that more water than before is leaking out, TEPCO said.More than 180 people received mostly minor injuries from Saturday's earthquake, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The quake also triggered landslides, damaged homes and a high-speed train line, and caused widespread power and water supply disruptions.TEPCO initially reported that there was no abnormality at the plant from Saturday's quake.Matsuo said the cooling water level fell as much as 70 centimeters (27 inches) in the primary containment chamber of the Unit 1 reactor and about 30 centimeters (11 inches) in Unit 3. TEPCO wasn't able to determine any decline in Unit 2 because indicators have been taken out to prepare for the removal of melted debris, it said.Increased leakage could require more cooling water to be pumped into the reactors, which would result in more contaminated water that is treated and stored in huge tanks at the plant. TEPCO says its storage capacity of 1.37 million tons will be full next summer. A government panel's recommendation that it be gradually released into the sea has faced fierce opposition from local residents and a decision is still pending.Meanwhile, the Tokyo High Court on Friday held the government as well as TEPCO accountable for the 2011 nuclear disaster, ordering both to pay about 280 million yen ($2.6 million) in compensation to more than 40 plaintiffs forced to evacuate to Chiba, near Tokyo, for their lost livelihoods and homes.Friday’s decision reverses an earlier ruling by the Chiba district court that excluded the government from responsibility. Judge Yukio Shirai said the government could have foreseen the risk of a massive tsunami and taken measures after a long-term assessment in 2002 of seismic activities.Lawyers representing the plaintiffs welcomed the decision and said it would affect other pending cases.“The case raises the question of whether we should tolerate a society that prioritizes economic activities over people's lives and health,” said Izutaro Mangi, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/water-leaks-indicate-new-damage-at-japan-s-fukushima-nuclear-plant-101613744247016.html
19-02-2021||World||After visit of envoys, EU calls for early assembly elections in Jammu & Kashmir||Following a visit to Jammu and Kashmir by a group of 24 envoys, the European Union (EU) on Friday called for more political and economic steps, including the early holding of assembly elections, to restore normalcy in the region.EU ambassador Ugo Astuto and envoys of ten EU states, including key players such as France, Italy and the Netherlands, were part of the third group of heads of foreign missions to travel to Jammu and Kashmir since January 2020. The visit was aimed at allowing the diplomats to make an assessment of the ground situation.While taking note of recent steps by the Indian government, such as holding of elections to the District Development Councils (DDCs) in November-December and resumption of 4G internet services earlier this month, an EU official said: “We look forward to a number of other important steps to be taken in the political and economic sphere, including the early organisation of the legislative assembly elections.”“The right to freedom of expression online and offline is a key value for all democracies,” the official said.The visit by the envoys provided an opportunity to “see the situation on the ground and interact with local interlocutors as part of the EU’s outreach to all stakeholders”. The official added: “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with India on this.”Besides the EU envoy, the ambassadors of Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden were part of the group. The remaining envoys were from countries in different geographical regions, such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic and Malaysia.The Union government has said elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir following the completion of the delimitation process, which is underway. In his Independence Day address last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “As soon as the delimitation process is over, there will be elections in the future so that the union territory has its own government, which will undertake development work with renewed vigour.”Other diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two-day visit, which ended on Thursday, was too brief to make a comprehensive assessment though there were indications of a relative improvement in the situation.The diplomats also said most of the grassroots politicians, civil society representatives and businesspeople they had interacted with had stressed the need for more steps to ensure social and economic development, investments and creation of jobs.EU ambassador Astuto was also part of the second group of envoys that had visited Jammu and Kashmir in February 2020, following the government’s decision in August 2019 to scrap the region’s special status and split it into two union territories. India has said the move was aimed at improving governance, boosting development and tackling cross-border terrorism.However, the lockdown of Kashmir, snapping of internet connectivity and widespread detention of political leaders in 2019 had been criticised by the EU and other countries.The external affairs ministry said the latest visit allowed the envoys to witness, first-hand, Kashmir’s “march on the path of inclusive development and the dynamism in the grassroots democratic institutions”. The envoys visited Srinagar, Budgam and Jammu and were also briefed on the security situation by senior army officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-visit-of-envoys-eu-calls-for-early-assembly-elections-in-jammu-kashmir-101613742172553.html

It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-still-very-good-vaccine-despite-study-south-africa-adviser-101613742729395.html
19-02-2021||World||US officially rejoins Paris climate agreement, 30 days after Biden ordered move||The United States officially rejoined the Paris climate agreement on Friday, reinvigorating the global fight against climate change as the Biden administration plans drastic emissions cuts over the next three decades.Scientists and foreign diplomats have welcomed the US return to the treaty, which became official 30 days after President Joe Biden ordered the move on his first day in office.Since nearly 200 countries signed the 2015 pact to prevent catastrophic climate change, the United States was the only country to exit. Former President Donald Trump took the step, claiming climate action would cost too much.US climate envoy John Kerry will take part in virtual events on Friday to mark the US re-entry, including appearances with the ambassadors to the UK and Italy, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and UN climate ambition envoy Michael Bloomberg.Biden has promised to chart a path toward net-zero US emissions by 2050. Scientists have said that goal is in line with what is needed, while also stressing that global emissions need to drop by half by 2030 to prevent the most devastating impacts of global warming. Kerry along with Biden’s domestic climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, are crafting new regulations and incentives aimed at speeding the deployment of clean energy and transitioning from fossil fuels.Those measures will form the backbone of Washington’s next emissions reduction goal, or Nationally Determined Contribution, to be announced before a global climate leaders summit Biden will host on April 22. The next UN climate conference is in November in Glasgow.Biden has also signed more than a dozen executive orders related to climate change, and has mobilized every federal agency to help shape the government's response.Despite the excitement over the US return to global negotiations, climate negotiators say the path forward will not be easy. Biden’s climate goals face political challenges in the United States, opposition from fossil fuel companies and some concern among foreign leaders about US flip-flopping on climate policy."There’s a lot of ground to make up, but the hope of Paris is alive and strong," said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officially-rejoins-paris-climate-agreement-30-days-after-biden-ordered-move-101613740878319.html
19-02-2021||World||Facebook controversy: What prompted Australia PM to reach out to PM Modi? All you need to know||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday said that he discussed the progress of the “media platform bill” with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi during a telephonic conversation a day before. The discussion was held in the aftermath of Facebook’s decision to restrict publishers and people of Australia from sharing or viewing news content on its platform.The contentious legislation, titled News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, aims to make two Big Techs - Google and Facebook - pay content publishers for sharing news on their platforms. While announcing the decision on Wednesday, Facebook said that the bill, already passed by the lower house of parliament, “fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content.”“It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” William Easton, managing director, Facebook Australia & New Zealand, said in a blog post.What's the rationale behind the code?The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which drafted the code, had identified a bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and Australian news businesses. The competition watchdog had said in a report that organisations like Google and Facebook are more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries in the supply of news in Australia. According to the chair of the ACCC, the bill would even out the bargaining power imbalance so that fair commercial deals can be made.Read | Facebook’s Australia face-off could backfire across the globeHere’s are some of the key elements of the code:The news media bargaining code will create a framework for registered news media corporations and digital platforms to negotiate for financial remuneration for the use and/or reproduction of news content.Digital platform corporations like Google and Facebook will have to provide the news business corporations with a range of information, including advance notification of planned changes to an algorithm that will have a significant effect on referral traffic to covered news content.The law would force the two Big Techs to enter mandatory arbitration with media outlets if they fail to reach an agreement over the value of the news content within three months. The arbiter will take the final call between the payment proposal put forward by both parties.The tech giants may make standard offers to news businesses, particularly smaller ones, to reduce the time and cost associated with negotiations.How Google and Facebook reacted?Google argued that the “baseball arbitration model” incentivises publishers to make ambit claims and resort to arbitration rather than good-faith negotiations. It had even threatened to pull its search engine from Australia if the government forces it to pay media outlets for their news content. However, the company has reluctantly struck deals with media companies, including NewsCorp, to pay for journalism.On the other hand, Facebook has decided to take the issue head-on by not caving, for the time being, to the government’s pressure. Easton said that platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news content, highlighting that Google Search is “inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content.” He argued that publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook which allows them to “sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.”“For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed,” he added.What’s next?Beginning Monday, the legislation will be debated in the Senate which is expected to adopt the law by the end of the week. Australia is mobilising support in its fight against Facebook and Morrison’s recent discussions with PM Modi, Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK’s Boris Johnson is proof of that. Morrison told reporters on Friday that “people are looking at what Australia is doing” and “they’re already going down this path,” indicating wider support on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-controversy-what-prompted-australia-pm-to-reach-out-to-pm-modi-101613739452925.html
19-02-2021||World||UK vows to share Covid-19 vaccines ahead of G7 meeting but uncertain of timeline, quantity||worldLeaders of the Group of Seven economic powers are holding their first meeting of 2021 on Friday, and vowing to share coronavirus vaccines with the world's poorest countries — though details of how soon and how much they will give remain scarce.Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, which holds the G-7 presidency this year, is meeting virtually with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the United States to discuss international challenges -- chief among them the pandemic that has killed almost 2.5 million people around the world.Wealthy nations have snapped up hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines against the virus, while some countries in the developing world have little or none.Johnson, whose country has had almost 120,000 coronavirus deaths, will promise to give “the majority of any future surplus vaccines” to the UN-backed COVAX effort to vaccinate the world's most vulnerable people, and will encourage other G-7 countries to do the same, the British government said.But Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said it was is “difficult to say with any kind of certainty” when or how much Britain could donate.“We're not really able to give with certainty either a timescale or the numbers involved,” he told the BBC.French President Emmanuel Macron gave a firmer target, saying Europe and the US should allocate up to 5 per cent of their current Covid-19 vaccine supplies to the poorest countries “very fast, so that people on the ground see it happening.”In an interview with the Financial Times, Macron noted that Russia and China have been quick to offer doses of their own products to some African nations.As the African continent awaits delivery of doses through COVAX, an African Union-created vaccines task force said Friday that it would be getting 300 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in May.The AU previously secured 270 million doses from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson for the continent of 1.3 billion people.Macron said that “hundreds of millions of vaccines are being given in rich countries” while the vaccination effort in poor countries has barely started.“It's an unprecedented acceleration of global inequality and it's politically unsustainable too because it's paving the way for a war of influence over vaccines,” he said. “You can see the Chinese strategy, and the Russian strategy too.”The French president's office said France was ready to hand over 5 per cent of its doses but would not give exact numbers or a date.European governments are under pressure to speed up their domestic vaccination campaigns after being outpaced by Britain and the US.German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, signaled broad support for Macron's proposal but said details still have to be thrashed out.Seibert told reporters in Berlin that “there is an understanding in principle with the French president that European countries will hand over some of their stock to poorer countries on other continents that so far have not been supplied."“When that will happen, in what steps, certainly still has to be discussed," he said.Development and aid groups said rich Western countries needed to do more, and soon.“The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible,” said Romilly Greenhill, UK director of anti-poverty group the One Campaign.America's G-7 allies are keen to impress President Joe Biden at his first major multilateral engagement since taking office.They are hopeful that US re-engagement with the world following the “America first” years under Donald Trump will mean a more coordinated response on issues including Covid-19 and climate change.Biden has pledged to join the COVAX initiative, which Trump refused to support, and to distribute USD 4 billion in US funding to the program.Friday's G-7 meeting — and a speech by Biden at the Munich Security Conference the same day — comes the day the United States officially rejoins the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. Trump pulled the US out of the landmark accord in 2017.The Biden administration also said it was ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the 2015 deal to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, which was repudiated by Trump.For Johnson, the G-7 presidency is a chance to demonstrate Britain is still a key global player following its exit from the EU, which became complete at the end of 2020.A full G-7 summit is scheduled to take place in June at the Carbis Bay seaside resort in southwest England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vows-to-share-covid-19-vaccines-ahead-of-g7-meeting-101613738967134.html
19-02-2021||World||World Social Justice Day 2021: Know this year's theme, significance||The United Nations (UN) General Assembly (GA) recognises that social development cannot be ensured in the absence of social justice. On November 26, 2007, the GA declared that February 20 will be celebrated annually as the World Day of Social Justice. The purpose of this day is to recognise in letter and spirit that even though the world is moving ahead through cooperation and innovation, social inequality still persists.India itself is no stranger to the concept of social justice. BR Ambedkar, the father of the Indian Constitution, believed that without ensuring social justice, a society cannot ensure political justice to all its citizens.The theme of this year’s World Social Justice Day is social justice in the digital economy. The advancements in technology made over the past decade have helped human beings traverse the tricky landscape of a world wrecked by Covid-19. Workers were able to take their work home because of what the UN calls ‘digital labour platforms’ which provided “workers with income-generating opportunities and benefits from flexible work arrangements”. However, this has also exacerbated issues of the regularity of work and income, the right to form or join trade unions, and hampered skill utilization.The UN estimates that the consequences of the pandemic are going to affect the economy for years to come and since digital labour platforms are not restricted by borders and operate across multiple jurisdictions, there is an ardent need for international policy dialogue and coordination. The UN has chosen this year’s Social Justice Day to shed some light on the basic rights of workers who have now shifted to digital platforms, especially of those in the global South, whose lives are impacted by a lack of proper digital infrastructure too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-social-justice-day-2021-know-this-year-s-theme-significance-101613736793530.html
19-02-2021||World||Galwan Valley casualty numbers: China launches renewed diplomatic war on India||China on Friday launched a renewed diplomatic war on India, issuing official statements blaming New Delhi for the border tension in eastern Ladakh and the Galwan Valley clash last summer that left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead.Following the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Daily releasing details - for the first time officially - of the four Chinese soldiers killed and one injured in the clash in June near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Chinese defence and foreign ministries issued statements, pinning the blame for the deaths of soldiers on India.Separately, Chinese state media outlets released videos and write-ups, urging the Chinese citizens to remember the “martyrs” and how four PLA soldiers sacrificed their lives while defending the country’s western borders.The defence ministry was quoted as saying the families of all five soldiers will be well looked after.All five PLA soldiers were awarded, four of them posthumously, for their role in fighting the Indian Army’s border troops in the Galwan Valley, Chinese official media announced, citing the Central Military Commission (CMC).The title of “border-defending hero” was conferred on Battalion Commander Chen Hongjun posthumously, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran received first-class merit.“They all died in a clash with trespassing foreign military personnel wielding steel tubes, cudgels and stones last June,” official news agency Xinhua reported, quoting PLA Daily.Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the skirmish, received the title of “hero regiment commander for defending the border”.Emphasising how young the soldiers were, Hu Xijin, editor of the tabloid Global Times, wrote that Wang Zhuoran, the youngest of the four soldiers who died, was only 19 years old, while Chen Xiangrong and Xiao Siyuan were 24 years old. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, while blaming India, said the PLA Daily story has put the truth out in the open.“This will be a way to pay tribute to our heroes and martyrs and also will help the Indian side to draw lessons from it and better work with China to uphold peace and stability in the border region and properly resolve the border issue,” she said during a briefing.Hua added, “We hope the border issue will be put in the proper place in our bilateral relations. We hope to work with the Indian side to properly resolve the issue and uphold the general picture in the interest of our bilateral ties.”Mentioning two soldiers, Chen Hongjun and Xiao Siyuan, Hua said while the former would have become a father in four months (since death), the latter was getting ready for marriage.“I think our peace today is hard to come by,” she said.Both Hua and defence ministry spokesperson, Ren Guoqiang, in a statement published on Chinese social media, continued to blame India for the clash.Ren said that China’s position on resolving the Sino-Indian border problem has been clear, consistent and sincere.China, he said, is committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and has always been ready to maintain the overall stability of the relations between China and India and the two militaries.Ren added that reporting of the casualty figures by PLA Daily is an effort to portray the truth.India has consistently denied the allegation and has maintained that the PLA had trespassed across the LAC.Chinese foreign ministry’s Hua added that India is an important neighbour and restoring a healthy, stable relation relationship is the aspiration and also in the interest of the people of the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/galwan-valley-casualty-numbers-china-launches-renewed-diplomatic-war-on-india-101613734310732.html
19-02-2021||World||'It was like a war film': How Italian town with first known virus death fared||Italy delivered the first shocking confirmation of locally transmitted coronavirus infections outside of Asia a year ago Sunday, with back-to-back revelations of cases more than 150 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) apart in the country's north.First, a 38-year-old man in Codogno, an industrial town in the Lombardy region, tested positive for Covid-19, sending panicked residents to pick up their children from school, stock up on provisions at grocery stores and search in vain for surgical masks at pharmacies.By the evening of Feb. 21, a 77-year-old retired roofer from Vo, a wine-making town in the Veneto region, had died — at the time, the first known fatality from a locally transmitted case of the virus in the West, setting off alarm bells far and wide.In the days and weeks that followed, densely populated Lombardy would become the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak and, by the end of March, countries the world over would be under lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus that has now taken 2.4 million lives. But Vo, as one of the first towns in the West to be isolated, has a unique story, providing some of the first scientific insights into the deadly virus.Adriano Trevisan’s death sent shockwaves through the town west of Venice. Trevisan, well-known around Vo and a regular at a card game in a local bar, had been hospitalized for two weeks with circulatory issues related to a heart condition that could not be resolved with drugs, according to his physician, Dr. Carlo Petruzzi. There was no reason to suspect the coronavirus — as the retiree had had no contact with China, until then a key element in diagnosis.After being advised of the death, Mayor Giuliano Martini, who doubles as the town’s chief pharmacist, ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close and forbade residents from leaving the town, even for work. He asked local volunteer groups to help ensure food and pharmaceutical supplies entering the town were ferried to shelves. The town's three family doctors were put into quarantine because of suspected contact, and the closest hospital, a 30-minute drive away, was closed.“It was like a war film,” Martini said. “We were completely alone.”Surrounded by vineyards and farmland, the town of 3,270 people nestled against Monte Venda has long enjoyed bucolic isolation. But by three days after Trevisan’s death, its isolation was ensured by government decree: Rome dispatched soldiers to seal the town's 12 access roads. Blockades were also set up around the 10 towns near Milan where the other early case of local transmission was confirmed.“There was a sense of bewilderment, I would call it,’’ said Dr. Luca Rossetto, one of the practitioners in Vo. “Even myself, with an old specialization in preventative hygiene, should have the right mindset. But there was an absolute disorientation.”Rossetto reviewed his recent cases and realized he had seen seven people in the previous days with pneumonia-like symptoms. A week later, the 69-year-old physician himself was hospitalized with the virus, a light case from which he recovered.Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia, meanwhile, instinctively ordered blanket testing for all of the residents of Vo, with the aim of understanding the outbreak’s origin. That he was even able to make such a call is thanks to the foresight of University of Padua virologist Andrea Crisanti, who had ordered the necessary tools after the virus appeared in China. Many places around the world struggled to institute testing so quickly.Crisanti recognized that there would be value in testing the entire town immediately after the contagion was confirmed and then again after two weeks. And his work offered early insight into how the virus spread — clarity that Crisanti said was never properly translated into action.The results of the first round of nasal swab tests, available on Feb. 27, showed that nearly 3% of the population had been infected. That indicated that the virus had been circulating in the town since the end of January, according to Crisanti.“With that data, we should have closed both Veneto and Lombardy, immediately,” Crisanti said. But decision-makers, he said, “didn’t perceive the extent of the problem.”The question of whether more more restrictions on movement should have been instituted sooner has been hotly debated in Italy, with many politicians noting that such decisions were extremely difficult given that the measures come with a heavy economic and social cost and infringe on freedoms. There is even a criminal investigation into whether officials waited too long to lock down two towns in Lombardy.Shutting down Vo proved remarkably effective in stopping the transmission. When Cristanti conducted the second round of testing on March 7, no new cases were detected.Cristanti said that the findings — which were published by the journal Nature in June but known to Italian officials immediately — made clear that isolation and mass testing were the best way to contain the virus before vaccines.While Crisanti succeeded in persuading the Veneto region to increase testing, it wasn’t until March 9 — 17 days after the virus had been simultaneously detected in two Italian regions, with cases multiplying and a mass exodus toward the south under way — that then-Premier Giuseppe Conte ordered the entire country on a near-total lockdown that would last seven weeks.By the end of May, as cases began to recede in Italy, more than 232,684 people had been infected, mostly in the north, and 33,415 had died.Scientists still don’t know how the virus arrived in Vo.Though struck at the same time, Veneto fared much better than Lombardy, which became the epicenter of both of Italy's surges. It has half the population and its industry is more spread out, but experts have also credited its health system, which enables close contact among family doctors, district administrators and hospital officials and which is less reliant on private facilities. Another key element in its virus fight was the testing system created by Crisanti.Crisanti urged the government in Rome in August to expand its capacity for nasal swab tests in the hopes of keeping transmission low after a successful lockdown. While the government has, Crisanti is disappointed that it has relied heavily on rapid tests — as many other places have and as some experts have recommended — rather than strategically deploying more reliable nasal swabs to isolate outbreaks.By October, Italy was battling a resurgence that has proved even deadlier than the spring peak, with the toll now at nearly 95,000 Italians. If the virus’s arrival last February caught the country off-guard, the long-predicted fall resurgence was “madness,” Crisanti said.Vo, too, suffered a resurgence that is only now abating. The town’s pandemic death toll doubled, to 6.Boasting an unusually high number of restaurants per capita at 45 eateries, Vo is now an echo of its former self. The weddings, baptisms and first communions that drew dwellers of nearby cities to the hillside town have been limited by restrictions. Restaurant closures also forced the Vo wine cooperative to reduce 2020 production. The local dance hall has never reopened.Things might have been different, Martini believes.“The virus in Vo arrived in Vo and died in Vo,” the mayor said of the first cases a year ago. The failure to repeat the model: “Ruinous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-like-a-war-film-how-italian-town-with-first-known-virus-death-fared-101613730355919.html

In order to prevent hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines, WHO started the ambitious initiative of Covax. It was rolled out in April last year by the UN health body in collaboration with the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to help 180 poor countries.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also highlighted the major inequality as he said more than 75 per cent of the Covid-19 vaccines have been administered by the rich nations.The first interim distribution forecast was released by Covax on February 3. The proposed coverage "is in line with the Facility target to reach at least 3% population coverage in all countries in the first half of the year, enough to protect the most vulnerable groups such as health care workers,” the forecast had said.Also Read | HELINA missile strikes 5 out 5, ready for inductionCovax aims to supply around 2 billion Covid-19 doses to low-income countries by the end of 2021. The initiative focuses on accelerated manufacture and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines for free and equitable access to all.Here what countries and companies have pledged towards Covax:1. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday has said that the country will donate surplus coronavirus vaccines to developing countries. The donation of the vaccines will be apart from the 548 million pounds donated to the program. Johnson also aims to encourage other countries to boost their funding to Covax during the G7 virtual meet.2. Novavax Inc will also supply 1.1 billion doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccines. Novavax with its manufacturing and distribution partner Serum Institute of India has pledged the commitment.3. The US has targeted a contribution of $4 billion to the global program for equitable inoculation. President Joe Biden will announce the commitment of funds during the Group of Seven call on Friday.4. France has also committed to donating 5 per cent of the secured Covid-19 vaccine supplies to low-income countries through Covax.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pledges-made-towards-equitable-supply-of-vaccines-through-covax-101613725129187.html

Now they will ask the general public to pay the charges of autopsy and even medical examination of rape victims. So the decision is not a welcome one," said a rights activist Tamur Kamal while talking to The Express Tribune.The proposed plan also suggested charges for keeping corpses in the cold storage to ₹1,500 per 24 hours. For DNA testing ₹18,000 has been fixed."For the district Peshawar autopsy cases the department will charge ₹5,000 per case while for the cases referred from other districts the charges will be ₹25,000 per post-mortem," said an official of the department, adding that for kinship and paternity test ₹20,000 fee has been proposed."For drug abuse analysis ₹3,000 charges have to be paid. Urine tests and alcohol analysis will cost ₹2,000. Test for poison detection to cost ₹4,000 while freezer charges for dead bodies will be ₹1,500 per 24 hours," he informed The Express Tribune.The unclaimed bodies are sent to the Khyber Medical College University for cold storage by the local police where they are stored sometimes for months till their identification and retrieval by the family.The Express Tribune reported that the decision to introduce 17 new charges was taken to meet the operational expenditures of the Forensic Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-charge-rape-victims-rs-25-000-for-medical-examination-101613725010020.html

MBS's prestige suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to the crown prince.Former US President Donald Trump maintained steady contact with the crown prince through his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defence-secretary-calls-saudi-crown-prince-reaffirms-strategic-ties-thanks-him-for-saudi-efforts-in-yemen-101613724311249.html

They have yet to ascertain a full list of live and dead animals sold legally or illegally at the market.Also read| Patanjali claims Coronil gets Ayush Ministry certification as per WHO schemeThe experts also insist that China carry out widespread testing of its mink farms after two-way transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and minks was confirmed in Europe.The WHO expert team finished their four-week trip to China last week. At a press conference, they announced that any leak of the virus from a lab was unlikely, while the Wuhan wet market's role remains unclear. The investigators also doubted that bats had carried Covid-19 to the market, suggesting that there was an intermediate host.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-believes-badgers-rabbits-could-have-spread-covid-19-to-humans-101613723007608.html
19-02-2021||World||From bats to seafood market, what WHO coronavirus experts learned in Wuhan||A World Health Organization team has left China after gaining some new insights into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people — but with the major questions still unanswered.The visit was politically sensitive for China — which is concerned about any allegations it didn't handle the initial outbreak properly — and has been closely watched around the world.Team member Peter Daszak sounded upbeat on arriving at the airport Wednesday at the end of the four-week trip to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in December 2019.“We have clear leads on what the next steps should be," he said. "We know a lot more after the work that's been done.”The team's major conclusions seemed to confirm what most researchers had already surmised about the virus. The visit was never expected to definitively pinpoint the origin of the pandemic — an undertaking that, based on others, could take years.Here's a look at the theories the team explored during their visit:THE BATSThe mission to Wuhan did not change a major theory about where the virus came from. Scientists think bats are the most likely carriers, and that they passed it on to another animal, which passed it on to humans. While there are other possibilities — a bat could have infected a human directly, for instance — the path through a second animal remains the most likely scenario, according to the WHO team and its Chinese counterparts. The question is what animal and where.___THE MARKETThe Huanan Seafood Market had a cluster of cases at the start of the outbreak and was initially suspected as the place where people first became infected. The discovery of earlier cases has all but ruled out that theory, but researchers still want to know how this early cluster happened.The market dealt mainly in frozen seafood but also sold domesticated wildlife. That included rabbits, which are known to be susceptible to the virus, and bamboo rats and ferret badgers, which are suspected of being susceptible. At the WHO mission's closing news conference Tuesday, one team member said some of these animals have been traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to bats that carry the virus that is the closest known relative of the one that causes Covid-19.The virus could also have been introduced to the market by an infected person. Chinese health officials note that only surfaces at the market tested positive for the virus, not any of the animal products. A Chinese official said Tuesday there appeared to be cases elsewhere in Wuhan around the same time as the market cluster, so the transfer of the virus from animals to humans could have happened elsewhere.___THE LABThe Chinese and the international experts concluded it is extremely unlikely the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab with an extensive collection of virus samples. Former President Donald Trump and officials in his administration were among those who floated that possibility — prompting angry denials from China. And most experts have long been skeptical of it.In making its determination, the team said that such leaks are extremely rare and there's no evidence the virus existed in that lab or any lab anywhere in the world when the pandemic began. It also reviewed safety protocols at the institute, leading the team to conclude “it was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,” WHO team leader Peter Ben Embarek said.___THE COLD CHAINThe joint investigation left open the possibility that the virus could have been spread to humans through frozen food products, a bit of a surprise as foreign experts have generally played down the risk.It's a theory that has been widely promoted by Chinese officials, who have detected the virus on imported frozen food packaging and seized on that to suggest the virus could have come to China from abroad.WHO team member Marion Koopmans noted that it still wouldn't answer the question of where the virus came from originally. “Its not the cold chain by itself, that cannot be," she said at the airport. "The virus has to come from somewhere.”___THE DATAThe mission has been dogged by questions about how much freedom China would give the researchers to visit the places and talk to the people they wanted to. In the end, they appeared satisfied with the arrangements, at least in their public comments. Team member Thea Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-bats-to-seafood-market-what-who-coronavirus-experts-learned-in-wuhan-101613723141269.html
19-02-2021||World||Discussed Facebook news ban with PM Modi, says Australian PM||Australia and Facebook held high-stakes talks Friday after the social media giant sparked global outrage by blacking out news for its Australian users, as Canberra insisted it wouldn't back down on a new law that would force the tech firm to pay for journalistic content.From Thursday, Facebook has blanked out the pages of media outlets for Australian users and blocked them from sharing any news content, rather than submit to the proposed legislation.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday to find a way out of the showdown, and that negotiations would continue over the weekend."We talked through their remaining issues and agreed our respective teams would work through them immediately," Frydenberg said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison also urged Facebook to "move quickly past" what he called threatening behaviour and "come back to the table".He said his government's world-first legislation to force Facebook and Google to pay Australian media for news content published on their platforms was garnering interest from leaders around the world."People are looking at what Australia is doing," he said, noting that he had already discussed the situation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canada's Justin Trudeau.The legislation, called the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, was approved this week by the lower house of parliament and will be debated beginning Monday by the Senate, which is expected to adopt the law by the end of the week.Facebook has defended its dramatic response to the law, saying the legislation "fundamentally misunderstands" the platform's relationship with media organisations and that it had no choice but to bar news content from its services in Australia.Since the ban came into effect, visits to Australian news sites by users at home and abroad dropped significantly, with overseas traffic down by over 20 percent per day, according to data analytics company Chartbeat.The data also suggested users were not yet leaving Facebook in response to the ban, with no apparent rise in Google search traffic recorded.News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller, speaking to a separate Senate inquiry in Canberra, said the full impact of Facebook's decision was yet to be felt by publishers.Yesterday saw referral traffic from the platform disappear, he said, while "direct traffic to our websites was up in double digits".Miller also encouraged the social media giant to return to direct negotiations with media outlets."The door is still open to Facebook."Facebook's sweeping ban drew widespread criticism for inadvertently blocking access to several critical government pages, including emergency services, health departments and the national weather service -- with most restored in the hours after it came into effect.Despite earlier threats to pull its services from Australia over the legislation, Google softened its stance and instead brokered several deals with large media companies, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-pm-morrison-says-he-has-discussed-facebook-news-ban-with-pm-modi-101613722476990.html

There, the company’s coronavirus vaccine is formulated and filled into vials before being shipped for distribution.Biden’s visit will be just his second trip away from the East Coast since taking office last month, following a Tuesday appearance in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at a CNN town hall. Last week, he toured the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, getting a first-hand look at federal research on the virus.Biden has regularly touted his administration’s progress accelerating vaccinations, and has encouraged any American with the opportunity to take a shot. “If you’re eligible, if it’s available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine,” he said during the Tuesday town hall.The US has given about 1.67 million shots per day over the past week, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, up from an average of roughly 900,000 per day in the week before Biden took office. Supply is increasing as Pfizer and Moderna Inc., the other company whose vaccine was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, ramp up their production, as well as efforts led in part by the Biden administration to increase the number of people able to administer vaccines.Also read| Biden admn introduces immigration bill; Indian IT professionals to be benefitedSince taking office, Biden has ordered an additional 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, bringing the total to 300 million, which is enough for 150 million people. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each require two doses. The president said Tuesday that Pfizer agreed to speed up shipments after Biden invoked the Defense Production Act, which enables the government to nationalize manufacturing in emergencies.Unlike Moderna, Pfizer declined full participation in the government’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine-development program under former President Donald Trump. Biden has since scrapped that name.Before Friday’s virtual meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven nations, White House officials on Thursday said the US would immediately commit $2 billion to the effort known as Covax, which aims to help lower-income countries with vaccines. Biden will pledge an additional $2 billion through 2021 and 2022 on condition that other nations’ fulfill their commitments.A third vaccine, from Johnson & Johnson, would require only one shot but the administration said Wednesday that it sees its distribution starting out slowly once it’s authorised by the FDA, which will likely happen within a few days of a Feb. 26 meeting to consider the company’s application and clinical data.Also read| China's population ageing fast, may lift birth restrictions in some regionsIf the vaccine is authorized, the administration’s contract would be for 100 million doses by the end of June. White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday that those deliveries would begin with just a few million doses and most distribution would be “back-end loaded.”Biden’s most recent visit to Michigan was during the final stretch of his campaign, on Oct. 31, when he and former President Barack Obama made joint appearances at rallies in Flint and Detroit. He won the state by more than 154,000 votes, which amounted to a 50.6% to 47.8% victory over Trump. Trump’s narrow 2016 win there, with a 0.23% margin over Hillary Clinton, was the first Republican presidential victory in the state since that of George H.W. Bush in 1988.While recent state races have also been close, Democrats currently hold the governorship as well as both Michigan Senate seats. Biden seriously considered Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who’s been in office since 2019, to be his running mate.During his first visit to the state after a group of militia members were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap Whitmer, he said “there’s not a better governor in the United States of America” than her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-plant-as-us-shots-accelerate-101613720012161.html

It has built artificial islands, Paracel and Spratly island chains in order to claim the 12 nautical miles of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In January this year, it passed a law that gave power to its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels and demolish structures built in disputed waters.Motegi expressed serious concern with regard to China's Coast Guard Law, and the four Ministers concurred to strongly oppose unilateral and forceful attempts to change the status quo in the context of the East and the South China Sea.The four Ministers concurred on further advancing practical cooperation in various areas such as quality infrastructure, maritime security, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, education, and human resource development."The four Ministers reaffirmed their strong support for the "ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific", which is ASEAN's proactive efforts, and ASEAN's unity and centrality as well as the ASEAN-led regional architecture. They also welcomed proactive efforts by other countries including those in Europe toward a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific," read the release.Motegi also expressed grave concern for the deteriorating situation in Myanmar and explained that Japan was strongly urging the Myanmar military to immediately stop violence against citizens including shootings, release those who have been detained including State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and swiftly restore Myanmar's democratic political system. The four Ministers shared the view on the need to recover the democratic regime early, read the release.In addition, the four Ministers also exchanged views on regional issues such as North Korea as well as cooperation on global challenges including response to the COVID-19 and climate change.Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is a four-member grouping of Australia, Japan, India, and the US. It is committed to respecting and upholding international rules and obligations through positive, practical engagement to protect and support the sovereignty, prosperity, and security of the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-expresses-worry-over-china-s-attempts-to-alter-status-quo-in-indopacific-101613719536828.html

She had been on life support at a hospital with what doctors had said was no chance of recovery.Video of the shooting showed her sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated a motorcycle helmet she had been wearing.The woman is the first confirmed death among the protesters who have faced off with security forces after a junta took power Feb. 1, detained Myanmar's elected leaders and prevented Parliament from convening.Her brother, Ye Htut Aung, who spoke to The Associated Press from a mortuary, said she died at 11:05 a.m. Friday. A source at Naypyitaw's 1000-Bed General Hospital, speaking on condition on anonymity because of fear of harassment from the authorities, confirmed the death.A spokesman for the ruling military at a news conference this week did not deny the 19-year-old woman had been shot by security forces, but said she was one of the crowd that had thrown rocks at police, and the case was under investigation. There were no independent accounts of her taking part in any violence.Protesters had already hailed Mya Thwet Thwet Khine as a hero and commemorated her during demonstrations earlier this week.Since the coup, the US and British governments have imposed sanctions targeting the new military leaders, and they and other governments and the United Nations have called for Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration to be restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19yearold-woman-shot-last-week-at-myanmar-protest-dies-101613717451631.html
19-02-2021||World||Biden administration introduces ambitious immigration bill in Congress; Indian IT professionals to be benefited||In a major move that will benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals in America, the Biden administration has introduced an ambitious immigration bill in Congress which among other things proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards.The US Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers.The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress – House of Representatives and the Senate – and signed into law by President Joe Biden, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally.The legislation would also benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals and their families.Those waiting for a Green Card for more than 10 years, would get the legal permanent residency immediately as they would be exempted from the visa cap.Indian IT professionals, waiting for more than a decade now, and whose number runs into thousands, are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this provision of the bill.Authors of the bill – Senator Bob Menendez and Congresswoman Linda Sanchez – told reporters that the US Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a moral and economic imperative and a vision of immigration reform that is expansive and inclusive.It grows the economy by making changes to the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, making it easier for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) advanced degree holders from US universities to stay in the US and improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries.It would also give dependents of H-1B holders work authorisation, and prevent children of H-1B holders from "ageing out" of the system.“I am the daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico. I have dedicated my career to building an immigration system that lets people live without fear, and a system that gives immigrants – like my parents – who sought a better life and contribute to our nation a fair opportunity to thrive,” Sanchez said.“Immigrants contribute greatly to our country and society. They own businesses, pay taxes and teach our children. They are our coworkers, neighbours and friends,” said Menendez.“We have a historic opportunity to finally enact bold immigration reform that leaves no one behind, addresses root causes of migration and safeguards our country’s national security. We have a moral and economic imperative to get this done once and for all,” he said.The ruling Democrats have a majority in both the House and Senate. However, in the upper chamber, they need the support of 10 Republicans to get the legislation through the Congress before it can be signed into law.The Democratic leadership and the White House hope that they will get the necessary support in the interest of millions of non-citizens living in the country.Supported by the White House, the bill creates an earned roadmap to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, with an expedited three-year path to citizenship, and giving all other undocumented immigrants who pass background checks and pay taxes with an eight-year path to citizenship without fear of deportation.It reforms the family-based immigration system to keep families together by recapturing visas from previous years to clear backlogs, including spouses and children of green card holders as immediate family members.It also eliminates discrimination facing LGBTQ families, provides protection for orphans, widows and children, allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join the family in the US on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.In a statement, President Biden said he looks forward to working with leaders in the House and Senate to address the wrongdoings of the past administration and restore justice, humanity and order to the immigration system.“This is an important first step in pursuing immigration policies that unite families, grow and enhance our economy, and safeguard our security,” he said.“The legislation I sent to Congress will bring about much-needed change to an immigration system where reform is long overdue. It will responsibly manage the border with smart investments."It will address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America. It will modernise our legal immigration pathways and create an earned path to citizenship for so many – including Dreamers, farm workers and TPS (Temporary Protected Status) holders,” he said“These are not Democratic or Republican priorities, but American ones. I have laid out my vision for what it will take to reform our immigration system and I look forward to working with leaders in Congress to get this done,” Biden added.Commenting on the development, FWD.us president Todd Schulte said it is a critical moment for immigration policy in the US. FWD.us is a pro-immigration lobbying group based in the United State.“This is a substantial step forward for major immigration legislation and would provide a desperately-needed pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have spent decades building their lives and families here," Schulte said.FWD.us represents top IT companies from Silicon Valley.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described it as a hopeful and historic day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-introduces-ambitious-immigration-bill-in-congress-indian-it-professionals-to-be-benefited-101613716185043.html

IPO Chairman Mujeeb Ahmed Khan also attended the meeting, the Dawn newspaper reported on Friday.An official announcement said that during the meeting, GI registration of products from various regions of Pakistan was discussed. The move aims to curb unauthorised use of Pakistan’s GI by other countries.Pink Himalayan salt is said to be loaded with minerals that are beneficial to health.Pakistan is fighting a case in the 27-member European Union against India's move to get Basmati rice registered as its product.“We decided that, after registration of rice, pink salt from the Salt Range mountains of Pakistan will be registered as GI,” the adviser said, adding that this will encourage and motivate our producers to expand their business at a global level.For this, a registrant would be designated with the approval of the Cabinet. Similarly, a list of other products on a priority basis will be pursued.“We urge our business community to identify and inform IPO of other products that can be registered as GI in order to protect them for realising their export potential,”Dawood said.The commerce adviser expressed satisfaction at the progress made and reiterated the importance of GI registration for various products.The registration of GI products will serve as a potential economic tool to promote and enhance national and international trade of Pakistan.Speedy registration will protect GIs of Pakistan and eradicate the possibility of violation of these products, the adviser said.He further advised the commerce ministry to double its efforts for registration of potential products as GI on a priority basis, it said.In January, Pakistan received the GI tag for its Basmati, paving the way for creating a local registry for the particular strain of rice and making a case in the international market, as the country fights a case in the EU against India's move to get Basmati rice registered as its product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-basmati-pakistan-all-set-to-register-himalayan-pink-salt-for-gi-tag-101613716226035.html

China has a history of testing new policies in a few areas and then rolling them out nationwide if successful.China’s population is aging more quickly than most of the world’s developed economies due to decades of family planning aimed at halting population growth. Even with the loosening of those policies in recent years the birthrate has continued to decline, dropping in 2019 to the lowest level since at least 1949.It likely continued to fall in 2020, with the number of newborn babies registered with the police dropping by about 15%. Full data will be released in April.The news helped boost the share prices of related companies Friday, with formula maker Beingmate Co., maternity and children’s supplies retailer Shanghai Aiyingshi Co. and toy manufacturer Goldlok Holdings Guangdong Co. up by their 10% daily limit. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was little changed as of 1:50 p.m.The Communist Party has already signaled its willingness to further relax birth restrictions during the 14th Five-Year Plan period that starts this year, urging an “inclusive” birth policy at a Party conclave held in late October.The northeast provinces have some of the country’s lowest birthrates, and the commission said they can conduct research on how lifting birth restrictions would impact the local economy and social stability. However, the statement noted that the desire to have children is low in the region despite the current relatively loose restrictions.“Socioeconomic factors have become an important factor affecting births, especially economic burdens, infant and child care, and female career development,” according to the statement, which called for improved public services and steps to address the concerns families have about raising children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-population-ageing-fast-may-lift-birth-restrictions-in-some-regions-101613715753819.html
19-02-2021||World||Massive breach fuels calls for US action on cybersecurity||Jolted by a sweeping hack that may have revealed government and corporate secrets to Russia, U.S. officials are scrambling to reinforce the nation’s cyber defenses and recognizing that an agency created two years ago to protect America’s networks and infrastructure lacks the money, tools and authority to counter such sophisticated threats.The breach, which hijacked widely used software from Texas-based SolarWinds Inc., has exposed the profound vulnerability of civilian government networks and the limitations of efforts to detect threats.It's also likely to unleash a wave of spending on technology modernization and cybersecurity.“It’s really highlighted the investments we need to make in cybersecurity to have the visibility to block these attacks in the future,” Anne Neuberger, the newly appointed deputy national security adviser for cyber and emergency technology said Wednesday at a White House briefing.The reaction reflects the severity of a hack that was disclosed only in December. The hackers, as yet unidentified but described by officials as “likely Russian,” had unfettered access to the data and email of at least nine U.S. government agencies and about 100 private companies, with the full extent of the compromise still unknown. And while this incident appeared to be aimed at stealing information, it heightened fears that future hackers could damage critical infrastructure, like electrical grids or water systems.President Joe Biden plans to release an executive order soon that Neuberger said will include about eight measures intended to address security gaps exposed by the hack. The administration has also proposed expanding by 30% the budget of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, or CISA, a little-known entity now under intense scrutiny because of the SolarWinds breach.Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for expanding the size and role of the agency, a component of the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in November 2018 amid a sense that U.S. adversaries were increasingly targeting civilian government and corporate networks as well as the “critical” infrastructure, such as the energy grid that is increasingly vulnerable in a wired world.Speaking at a recent hearing on cybersecurity, Rep. John Katko, a Republican from New York, urged his colleagues to quickly "find a legislative vehicle to give CISA the resources it needs to fully respond and protect us.”Biden’s Covid-19 relief package called for $690 billion more for CISA, as well as providing the agency with $9 billion to modernize IT across the government in partnership with the General Services Administration.That has been pulled from the latest version of the bill because some members didn’t see a connection to the pandemic. But Rep. Jim Langevin, co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said additional funding for CISA is likely to reemerge with bipartisan support in upcoming legislation, perhaps an infrastructure bill.“Our cyber infrastructure is every bit as important as our roads and bridges,” Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, said in an interview. “It’s important to our economy. It’s important to protecting human life, and we need to make sure we have a modern and resilient cyber infrastructure.”CISA operates a threat-detection system known as “Einstein" that was unable to detect the SolarWinds breach. Brandon Wales, CISA's acting director, said that was because the breach was hidden in a legitimate software update from SolarWinds to its customers. After it was able to identify the malicious activity, the system was able to scan federal networks and identify some government victims. “It was designed to work in concert with other security programs inside the agencies,” he said.The former head of CISA, Christopher Krebs, told the House Homeland Security Committee this month that the U.S. should increase support to the agency, in part so it can issue grants to state and local governments to improve their cybersecurity and accelerate IT modernization across the federal government, which is part of the Biden proposal.“Are we going to stop every attack? No. But we can take care of the most common risks and make the bad guys work that much harder and limit their success,” said Krebs, who was ousted by then-President Donald Trump after the election and now co-owns a consulting company whose clients include SolarWinds.The breach was discovered in early December by the private security firm FireEye, a cause of concern for some officials.“It was pretty alarming that we found out about it through a private company as opposed to our being able to detect it ourselves to begin with,” Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said at her January confirmation hearing.Right after the hack was announced, the Treasury Department bypassed its normal competitive contracting process to hire the private security firm CrowdStrike, U.S. contract records show. The department declined to comment. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has said that dozens of email accounts of top officials at the agency were hacked.The Social Security Administration hired FireEye to do an independent forensic analysis of its network logs. The agency had a “backdoor code” installed like other SolarWinds customers, but “there were no indicators suggesting we were targeted or that a future attack occurred beyond the initial software installation,” spokesperson Mark Hinkle said.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the hack has highlighted several failures at the federal level but not necessarily a lack of expertise by public sector employees. Still, “I doubt we will ever have all the capacity we’d need in-house,” he said.There have been some new cybersecurity measures taken in recent months. In the defense policy bill that passed in January, lawmakers created a national director of cybersecurity, replacing a position at the White House that had been cut under Trump, and granted CISA the power to issue administrative subpoenas as part of its efforts to identify vulnerable systems and notify operators.The legislation also granted CISA increased authority to hunt for threats across the networks of civilian government agencies, something Langevin said they were only previously able to do when invited.“In practical terms, what that meant is they weren’t invited in because no department or agency wants to look bad,” he said. “So you know what was happening? Everyone was sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that cyberthreats were going to go away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-breach-fuels-calls-for-us-action-on-cybersecurity-101613715625967.html
19-02-2021||World||Joe Biden's immigration agenda takes shape as bill unveiled||President Joe Biden’s proposed immigration overhaul was introduced in Congress on Thursday, kicking off what will likely be one of his most difficult legislative challenges.The legislation, known as the US Citizenship Act of 2021, hews closely to the outline that Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office. The proposal includes an eight-year path to citizenship for most of the roughly 11 million immigrants living illegally in the US, bolsters the nation’s refugee and asylum systems and calls for additional technology to be used to help secure the southern border.The citizenship path is not conditional on the implementation of border security measures, which had been a trade-off included in past immigration bills designed to earn Republican support.Representative Linda Sánchez, a California Democrat, sponsored the bill in the House and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez is its chief sponsor in the Senate.Previous attempts to reform the nation’s immigration system have failed over the past two decades, and Biden’s bill could face an even more daunting path because GOP lawmakers’ opposition to legalizing undocumented immigrants, which they decry as amnesty, hardened during the Trump era.The White House previously signaled it is open to breaking the package into pieces and presenting them separately in order to win over at least some Republicans. Biden said in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday that smaller measures could help fix the system “in the meantime.”Yet his team plans to defer to leaders in the House and Senate on the best path forward, including whether to try to use a procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass it with only Democratic votes while building support for broader legislation. The Democrats are employing the reconciliation process to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Menendez said Thursday during a virtual press conference that it’s time to go big on an immigration overhaul after calling former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies “a cornerstone of Trump’s hateful horror show.”“It’s time to bring all 11 million undocumented out of the shadows,” he said, calling them essential workers who should not be left behind by piecemeal efforts. “We are not going to make concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with 2 million.”Menendez said lawmakers won’t know if they can get 60 votes in the Senate until they try, which would be necessary to vote on the bill without using the reconciliation process.“We will never win an argument we don’t have the courage to make,” he said.Menendez said some Republicans want portions of the package — like provisions for farm workers or tech workers — but he made clear he wants a broad path to citizenship in return. It’s possible portions of the package could eventually move separately, including in a second budget reconciliation bill Democrats are planning on later this year, which would not need Republican votes, the senator said.Menendez said there is a strong argument to be made that some provisions should be eligible because immigration has substantial budget impacts. Senate rules restrict what kinds of provisions can be included in a bill moving through reconciliation.“We are not foreclosing any pathway,” Menendez said.Several other bills could serve as vehicles to move parts of the Biden plan.A bipartisan group of lawmakers has reintroduced the Dream Act, which would offer deportation protections and a citizenship path to immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the US as children. Democrats have also supported legislation that would offer immediate relief to farmworkers.Biden’s proposal makes Dreamers, farmworkers and migrants with Temporary Protected Status eligible to apply for permanent legal residence right away, which would allow them to apply for citizenship within three years. That faster path to citizenship is meant to signal that those groups are important, but it doesn’t mean the White House has decided to pursue piecemeal bills to protect them, an administration official said on Wednesday.Only immigrants who were in the country on or before Jan. 1, 2021 would be eligible for the legalization process.Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas is also introducing a bill that would offer permanent legal status to about 5 million undocumented immigrants who have worked in front-line jobs during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as so-called Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status.The Menendez-Sánchez bill would expand legal immigration for those seeking employment- and family-based visas by clearing backlogs of those waiting for green cards, lifting per-country visa caps, and exempting spouses and minor children from annual green card quotas. It includes a pilot program that creates 10,000 new visas for workers to help spur economic development in certain parts of the country.It also contains provisions designed to please labor unions, which have in the past complained that certain visa programs allow companies to employ lower-paid migrant workers instead of American citizens. The bill would tie green card levels to macroeconomic conditions and establish a commission on workplace conditions comprised of union officials, civil rights advocates and others, administration officials said.Biden has already signed a number of executive actions intended to roll back Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, including reversing a travel ban on some predominately Muslim nations, allowing certain asylum seekers to start entering the US while their cases are being processed and beginning the process of winding down Trump’s “public charge” rule, which sought to deny green cards to immigrants who used Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of government assistance.The president also ordered construction halted on Trump’s wall at the Mexican border. Biden's proclamation rescinded the national emergency that Trump declared to secure funding for the project.The current administration is facing pressure from business groups to end Trump’s bans on most work visas, which the former president put in place shortly after the pandemic hit the US. The White House has put the visa bans under review but has yet to revoke them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-immigration-agenda-takes-shape-as-bill-unveiled-101613713200725.html
19-02-2021||World||Covid-19: US President Joe Biden to commit $4bn to Covax that favours India||US President Joe Biden will announce on Friday a total contribution of $4 billion to the Covax facility, a programme backed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines around the world that his predecessor Donald Trump had spurned over his feud with the global health body.India is the largest beneficiary of Covax, clinching a deal earlier this month to receive 97.1 million of the 2 billion doses to be distributed under the programme, according to an agreement announced earlier in February. Covax is a collaboration involving the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Biden will announce the new contribution during a virtual meeting of the G7, according to a senior administration official.The first tranche of $2 billion will go to Gavi, the White House said in a note. The remaining $2 billion will be released over 2021 and 2022. The first lot of $500 million will be paid after initial donor pledges are fulfilled and first vaccine doses have been delivered.“In close cooperation with Gavi, this additional $2 billion in funding will serve to expand Covax’s reach,” the White House note said. “We also call on our G7 and other partners to work alongside Gavi, to bring in billions more in resources to support global Covid-19 vaccination, and to target urgent vaccine manufacturing, supply, and delivery needs.”Former US president Donald Trump had kept the United States out of this programme as he had fought with the WHO for what he had called partisan support of China’s misleading initial claims and statements about the origins of the coronavirus. Trump had terminated US funding for the WHO - as its biggest contributor – in the middle of the deadliest pandemic to hit the world in more than 100 years.It turned out to be a part of a pattern that defined his legacy - the US left Unesco, the Paris Agreement on climate, the Iran nuclear deal, and UN human rights council during his tenure.On his first day in office, Biden announced that the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement and the WHO. He has since vowed to return the US to the world stage and reclaim its leadership role that was forsaken by Trump as he had sought to pursue an America-first agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-president-joe-biden-to-commit-4bn-to-covax-that-favours-india-101613710607511.html

The 63-year-old Nazir is on trial at Sheffield Crown Court charged with a number of sexual offences."Nazir has denied two counts of attempting to rape a girl under 16, indecent assault of a boy under 14 and raping a boy under 16," the UK media report said.Besides Nazir, his two brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 70, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, are also accused of the "indecent assault" but are not fit to plead and face a trial of the facts.Reportedly, the allegations came to light in 2016 when a man and a woman contacted the police, more than 40 years after the alleged assaults took place. As things stand, the ongoing trial is expected to last three weeks after the defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.Also read| Rich nations stockpiling a billion more Covid-19 shots than needed: ReportIn November last year, Nazir had announced his retirement from the Upper House of the UK's Parliament amid charges of sexual misconduct. Nazir had resigned amid reports that a House of Lords Conduct Committee recommended that he should have been expelled."...Lord Ahmed breached the Code of Conduct by failing to act on his personal honour in the discharge of his parliamentary activities by agreeing to use his position as a member of the House to help a member of the public but then; sexually assaulting the complainant, lying to the complainant about his intentions to help her with a complaint to the Metropolitan Police regarding exploitation by a faith healer, exploiting the complainant emotionally and sexually despite knowing she was vulnerable," stated the committee's report.Though Nazir's tainted credentials are well known, the Pakistani media had covered up his ouster as voluntary retirement.Nazir is not new to controversies. The 63-year-old was born in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir but migrated to the UK as a child with his parents.

The government is raising surveillance against mutant varieties as they may be more resistant to vaccines, which Japan started to distribute this week."It may be more contagious than conventional strains, and if it continues to spread domestically, it could lead to a rapid rise in cases," Kato said.The new strain appears to have originated overseas but is different from other types that have been found sporadically in Japan, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. It has the E484K mutation on the spike protein of the virus that has been found in other variants, which may undermine the effectiveness of vaccines.Japan has reported 151 cases of variants from Britain, South Africa and Brazil, according to the health ministry. The nation has had more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 with 7,194 fatalities.Meanwhile, 5 staff and 39 foreign detainees at a Tokyo immigration facility have tested positive for Covid-19.All 130 detainees at the facility have been tested for the virus, according to a spokesperson for the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau. None of the cases is serious, and all infected detainees remain quarantined from others.The representative declined to comment on the nationality of the infected detainees, citing privacy concerns.Japan's detention system for immigration law violators and asylum seekers has been widely criticized for its medical standards, monitoring of detainees and response to emergencies."Many detainees are locked in a small, closed spaces," said Motoko Yamagishi, the head of a migrants-rights group.

19-02-2021||World||Oil rally may be just what Putin needs to keep Russians happy||Rising oil prices and a weak ruble could provide the Kremlin with as much as $33 billion in extra cash for social spending this year, giving Vladimir Putin the financial wherewithal to help head off growing public discontent.Thanks to a 25% price surge this year, Russia now receives more rubles per barrel of Brent crude than any time since mid-2019. If oil remains high, the windfall would be enough to allow the budget to receive an extra 2.3% of gross domestic product, according to Sova Capital in Moscow.“It’s very important to stimulate business and consumers whose disposable incomes were down last year,” said Artem Zaigrin, chief economist at Sova Capital in Moscow. “Without additional funding, there are risks that the economic recovery will fade.”Amid growing tensions with the West and fears of new sanctions, Putin has been reluctant to spend heavily in recent years, even during the pandemic. Stagnant living standards have helped fuel public anger at the Kremlin, which has boiled over into the biggest nationwide protests in years and poses a challenge for Putin’s ruling party in parliamentary elections this fall.So far, the Kremlin says it aims to stick with its earlier plan to cut spending this year and next, reversing most of the pandemic increase, in order to limit borrowing, as well as vulnerability to more Western sanctions on its debt. Any oil windfall usually goes straight to a rainy-day fund.But after a decade of stagnating incomes, pressure is growing to spend more money. Just last week, the Kremlin changed the rules so it can add expenditure to the budget without approval from parliament.Non-energy revenue was higher than expected last year after Russia experienced one of the smallest contractions of major economies, so there will also be leftover budget money to spend in 2021.It’s premature to start thinking about extra spending since it isn’t clear yet if oil prices will stay high, said Alexandra Suslina, a budget specialist at the Economic Expert Group, a Moscow think tank. “It seems like a populist move ahead of the elections,” she said.The Russian president may announce new spending measures at his annual address to the nation expected in the next few weeks. So far, however, his spokesman has denied reports of plans to announce more expenditures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-rally-may-be-just-what-putin-needs-to-keep-russians-happy-101613709173208.html

A colonel, who led them and seriously injured, was conferred with honorary title. pic.twitter.com/Io9Wk3pXaUChen Xiangrong was posthumously awarded the title of "Guardian of the Frontier Hero," while the other three men were also given first-class merit citations, Reuters added.Also read: In India-China border disengagement plan, Galwan model is the templateChina has also acknowledged that the colonel, who led the troops against India was seriously injured, has been conferred with honorary title, a report by Chinese state media People's Daily stated.ALSO WATCH | ‘PM Modi gave Indian territory to China’: Rahul Gandhi on LAC disengagement﻿India and China witnessed a prolonged border row that erupted in May last year and after their troops clashed in June in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. The clash happened along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) where rival soldiers were caught in a stand-off that began with a confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6.The soldiers were seen fighting each other with nail-studded clubs and stones. While India had previously stated that 20 of its soldiers died in the clash, Beijing had acknowledged casualties but had not disclosed details.India posthumously honoured five Indian Army soldiers, who blocked PLA aggression to capture territory in east Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 last year, with gallantry medals on Republic Day this year.In the seven-hour conflict along the Line of Actual Control, the first in more than five decades, Indian soldiers had retaliated in full measure when the Chinese troops refused to withdraw from a location near Patrolling Point 14 in line with the agreement reached between the two countries and triggered the clash. The PLA troops had come prepared with barbed wire sticks and spears.At its peak, the violent clash involved more than 600 rival soldiers with a majority of casualties on both sides due to hypothermia with the soldiers getting pushed out of the cliff into the freezing Galwan river.Also read | Face-off between India and China in Galwan valley: Here’s what we knowFrom the start of the skirmish, India had maintained that China tried to change the status quo as the PLA troops tried to transgress into Indian territory near the southern bank of Pangong Tso.

Disengagement between rival soldiers deployed on heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso began on February 10 and is nearing completion.While PLA has retreated to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, India is moving back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.In a statement in Parliament on February 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that structures built by both sides after April 2020 at heights on both banks of the lake will be removed.

"Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world," she added.The analysis found that, along with other Covid vaccine supplies procured by the global COVAX vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries.This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from Covid-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic.The World Health Organization on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global COVAX scheme to ensure fairness. The One Campaign report found that with current supply deals, Australia, Canada, US, UK and European states would be available to share Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-nations-stockpiling-a-billion-more-covid-19-shots-than-needed-report-101613695996589.html
19-02-2021||World||Joe Biden rolling out plan for $4 billion global Covid-19 vaccine effort||Joe Biden will use his first big presidential moment on the global stage at Friday's Group of Seven meeting of world leaders to announce that the US will soon begin releasing $4 billion for an international effort to bolster the purchase and distribution of coronavirus vaccine to poor nations, White House officials said.Biden will also encourage G-7 partners to make good on their pledges to COVAX, an initiative by the World Health Organization to improve access to vaccines, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview Biden's announcement.Former President Donald Trump declined to participate in the COVAX initiative because of its ties to WHO, the Geneva-based agency that Trump accused of covering up China's missteps in handling the virus at the start of the public health crisis. Trump pulled the US out of the WHO, but Biden moved quickly after his inauguration last month to rejoin and confirmed that the US would contribute to COVAX.The $4 billion in U.S. funding was approved by Congress in December and will be distributed through 2022.The US is committed to working through COVAX to ensure “equitable distribution of vaccines and funding globally,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.It remains to be seen how G-7 allies will take Biden's calls for greater international cooperation on vaccine distribution given that the U.S. refused to take part in the initiative under Trump and that there are growing calls for the Biden administration to distribute some US-manufactured vaccine supplies overseas.French President Emmanuel Macron, in an interview Thursday with the Financial Times, called on the US and European nations to allocate up to 5% of current vaccine supplies to developing countries — the kind of vaccine diplomacy that China and Russia have begun deploying.And earlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “ wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, noting 10 countries have administered 75% of all vaccinations.Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also raised with Biden the prospect of Canada getting the vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, according to a senior Canadian government official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.Canada has been getting all its Pfizer doses from a company facility in Puurs, Belgium, and has experienced disruptions in supply.But Biden, who announced last week that the US will have enough supply of the vaccine by the end of the summer to inoculate 300 million people, remains focused for now on making sure every American is inoculated, administration officials say.The president, in his first national security memorandum last month, called for his administration to develop a framework to donate surplus vaccines once there is a sufficient supply in the US.The COVAX program has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. WHO says COVAX needs $5 billion in 2021.Guterres said Wednesday that 130 countries have not received a single dose of the vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.”The Group of Seven industrialized nations are the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy. Friday's meeting of the G-7, the first of Biden's presidency, is being held virtually.In addition to discussing vaccine distribution, Biden also plans to use the meeting to discuss G-7 countries' collective competitiveness and economic challenges posed by China, according to the White House.Biden is also scheduled to deliver a virtual address to the Munich Security Conference on Friday before traveling to Michigan to visit Pfizer's vaccine manufacturing facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-rolling-out-plan-for-4-billion-global-covid-19-vaccine-effort-101613697370739.html

Researchers saw an 85% reduction of symptomatic Covid-19 between 15 and 28 days after they were given the vaccine.Overall infections, including among asymptomatic patients, were reduced by 75%.Pfizer in an emailed statement said it was looking at real world data from Israel and other locations to understand the impact of its vaccine against Covid-19 arising from emerging variants.The Lancet publication comes a day after Canadian researchers suggested that the second Pfizer dose be delayed given the high level of protection from the first shot in order to increase the number of people getting vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-in-israel-shows-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-85-effective-after-first-dose-the-lancet-101613696937878.html
19-02-2021||World||Australian news sites' traffic falls after Facebook blocks content: Report||Total web traffic to Australian news sites dropped by around 13% after Facebook Inc blocked their content on the social media platform this week, according to early data that underscores the outsize impact the US company has on the local market.The data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat showed that a pickup in traffic to news sites from Google was outweighed by a significant slump in traffic from Facebook."Unfortunately, Facebook's disappearance has resulted in a hit to publishers' traffic numbers: when Facebook traffic dropped off, overall Australian traffic did not shift to other platforms," a Chartbeat spokeswoman said.The Chartbeat data, which compared both domestic and foreign traffic to around 250 Australian news publishers on Wednesday before the ban to Thursday, provides some of the first tangible evidence of the impact of Facebook's move.The social media giant on Wednesday barred users from sharing or reading news from Australian publishers on its platform in protest of a looming law that will force it and Alphabet Inc's Google to pay publishers for content.Google and Facebook had campaigned together against the laws, which are expected to be passed by parliament within days, and both threatened to cancel services in Australia. Google, however, sealed pre-emptive deals with several media outlets in recent days.Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms used outside the country fell by about 30%, the Chartbeat data showed.Chartbeat said that the percentage of traffic in Australia to the news sites from Google Search rose from around 26% on the day before the ban to about 34% afterward, while traffic from Facebook fell from around 21% to about 2%.The analytics firm said that it counts Australian Broadcasting Corp and Australian Community Media among the publishers it works with, but could not say if any specific publishers were included in this data.The Chartbeat data also found that the percentage of traffic to news sites coming from Facebook outside of Australia fell from around 30% to about 4%, while Google Search grew from around 38% to about 52%.The Chartbeat spokeswoman said foreign readership of Australian news sites is driven heavily by Facebook, with historical data showing around 15% of visits to Australian publishers being driven by Facebook compared to 12% of visits to publishers globally.A 2020 University of Canberra study found 21% of Australians use social media as their primary news source and 39% of the population uses Facebook to receive news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-news-sites-traffic-falls-after-facebook-blocks-content-report-101613696619619.html
19-02-2021||World||Uber faces UK Supreme Court ruling on worker rights in gig economy test||Britain's Supreme Court will rule on Friday in a battle over workers' rights at taxi app Uber that could have ramifications for millions of people in the gig economy.In a case led by two drivers, a London employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks.The Silicon Valley-based company appealed the decision all the way to Britain's top court which will provide its verdict from 0945 GMT on Friday.Uber drivers are currently treated as self-employed, meaning that in law they are only afforded minimal protections.If the firm loses, it could still take several months for the details to be worked out following a further employment tribunal hearing, depending on the nature of the Supreme Court's decision."It would involve them working out exactly how many hours they worked, how much they got paid for those hours and identifying occasions when that meant that they were paid less than the minimum wage," Matt McDonald, a partner who specialises in employment disputes at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, told Reuters.Also read| Australia to hold talks with Facebook’s Zuckerberg after block"As an administrative job for the courts, it's a messy one," he said.A total of 25 drivers form part of an expanded group who are part of the case. Uber has around 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London, one of its most important markets.A win, however, would be a major boost to it and several transportation, delivery and courier companies which use a similar business model, including food service firm Deliveroo and taxi rival Addison Lee.The gig economy, where people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis, has faced criticism from unions who say it is exploitative whilst businesses cite flexibility as an advantage.Uber saw off a challenge in its home market of California in November when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-faces-uk-supreme-court-ruling-on-worker-rights-in-gig-economy-test-101613693279869.html
19-02-2021||World||Pakistan asks India to allow neutral international observers to visit J-K||Pakistan on Thursday urged India to let neutral international observers visit Kashmir and assess the situation on ground by free interaction with the Kashmiri people.Foreign Office Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri made the comments during the weekly briefing here.Envoys from several countries, including member states of the European Union and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) visited Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the ground situation in view of the efforts made to restore normalcy by strengthening democratically-elected local bodies.India has told Pakistan that it has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of India, asserting that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been and will remain an integral part of the country.Chaudhri said that India should allow UN observers, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the OIC Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission, and the international media to visit Kashmir and assess the situation on ground by free interaction with the Kashmiri people.Earlier this month, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said that India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.To a question about India prohibiting the Sikh Yatris to visit Pakistan for religious purposes, he said Pakistan provides maximum facilitation to the Sikh Yatris from all over the world, including India, for visiting their religious sites in Pakistan.“We believe that India should also facilitate Sikh Yatris for visiting their religious sites in Pakistan,” Chaudhri said.On Wednesday, India denied permission to around 600 Sikh pilgrims to visit Pakistan, citing the security and COVID-19 situation in the country.Chaudhri said that a workshop on “Exchange of Good Practices in tackling COVID Pandemic and the Way Forward” was organised for SAARC member countries plus Mauritius and Seychelles in a virtual format.“In line with its policy of enhanced regional and international cooperation in dealing with the pandemic, Pakistan is also participating in the said workshop and sharing its good practices with the regional countries,” he said.Responding to a question about Afghan peace process, the spokesperson said Pakistan desires that the developments made so far toward durable peace in Afghanistan should be preserved and built upon. He said all the stakeholders in Afghanistan should seize the opportunity of reaching a long-lasting peace.He said Head of Afghan Massoud Foundation, Ahmad Wali Massoud, along with his delegation, who arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, met Prime Minister Imran Khan who reiterated his longstanding position that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that a political solution is the only way forward.The Prime Minister also underscored that all Afghan parties must work for reduction in violence leading to a ceasefire and conveyed that Pakistan would support whatever the Afghans agreed upon about the future of their country.Chaudhri also said Prime Minister Khan is likely to visit Sri Lanka later this month. He said the two sides are currently working on the elements of the programme keeping in view the COVID-19 health related protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-asks-india-to-allow-neutral-international-observers-to-visit-jk-101613693978606.html
19-02-2021||World||US says it's ready to join talks to resume Iran nuclear deal||The Biden administration said Thursday it's ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the 2015 nuclear deal. It’s also reversed the Trump administration’s determination that all UN sanctions against Iran had been restored and eased stringent restrictions on the domestic US travel of Iranian diplomats posted to the United Nations.The State Department said the US would accept an invitation from the European Union to attend a meeting of the participants in the original agreement. The US has not participated in a meeting of those participants since former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.“The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran’s nuclear program,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.Such an invitation has not yet been issued but one is expected shortly, following discussions earlier Thursday between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his British, French and German counterparts.Also read| Some electricity restored in Texas, but water woes persistMeanwhile, at the United Nations, the administration notified the Security Council that it had withdrawn Trump's September 2020 invocation of the so-called “snapback” mechanism under which it maintained that all U.N sanctions against Iran had been re-imposed. That determination had been vigorously disputed by nearly all other UN members and had left the US isolated at the world body.In another move, officials said the administration has eased extremely strict limits on the travel of Iranian diplomats accredited to the United Nations. The Trump administration had imposed the severe restrictions, which essentially confined them to their UN mission and the UN headquarters building in New York.Earlier Thursday, Blinken and the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany and France urged Iran to allow continued United Nations nuclear inspections and stop nuclear activities that have no credible civilian use. They warned that Iran’s actions could threaten delicate efforts to bring the US back into the 2015 deal and end sanctions damaging Iran’s economy.Iran is “playing with fire,” said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who took part in the talks Thursday in Paris with his British and French counterparts. Blinken had joined via videoconference.Also read| Texas senator Ted Cruz says he went on vacation amid storm 'to be a good dad'Iran has said it will stop part of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities next week if the West doesn’t implement its own commitments under the 2015 deal. The accord has been unraveling since Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.Blinken reiterated that “if Iran comes back into strict compliance with its commitments ... the United States will do the same,” according to a joint statement after Thursday’s meeting that reflected closer trans-Atlantic positions on Iran since President Joe Biden took office.The diplomats noted “the dangerous nature of a decision to limit IAEA access, and urge Iran to consider the consequences of such grave action, particularly at this time of renewed diplomatic opportunity.”They said Iran’s decision to produce uranium enriched up to 20% and uranium metal has “no credible” civilian use.The 2015 accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran denies it is seeking such an arsenal.“We are the ones who have kept this agreement alive in recent years, and now it’s about supporting the United States in taking the road back into the agreement,” Maas told reporters in Paris.Also read| Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for news“The measures that have been taken in Tehran and may be taken in the coming days are anything but helpful. They endanger the Americans’ path back into this agreement. The more pressure that is exerted, the more politically difficult it will be to find a solution,” he said.Iran’s threats are “very worrying,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, stressing the need “to re-engage diplomatically in order to restrain Iran, but also bring it back into compliance.”The diplomats also expressed concern about human rights violations in Iran and its ballistic missile program.In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani expressed hope Thursday that the Biden administration will rejoin the accord and lift the US sanctions that Washington re-imposed under Trump, according to state television.Tehran has been using its violations of the nuclear deal to put pressure on the remaining signatories — France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset the crippling sanctions.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the president of the European Council spoke with Rouhani this week to try to end the diplomatic standoff. The head of the IAEA is scheduled to travel to Iran this weekend to find a solution that allows the agency to continue inspections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-it-s-ready-to-join-talks-to-resume-iran-nuclear-deal-101613692230124.html
19-02-2021||World||US President Biden to debut at G7 with vaccines, economy and China in focus||Joe Biden will attend his first meeting as US president with Group of Seven leaders on Friday to discuss plans to defeat the novel coronavirus, reopen the battered world economy and counter the challenge posed by China.The Covid-19 pandemic has killed 2.4 million people, tipped the global economy into its worst peacetime slump since the Great Depression and upended normal life for billions just as the West grapples with the rise of China.Biden "will focus on the global response to the pandemic, including vaccine production, distribution of supplies" and efforts to fight emerging infections, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday.He "will also discuss the global economic recovery, including the importance of all industrial countries maintaining economic support for the recovery" and "the importance of updating global roles to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China," Psaki said.The call with G7 leaders at 1400 GMT is a chance for Biden, a Democrat who took over from Republican former President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, to project a message of re-engagement with the world and with global institutions after four years of his predecessor's "America First" policies.Besides Biden, Italy's new prime minister, Mario Draghi, will be a new face at the leaders' virtual table, though he is famous for "doing whatever it takes" at the European Central Bank to save the euro during the European debt crisis.Britain, which holds the rotating chair of the G7 and is trying to recast itself as a steward of the rules-based international system following Brexit, will ask members to help speed up the development of future vaccines to 100 days.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to build ties with Biden who did not support Brexit and who, as a presidential candidate, last year publicly warned Britain against endangering peace in Ireland.Johnson has said he is interested in the idea of a global treaty on pandemics to ensure proper transparency after the novel coronavirus outbreak which originated in China.China will also be on the agenda.In his first major foreign policy speech as president, Biden cast China as the "most serious competitor" of the United States."We’ll confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance," Biden said on Feb. 4.The G7 of the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Canada has a combined gross domestic product of about $40 trillion - a little less than half of the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-debut-at-g7-with-vaccines-economy-and-china-in-focus-101613693150902.html
19-02-2021||World||Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for news||Canada vowed on Thursday to make Facebook Inc pay for news content, seeking allies in the media battle with tech giants and pledging not to back down if the social media platform shuts off the country's news as it did in Australia.Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Inc's Google to pay fees to Australian publishers for news links.Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months, condemned Facebook's action and said it would not deter Ottawa."Canada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are really among the first group of countries around the world that are doing this," he told reporters.Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of a potential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620 million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agree on a price through binding arbitration.Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content."We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate," he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content."I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties with Germany, with France?" he asked, saying that at some point Facebook's approach would become "totally unsustainable".University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializes in social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach."We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful," she said in a phone interview.This week, Facebook said news makes up less than 4% of content people see on the platform but contended that it helped Australian publishers generate about AU $407 million last year.Google has signed 500 deals worth around $1 billion over three years with publishers around the world for its new News Showcase service and is in talks with Canadian companies.Guilbeault said Google would still be subject to the new Canadian new law, since Ottawa wanted an approach that was fair, transparent and predictable."What's to say that Google - tomorrow, six months, a year from now - doesn't change its mind and says its doesn't want to do that any more?" he said.Lauren Skelly, a spokeswoman for Google in Canada, declined to comment on Guilbeault's remarks, saying the company did not know details of the legislation.Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said Canada should aspire to Google's approach, where companies put money into content that provided added value."If we follow the Australian model ... we'll find ourself in much the same spot," he said by phone. "Everybody loses. The media organizations lose ... Facebook loses."Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook in Canada, said there were "other options to support news in Canada that will more fairly benefit publishers of all sizes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-vows-to-be-next-country-to-go-after-facebook-to-pay-for-news-101613691987610.html
19-02-2021||World||Texas senator Ted Cruz says he went on vacation amid storm 'to be a good dad'||Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his family on vacation to Cancun, Mexico, this week as his home state was paralyzed by a deadly winter storm, drawing criticism from leaders in both parties and potentially damaging his political ambitions.In a statement on Thursday, the Republican senator said he was returning to Texas. He accompanied his family to Mexico a day earlier, he said, only after his daughters asked to go on a trip with friends, given that school was canceled for the week.“Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon,” Cruz wrote.“My staff and I are in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas,” he continued. “We want our power back, our water on, and our homes warm.”Cruz addressed his travels only hours after The Associated Press and other media outlets reported that he had traveled to Cancun on Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of Texans still grappling with the fallout of a winter storm that crippled the state's power grid and killed more than three dozen people, some while trying to keep warm.The statement did little to quell a fierce political backlash that comes as Cruz eyes a second presidential run in 2024. He was already one of the most villainized Republicans in Congress, having created adversaries across the political spectrum in a career defined by far-right policies and fights with the establishment.More recently, he emerged as a leader in former President Donald Trump's push to overturn the results of the November election. Billboards calling for his resignation stood along Texas highways earlier in the month.Even the state Republican Party chair declined to come to Cruz's defense on Thursday.“That’s something that he has to answer to his constituents about," Texas GOP Chair Allen West said when asked whether Cruz’s travel was appropriate while Texans are without power and water.“I’m here trying to take care of my family and look after my friends and others that are still without power,” West said. “That’s my focus.”Hundreds of thousands of people in Texas woke up Thursday to a fourth day without power, and a water crisis was unfolding after winter storms wreaked havoc on the state’s power grid and utilities.Texas officials ordered 7 million people — one-quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking the water, after days of record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and froze pipes.In Austin, some hospitals faced a loss in water pressure and, in some cases, heat.News of Cruz's absence quickly rippled across the state.Livia Trevino, a 24-year-old whose Austin home was still without water Thursday, said she felt abandoned by government leaders.“They are taking vacations and leaving the country, so they don’t have to deal with this, and we are freezing to death. We don’t have water and we don’t have food,” she said.In his statement, Cruz said that his family had lost heat and power as well.“This has been an infuriating week for Texans," he said.While the situation will not help Cruz's political future, the two-term senator is not in any immediate political danger. His current term expires in early 2025, and the unofficial beginning of the next Republican presidential primary election is two years away.Still, Democrats across Washington were eager to talk about the controversy.One of Cruz's most aggressive critics on the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, encouraged her supporters on Thursday to volunteer for a “welfare check phone bank” to help Texans affected by the storm.“So many elected leaders in Texas have failed their constituents,” the New York Democrat wrote in an email. “Instead of focusing on relief, they’ve chosen to go on Fox News to spread lies or to board a plane to Cancun.”Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki leaned into a question about Cruz's “whereabouts.”“I don’t have any updates on the exact location of Sen. Ted Cruz nor does anyone at the White House,” Psaki said, adding that President Joe Biden's administration is focused on “working directly with leadership in Texas and surrounding states on addressing the winter storm and the crisis at hand.”Cruz's office declined to answer specific questions about the family vacation, but his staff reached out to the Houston Police Department on Wednesday afternoon to say the senator would be arriving at the airport, according to department spokesperson Jodi Silva. She said officers “monitored his movements” while Cruz was at the airport.Silva could not say whether such requests are typical for Cruz’s travel or whether his staff had made a similar request for his return flight.U.S. Capitol Police officials and the Senate sergeant-at-arms have encouraged lawmakers and their staff to be conscious of potential threats and to consider advising law enforcement about their travel at airports and other transportation hubs.Cruz's office did not immediately say whether the senator would self-quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who have traveled to get a coronavirus test three to five days after their return and to quarantine for a full week, regardless of the test results.Cruz checked in for his return flight Thursday afternoon in Cancun and walked briskly through the terminal pulling a roller bag to security. He wore a golf shirt, jeans and a face mask in the style of the Texas state flag.The senator was accompanied by a Spanish-speaking man wearing a black polo shirt with the name and logo of The Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.Cruz told reporters that he planned to “go home and keep working to get the grid reopened, to get power restored, to get the water back on."“A lot of Texans are hurting and this crisis is frustrating. It’s frustrating for millions of Texans. It shouldn’t happen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-senator-ted-cruz-says-he-went-on-vacation-amid-storm-to-be-a-good-dad-101613691826765.html

19-02-2021||World||Australia to hold talks with Facebook’s Zuckerberg after block||Australia will hold talks with Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in a bid to break a legal standoff after the tech giant angered the government by blocking the nation’s news sharing on its platform.“We’ll see if there’s a pathway forward,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a Nine Network television interview on Friday, adding he would talk with the company’s chief later in the day after contacting Zuckerberg about his displeasure about Thursday’s “outrageous” block.Still, Frydenberg said the government will proceed with its controversial legislation that will force Facebook and Google to pay Australian publishers for news content -- the law is expected to pass parliament next week.Zuckerberg’s company switched off the main news source for almost one in five Australians and disabled a raft of government Facebook pages carrying public health advice on the coronavirus, warnings from the weather bureau and even the site of a children’s hospital.In contrast, Alphabet-owned Google -- which also opposes the law -- has negotiated a string of deals in the past week with media companies, in a bid to avoid the arbitration process enforced by the law.“There is a A$9 billion ($7 billion) online advertising market that is completely dominated by Google and Facebook, and we’re trying to create a level playing field,” Frydenberg said. “The rest of the world is watching us very closely.”In the U.K., conservative MP and chairman of the Commons media committee Julian Knight called Facebook’s block in Australia “bullying” and the “worst type of corporate culture,” according the the BBC. The U.K. News Media Association said the move showed stricter regulation might be required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-hold-talks-with-facebook-s-zuckerberg-after-block-101613688115343.html
19-02-2021||World||'Mr. Kitty' goes virtually to Washington over GameStop saga||The social media movement that made a beloved icon of GameStop enthusiast Keith Gill continued to rally behind the YouTube personality known as Roaring Kitty as he testified to Congress on Thursday about his role in last month’s stock market frenzy.“Today, the world shall know his name,” cheered one online fan on the social media website Reddit, superimposing a headshot of Gill over a boxer's body.The 34-year-old Gill became the most visible face of the GameStop rally largely because of his videos, where he wore a red headband and colorful, cat-themed T-shirts as he spent hours each week talking about the stock from the basement of his home in a suburb of Boston.For the virtual hearing of the House Committee on Financial Services, Gill wore a jacket and tie, although the headband could be seen hanging on a poster of a kitten with the words “Hang in There!” —- a crowd-pleasing reference to people still holding onto GameStop shares after its remarkable rollercoaster rise and fall.Gill reaped a big profit in the troubled video-game company after months talking about GameStop stock on his YouTube channel and on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, where he went by the pseudonym DFV, for ‘deep value’ plus an expletive.But on Thursday he rejected suggestions that he played a key role in the GameStop frenzy, arguing his social media conversations sharing analysis of company fundamentals were no different than what people do at bars, golf courses or with family members at home.“The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors and influence the market is preposterous,” Gill told lawmakers. “My posts did not cause the movement of billions of dollars into GameStop shares."But Gill did acknowledge that some investors jumped in too late. GameStop shares soared as high as $483 in January but have since fallen back, trading Thursday afternoon at around $45."It is tragic that some people lost money and my heart goes out to them,” Gill said.Gill's testimony won plaudits Thursday from WallStreetBets members on Reddit and the live-chatting service Discord.“DFV is pretty boss right now,” wrote a Discord user, responding to another who said: “DFV answering these questions straight. Only person I can bear to listen to.”Lawmakers on Thursday seemed far less interested in probing Gill than in other panelists representing Wall Street hedge funds and other bigger players. Some of the toughest questions went to the CEO of smartphone-based investment service Robinhood, which was widely criticized for restricting trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks for more than a day.But along with congressional scrutiny, Gill is now facing an investigative inquiry from a Massachusetts state regulator and a class-action lawsuit claiming he misrepresented himself as an amateur investor while convincing other investors to buy GameStop shares. Gill was registered as a broker-dealer and worked as a “financial wellness educational director” for insurance company MassMutual while he was sharing his thoughts on GameStop online.Gill emphasized to lawmakers his humble upbringing in Brockton, Massachusetts, where his father was a truck driver, his mother a nurse, and Gill was the first in his family to get a 4-year college degree but then struggled to keep steady work as he attempted a career in finance.He said he began analyzing stocks as a hobby and to supplement his income. He took to social media to trade tips and help work out his ideas with other individual investors about stocks like GameStop, a phenomenon he said is helping to level the playing field for smaller investors.“Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success," he wrote in prepared written remarks. “But the thing is, I felt that way in December far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit my family in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news — we were millionaires."Gill said he analyzed stocks on his own time and got curious about GameStop in June 2019, after it began trading at a deep discount after a poor quarterly earnings report. He bought call options and increased his position throughout 2019 and 2020, convinced that the stock price was “dramatically undervalued."With options, an investor can pay a few dollars for the right to buy a stock at a later date at a certain price. If the stock hits or surpasses that target, investors can reap a bigger return than if they simply bought a share.One Redditor going by the name Bruchtime27 penned an ode to Gill that began: “I love you man."“You did your homework for years, learning about the market and understanding what your strategy would be, all while talking care of your family and no doubt just being an all-around good dude through some incredibly difficult times since ‘08,” the user wrote.As they celebrated Gill, many commenters on Reddit and Discord launched profanity-ridden tirades against the other panelists testifying at the hearing, particularly Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mr-kitty-goes-virtually-to-washington-over-gamestop-saga-101613681957056.html

She accused Robinhood of providing investors poor execution and lost rebates, adding that that makes its popular app far from free.Tenev pushed back, arguing Robinhood’s platform has dramatically lowered the cost of trading for retail investors, something its been able to do by selling customers’ orders rather than charging commissions. He wouldn’t commit to sharing its proceeds from payment for order flow arrangements, adding that Robinhood needs to generate revenue because it’s a for-profit business.“Robinhood forced the entire industry to drop commissions and replicate our business model,” he said in an exchange that came five hours into the hearing.Ocasio-Cortez’s inquiry came just after her fellow Democrat and member of the so-called squad of progressives, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, said in a tense exchange with Citadel Founder Ken Griffin that taxing stock transactions would discourage dangerous speculation caused by high-frequency trading.Griffin disagreed, saying “a transaction tax will injure Americans hoping to save for retirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-questions-if-free-robinhood-trades-are-really-free-101613689790367.html
19-02-2021||World||Google revamps AI teams in wake of researcher’s departure||Google restructured its responsible artificial intelligence efforts to centralize teams under a single executive, Marian Croak, a move by the internet giant to stabilize groups working on ethics research and products after months of chaos.Croak, a vice president of engineering, will be the Lead for the Responsible AI Research and Engineering Center of Expertise, she said in a YouTube video announcing her appointment Thursday. The Alphabet Inc. unit has sought to defuse employee rancor stemming from the acrimonious departure of a prominent Black researcher, Timnit Gebru. Croak, a Black Google executive who is currently focused on site-reliability matters, will report to Jeff Dean, the senior vice president of Google AI.Croak acknowledged in the video that there’s a lot of “dissension” in the ethical AI realm right now, with researchers disagreeing on principles.“Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use?” she said. “There’s quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times. And what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.”Croak will oversee the Ethical AI team that’s become the focus of intense scrutiny as well as employees on other fairness teams. These include people working on machine learning, computer-vision systems, natural language processing and those who engineer fairness products, a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News, which was first to report the changes. Megan Kacholia, who attracted employee criticism after dismissing Gebru, will no longer oversee these researchers, the person said.Gebru responded to the news by writing on Twitter that Google was trying to “neutralize one Black woman with another.”The crisis began in early December when Gebru, who’s best known for showing how facial recognition algorithms are better at identifying White people than Black people, said she was fired by email. Google said it had accepted her resignation after a conflict over an AI research paper critical of its technology that Google executives demanded Gebru retract or remove Google authors from. Her dismissal upset the Ethical AI research team she co-led, with members of her group taking to Twitter to publicly support her and criticize Google.Two weeks later, a group of Google artificial intelligence researchers sent a sweeping list of demands to management calling for new policies and leadership changes. Five weeks ago, Google also sidelined the other leader of its AI ethics research team, Margaret Mitchell, locking her out of its corporate network.This isn’t the first time Google has turned to Croak to handle the issue. A few days after Gebru’s dismissal, Croak moderated a meeting of Dean and Kacholia on one side, and researchers and the Black Googlers Network on the other.“My biggest disappointment is with Marian Croak legitimizing this,” Gebru wrote on Twitter. “Starting with hosting Megan & Jeff’s gaslighting session.”(Updates with comments from Timnit Gebru starting in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-revamps-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure-101613689805325.html

The pandemic will only end when it’s eradicated across the world, they added.The U.S. has already ordered enough vaccines for at least 300 million adults, and at least 400 million if Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine wins approval for use in the coming weeks. Biden’s administration is considering how to donate surplus doses abroad but won’t do so until people in the U.S. have been widely vaccinated, the officials said.After the first $2 billion payment, an additional $500 million will be delivered when existing donor pledges are fulfilled and when recipient nations receive first doses, the officials said. The remaining $1.5 billion will depend on other countries making new pledges of their own, but the officials didn’t specify criteria.Covax allows countries, including wealthy ones, to tap into vaccine supplies. The U.S. isn’t planning to do so at this time, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-pledge-4-billion-to-vaccine-program-for-poorer-nations-101613688143338.html

"Today (we) begin the plan to serve those who are on the front lines" in the fight against coronavirus, said Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in televised comments."In the coming months, we will have more than 70% of the population vaccinated and we will achieve the so-called herd immunity," said the Health Minister Carlos Alvarado.Official figures as of Wednesday showed Venezuela has had a total of 134,319 Covid-19 cases and 1,297 related deaths. Medical experts and opposition leaders have said the figure is likely much higher.Venezuela has around 1 million health workers, according to medical organizations.They frequently complain of low wages and poor working conditions in public hospitals, which suffer from lack of water, power and medical supplies.At the Miguel Perez Carreno hospital in western Caracas, 150 nurses, or 90% of their total, did not show up to work on Thursday to protest salaries of only $3 per month, according to two sources familiar with the situation.The information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Rodriguez said that in the next two weeks, health personnel will be vaccinated in Caracas and nearby states of Miranda and La Guaira.As she spoke, state television showed images of a half dozen women in blue and green uniforms in hospitals receiving injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-begins-coronavirus-vaccination-for-health-professionals-101613682036039.html

In an interview with the Financial Times, Macron said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel supports the idea. He also said that sharing doses with African countries won’t delay domestic vaccination campaigns by “a single day.”Earlier on Thursday, Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO director-general, said that Macron’s efforts were encouraging, as previous offers to donate doses haven’t materialized yet.“There have been many challenges,” Aylward said at a press briefing, citing interruption in vaccine deliveries to countries interested in giving to Covax, which is led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he spoke to Macron last week about vaccines, including about the barriers to boosting production. In the FT interview, Macron described cheaper inoculations provided by Russia and China as contributing to a strategy by these countries to gain influence abroad.The French pledge comes as Macron’s government is being criticized by opponents at home for the slow start to its vaccine campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-donate-5-of-its-vaccine-doses-to-poorer-countries-101613682059124.html

Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate seat in 2022 as she settles into life after Washington.The former president's eldest daughter and ex-senior White House adviser spoke with Rubio several weeks ago and told him she would not be running for his seat, according to a Rubio campaign spokesperson. The two have also discussed appearing at a joint event.The conversation, first reported by The New York Times, comes a day after Donald Trump re-emerged after nearly a moth of self-imposed silence, conducting a series of interviews to commemorate the death of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. Trump would not comment on his political future in the interviews, saying it was too soon to talk about whether he will run again in 2024.But there is plenty of speculation that other Trumps may want to follow in his footsteps. Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, who served as a chief campaign surrogate, is still considering running for the Senate in North Carolina. And the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., remains deeply popular with his father's base.In a pair of friendly statements, Rubio and Ivanka Trump praised one another for their efforts together working on issues like paid family leave.“I am incredibly grateful to Ivanka for her friendship and support," said Rubio. “The challenges working moms and dads face in today’s economy are real, and Ivanka was a formidable and effective advocate for them.”“Marco has been a tremendous advocate for working families, a good personal friend, and I know he will continue to drive meaningful progress on issues we both care deeply about,” said Ivanka Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-tells-rubio-she-won-t-run-for-his-senate-seat-101613682131047.html

The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to bring these women back into the work force," Harris told the group.Attendees included House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Representative Barabara Lee and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.Harris has already been deeply involved in policy and diplomacy in the early weeks of President Joe Biden's administration. Earlier she met with Black Chambers of Commerce and Black mayors at a meeting convened by the African American Mayors Association to talk about Covid-19 relief, and this week held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron.Harris' meeting on Thursday occurred as Congress has more female members than ever before, with 27% of all seats, more than double the number in 2001. The vast majority of women lawmakers are Democrats, and a growing percentage of women have voted for Democrats in recent elections. Black women rallied behind Biden during critical turns in his 2020 presidential campaign.Murray said women are facing challenges with remote learning for children, so they must get them back into schools safely. "Women are leaving the work force because of this," she said.The meeting also included Melanie Campbell of the Black Women's Roundtable; Jen Earle, National Association of Women Business Owners; Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry and Tina Tchen, CEO of the anti-sexual harassment group Time's UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-taps-growing-political-power-of-women-lawmakers-promotes-covid-19-relief-101613682144048.html
19-02-2021||World||Almost a quarter of all freshwater fish species are in peril, thanks to humans||The 18,000 types of fish living in rivers make up a quarter of all vertebrate species. After two centuries of industrial development, 23% of them are now threatened with extinction, according to new research published today in the journal Science. Individual rivers face different challenges, from overfishing in the Mekong River to increased damming along the Amazon, said Sébastien Brosse, a freshwater ecology professor at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France. What this study does is quantify those challenges.The French and Chinese scientists who contributed to the paper classified fish populations based on six scientific criteria including species and ecosystem function, which they then used to calculate a novel biodiversity index score—a “holistic measure of multiple measures of biodiversity change”— expressing humans’ impact on life in 2,456 river basins. More than 86% of rivers have been either moderately or severely affected by industrialization, with the remaining 13%, approximately, concentrated in tropical Africa and Australia. That’s far below the target many environmental organizations have set for conserving 30% of natural habitats by 2030. “This study provides support to the growing realization that the world is facing a freshwater biodiversity crisis, and humans are the primary cause,” said Julian Olden, an ecology professor at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study. Overfishing, land use, redirected rivers, dams, soil and water pollution, and climate change have all contributed to the decline or extinction of native fish, as well as the rise of invasive species. That would be concern enough, the authors write. But the damage may impact the larger ecosystems that support much broader swaths of life and human industry. “Freshwater ecosystems are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet,” said Michele Thieme, lead freshwater scientist at World Wildlife Fund, who wasn’t a part of the study, “and we must protect them for the variety of services that they provide to nature and people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-a-quarter-of-all-freshwater-fish-species-are-in-peril-thanks-to-humans-101613682153040.html
19-02-2021||World||NASA confirms Perseverance spacecraft entered Mars atmosphere||NASA confirmed Thursday that the Mars 2020 spacecraft carrying the Perseverance rover had entered the Red Planet's atmosphere."We have confirmation of entry interface" said operations lead Swati Mohan.The risky, autonomously guided landing phase lasts about seven minutes, and it takes more than 11 minutes for a radio signal to reach Earth.That means the rover is already on the surface, but it is not yet known whether it crashed or landed successfully.The vessel careened into the Martian atmosphere at 12,500 miles (20,000 kilometers) per hour, protected by its heat shield.It was then expected to deploy a supersonic parachute the size of a Little League field, before firing up an eight-engined jetpack to slow its descent even further, before eventually lowering the rover carefully to the ground on a set of cables.The landing site, measuring 4.8 miles by 4.1 miles (7.7 kilometers by 6.6 kilometers), places the rover at the site of an ancient river delta that could harbor signs of fossilized microbial life.NASA scientists will follow the progress of Perseverance's descent by listening for simple tones from the craft, and from data it relays to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.The crater is "absolutely treacherous for landing," Allen Chen, lead engineer for the landing stage said Thursday. "There's a cliff wall that's about 200 feet tall that runs right through the middle of the landing site."There are craters full of sand that if we landed in them we would not be able to drive out of. And there are there rocks to the east, actually all over the place, rock fields -- that would be a bad day for us if we were to land on them."Perseverance has new landing technologies up its sleeve to help it navigate the landing with greater precision, including the "Terrain Relative Navigation" that uses a special camera to identify surface features and compare them to an onboard map.Conditions are dynamic and there's always a chance no signals make it back -- but that doesn't necessarily mean landing failed, because the spacecraft is performing all its maneuvers by itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-confirms-perseverance-spacecraft-entered-mars-atmosphere-101613681871404.html
19-02-2021||World||Global uproar as Facebook blocks news in Australia||Facebook faced a worldwide backlash from publishers and politicians on Thursday after blocking news feeds in Australia in a surprise escalation of a dispute with the government over a law to require it to share revenue from news.Facebook wiped out pages from Australian state governments and charities as well as from domestic and international news organisations, three days before the launch of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme.Though the measure was limited to Australia, denunciations came from far afield, with politicians elsewhere describing it as an attempt to put pressure on governments that are considering similar measures around the world.Facebook’s actions “will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Big Tech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison wrote on his own Facebook page.The dispute centres on a planned Australian law that would require Facebook and Alphabet’s Google to reach commercial deals to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree a price through arbitration.Facebook said it had blocked a wide swathe of pages because the draft law did not clearly define news content. It said its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed, and it would restore pages that were taken down by mistake.“The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content,” a company spokesman said.The head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, Julian Knight, was among politicians abroad who thought the message was aimed far beyond Australia. “This bully boy action that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,” Knight said.“They’re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business. So, we’re all behind Australia.”News publishers saw Facebook’s tactics as evidence that the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, cannot be trusted as the gatekeeper for their industry. Henry Faure Walker, chairman of Britain’s News Media Association industry group, said banning news during a global pandemic was “a classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves.”The head of Germany’s BDZV news publishers’ association, Dietmar Wolff, said: “It is high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms.”Facebook shares traded down 1.5% on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-uproar-as-facebook-blocks-news-in-australia-101613672011674.html
