We need Trump-plus.”The South Carolina senator’s comments reflect the internal struggle facing the party after a minority of Republican senators sided with Democrats on Saturday and voted to convict Trump of inciting supporters to breach the Capitol, clash with police, and interfere with the certification of his election defeat by the Senate.Trump’s level of support among the GOP base will help determine his future role in the party. Graham said there’s no question Republicans need to work with Trump to win future elections and that he’ll be meeting him in Florida “next week.”“We can’t do it without him,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.”McConnell’s speech, in which the top Republican in the Senate denounced Trump as “practically and morally responsible” for the storming Capitol -- despite voting to acquit him on the impeachment charge -- was “an outlier” that will weigh on the party down the road, Graham said.“He got a load off his chest, obviously.” Graham said. “But unfortunately, he put a load on the back of Republicans. That speech you will see in 2022 campaigns.”Republicans who have crossed Trump, including House members who voted for his impeachment in January and the senators who joined Democrats in Saturday’s vote, have already met pushback from within the GOP.Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Richard Burr of North Carolina were both censured on Saturday by their state parties. Burr plans to retire from the Senate at the end of his term; Cassidy was re-elected in November and won’t face voters again until 2026.“I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said Saturday in a tweet.In another sign that Trump’s influence could live on, Graham predicted the former president’s daughter in law, Lara Trump, could run for Burr’s Senate seat in 2022.“I think she represents the future of the Republican Party,” Graham said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-alive-and-well-as-republican-party-force-says-lindsey-graham-101613324499020.html

However, the White House has expressed its deep concerns about the probe, saying the findings must be free from intervention by the Chinese government.The WHO appeared to back away from an outright rejection of the lab-leak theory on Friday. All avenues of research remain open, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing. In an interview with Face the Nation/CBS News broadcast on Sunday, Johnson said it’s vital to get to bottom of how the pandemic originated.“Was it in a - in a wet market? Did it come from the bats? Were the bats associated with the - the pangolins? All these questions are now matters of speculation,” he said. “We need to see the data. We need to see all the evidence. So I thoroughly support what President Biden has said about that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-thoroughly-supports-biden-over-call-for-china-to-release-covid-19-data-101613320941234.html

Walensky also said vaccinating teachers should be a priority.While the guidance did not mandate reopening, it said that schools should open “as safely and as quickly as possible,” weighing in on a prickly debate over how to educate children amid the coronavirus crisis that has often put teachers and local school districts at odds.“Our guidance is really dependent on how much disease is in the community,” since most transmission within schools is from staff-to-staff contact and when mask-wearing requirements are breached, Walensky said on NBC.In recent weeks, the pace of vaccinations has picked up in the US, with about 11% of the population having received the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-let-down-guard-on-virus-cdc-head-warns-amid-lethal-covid-19-strain-101613318770735.html
14-02-2021||World||Doctors who say no to opioid use face threats from patients||One patient threatened to shoot Dr. Terry Hunt if physical therapy didn't relieve his pain as effectively as opioids did. Another harassed his staff, then roamed a hospital searching for Hunt after being told he would be weaned off painkillers he had used inappropriately.Hunt was unharmed, but shaken enough to ask the central Illinois hospital system where he worked to dismiss both patients.So when he heard about Tuesday's attack at a medical clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, that left one person dead and four injured, “the first thing I assumed is that it was something to do with pain medication,” said Hunt, who now works for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and a Mayo Clinic Health System facility in Red Wing, Minnesota. “It makes us ask about our own workplace: How secure are we?”Authorities said Gregory Paul Ulrich, 67, was angry about his medical treatment before he shot five workers and detonated three apparent pipe bombs at an Allina Health clinic. A police report says he had threatened a similar mass shooting in 2018, allegedly as revenge against people who he said “tortured” him with back surgeries and prescribed medication.A former roommate said Ulrich became upset when a doctor stopped prescribing painkillers, and that Ulrich also used other drugs and had untreated mental health issues. Law enforcement and the health system have not addressed the specifics of Ulrich’s treatment or medications.Doctors who treat pain say threats of violence escalated markedly in recent years as mounting legal and regulatory pressure stemming from the deadly opioid epidemic led many to prescribe alternatives and taper their patients off addictive painkillers.While some patients benefit from careful use of opioids, and doctors don't want to stigmatize them, many would be better off treating pain with other therapies, experts say. But many become addicted to the drugs that are usually intended for short-term use following surgeries.“It hijacks their brain,” said Dr. Carrie DeLone, regional medical director at Penn State Health Community Medical Group. “They don't see themselves as having a problem.”Pain specialist Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a professor at Braindeis University and a founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said patients are convinced that opioids are treating their underlying problem because if they try to go without a dose or as their previous dose wears off, “they’re feeling horrible, agonizing pain,” when it can be the withdrawal that is causing pain hypersensitivity.“It’s much easier to give the patient what they want. You write the prescription ... they walk out the door happy and there are no problems. To try and help a patient taper down ... is much harder,” Kolodny said.And when a doctor says no, things can turn ugly.“We’ve had patients waiting for doctors in parking lots to harass them. We’ve had them say ‘We’re going to shoot you’ or ‘We’re going to burn your house down,’” DeLone said.Almost half of pain specialists surveyed during a violence education session at a 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine meeting cited opioid management as the reason they had been threatened, said Dr. W. Michael Hooten, president-elect of the organization.In response to threats, doctors have dismissed patients. But they have also installed alarm systems and panic buttons and set up exams rooms so doctors are closest to the door. Some even advocate carrying weapons, said Hooten, noting that smaller clinics are at greatest risk because they might not be able to afford security.After his 2018 threat, police took Ulrich for a mental health evaluation, and Allina took legal action to bar him from the company’s property. A restraining order prohibited Ulrich from contact with the doctor or going into the clinic and nearby Allina-run Buffalo Hospital, where he once frightened a nurse so much that a colleague hit a panic button for help.Police said they had had no recent interactions with Ulrich that would have raised alarms before the attack in Buffalo, a small city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis.St. Joseph County, Indiana, Prosecutor Ken Cotter said he didn't know that such threats were common until 2017, when a man shot and killed a doctor who refused to prescribe opioids to his wife. Michael Jarvis ambushed Dr. Todd Graham in a parking lot hours after the appointment, said Cotter, adding there was evidence that Jarvis also was using opioids. Jarvis took his own life soon after.Before that, “I do not recall ever reading a threat report” from a doctor, said Cotter, who said he received calls from about 20 doctors after the shooting telling him how common they were. “They took (threats) as a cost of doing business.”Cotter said about a dozen meetings were held with doctors, law enforcement officials and others to discuss how to keep doctors safe, including deescalating tense situations, but also alternatives to opioids, disposal of old medications, and tackling the addiction problems that plague their communities.“When you've got doctors calling to say we have to do something, this is ... literally our whole community's crusade,” Cotter said.Kolodny, from Brandeis, said he has been compared to Hitler, threatened on Twitter, and a bag of nails was mailed to his home. Last month, protesters carried signs near his office demanding that he be fired because of his work advocating less opioid use and helping to sue opioid manufacturers.“The threats have “gotten really scary,” he said. “It’s just gotten really heated up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-who-say-no-to-opioid-use-face-threats-from-patients-101613317891641.html
14-02-2021||World||WHO’s Wuhan probe found signs of much wider Covid-19 outbreak in 2019: Report||The team of experts sent to China’s Wuhan to probe the origin of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reportedly discovered several signs of a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than it was reported earlier. In an interview with CNN, World Health Organization (WHO) expert Peter Ben Embarek said that the investigators are seeking access to hundreds of thousands of blood samples from the Chinese city that Beijing has not allowed them to examine.According to Embarek, the team also established that there were already over a dozen strains of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, circulating in December. “The virus was circulating widely in Wuhan in December, which is a new finding,” the head of the WHO-led team was quoted by the US media network as saying.In December 2019, the UN health agency had picked up a media report about a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause emerging in China’s Wuhan. The virus outbreak was later identified as a novel coronavirus and China shared its genetic sequence with the WHO in early January. However, many scientists studying the origin of Covid-19 had indicated that the virus may have been spreading in China long before it was officially reported.The Chinese scientists presented the visiting WHO team with 174 Covid-19 cases detected from in and around Wuhan in December 2019. The WHO food safety expert said the number suggests that the virus could have infected more than 1,000 people in Wuhan in that month, given around “15 per cent end up severe cases” that had been noticed by Chinese doctors but the “vast majority are mild cases.”Read | 'Deep concerns' about WHO Covid-19 report from China: White HouseDuring the interview, Embarek noted that broadening the type of genetic samples from early Covid-19 cases allowed them to examine partial genetic samples as well, instead of only the complete ones. He said that the scientists gathered 13 different genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019, which could provide significant clues about the origin and scale of the outbreak if they are able to examine it along with wider patient data from 2019.“Some of them are from the markets...some of them are not linked to the markets," the expert was quoted as saying by CNN.Over 108 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 2.4 million related deaths have been reported from across the globe, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University & Medicine. The United States remains the worst-hit country in terms of absolute numbers, with more than 27 million reported cases of coronavirus and over 484,000 related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whos-wuhan-probe-found-signs-of-much-wider-covid-19-outbreak-in-2019-report-101613315826615.html

14-02-2021||World||Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada killed in Pakistan ‘months ago’: Reports||Conflicting reports emerged on Sunday about the fate of Afghan Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, with a section of the Afghan media reporting that he was killed in a blast in Pakistan’s Balochistan province last year.However, senior Taliban leader Ahmadullah Wasiq described the reports of Akhundzada’s death as “false news and baseless rumours” and contended the Taliban chief was alive.If the reports of Akhundzada’s death are accurate, he will be the third Taliban chief after Mullah Omar and Mullah Akhtar Mansour to have died in Pakistan.Akhundzada was killed with Mullah Matiullah, the Taliban’s intelligence chief, and Hafiz Abdul Majeed, the group’s head of finance, in a blast at a safe house in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, “months ago”, Hasht-e-Subh newspaper reported, citing its sources.The house belonged to Majeed. While Akhundzada and Matiullah were killed almost instantly, Majeed died “two or three days later in a Pakistani military hospital”, the report said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the blast was believed to have occurred in April 2020. The people confirmed that the blast had occurred in a house belonging to Majeed. They added that some more senior Taliban leaders were believed to have been killed in the blast.Hours after the reports of Akhundzada’s death spread on Sunday, senior Taliban leader Ahmadullah Wasiq said on Twitter: “This is false news and baseless rumours have no truth. Spreading such rumours and false news is a failed propaganda attempt by the enemy's intelligence services. The enemy wants to hide its defeats in such rumours and distract the people’s minds.”There have been reports in the past of Akhundzada’s death that have proved to be inaccurate.However, it is not unknown for the Taliban to hide the death of its leaders. Mullah Omar’s death in Pakistan in 2013 was kept hidden from the public by the Taliban for about two years. The group confirmed the death in July 2015 only after Afghanistan’s spy agency went public with the development.Mullah Omar’s successor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, was killed in a US drone strike in Balochistan, in May 2016. Akhundzada was named the new head of the Taliban days later.Akhundzada’s brother Hafiz Ahmadullah was killed with three others in a blast at a mosque located 25 km from Quetta on August 16, 2019. Akhundzada’s son was injured in the incident. The mosque was frequented by Afghan Taliban members and Akhundzada himself used to lead prayers there, reports at the time had said.It is no secret that scores of top Afghan Taliban leaders are based in Pakistan. The top leadership council is called the “Quetta Shura” because most of its members are based in Quetta.During Taliban deputy leader Abdul Ghani Baradar’s visit to Pakistan in December, video footage emerged that showed him acknowledging that the group makes all decisions related to the Afghan peace talks after consulting its leadership and clerics’ council based in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-chief-haibatullah-akhundzada-killed-in-pakistan-months-ago-reports-101613312039343.html

We have to carry out a protest action that riot police can’t stop and that anyone can join.”President Vladimir Putin said he can understand why people support the recent rallies, according to his meeting with the chief editors of major media outlets broadcast on state television Sunday.“Irritation is growing, there are many problems, there is not enough money,” Putin said. He referred to Navalny only as a “figure” that was being used by Europe, the US and other countries to destabilize Russia.The flashmob, which organizers call “Love is more powerful than fear,” started in the Russian Far East, Volkov said in his Twitter post, showing a photo of a group of people with the lights on the Bering Island. Navalny’s team accounts posted similar photos from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and other Far East regions.Front RowNavalny himself only posted a photo with his wife, Yulia, on Instagram, with the message: “I love you. And all the jokes I make in the courts, I make only for you to laugh in the first row.”Russia has 11 time zones, so the event should reach the capital, Moscow, in several hours. The organizers didn’t have information on how many people took part in the flashmob so far.Riot police detained more than 11,000 when protesters took to the streets in dozens of cities on Jan. 23 and 31. The largest nationwide protests in a decade came after police detained Navalny when he returned to Moscow last month from Berlin, where he’d been recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security service. The Kremlin denies responsibility.The flashmob takes place as the European Union works on a proposal to sanction Russia over the imprisonment of Navalny, according to two people familiar with the discussions. A Moscow court jailed the opposition leader for two years and 8 months Feb. 2 for breaching probation terms from a 2014 fraud conviction while he was recovering in Germany.Navalny’s allies have urged the EU, the UK and the US to sanction 35 top Russian officials and business figures close to the Kremlin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Friday that Russia is ready to break off ties with the EU if the bloc imposes sanctions that damage the nation’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-opposition-holds-valentine-s-day-flashmob-protest-for-alexei-navalny-101613308651905.html

14-02-2021||World||In Trump’s acquittal, a historic rebuke by his own party||Former US president Donald Trump was on Saturday acquitted of inciting the January 6 Capitol riots but ended up being yet another “first in the history of the United States”, a phrase he remained fixated with during his four-year term. Trump’s impeachment trial was already a historic event as he was the first US president to face a second impeachment trial and the first former president ever to face an impeachment trial. However, these two firsts were achieved by Trump even before the Senate voted on the one article of impeachment - “Incitement of Insurrection”.In the previous impeachment trial, Trump administration was accused of withholding $400 million in military aid, approved by Congress and the Pentagon, to Ukraine and pressurising President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. On February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted from the charges and Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican member who voted to convict the president on one charge of "Abuse of Power”.Although the former president was once again acquitted by the Senate on the charges of “Incitement of Insurrection”, it was a historic rebuke of a president by his own party as seven Republican senators joined Democrats to convict Trump. The evenly split US Senate voted 57-43 in favour of the article of impeachment, falling 10 votes short of the two-thirds of the Senate required to convict the Republican leader.Read | Donald Trump indicates active public life after second impeachment acquittalThe seven Republicans, who joined all Democrats, and two independent senators to vote in favour of Trump’s conviction were Susan Collins, Patrick J Toomey, Richard Burr, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse, Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney. It was in sharp contrast with the past impeachment votes when the party rallied behind its president to help him acquit of all the charges.Apart from Trump, only two presidents, Andrew Johnson (1868) and Bill Clinton (1998), have faced impeachment trial in Senate. While Johnson, a Democrat, was acquitted with the help of seven Republicans voting against the conviction, all 45 Democrats rallied behind Clinton to acquit him of impeachment charges. In this context, Trump’s impeachment vote was the most bipartisan ever in favour of a president’s conviction and removal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-trump-s-acquittal-a-historic-rebuke-by-his-own-party-101613308045251.html
14-02-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to host virtual meeting of G7 leaders||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to host fellow G7 leaders for a virtual meeting on February 19 ahead of its presidency of a summit in June of the Group of Seven countries including the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US, Downing Street said on Sunday.The virtual meeting, the first hosted by Johnson as part of the UK’s G7 Presidency this year and the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, will bring together the world leaders to discuss how leading democracies can work together to ensure equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines around the world and prevent future pandemics.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the G7 Summit in Cornwall in June after India was invited as a guest country by the UK, alongside South Korea and Australia.“The solutions to the challenges we face – from the colossal mission to get vaccines to every single country, to the fight to reverse the damage done to our ecosystems and lead a sustainable recovery from coronavirus – lie in the discussions we have with our friends and partners around the world,” said Johnson.“Quantum leaps in science have given us the vaccines we need to end this pandemic for good. Now world governments have a responsibility to work together to put those vaccines to the best possible use. I hope 2021 will be remembered as the year humanity worked together like never before to defeat a common foe,” he said.The G7 leaders’ meeting on February 19 will be attended by the leaders of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US, and the Presidents of the European Council and the EU Commission.Downing Street said Johnson plans to use the virtual meeting, which will also be US President Joe Biden’s first major multilateral engagement, to call for leaders to work together on a “joined-up global approach” to pandemics that brings an end to the nationalist and divisive politics that marred the initial response to coronavirus.He will argue that putting citizens first should not come at the expense of working on a unified response, and that the last 12 months of the pandemic have showed that no country can be safe until every country is safe from the pandemic.The rollout of vaccines offers a fresh opportunity to demonstrate the value of international cooperation, he is expected to highlight.“International pandemic preparedness will be a major priority for the UK’s G7 Presidency and the Prime Minister will work with fellow G7 leaders to implement his five-point plan to prevent future pandemics announced at the UN General Assembly last year,” Downing Street said.The five-point plan includes a worldwide network of zoonotic research hubs, developing global manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines, the design of a global pandemic early warning system, the agreement of global protocols for a future health emergency and the reduction of trade barriers.There have already been positive steps to ensure equitable access to a coronavirus vaccine. Last month, the US announced it would join the COVAX initiative, becoming the final G7 country to do so.COVAX will provide developing countries with 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine this year and the UK is providing 548 million pounds to the scheme.Plans for the virtual meeting next week come as UK Chancellor of Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey held the first meeting of G7 Finance Ministers on Friday.During February, the UK also holds the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which rotates between members every month.The UK has said it will use its Presidency to galvanise international action on coronavirus, climate change and conflict.On February 23, the UK Prime Minister will chair a virtual meeting of the UNSC on the link between climate change and conflict, marking the first time a UK Prime Minister has chaired a Security Council session since 1992.The session will also involve permanent UNSC members China, France, Russia and the US; non-permanent members Estonia, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam; and the UN Secretary General.Downing Street has said that discussions at the meeting will inform crucial action ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit scheduled for Glasgow in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-host-virtual-meeting-of-g7-leaders-101613306295406.html

There, he’s the counterpart for outside groups and activists ready to hold the president accountable for his pledge to address the nation’s deep-seated racial divisions.Together with his promise to fight inequality across all policies, Biden campaigned on healing the nation’s political rifts and working across the aisle to restore civility in Washington. But many Republicans have rejected the president’s call to address racial disparities -- and even the notion that institutionalized racism exists -- setting up a potentially persistent conflict for Richmond to negotiate.“We’re listening to everybody and we’re going to take input, but that doesn’t mean that we’re going to compromise our values,” Richmond said in an interview. “I’ll just give you one old African proverb as a way to think about it: When two elephants fight only the grass suffers. And so we want to make sure that the people are not the grass -- that you have endless fighting and they never get help.”Biden has staked his presidency on bringing the coronavirus pandemic to heel and reinvigorating the U.S. economy after the crisis dealt a disproportionate blow to minorities.But aside from immediate relief, civil rights groups demand structural changes that would help address racial economic disparities and rights going forward. That includes passing a new voting rights law to expand ballot access, even as Republican legislatures attempt to enact measures that would tighten rules on voting -- moves that would disproportionately affect minority groups, their advocates say.“It’s important that President Biden has named racism as one of the crises that he must attack, along with Covid, along with the climate crisis and the economy,” said Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project National Office, a civil rights group. “And so our task, as the outside groups, is to make sure that they are being real on their commitment.”As the main conduit between Biden and outside liberal groups pushing to undo former President Donald Trump’s policies and advance a progressive agenda, Richmond will deal with issues ranging from unequal health care to police brutality. Other important administration figures on those issues, Dianis said, include Catherine Lhamon, who’s in charge of racial justice and equity on the Domestic Policy Council; Kristen Clarke, Biden’s nominee for assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division; and Vanita Gupta, his nominee as associate attorney general.“I might be what my dad used to call a jack of all trades, a master of none. In baseball terminology, more of a utility player,” said Richmond, a former college ballplayer who helped Democrats dominate Republicans in their annual charity game.‘Transformational President’Biden, Richmond recounted, “said over and over on the campaign trail that he wants to be a very transformational president, that he wants to empower groups that generally were not empowered. And he wants his legacy to be that of the most empowering president to ever govern.”Biden made significant moves in his first weeks in office, issuing directives to rescind Trump’s ban on diversity training for federal workers, prevent discrimination in housing and end the use of private prisons. The president has infused his pandemic response with measures to address the virus’s out-sized toll on Black and Brown Americans, and has outlined plans to invest $150 billion in minority-owned small businesses and increase spending for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Richmond said these early steps are a key signal to the public that Biden’s pledge to work toward equity was serious.“That is a big deal. That means we are looking for and watching and being intentional about equity throughout government. So that means advertising, procurement, that means education,” Richmond said in an interview. “But even within our Covid package and Covid response, so far we’ve done it through a lens of racial equity, too.”Richmond, 47, graduated from Morehouse College, a Historically Black College and University in Atlanta, before earning his law degree from Tulane University in New Orleans.He was first elected to Louisiana’s House of Representatives when he was 26 years old, and served for 11 years before being elected to the U.S. House in 2010. He chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2017 to 2019 -- a period characterized by deep racial strife as Trump’s divisive rhetoric helped fuel a resurgence of white supremacism.Under Richmond’s leadership, the caucus delivered a 125-page report to Trump rebutting his “what have you got to lose?” pitch to Black voters during his 2016 campaign. The report was titled: “We Have a Lot to Lose: Solutions to Advance Black Families in the 21st Century.”The group champions many of the issues on Biden’s agenda, such as criminal justice reform, eliminating health disparities and addressing the wealth gap. But Richmond can also help Biden reach across the aisle; as a lawmaker, he cultivated relationships with key Republicans including Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking GOP member in the House, who calls Richmond a “close friend.”Voting-Rights BattleRepublicans have already signaled that an uphill battle awaits Biden’s initiatives on race.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow a floor vote on the voting rights bill when his party controlled the chamber under Trump. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has taken issue with Biden’s plan to end systemic housing discrimination and boost home ownership in communities of color.“Is it ever appropriate for the government to treat people differently based on their race?” Cotton asked during a confirmation hearing for Marcia Fudge, Biden’s nominee for secretary for Housing and Urban Development.And Republican Senator Rand Paul said that Biden’s inaugural address, which focused heavily on inequality, amounted to an allegation that Republicans were racist.But Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist, said Biden and Richmond may be able to win “surprise” Republican votes on some equity measures. For example, he said former Alabama Senator Doug Jones, whom he previously worked for, cosponsored legislation with Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, on reviving cold cases from the Civil Rights era.In Richmond, Biden has “an astute politician” who can manage the challenge, said James Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.Clyburn -- who is largely credited with saving Biden’s faltering campaign when he endorsed him ahead of South Carolina’s Democratic primary -- was instrumental in introducing Biden to Richmond, leading to the prominent White House role. Clyburn is a powerful political figure among Black Americans and civil rights groups and said he expects Richmond to be involved in all major policy discussions at the White House.“He will make a very effective adviser to the president,” Clyburn said, cautioning Biden to heed Richmond’s counsel. “If he doesn’t, he’ll hear from me.”Biden has signaled he has no intention of defining Richmond’s role narrowly or limiting him to inequality issues. On February 5, for example, Richmond was part of an Oval Office meeting to discuss the pandemic relief package with House Democrats.Richmond is “a young man but a seasoned politician,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League and former mayor of New Orleans, who has known Biden’s aide since his political career began two decades ago.“The president needs him around the table on every big decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aide-cedric-richmond-feels-heat-from-all-sides-on-white-house-equality-vow-101613302210573.html

Another patient from the area was hospitalized in the capital, bringing the total number of potential cases to eight, the news site reported, citing the head of the National Health Security Agency, Sakoba Keita.World Health Organization Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a tweet Sunday it’s preparing to stem the outbreak.Guinea, the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, was at the epicenter of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.A nurse who fell ill in late January and was buried on Feb. 1 was identified as the first case in the country since then, according to Guineenews.Following the nurse’s funeral, eight people have tested positive and a ninth patient is awaiting results, according to a government official contacted Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-deaths-rise-to-four-in-guinea-as-disease-flares-again-101613301095628.html
14-02-2021||World||Saudi Arabia will continue to treat Houthis as terrorists: Saudi UN representative||Saudi Arabia will continue to treat Yemen's Houthis as a terrorist organisation despite a US decision to lift the designation on the group, according to the kingdom's permanent representative to the United Nations.There has been no other official response from Riyadh to the announcement on Friday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday that Washington would, effective Feb. 16, lift the terrorist group designation."Despite this, we will still deal with the Houthi militia as a terrorist organisation and address its threats with military action," Abdullah Al-Muallami, told Saudi-owned Asharq News in remarks retweeted by the kingdom's UN mission on Saturday.The Saudi government media office CIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on the decision.However, on Sunday several commentators at state-controlled media outlets criticised the US decision, saying it would only embolden the Iran-aligned Houthis, who have recently stepped up attacks against Saudi Arabia."A clear contradiction exists between the new administration's claim to support the kingdom's security and its soft approach with the Houthis," wrote Hamoud Abu Talib in Okaz newspaper on Sunday.Fellow columnist Fahim al-Hamid, also writing in Okaz, said the decision was a "gift" to the Houthis and Iran that "sends the wrong signals".The Houthis, battling a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015, last week claimed several drone attacks on southern Saudi Arabia. Most were intercepted but one hit a civilian airport on Wednesday.The White House condemned the attack, and Blinken held a phone call with his Saudi counterpart to discuss joint efforts towards bolstering Saudi defences and diplomacy to end the Yemen conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Biden's administration has said it would halt US support for the Saudi-backed military campaign but continue to pressure the Houthis, who control northern Yemen after ousting the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa.Riyadh accuses Iran of supplying arms and training to the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran.Describing lifting the designation as a "terrible mistake", Saudi columnist Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh wrote in Al Jazirah newspaper, that Biden should build on his predecessor's "maximum pressure" campaign on Tehran, which saw Washington re-impose sanctions on Iran after quitting a 2015 international nuclear pact. Riyadh backed that policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-will-continue-to-treat-houthis-as-terrorists-un-representative-101613299878603.html

Wahid Qatali said first responders were quickly overwhelmed Saturday by the huge, out-of-control fire. “When each cylinder was exploding it was flying 100s of meters high,” he told The Associated Press.Two explosions at the border crossing were powerful enough to be spotted from space by NASA satellites. One blast erupted around 1:10 p.m. Afghan time (0840 GMT), the next around a half-hour later at 1:42 p.m. local (0912 GMT).The United States allows Afghanistan to import fuel and oil from Iran as part of a special concession that exempts Kabul from US sanctions against Iran. Satellite photos taken Saturday before the explosion showed dozens of tankers parked at the border crossing.Qatali said officials were concerned that windy conditions Sunday could fan the flames and spread the fire to even more fuel-laden trucks in the area. He said the government was able to save more than 1,200 trucks.Herat's chamber of commerce and industries chief Younus Qazizada said the explosion and fire started when provincial customs employees were inspecting a gas tanker. But an investigation into the cause of the fire continued Sunday.“If the government would have invested the income of a single day of customs (tariffs) in the firefighting department this chaos wouldn't have happened,” Qazizada said.Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency reported an estimated USD 50 million loss of goods and consignments in the catastrophe. Qazizada estimated the losses were twice that much.Qatali, the provincial governor, said the investigative team will inspect video footage of the area but Wakel Ahmad Karokhi, a Herat provincial council member, said the customs facility was entirely consumed by the fire.The fire spread Saturday to the Dogharoon customs facilities on the Iranian side of the border and first responders — including the fire department, the Iranian army and border forces — were assisting in extinguishing the blaze, according to Iranian state television. The Afghan side of the border crossing has its own fire department, but officials in Herat said they were never in control of the blaze.Iran sent 15 firefighting units to the Afghanistan side to help.The Islam Qala border crossing is around 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the city of Herat and is a major transit route between Afghanistan and Iran.The Afghan government is working on an alternative to resume trade between the two countries, as Afghanistan is mostly dependent on imported goods from neighboring countries. Iran officials say that they will accelerate the custom process at other border crossings with Afghanistan.The fire continued to burn Sunday and the explosions shut down the power grid between Iran and Afghanistan, leaving Herat in the dark, said Wahidullah Tawhidi, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Power Supply.According to ISNA, Iranian authorities allowed 2,000 trucks to move into the Iranian side from Islam Qala to prevent further damage. Seven of the injured were transferred to hospitals inside Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-battle-afghan-iran-border-blaze-for-a-second-day-101613298068236.html
14-02-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup protesters keep pressure on junta||Vast numbers of people all over Myanmar flouted orders against demonstrations Sunday to march again in protest against the military takeover that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Large demonstrations were held in the major cities of Yangon, Mandalay and the capital, Naypyitaw, as well as in far-flung areas dominated by ethnic minorities.Protesters in Yangon again rallied outside the Chinese and U.S. embassies. They accuse Beijing of propping up the military regime and applaud Washington’s actions sanctioning the military.“The civil disobedience movement and demonstrations show that the people of Myanmar want democracy. We stand with them,” said a statement Saturday on the U.S. Embassy’s Twitter account.Other protesters carried signs urging people to boycott businesses linked to the military.Civil servants have been very active in the protests, and social media postings on Sunday indicated that state railway workers have joined them, with some unconfirmed claims that they have gone on strike.The military seized power on Feb. 1, detaining Suu Kyi and members of her government and preventing recently elected lawmakers from opening a new session of Parliament.The junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, said it was forced to step in because the government failed to properly investigate allegations of fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won in a landslide. The state election commission refuted that contention, saying there is no evidence to support it.Eight days of street demonstrations are estimated to have drawn hundreds of thousands of people to the streets despite the threat of six months' imprisonment for violating an order banning gatherings of five or more people. The same order imposes an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.Protesters also have reason to fear for their personal safety, as police have used rubber bullets to try to break up some demonstrations. A 19-year-old woman who was shot in the head with what experts said was live ammunition at a protest in Naypyitaw was on life support in a hospital and was not expected to recover.Tributes to the woman were held Sunday by protesters in Yangon and Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city.Public concern is also rising at what many charge is the military’s manipulation of criminals released from prison to carry out violence and instill panic.The government last week declared an amnesty that led to the release of more than 23,000 convicts. There are many claims on social media that some have been recruited by the authorities to carry out violent activities at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas have set up their own neighborhood watch groups in response.The truth of the allegations about government-directed thugs is difficult to verify, even with videos claiming to show their activities. There is historical precedent, as the military released convicts to carry out violence and cause chaos in 1988 during a failed popular uprising against a military dictatorship.There was already outrage at nighttime raids during the curfew period in which security personnel have tried to seize people from their homes.In several cases, neighbors and others people rushed to the scene in such numbers that security forces abandoned their attempts to haul in their targets. Videos of such raids were widely posted on social media.Detainees have included political leaders, government officials, civil servants, activists and student leaders. Medical personnel have been singled out because their community initiated the civil disobedience campaign against the military takeover and remains in its vanguard.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says 384 people have been detained since the coup, with 360 still being held. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest, but a remand order holding her on a minor charge of possessing unregistered imported walkie-talkies expires Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-protesters-keep-pressure-on-junta-101613298953809.html

The World Bank, which helped fund the first batch of doses, has said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need."I will not be receiving the vaccine today, for today is not my turn and the priority is for the medical sector that has done its duty and presented big sacrifices," caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters at the Rafik Hariri hospital, where Lebanon's first coronavirus case was quarantined about a year ago.Also read| New Zealand’s Auckland goes into three-day lockdownTizani, who is better known by his stage name Abou Salim, encouraged everyone to get the vaccine."For those who are afraid to get vaccinated, I swear by God, it is protection for them," he said.The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon's population of more than six million, which includes at least a million Syrian refugees.Lebanon has been under a 24-hour curfew for nearly a month, although the government began lifting some restrictions this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-starts-covid-19-vaccination-drive-pm-says-will-wait-for-his-turn-101613292599429.html

All have risen to the call of public service and have been key agents in shaping politics and policy from a local to global scale. Their leadership will impact generations to come, Indiaspora said in an email.“It is incredible to see over 200 leaders from 15 countries answer the call of seva and public service. They represent over 550 million constituents," Indiaspora Founder M R Rangaswami, a Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur and investor told PTI.The list will be unveiled on Monday, he said.“It is a huge source of pride to have the first woman and first person of colour as the Vice President of the world's oldest democracy be someone of Indian heritage,” said Rangaswami.“We wanted to use this seminal moment on President's Day to highlight a host of others in the diaspora who also are in public service,” he said.The Indiaspora list highlights the accomplishments of leaders of the Indian diaspora from across industries and sectors.“With each list, we pay tribute to leaders from a specific area, whether business, government, philanthropy, academics, or to the leaders of the next generation. Our aim is to bring greater awareness to the collective inspiration, influence and impact of our global community,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/list-of-global-indian-diaspora-members-holding-highest-positions-to-be-unveiled-101613294758328.html
14-02-2021||World||Indian fraudster sentenced to two years in US federal prison||A 32-year-old Indian national who played a key role in a telemarketing fraud scheme has been sentenced to two years in federal prison, the Department of Justice has said.Manish Kumar, was arrested by FBI agents on August 24, 2019, as he deplaned in New York City from a flight from India and ordered detention in federal custody. He pleaded guilty on November 5, 2020, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of wire fraud, and two counts of aggravated identity theft.He was sentenced on Thursday to 24 months in federal prison to be followed by three years supervised release, and to pay restitution in the amount of USD5,000.As part of the investigation, FBI was able to intercept some of the fraudulently obtained funds and return them directly to victims, making additional restitution unnecessary.Kumar previously admitted to the court that he directed telephone calls to call centers in India as part of a scheme to mislead individuals into believing that their computers were infected by malware, and to buy computer protection services from call center operators.The call centers perpetuated the falsehood that malware had been detected on the callers’ computer, convincing callers to provide payment information to purchase putative technical support services. No putative services were provided, federal prosecutors alleged.“As part of the scheme, those who had been misled, were later victimised again. Call center operators called back and told the victims that they were entitled to refunds. The operators would then mislead the victims into believing that they had accidentally been sent far in excess of the refund amounts and urged the victims to return the overage,” the Department of Justice said.“Because no funds had actually been sent to the victims, in “returning” the overage, the victims were actually parting with more of their own money,” it said, adding that Kumar admitted to providing money routing services for this component of the scheme.Kumar provided the call center operators with a bank account in the United States, where the victim money would be sent and then forwarded to Kumar and his coconspirators.Additionally, Kumar admitted that he had obtained information sufficient to place charges on thirty-seven credit card accounts of US residents and had taken steps to have fraudulent charges placed on those accounts, the Department of Justice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-fraudster-sentenced-to-two-years-in-us-federal-prison-101613293923671.html

Tokyo police said they couldn't comment on how many people attended the event.The march came as tens of thousands took to the streets of Myanmar on Sunday in a ninth straight day of protests. Several demonstrations have been held in Japan since the Feb. 1 coup, mainly by Myanmar residents of Japan.While the detention of elected leader Suu Kyi is currently due to end on Monday, the coup has been denounced by Western countries, with the United States announcing some sanctions on the ruling generals. While other countries also considering measures, Japan and some other Asian nations are unlikely to cut ties given Myanmar's strategic importance in the region.Also read| Myanmar army ask locals to report visitors as cops hunt for protesters"It is very heart-rending," said Thant Zaw Htun, 45, originally from Yangon and now an employee at a recruitment agency, referring to the protests in Myanmar."I want to go back to Myanmar to join them but cannot because of the situation (travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic). Instead, I join here today to do what I can do."While some carried portraits of Suu Kyi, others wore face masks and even earrings bearing Suu Kyi's image. Most remained silent rather than shout slogans as they marched in an effort to prevent spread of the coronavirus."As a Myanmar national, I absolutely cannot accept the military's coup in Myanmar," said Thwe Thwe Tun, 27, who works at a construction company."I think all Myanmar people in Japan have the same opinion."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-march-in-tokyo-to-protest-myanmar-coup-biggest-japan-demonstration-101613293232257.html

14-02-2021||World||Spain: Catalans to vote in test of separatist movement||Voting has started in Spain’s northeastern Catalonia on Sunday as 5.3 million voters are called to cast ballots in a regional election that will test the region’s secessionist movement.Salvador Illa, who was in charge of Spain’s coronavirus response as its health minister until last month, will lead the ticket of the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. Illa is hoping to end the hold pro-independence lawmakers have held in the regional parliament for the past decade.Polls, however, predict a tight race between the Socialists and the two leading pro-secession parties, the left-wing Republic Left of Catalonia and the center-right Together for Catalonia.The goal of separatists is to not only maintain their slim majority of the Catalan parliament based in Barcelona, but also try to break the 50% barrier of the popular vote for the first time.The wealthy region, with its own language spoken alongside Spanish, has been the source of Spain’s biggest political crisis in decades since separatists leaders failed in a 2017 secession bid in defiance of court warnings it was unconstitutional. Several of those leaders ended up in prison, while others fled to other European countries.With Spain still suffering from a post-Christmas spike in coronavirus infections, the vote is being held under strict health regulations. Voters must wear face masks, use the hand disinfectant provided at polling stations, and remain at least 1.5 meters apart while queuing.Those particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 are encouraged to vote between 9 a.m. and noon. The general population is supposed to vote from noon until 7 p.m. That leaves the final hour until polls close at 8 p.m. for voters who are either infected or quarantined due to recent contact with an infected person.Preliminary results are expected to start being announced by government officials around 10:00pm, but a record number of mail-in votes may mean the full results will take longer than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-catalans-to-vote-in-test-of-separatist-movement-101613291886719.html
14-02-2021||World||New Zealand’s Auckland goes into three-day lockdown||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a short lockdown for its largest city Auckland while authorities investigate three new cases of Covid-19 in the community.Auckland will enter a three-day lockdown at midnight, Ardern said at a news conference Sunday after an emergency Cabinet meeting. The alert level for the remainder of New Zealand will rise to 2, which requires social distancing and signals the risk of community transmission. Cabinet will meet again on Monday.“These new cases pose questions,” Ardern said. “We need to act with a high degree of caution” because they could be one of the more virulent strains, she said.It is the second regional lockdown in New Zealand since Aucklanders were asked to isolate at home for about three weeks in August. That outbreak was successfully contained and eliminated, and New Zealanders have enjoyed a summer free of any restrictions until now.Also read| Covid-19: Post-vaccine symptoms more common in young than elderly, says studyEarlier Sunday, the Ministry of Health reported three new cases of Covid-19 in a family from South Auckland -- a mother, father and daughter.

She is not involved in handling food for the company, he said.Auckland’s move to Alert Level 3 means people are asked to stay at home and work remotely if possible.

14-02-2021||World||Acquitted again by Senate, Trump still a powerful force in Republican politics||It is still Donald Trump's Republican Party - at least for now.The vote by 43 of the 50 Republican senators to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting last month's deadly riot at the US Capitol, with only seven voting for conviction, highlights just how powerful a grip he has on the party he remade in his image over the past five years.The former president, who has largely stayed out of sight at his Florida home since leaving the White House on January 20, commands fervent loyalty among his supporters, forcing most Republican politicians to pledge their fealty and fear his wrath.But after two impeachments, months of false claims that his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden was rigged, and an assault on the US Capitol by his supporters that left five people dead, Trump is also political poison in many of the swing districts that often decide American elections.That leaves Republicans in a precarious position as they try to forge a winning coalition in the 2022 elections for control of Congress and a 2024 White House race that might include Trump as a candidate."It's hard to imagine Republicans winning national elections without Trump supporters anytime soon," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and aide to Senator Marco Rubio during his 2016 presidential primary race against Trump."The party is facing a real Catch 22: it can't win with Trump but it's obvious it can't win without him either," he said.Trump has not signaled his long-range political plans for after the trial, although he has publicly hinted at another run for the White House and he is reportedly keen to help primary challengers to Republicans in Congress who voted to impeach or convict him."Whether he does run again is up to him, but he's still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message," one adviser said. "You can call it a kingmaker or whatever you want to call it."Trump has maintained strong support from Republicans in polls even since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.Just days after the riot, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found 70% of Republicans still approved of Trump's job performance, and a later poll found a similar percentage believed he should be allowed to run for office again.But outside his party he is unpopular. A new Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed that 71% of Americans believed Trump was at least partially responsible for starting the assault on the Capitol. Fifty percent believed he should be convicted in the Senate with 38% opposed and 12% unsure.Trump's defenders in the Senate argued that the trial was unconstitutional because Trump had already left office and that his remarks ahead of the riot were protected by the constitutional right to free speech. But a majority of senators including seven Republicans rejected that view.Democrats said many Republican senators were afraid to vote with their conscience to convict Trump out of fear of retribution from his supporters."If this vote was taken in secret, there would be a conviction," Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the Republicans who voted to acquit Trump on Saturday, though he later slammed the former president as "practically and morally responsible" for provoking the violence.His position illustrated how some Republican leaders are trying to distance themselves from Trump and limit his influence without triggering the full-blown fury of Trump and his supporters.Trump's continued sway was evident, however, in House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy's visit last month to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where they huddled on strategy for the 2022 congressional elections.That visit came just three weeks after McCarthy had enraged Trump by saying he bore responsibility for the Capitol riot. McCarthy later backtracked, saying he did not believe Trump provoked the assault.POLITICAL BACKLASHThe few lawmakers who have broken with Trump have suffered a stinging backlash.Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives and one of 10 who voted for Trump's impeachment, quickly faced an effort by conservatives to remove her from her leadership post. She survived it, but Trump has vowed to throw his support behind a primary challenger to her.In Arizona, which backed Biden and elected a Democratic senator in November, the state party censured three prominent Republicans who had clashed with Trump while he was in office - Governor Doug Ducey, former Senator Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, widow of the late Senator John McCain.When Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska was threatened with censure by his state party for criticizing Trump, he suggested it was down to a cult of personality."Let's be clear about why this is happening. It is because I still believe, as you used to, that politics isn't about the weird worship of one dude," Sasse said in a video addressed to the party leadership in Nebraska. He was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump on Saturday.The fissures have led to an open debate in conservative circles over how far right to lean. At Fox News, the cable news network that played a key role in Trump's rise to power, Fox Corp Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch this week told investors the outlet would stick to its "center right" position.Trump tore into the network after its early, and ultimately accurate, election-night projection that he lost in Arizona, presenting an opportunity for further-right video networks to draw disaffected Trump supporters."We don't need to go further right," Murdoch said. "We don't believe America is further right, and we're obviously not going to pivot left."Dozens of former Republican officials, disillusioned by the party's failure to stand up to Trump, have held talks to form a new center-right party, though multiple congressional Republicans rejected the idea.Advisers say Trump himself has talked about forming a breakaway Patriot Party, exacerbating Republican divisions.While Trump maintains control over the party for now, several Republican senators said during the impeachment trial that the stain left by the deadly siege of the Capitol and Trump's months of false claims about widespread election fraud would cripple his chances of winning power again in 2024."After the American public sees the whole story laid out here ... I don't see how Donald Trump could be reelected to the presidency again," Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who also voted for a conviction, told reporters during the trial.With Trump out of office and blocked from Twitter, his favorite means of communication, some Republicans said his hold on the party could fade as new issues and personalities emerge.Republican Senator John Cornyn, a Trump ally, said the former president's legacy had suffered permanent damage."Unfortunately, while President Trump did a lot of good, his handling of the post-election period is what he's going to be remembered for," Cornyn said. "And I think that's a tragedy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/acquitted-again-by-senate-trump-still-a-powerful-force-in-republican-politics-101613282709120.html
14-02-2021||World||Donald Trump indicates active public life after second impeachment acquittal||Donald Trump has told millions of his supporters that he is ready for yet another phase of active public life after the US Senate acquitted him in his second impeachment trial.Following four days of the impeachment trial, the 100-member Senate voted to impeach the former US president by 57-43 votes, 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction.Trump, a Republican, is the first-ever president to have been impeached twice and the first president to have faced impeachment after leaving office.Trump, 74, faced the charge of incitement of insurrection over the deadly January 6 assault of the US Capitol by his supporters.“Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people. There has never been anything like it!” Trump said in a statement.“We have so much work ahead of us, and soon we will emerge with a vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future,” Trump, who received 74 million votes in the November 3 presidential election, higher than that of any president before him.While Trump has remained quiet on his post-presidency life, speculation has been rife that he might run for the presidency in 2024 or encourage someone from his family to fight out a battle for the White House.There is also some talk that the former president might part ways with the Republican Party to form his own party. However, there has been no statement on this from Trump.“Our cherished Constitutional Republic was founded on the impartial rule of law, the indispensable safeguard for our liberties, our rights and our freedoms,” Trump said.After the end of his term on January 20, Trump flew to his resort in Palm Beach Florida, where he has been staying since then.Trump has been banned from almost all the major social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook.Meanwhile, several Republican leaders slammed the party's Senators who voted against Trump.Also Read: What's next for Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Joe Biden?The seven Senators are Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse and Pat Toomey.“The Louisiana GOP immediately censured Sen. Bill Cassidy, while state party officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania issued sharp statements expressing disappointment over the votes cast Saturday by Sens. Richard Burr and Pat Toomey,” Politico reported.“The moves are the latest in a series of censures and disciplinary actions doled out to lawmakers deemed to be critical of the former president in the wake of the Capitol riot,” it added.Republican Senator John Cornyn said that he had concerns about this snap impeachment from the start.“The arguments of the House Impeachment Managers that the Constitution permits the impeachment of a private citizen, the free speech protections of the First Amendment don’t apply, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is optional, and that the trial may include a presiding officer who also serves as a juror all were a bridge too far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-indicates-active-public-life-after-second-impeachment-acquittal-101613282948033.html
14-02-2021||World||Biden administration appoints two Indian-origin experts to key positions||Two Indian-origin experts in public service have been appointed by the Biden administration to key positions at AmeriCorps, the federal agency for volunteering and service.Sonali Nijhawan has been named Director of AmeriCorps State and National, and Sri Preston Kulkarni, 42, was appointed the new Chief of External Affairs.Though having run for Congress twice unsuccessfully in Texas, Kulkarni was certainly noticed by the leadership in Washington.Kulkarni’s appointment, along with Nijhawan and Dan Kohl, reflects “the Biden administration’s commitment to diverse leadership,” according to the release by AmeriCorps.In their roles, these leaders will use service to support the administration’s agenda, focusing on four of the most urgent challenges of our time: Covid-19, economic recovery, racial equity, and climate change, the AmeriCorps said.Kulkarni lost his race for the Texas District 22 seat in the US House of Representatives to former Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls in November as the Democratic nominee in a deeply Republican district.Kulkarni brings a variety of experience in service and public affairs to AmeriCorps, including 14 years as a foreign service officer with the State Department where he specialised in public diplomacy and worked in public affairs and international information programmes, completing tours in Taiwan, Russia, Iraq, Israel, Jamaica and Washington, the statement said.Nijhawan has committed her career to developing leaders and growing national service. Most recently, she developed and served as the executive director of Stockton Service Corps, a six-year, $12 million initiative to address local needs through AmeriCorps.Her professional background also includes extensive experience in education, AmeriCorps said in a press release.Inspired by the students, families, and AmeriCorps community she met, she went on to help found City Year Sacramento and launch the organisation's 22nd site with 50 new AmeriCorps members.Nijhawan also served as the California director of Education Pioneers where she recruited, placed, and supported managers in urban school systems and education nonprofits, empowering people to challenge the status quo of our public education system.She earned a bachelor's in education and psychology from Marquette University and a master's in social work from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-appoints-two-indian-origin-experts-to-key-positions-101613282197973.html
14-02-2021||World||Indo-Canadian groups seek action against attacks on them over farm law support||More than two dozen Indo-Canadian organisations have asked the Canadian minister of public safety to take action against “coordinated attacks” on the community for being perceived as pro-India or critical of the protests against India’s new farm laws.The letter was sent on Saturday to Bill Blair, the minister for public safety and emergency preparedness. It said it appeared that “separatist elements seeking to create ‘Khalistan’ are deeply embedded and engaged in the anti-legislation agitations in Canada and the attacks on Indo-Canadians has taken a sectarian turn.” Sent by the umbrella organisation, National Alliance of Indo-Canadians, the letter was signed by representatives of 28 community bodies.The letter added, “This is deeply troubling as Canada’s worst incident of terrorism, bombing of Air India flight 182, the Kanishka, also emerged from the Khalistan movement in the country. Even more problematic is how elements supporting separatism are indulging in Hinduphobia under the guise of protesting the Indian laws.” The bombing of the Kanishka in 1985 by Khalistani terrorists claimed 329 lives.The signatories sought “early and effective action” from Public Safety Canada and its departments, “reassure Hindu-Canadians, who are fearful of their future due to this recent phenomenon. We do not want a repeat of the Kanishka tragedy.”As reported by the Hindustan Times earlier, incidents of threats, including those of sexual violence against female members of families, have occurred in several parts of Canada including the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. Multiple police complaints have been filed by victims of these attacks.In one glaring instance, volunteers who helped organise a ‘Tiranga Rally’ in Vancouver earlier this month faced not just threatening calls but had protestors turning up outside their office.Nearly 350 cars participated in the rally from Surrey, a suburban city, to Vancouver, with several participants waving Indian national flags in front of the building housing the Indian Consulate.One of the volunteers was mentioned in a Hindustan Times report on the event and days later she, her husband and the immigration business they operate in Surrey, were targeted.The volunteer, who has requested that her name be withheld because of concerns over safety, said that threatening calls, of an abusive nature and at times, communal invective, commenced hours after the rally was held. “I’m scared,” she said, of these developments.Anti-India protestors have gathered in the parking lot outside the strip mall where the business of the couple is located. Khalistan flags were also visible in a video of the protest. They also said they have been cyberbullied and filed a complaint with the local Delta Police Department.The intimidation of the couple is the latest episode in a series of recent incidents in Canada, which includes threatening calls, visits to residences and businesses of those seen to be pro-India and critical of the ongoing agitation against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-groups-seek-action-against-attacks-on-them-over-farm-law-support-101613282321782.html
14-02-2021||World||Imran Khan tightens noose over NGOs to silence dissent||Tightening the noose around non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Pakistan to crush dissent, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday alleged that NGOs have been receiving foreign funds to promote the "enemy agenda" and are working against the state, reported DW News Agency.Activists and rights groups asserted that the crackdown on civil society organisations is part of the authorities' broader plan to silence dissent, reported DW News Agency.Local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have been under pressure in Pakistan for many years, but suppression under the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan has intensified as he ordered 18 foreign NGOs to close their operations and leave the country since 2018.Khan took up the issue of NGOs' foreign funding in a Cabinet meeting last month amid increasing concerns that his government is suppressing freedom of speech in the country."The way Khan's government banned several international NGOs and took measures to create problems for local NGOs is alarming. We have never experienced this situation before. The government also wants to control the media," said Mohammad Tahseen, Executive Director of the South Asia Partnership Pakistan organization, told DW.Meanwhile, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars negated the age-old allegations International NGOs are "essentially a front for intelligence operations.""In a country where foreign intelligence agencies, especially the CIA, have long made a mark, it's an easy narrative to sell. Many in Pakistan believe that Save the Children was involved in the CIA-sponsored fake vaccination campaign that helped track down Osama Bin Laden. Longstanding suspicion about foreign NGOs was heightened after the Bin Laden raid, and it has remained strong today," Kugelman told DW.Further, Tahseen lambasted Imran-government over the crackdown on NGOs and said, "It is easier for the government to target NGOs than to work for the welfare of the citizens. There is no evidence that NGOs are working against the country. NGOs are actually performing a very important role to enhance human development, fundamental rights and social justice in Pakistan."Moreover, political analyst Qamar Cheema pointed to the lack of trust between state authorities and civil society groups. "The state fears that these organizations might create national disorder. It hopes to manage the situation," he told DW.Conservative groups, state-influencers alleged that NGOs promote liberal values that go against the teachings of Islam.Regarding misuse of NGOs, Tahseen said, "NGOs are subject to multiple layers of scrutiny and clearances at different government levels before they can register and start their operations. It is unfair to accuse them of wrongdoings."Kugelman, taking the issue of foreign funding lambasted the Imran government and said, "There is a concern about how foreign money enters Pakistan, and how it is used. The irony is that the security establishment has long welcomed foreign assistance for itself. Expelling foreign NGOs just because they're not properly accounting for their funding sounds harsh".The clampdown on foreign-funded NGOs has, to a large extent, dissuaded international donors and NGOs from engaging with Pakistan. Experts say this will have a negative impact on the country's poor, who benefit from international cooperation, reported DW News Agency."The crackdown is tarnishing the country's image. Pakistan is losing international aid and support," asserted Tahseen.Kugelman shares a similar view: "If Islamabad continues to telegraph a message that foreign NGOs won't enjoy a welcoming environment, then that could temper the interest of these groups to enter Pakistan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-tightens-noose-over-ngos-to-silence-dissent-101613281018076.html
14-02-2021||World||Japan quake brings back memories of deadly 2011 tsunami||The stench of alcohol filled the small bar on Sunday as Aoi Hoshino swept up glass from whiskey bottles smashed in a strong earthquake the night before, one appearing to be an aftershock from a devastating quake that hit the Fukushima area in 2011.The 7.3 magnitude quake struck shortly before midnight Saturday and cracked walls, shattered windows and set off a landslide in Fukushima, the area closest to the epicentre. More than 100 people were injured.Hoshino, 46, swept broken glass from some 20 shattered whiskey bottles into a garbage bag in her bar on a back street in the city of Iwaki, roughly 200 km (120 miles) north of Tokyo and not far from the quake's epicentre."We were hit by this coronavirus pandemic, and so we were looking forward to reopening our shops, and now this happens," she said, referring to a locally declared state of emergency that had closed her bar from January and was set to lift on Monday."It’s just one thing after another."The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was believed to be an aftershock from the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011 that set off a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000 people along a wide swath of northeastern Japan, and the Fukushima nuclear accident, the world's worst in 25 years. The agency warned of aftershocks for several days.Hoshino said Saturday's quake brought back frightening memories."My body immediately reacted, and I couldn’t stop trembling. My legs were shaking too, but I couldn’t gauge whether it was safer to run out or stay in, so I ended up doing a weird little dance," she said with a chuckle.At least 121 people were injured, NHK national television said, including several who suffered fractures, but there were no reported deaths.BUILDINGS SHOOK IN TOKYOThe 11:08 p.m. (1408 GMT) quake shook buildings in the Japanese capital Tokyo, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of buildings across eastern and northeastern Japan. By morning, though, power was restored to virtually all.Several thousand households remained without water, forcing residents to line up with plastic jugs to receive water from trucks.Though much of Iwaki appeared as usual, tiles had fallen from the front of at least one building, and the sound of broken glass being swept up echoed from several shops and restaurants.On the wall of Noboru Endo's hair salon a hairline crack had opened, in the same place a wider one opened 10 years ago, but otherwise there was little damage.Endo, 64, said Saturday's quake did not compare to the one a decade ago, which went on for several minutes and had weeks of frequent aftershocks."We’ve all pretty much gone back to life as usual, save a few areas that are still badly affected," he said of reconstruction efforts in the area.There was no tsunami this time, and no reports of irregularities at any nuclear plants. NHK reported that about 160 millilitres (5 ounces) of water had leaked from a spent fuel pool at the Fukushima Dai-Ni reactor but that this presented no danger.Shinkansen bullet train service to much of northern Japan was suspended due to damage along the tracks. Service along one line was not expected to be restored until at least Tuesday.Beermakers such as Asahi Group Holdings and Kirin Holdings, which have factories in Fukushima and Sendai, said they were assessing the impact on their facilities. Kirin said its Sendai plant sustained light damage and it was still checking the situation.The power outages did not affect any of the Pfizer Inc Covid-19 vaccines that arrived on Friday for inoculations that are to start this week, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato.Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas, and Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-quake-brings-back-memories-of-deadly-2011-tsunami-101613280079733.html
14-02-2021||World||China fires back at US allegations of lack of transparency||China fired back Sunday at the US over allegations from the White House that Beijing withheld some information about the coronavirus outbreak from World Health Organization investigators.In a statement Friday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government," he said, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019."To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak." Sullivan's statement said.China responded with a statement from its Washington embassy on Sunday, saying the US had already “gravely damaged international cooperation on Covid-19″ and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed President Joe Biden's decision to reverse the Trump administration's move to leave the WHO, China hopes the US will “hold itself to the highest standards, take a serious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude, shoulder its rightful responsibility, support the WHO’s work with real actions and make due contribution to the international cooperation on Covid-19," the statement said.Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in the New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission."“As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways," Daszak tweeted.Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, also said that had not been her experience and implied some comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted casting shadows over important scientific work," Fischer tweeted.While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.The British-born Daszak, a zoologist who now works in New York, affirmed Fischer's remarks, tweeting: “It’s disappointing to spend time w/ journalists explaining key findings of our exhausting month-long work in China, to see our colleagues selectively misquoted to fit a narrative that was prescribed before the work began. Shame on you @nytimes."Daszak had previously worked with the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, to track down the origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak. He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centers, including the highly secure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been the subject of speculation because of its large collection of bat virus specimens.In their comments while in China, team members said they had some new insights into the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people, but that major questions are still unanswered.The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. They said transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely.The WHO team’s visit was politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fires-back-at-us-allegations-of-lack-of-transparency-101613277433512.html

Service along one line was not expected to be restored until at least Tuesday.The March 11, 2011 quake set off a series of massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000.Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trains-halted-scores-injured-as-japan-cleans-up-after-strong-quake-101613268873497.html
14-02-2021||World||Biden aide Ducklo resigns over report he threatened reporter||White House Deputy Press Secretary TJ Ducklo resigned Saturday amid allegations he threatened a reporter who was investigating his relationship with another journalist.Ducklo’s departure came after Vanity Fair reported Friday that he used misogynistic language as he tried to talk a Politico reporter out of writing about his relationship with an Axios reporter. He was initially given a one-week suspension as his boss, Press Secretary Jen Psaki, defended him. But by Saturday, the situation became untenable.“We accepted the resignation of TJ Ducklo after a discussion with him this evening,” Psaki said in a statement. “We are committed to striving every day to meet the standard set by the president in treating others with dignity and respect, with civility and with a value for others through our words and our actions.”President Joe Biden has long made clear he doesn’t accept disrespectful treatment of others by his staff. On Inauguration Day, as he swore in hundreds of political appointees, Biden laid out a zero-tolerance policy for misbehavior.“I’m not joking when I say this: If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.After word of Ducklo’s suspension, Biden aides expressed frustration that he’d been treated too leniently, according to three people familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. Given the nature of his comments to the reporter and Biden’s recent warning, they believed he should have been fired immediately.Ducklo, 32, warned a female Politico reporter against publishing a story about his relationship with Alexi McCammond of Axios, who’d covered the Biden campaign, according to the Vanity Fair report. He told the Politico reporter “I will destroy you,” and spoke in sexually explicit terms as he worked to kill the story, according to the magazine.The Vanity Fair article came after People magazine on Monday published a story about Ducklo’s relationship with McCammond and his treatment for lung cancer. The next morning, Politico Playbook ran its own accounting of the relationship, questioning the ethics of the situation and saying that it had notified the White House of its plans to publish on Monday, giving Ducklo time to rush out the People story.Ducklo on Saturday expressed remorse for his words. “No words can express my regret, my embarrassment, and my disgust for my behavior,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter.“I used language that no woman should ever have to hear from anyone.”Ducklo worked in the communications department at Bloomberg from April 2016 to March 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aide-ducklo-resigns-over-report-he-threatened-reporter-101613268251222.html
14-02-2021||World||What's next for Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Joe Biden?||The US Senate acquitted Donald Trump on Saturday of the charge of inciting the January 6 assault on the US Capitol in an unprecedented second impeachment trial.Trump's acquittal raises questions about what's next for the 74-year-old former president, the Republican Party and President Joe Biden.- Donald Trump -Although Trump's acquittal by the Senate was a near certainty, the verdict must have come as a relief to the former president.In a statement, Trump denounced what he called a "witch hunt" and talked about the future."Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun," he said."We have so much work ahead of us, and soon we will emerge with a vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future."Trump has flirted with the idea of running for the White House again in 2024 and a conviction would have likely barred him from holding federal office again.Since leaving the White House on January 20, Trump has been holed up in his Mar-a-Lago resort, deprived of the Twitter account he used to communicate with his many millions of followers.Capri Cafaro, executive in residence at American University in Washington and a former Democratic member of the Ohio state senate, said the acquittal could be a "rallying cry" for Trump and his backers.But, Cafaro added, "the legacy of Donald Trump for many at this point may be the events of January 6, regardless of acquittal.""There will be Americans who think that Donald Trump had some kind of role," she said, and that could carry over to the real estate tycoon's activities in the private sector."It's almost like he has no choice but to continue to try to be in politics," she said.Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown University, agreed that Trump's future may be limited."If a corporation were to offer him a speaking appearance, the social media backlash would be swift and severe, with possible boycotts of their products," Schiller said."Even holding conferences or events at Trump properties will be a problem for large publicly traded companies, or companies that provide a direct to consumer product," she said.- The Republican Party -The fact that the vast majority of Senate Republicans voted to acquit Trump is a clear signal that he retains a grip on the GOP, the Grand Old Party."The party is his," Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his most fervent supporters, said last week. "It doesn't belong to anyone else."But seven Republican senators voted to convict the former president and 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives voted last month to impeach him, including the party's third-ranking member, Liz Cheney, daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted for acquittal but said Trump was "practically and morally" responsible for the January 6 violence.A number of Republicans have distanced themselves from the former president and are lining up to take their own shot at the White House in 2024.Among them is former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who said Republicans were wrong for supporting Trump's campaign to reverse the election results, a course that led to the January 6 attack on Congress."He went down a path he shouldn't have, and we shouldn't have followed him," Haley said in an interview with Politico magazine.Haley also dismissed speculation Trump will seek the presidency in 2024. "I don't think he can," she said. "He's fallen so far."But the Republicans advocating a complete break with Trump are in the minority and most remain fearful of the power he holds over his base."GOP senators who vote to acquit may be protecting themselves against primary challenges from the more extreme wing of their party in 2022, or even 2024," Schiller said. "But they may simultaneously make themselves more vulnerable to defeat in the general election."Cafaro said Republican lawmakers remaining faithful to Trump were making an "incredibly risky" gamble."They're making a decision based upon a snapshot in time that may not exist for them in two years," she said.A group of anti-Trump former Republican officials has raised the idea of creating a center-right third party but it is unlikely to gain much traction.- Joe Biden -Trump's impeachment trial has been hanging over the start of Biden's presidency and the Democrats must be glad it took just five days.The Senate will now be in a position to swiftly confirm Biden's cabinet appointees and work on his legislative agenda as the country struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic and severe economic woes."President Biden has done a very good job of separating himself from the impeachment trial proceedings and keep his messaging on the Covid-19 crisis and the accompanying economic crisis," Schiller said.But Trump remains a force to be reckoned with."There's no saying that we're immune from more protests, demonstrations, activism from the far right," Cafaro said. "If and when that happens how Joe Biden deals with them will be something to watch."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-next-for-donald-trump-the-republican-party-and-joe-biden-101613263493205.html
14-02-2021||World||UK meets key Covid-19 vaccine target, opening path to lifting lockdown||The UK has passed its target to vaccinate almost 15 million of its most vulnerable citizens against coronavirus, cementing a record of delivering one of the most successful immunization programs in the world.According to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker, the UK administered 15.1 million doses as of Saturday. Almost 22% of the population has been given one dose, with less than 1% getting two shots.Prime Minister Boris Johnson set the target at the start of the year with the aim of immunizing everyone over the age of 70, along with people who live or work in care homes, health service workers and those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19. These groups are estimated to account for about 88% of deaths from the disease in the UK.For Johnson, whose government has been slammed for its handling of the pandemic that has claimed more than 117,000 lives, the achievement is a welcome political boost. But hitting the crucial vaccine target also opens up new risks for the government.The vaccination program now offers a route out of the UK’s third lockdown, which has shuttered businesses and closed schools to most, compounding the damage of the worst economic slump in more than 300 years. Scientists also expect it to slow infections and limit the death toll, already the highest in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world.WHO EndorsementBritain was the first western country to start rolling out vaccines and the first to extend the delay between first and second doses to 12 weeks in an effort to give as many people as possible at least some protection from the virus. The approach provoked skepticism initially but has since been endorsed by the World Health Organization.But while the UK’s pioneering approach to vaccinations has given it a lead over nearly every other country in the world, passing the crucial milestone is likely to fuel demands to lift the lockdown and fire up the economy.Senior members of Johnson’s own Conservative government have been calling on him to move faster to ease restrictions and avert a wave of unemployment. Yet with infection levels still the highest in Europe, Johnson and his scientific advisers have explained they will need to stay cautious, with curbs remaining in place potentially for months to come.Over the next week, the government will review the lockdown restrictions in the context of the infection and case rates, and the vaccination program. Then, on Feb. 22 the prime minister is due to announce his “road map” to unlock the country gradually over the months ahead.On a visit Saturday to a vaccine manufacturing plant in Teesside in northeastern England, Johnson said he’s “optimistic” he’ll be able to detail plans for a “cautious” easing of restrictions this month.Schools, PubsIf all goes well, schools will be the first to reopen, potentially on March 8. The Sunday Telegraph reported that individuals in England will be allowed to meet a friend for a coffee on a park bench from that day, a possible signal that pubs may be able to reopen with outdoor dining in time for the Easter holidays.The government plans to offer a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 by the end of April.There are potential challenges ahead for managing the pandemic, too. Mutations of the virus, some of which show signs of resistance to the vaccines, are emerging and threaten the government’s path out of lockdown. In response, Johnson has announced tougher border measures with a decade in jail as punishment for breaking new quarantine rules for travelers arriving in Britain from virus hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-meets-key-covid-19-vaccine-target-opening-path-to-lifting-lockdown-101613263229822.html
14-02-2021||World||Donald Trump's journey from poll defeat to acquittal in second impeachment trial||Former US president Donald Trump was acquitted Saturday in his second impeachment trial by a Senate vote of 57 to 43, surviving charges that he incited the deadly January 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters bent on preventing Congress from transferring power to Joe Biden.Here is a timeline of events leading up to the trial and acquittal:- Election defeat -Despite the risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the country, record numbers of Americans turn out to vote in the November 3 election.Trump had spent the preceding months warning of election fraud and trying to block mail-in voting, which he feared would massively favor his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.Because so many ballots are mailed in, the final results are delayed, though Trump is reportedly furious when conservative channel Fox News declares the traditionally Republican state of Arizona for Biden on election night.Within days, Trump's lawyers, led by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, embark on a series of fruitless court cases to challenge the election results.- Biden declared winner -On November 7, Biden is declared the winner after flipping the historically Republican southern state of Georgia. In his acceptance speech that night, he calls for unity and holds out an olive branch to Trump supporters, many of whom believed the outgoing president's unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen."I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance," Biden said.- Georgia recounts begin -Under pressure from Trump, Georgia's Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger launches a hand recount of the Georgia ballots that confirms Biden's win. Trump demands an additional recount, which on December 7 shows Biden won the state by 11,779 votes.- 'Will be wild!' -On December 19, Trump tweets to his 88 million social media followers to come to Washington on January 6, the day Congress is due to convene to confirm the election results in what is normally a symbolic, procedural event, for a "big protest in DC.""Be there, will be wild!" he said.- Trump demands Georgia 'find' votes -On January 2, Trump calls Georgia's election overseer Raffensperger and begs him to find more votes to overturn Biden's victory. "What I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes," he says.- Mob storms the Capitol -Vice President Mike Pence releases a statement in which he declines Trump's unconstitutional demand that he reject the electoral college vote, as Congress gathers in the US Capitol to certify Biden's victory.Trump tells a gathering of thousands of angry followers at the White House to march to the Capitol and "fight" for him.The mob storms the building, causing lawmakers and Pence to flee in fear for their lives. Five people, including a police officer, die in the violence. After police and the National Guard restore order, Congress reconvenes and confirms the result.- Twitter ban -On January 8, Twitter, the defeated president's favorite channel for communicating with his followers, bans him from the platform indefinitely.- Second impeachment -On January 13, the House of Representatives impeaches Trump on grounds that he incited the insurrection. Ten Republicans vote with Democrats to back the motion.On January 20, Biden is inaugurated in front of the Capitol. Trump breaks with precedent and refuses to attend, instead flying to his Mar-A-Lago golf resort in Florida.Trump's second impeachment trial begins on February 9 in the 100-seat Senate, with its members -- witnesses to the mayhem -- serving as jurors.Jamie Raskin, the chief of the nine House members serving as prosecutors, calls Trump the "inciter in chief" for his role in stirring and encouraging the insurrection.The prosecutors give a detailed presentation featuring Trump remarks and tweets and video of the riot, including never before seen footage in which lawmakers are seen fleeing to safety as Trump supporters run amok and hunt down Democratic legislators.- 'Practically and morally responsible' -Trump defense lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen argue the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office, and dismiss the proceedings as an exercise in political vengeance.On February 13 the Senate acquits Trump by a vote of 57 to 43, failing to muster the 17 Republicans that the prosecution needed to convict the former president.Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell votes to acquit, embracing the unconstitutionality argument, but later excoriates Trump for his behavior on January 6."There's no question -- none -- that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day," McConnell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-journey-from-poll-defeat-to-acquittal-in-second-impeachment-trial-101613262911600.html
14-02-2021||World||Here’s why seven GOP Senators voted to convict Donald Trump||Seven Republican senators broke ranks and voted to convict Donald Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol -- 10 shy of the 17 needed to reach a two-thirds majority, but still an unusually strong rebuke from members of the former president’s party.Each is likely to face significant blowback from other Republicans. Here are the seven senators and the explanations for their votes:Richard Burr of North CarolinaBurr had previously announced he won’t run for re-election in 2022, and has been a sometime critic of Trump’s. He ran a multi-year bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether it was aimed at helping Trump win.Also Read: Trump, after acquittal, says movement 'has only just begun'“The president bears responsibility for these tragic events,” Burr said in a statement after his vote to convict Trump. “The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government, and that the charge rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Therefore, I have voted to convict.”Bill Cassidy of LouisianaCassidy, who just won re-election and won’t face voters again until 2026, had been agonizing over his decision all week, and was troubled by the inability of Trump’s lawyers to explain the former president’s inaction during the first hours of the riot as police were under attack, people were dying, and lawmakers --including Vice President Mike Pence -- were under threat.“Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” he said in a statement.Susan Collins of MaineCollins, who voted to acquit Trump at his first impeachment trial, had said she hoped the former president learned a lesson after that proceeding. This time, she voted to convict.Collins ripped Trump in a lengthy floor speech for inciting the insurrection and said he “bears significant responsibility for the invasion.” She said the trial for her was about his failure to follow his oath of office and respect the peaceful transition of power.Lisa Murkowski of AlaskaMurkowski has previously expressed a hope that her party could move on from Trump, and is arguably the most independent Republican senator. She plans to run for re-election next year and is sure to face a Trump-aligned primary challenger. However, in 2010, she won as a write-in candidate after losing a party primary.Mitt Romney of UtahThe 2012 GOP presidential nominee was the only Republican to vote to toss Trump from office a year ago, and his vote was not a surprise.Romney accused Trump of trying to “corrupt the election” by pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to falsify results, and of inciting the insurrection.“Trump also violated his oath of office by failing to protect the Capitol, the Vice President, and others in the Capitol,” Romney said.Ben Sasse of NebraskaSasse has emerged as one of the few young Republicans willing to buck Trump, harshly slamming his efforts to overturn the election results. Conveniently for him, he also just won re-election and won’t face voters for six years.In a statement explaining his vote, he condemned Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election by a landslide and for spreading conspiracy theories about voter fraud.“The president repeated these lies when summoning his crowd -- parts of which were widely known to be violent -- to Capitol Hill to intimidate Vice President Pence and Congress into not fulfilling our constitutional duties,” he said. “Those lies had consequences, endangering the life of the vice president and bringing us dangerously close to a bloody constitutional crisis. Each of these actions are violations of a president’s oath of office.”Pat Toomey of PennsylvaniaToomey has long chafed at Trump, particularly on their divergent economic philosophies. He came out quickly against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in his state. He’s retiring and doesn’t need to worry about a primary.“As a result of President Trump’s actions, for the first time in American history, the transfer of presidential power was not peaceful,” Toomey said. “A lawless attempt to retain power by a president was one of the founders’ greatest fears motivating the inclusion of the impeachment authorities in the U.S. Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-why-seven-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-donald-trump-101613262160711.html
14-02-2021||World||After not-guilty vote, McConnell says Trump morally responsible for Capitol riot||US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Donald Trump "practically and morally responsible" for his supporters' deadly attack on the Capitol, only moments after voting to acquit the Republican former president on an impeachment charge of inciting the melee.The top Senate Republican explained the unexpected turnabout at the end of a five-day impeachment trial, by declaring it unconstitutional to convict Trump of misconduct now that the former president has left office and become a private citizen.The Senate earlier in the week found that the trial was constitutional in a 56-44 vote."There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day," said McConnell, who along with the rest of the Congress and former Vice President Mike Pence fled the mob that descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6."The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president," McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.The remarks came soon after the 100-seat chamber acquitted Trump on a single charge of inciting insurrection in a 57-43 vote that failed to reach the 67-vote threshold necessary for conviction. Seven Senate Republicans joined Democrats to vote for conviction.The House of Representatives had impeached Trump on Jan. 13, a week before he left office.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the senators who made Trump's acquittal possible as a "cowardly group of Republicans" and blamed McConnell for not allowing the House to deliver the impeachment charge to the Senate while Trump was still in the White House."Senator Mitch McConnell just went to the floor essentially to say that we made our case on the facts," said Representative Jamie Raskin, who had led the nine House Democrats who prosecuted Trump before the Senate.McConnell was not the only Republican to castigate Trump for his behavior after voting for acquittal."The question I must answer is not whether President Trump said and did things that were reckless and encouraged the mob. I believe that happened," Senator Rob Portman in a statement."My decision was based on my reading of the Constitution," the Ohio Republican added. "I believe the Framers understood that convicting a former president and disqualifying him or her from running again pulls people further apart."Senator Chuck Grassley, the Senate's most senior Republican, described Trump's language in a fiery speech to supporters just before the Capitol assault as "extreme, aggressive and irresponsible."But he said the Senate had no jurisdiction to hold a trial, agreed with Trump's legal team that the former president deserved more "due process" and said the prosecution had not made their case.In comments that echoed the prosecution's case, McConnell said Trump had orchestrated "an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories" and described the former president as "determined to either overturn the voters' decision or else torch our institutions on the way out."McConnell suggested that Trump could still face criminal prosecution for his acts."President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office as an ordinary citizen," McConnell said. "He didn't get away with anything. Yet."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-not-guilty-vote-mcconnell-says-trump-morally-responsible-for-capitol-riot-101613261710505.html

Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide," will take place on Feb. 18 at 1200 ET (1700 GMT), according to the press release and will be livestreamed here https://financialservices.house.gov/live. Waters, a Democrat, is Chair of the House Committee on Financial Services."We are working with the House Financial Services Committee and plan to testify," Reddit's Huffman said in an emailed statement. Representatives for Melvin, Citadel and Robinhood did not respond to requests for comment. Gill could not be reached for comment.Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin and Citadel have been at the center of the GameStop saga, which saw retail traders promote GameStop on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Robinhood emerged as a popular venue to trade the stocks but was criticized for temporarily restricting trading in the hot stock.The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Griffin and firm partners, put $2 billion into Melvin.Democrats and Republicans are united in their outrage by Robinhood's decision to suspend trading in the so-called "meme stocks" on Jan. 28. Tenev said the company had to impose the restrictions after wild trading in the stocks triggered a $3 billion margin call by Robinhood's clearing house, straining the company's balance sheet.Massachusetts securities regulators have also issued a subpoena seeking Gill's testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roaring-kitty-to-testify-on-gamestop-alongside-hedge-fund-managers-101613254348751.html

14-02-2021||World||Trump acquitted: Senate votes 57-43 at impeachment trial||The Senate on Saturday acquitted Donald Trump of inciting the horrific attack on the US Capitol, concluding a historic impeachment trial that exposed the fragility of America's democratic traditions and left a divided nation to come to terms with the violence sparked by his defeated presidency.Barely a month since the deadly Jan. 6 riot that stunned the world, the Senate convened for a rare weekend session to deliver its verdict, voting while armed National Guard troops continued to stand their posts outside the iconic building.The quick trial, the nation’s first of a former president, showed how perilously close the invaders had come to destroying the nation's deep tradition of a peaceful transfer of presidential power after Trump had refused to concede the election. Rallying outside the White House, he unleashed a mob of supporters to “fight like hell” for him at the Capitol just as Congress was certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. As hundreds stormed the building, some in tactical gear engaging in bloody combat with police, lawmakers fled for their lives. Five people died.The verdict, on a vote of 57-43, is all but certain to influence not only the former president's political future but that of the senators sworn to deliver impartial justice as jurors. Seven Republicans joined all Democrats to convict, but it was far from the two-third threshold required.Also Read | Trump, after acquittal, says movement 'has only just begun'The outcome after the uprising leaves unresolved the nation’s wrenching divisions over Trump's brand of politics that led to the most violent domestic attack on one of America's three branches of government.“Senators, we are in a dialogue with history, a conversation with our past, with a hope for our future,” said Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.., one of the House prosecutors in closing arguments.“What we do here, what is being asked of each of us here in this moment will be remembered."Trump, unrepentant, welcomed the his second impeachment acquittal and said his movement “has only just begun.” He slammed the trial as “yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.”Though he was acquitted, it was easily the largest number of senators to ever vote to find a president of their own party guilty of an impeachment charge.Voting to find Trump guilty were GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania.Even after voting to acquit, the Republican leader Mitch McConnell condemned the former president as ‘practically and morally responsible’ for the insurrection. Trump could not be convicted because he was out of office, McConnell contended.The trial had been momentarily thrown into confusion when senators suddenly wanted to consider potential witnesses, an hours-long standoff Saturday that stalled the momentum toward a vote. Prolonged proceedings would be politically risky, particularly for Biden's new presidency and his emerging legislative agenda. Coming amid the searing Covid-19 crisis, the Biden White House is trying to rush pandemic relief through Congress.Biden has hardly weighed in on the proceedings and was spending the weekend with family at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Maryland.The nearly weeklong trial has delivered a grim and graphic narrative of the riot and its consequences in ways that senators, most of whom fled for their own safety that day, acknowledge they are still coming to grips with.House prosecutors have argued that Trump’s was the "inciter in chief" stoking a months-long campaign, and orchestrated pattern of violent rhetoric and false claims they called the “big lie” that unleashed the mob. Five people died, including a rioter who was shot and a police officer.Trump’s lawyers countered that Trump’s words were not intended to incite the violence and that impeachment is nothing but a “witch hunt” designed to prevent him from serving in office again.The senators, announcing their votes from their desks, were not only jurors but also witnesses. Only by watching the graphic videos — rioters calling out menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the January certification tally — did senators say they began to understand just how perilously close the country came to chaos.Many senators kept their votes closely held until the final moments on Saturday, particularly the Republicans representing states where the former president remains popular. Most of them ultimately voted to acquit, doubting whether Trump was fully responsible or if impeachment is the appropriate response.“Just look at what Republicans have been forced to defend,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “Look at what Republicans have chosen to forgive.”In closing arguments, lead prosecutor Michael van der Veen fell back on the procedural argument that Republican senators have embraced in their own reasoning of the case what he said is a “phony impeachment show trial.”“Mr. Trump is innocent of the charges against him,” said Michael van der Veen. “The act of incitement never happened.”The House impeached trump on the sole charge of incitement of insurrection one week after the riot, the most bipartisan vote of a presidential impeachment.The delay Saturday came as senators wanted to hear evidence about Trump's actions during the riot.Fresh stories overnight focused onRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who said in a statement late Friday that Trump rebuffed a plea from House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to call off the rioters.Fifty-five senators voted for to consider witnesses, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah. Once they did, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina changed his vote to join them on the 55-45 vote.But facing a prolonged trial with defense poised to call many more witnesses, the situation was resolved when Herrera Beutler’s statement on the call was read aloud into the record for senators to consider as evidence. As part of the deal, Democrats dropped their planned deposition and Republicans abandoned their threat to call their own witnesses.Impeachment trials are rare, senators meeting as the court of impeachment over a president only four times in the nation's history, for Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now twice for Trump, the only one to be twice impeached.Unlike last year’s impeachment trial of Trump in the Ukraine affair, a complicated charge of corruption and obstruction over his attempts to have the foreign ally dig up dirt on then-campaign rival Biden, this one brought an emotional punch displayed in graphic videos of the siege that laid bare the unexpected vulnerability of the democratic system.At the same time, this year's trial carried similar warnings from the prosecutors pleading with senators that Trump must be held accountable because he has shown repeatedly he has no bounds. Left unchecked, he will further test the norms of civic behavior, even now that he is out of office still commanding loyal supporters.“This trial in the final analysis is not about Donald Trump,” said lead prosecutor Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. "This trial is about who we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-trump-acquitted-by-the-us-senate-in-his-impeachment-trial-101613250209127.html

The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A federal appeals court in Boston had declined on Thursday to issue an order preventing the Taylors' extradition while they appealed lower-court rulings. The US State Department approved their extradition in October."The very least the US courts owe the petitioners is a full chance to litigate these issues, including exercising their appellate rights, before they are consigned to the fate that awaits them at the hands of the Japanese government," defense lawyers wrote.The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-court-rejects-bid-by-ghosn-s-accused-escape-plotters-to-avoid-extradition-101613249459837.html
14-02-2021||World||UK media watchdog fines Khalsa TV for violence, terror references||London: The UK’s media watchdog has imposed a total fine of 50,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Ltd or KTV in Britain for broadcasting a music video and a discussion programme that was an indirect call for British Sikh to commit violence and also contained a terror reference. The Office of Communications (Ofcom), the UK government-approved media regulatory authority, issued the order on Friday following its findings dating back to February and November 2019. Its order also includes a direction for the channel to broadcast a statement of Ofcom’s findings on a date and in a form to be determined by the watchdog and also for KTV not to repeat the music video or the discussion programme found in breach of its rules. “Ofcom has imposed financial penalties of 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Limited in relation to its service KTV for failing to comply with our broadcasting rules. The 20,000 pounds penalty relates to a music video. The 30,000 pounds penalty relates to a discussion programme,” the Ofcom decision states. On July 4, 7 and 9 in 2018, KTV broadcast a music video for a song called ‘Bagga and Shera’. Following its investigation, Ofcom found that the music video was an “indirect call to action for Sikhs living in the UK to commit violence, up to and including murder”. It also included brief flashes, which, when slowed down, revealed frames of on-screen text. It appeared to be seeking to influence viewers by conveying a message to them or otherwise influencing their minds without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred, which Ofcom found was in breach of its rules of the broadcast. The discussion programme in question was aired live on March 30, 2019, as ‘Panthak Masle’. Ofcom found that the programme provided a platform for several guests to express views which amounted to “indirect calls to action and were likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder”. “Ofcom also found that it included a reference to the proscribed terrorist organisation the Babbar Khalsa, and which in our view could be taken as legitimising it and normalising its aims and actions in the eyes of viewers,” it notes. KTV is a television channel broadcasting largely to the Sikh community in the United Kingdom under a licence held by Khalsa Television Limited. Ofcom conducted its investigations after receiving complaints that the music video and discussion programme was likely to “encourage or incite crime or violence”. The music video in question contained an image of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which Ofcom noted “emphasised the video’s narrative of advocating violent action against the Indian state”. The discussion programme, being broadcast in Punjabi, meant Ofcom had to commission an English translation. It said that KTV was notified about the investigation and did not initially raise accuracy issues but later did, resulting in a second translation. It concluded that KTV failed to ensure that material which was “potentially highly offensive to viewers” was justified by the context and therefore in breach of its code. On its website, KTV describes itself as an exciting channel, airing a range of cultural, educational and entertaining programmes for audiences of all ages. It says it prides itself in being “completely independent, impartial and honest”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-media-watchdog-fines-khalsa-tv-for-violence-terror-references-101613244993839.html
14-02-2021||World||Closing arguments begin in Trump impeachment trial as Senate reaches deal to skip witnesses||The US Senate began hearing final arguments on Saturday in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump as the top Republican senator said he would vote to acquit the former president of inciting the deadly January 6 assault on the Capitol.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision means Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the Senate of the charge of inciting an insurrection by his supporters.Before moving to final arguments, the proceedings were interrupted for a few hours after House prosecutors, in a surprise move, said they wanted to call witnesses at the trial.House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said he wanted to call a Republican lawmaker as a witness but eventually agreed with Trump's defense lawyers just to have her testimony entered into evidence.Trump's lawyers had threatened in response to call witnesses of their own, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, and others.The Senate voted 55-45 to allow witnesses but senators, House prosecutors and defense lawyers then hammered out an agreement allowing the trial to proceed to closing arguments.The four hours of final arguments will be split equally between both sides with the House prosecutors going first.A vote on whether to acquit or convict the 74-year-old former Republican president is expected later Saturday afternoon.Raskin had wanted Representative Jamie Herrera Beutler to testify after she released a statement about the events of January 6.Herrera Beutler, a Republican from Washington state, was one of 10 Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach Trump in the House of Representatives.In her statement, she said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had called Trump while the attack was ongoing and implored him to call off the rioters."When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was Antifa that had breached the Capitol," Herrera Beutler said."McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters," the congresswoman said."That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,'" she said.'A close call'Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House on January 13 for inciting the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, who were seeking to block congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's November 3 election victory.A conviction in the 100-member Senate -- which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans -- would require a two-thirds majority and appears highly unlikely after McConnell said he would vote to acquit.Also Read | Senate minority leader McConnell will vote to acquit Trump: Report"While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and therefore we lack jurisdiction," McConnell said in an email to his Republican colleagues."The Constitution makes perfectly clear that Presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the President has left office," he said. "Given these conclusions, I will vote to acquit."Trump's defense lawyers argued on Friday that the former president bears no responsibility for the attack on Congress and wrapped up their presentation in just three hours.This followed two days of evidence from Democratic impeachment managers centered around harrowing video footage of the mob assault on the Capitol.Trump's defense lawyers called the impeachment unconstitutional and an "act of political vengeance."They argued that Trump's rally speech near the White House that preceded the January 6 attack, when he told supporters to "fight," was merely rhetorical.Seeking to turn the table on the Democrats' powerful use of video evidence, defense lawyers played their own compilations showing Democratic lawmakers at different times using the word "fight."House impeachment managers charge that after losing to Biden, Trump deliberately stoked tension with a campaign of lies claiming there had been mass voter fraud.On January 6 he staged a fiery rally near the White House, calling on the crowd to march on Congress, which was in the process of certifying Biden's victory.The mob then stormed the Capitol, disrupting the certification. Five people, including a police officer and a woman shot during the unrest, died in the mayhem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closing-arguments-begin-in-trump-impeachment-trial-as-senate-reaches-deal-to-skip-witnesses-101613240634576.html
