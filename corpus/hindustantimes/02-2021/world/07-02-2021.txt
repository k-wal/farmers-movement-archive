During the call, the two diplomats sparred on democracy and human rights issues.Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the US, said tough talks are “not the right way of doing diplomacy,” when asked about the Blinken-Yang phone call in a CNN interview aired on Sunday.“You don’t have effective foreign policy just by talking tough, or playing tough,” he said on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “I think there’s a clear need for a good sense of mutual respect.”Biden has so far signaled a desire to continue international pressure on China over its human rights practices, while China has repeatedly said the two countries should look for areas for cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-hasn-t-called-xi-jinping-yet-says-haven-t-had-occasion-to-talk-101612720262050.html

China and Pakistan consider each other close allies while Beijing’s ties with Phnom Penh are possibly the strongest among southeast Asian countries.China and Pakistan share close military ties, with a senior Chinese general once remarking that it’s the “backbone” of the overall bilateral relations. The Chinese defence ministry on Sunday released separate statements on delivering the vaccines, saying the Pakistani military was the first to receive “vaccine assistance” from their Chinese counterparts.“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Sunday delivered a batch of Covid-19 vaccines to the Pakistani military at the latter’s request and with the approval of the Central Military Commission,” China’s defence ministry said.“The Pakistani military is the first foreign military to receive the Covid-19 vaccine assistance from the Chinese military.” A video on the handover released by the defence ministry showed the vaccines to be from the state-run Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm.The PLA will continue to make positive contributions to the building of a community of common health for mankind, the statement said. It did not share details about the number of vaccine doses that were given to the Pakistan army. The defence ministry issued a similar statement on delivering vaccines to the Cambodian military, saying the “Cambodian military is one of the first foreign militaries to receive the Covid-19 vaccine assistance from the Chinese military”.Last week, the first batch of 500,000 Chinese Covid-19 vaccines were sent to Pakistan, days after foreign minister Wang Yi promised Islamabad that Beijing would assist Pakistan with vaccines and accelerate vaccines exports to the country, Chinese state media reported.Besides Pakistan, China is also providing vaccine aid to 13 developing countries, including Brunei, Nepal, the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Palestine, Belarus, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Equatorial Guinea, with 38 more developing countries in need slated to receive China’s vaccine aid at a later stage, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said last week.“China has supported its companies in conducting joint research and production of vaccines with foreign partners and already exported Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines to countries including the UAE, Morocco, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, and Chile,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-delivers-covid-vaccines-to-pakistani-military-101612717009167.html

Ali Raisi, spokesman for the government’s coronavirus task force, said in the statement that the vaccines will be free of charge.Iran has reported more than 1.4 million cases and almost 60,000 deaths so far. Officials have blamed US sanctions for hampering their ability to both contain the disease and ward off economic collapse.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s decision to ban British and US-made shots as untrustworthy could further complicate efforts to stabilize the outbreak and begin recovery, though Iran has secured some 4.2 million doses of the UK-based AstraZeneca-Oxford University shot through the global vaccine procurement system backed by the World Health Organization.Sputnik V dealIran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said the countries would soon finalize an agreement for Iran to produce Sputnik V by April, according to state TV.On Sunday, while the country reported 7,065 new infections overnight, the number of daily deaths from the virus dropped to 57, the lowest figure since May 2020.Iran also unveiled its second locally developed vaccine for the disease, called Razi Cov Pars, a recombinant protein-based vaccine that’s been developed by state-owned Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, state TV reported.The first clinical trial phase of COVIRAN, the country’s other homemade vaccine, was completed last week with 56 volunteers and is expected to be approved for use by the general population by the summer, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-to-start-covid-19-vaccinations-using-russia-s-sputnik-jab-101612713199369.html

The woman recorded Casanova dancing in jail and posted it on Instagram, the newspaper reported.Westchester County Correction Commissioner Joseph Spano said correction officials have revoked Casanova's video visitation privileges because recording videos and taking pictures during a virtual visit is prohibited.“I’m happy to say we don’t have a lot of issues with video visits because inmates know it’s a privilege, not a right,” Spano said.Casanova faces another charge for not wearing a mask, authorities said.An email seeking comment was sent to Casanova's attorney on Sunday.Casanova was among 18 alleged members of the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation gang charged in a federal indictment in December with a host of crimes in New York City and elsewhere in New York state. Casanova has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and firearms possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-rapper-casanova-disciplined-for-tiktok-video-dance-challenge-101612711855396.html

Already in the last synods, the number of women participating as experts or auditors increased.""With the appointment of Sr. Nathalie Becquart, and the possibility that she will participate with the right to vote, a door has been open.

07-02-2021||World||‘Will be available for autumn’: Oxford researcher on new version of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||A new version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to provide immunity against the coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa “will be available for the autumn”, a lead researcher of the vaccine development programme at the University of Oxford said on Sunday. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford, told BBC that the researchers have already started working on the first part of the manufacturing process in the university and the new version will be ready to use in the autumn.“It looks very much like (the new vaccine) will be available for the autumn. We’re already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford, that will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain as we go through the Spring, and it looks very much like that we can have a new version ready to use in the autumn,” said Gilbert.The vaccinologist commented on the availability of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine after the biopharmaceutical company admitted that the current version, AZD1222, had significantly reduced efficacy against the South African variant called B.1.351. A spokesperson of AstraZeneca reportedly said that the early data from small phase I/II trial has shown limited efficacy against mild disease primarily due to B.1.351.Read | Explained: Why South African Covid-19 variant remains a concern amid vaccinationGilbert said the researchers expect to show this year that the new version of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) “will generate antibodies that recognise the new variant.” “And then it will be very much like working on flu vaccines, so people will be familiar with the idea that we have to have new components, new strains in the flu vaccine every year to keep up with the new strains that are circulating,” she added.While Oxford researchers continue to work on the new version of their Covid-19 vaccine, US biotechnology company Moderna Inc, known for its messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, announced last month that its Covid-19 vaccine will be effective against the new variants of coronavirus identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Moderna said in a statement that the two-dose regimen of its Covid-19 vaccine at the 100 microgram dose is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-be-available-for-autumn-researcher-on-astrazeneca-s-new-vaccine-version-101612705225170.html

In the travel sector, vaccine passports - a documents carrying the proof of vaccination of a person - will be the much talked about thing.In this digital era, users will be able to access their passports on mobile phones as an app or as part of a digital wallet.The Technical Group of Global Tourism Crisis Committee - a United Nations body - aims to take innovative actions to ensure safe cross border travel and restore international mobility.The committee was created by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) to chalk out a coordinated plan of action for recovering the hard hit tourism industry. The cross sector body includes various UN key agencies. It met for the first time in Madrid in January 2021 to plan the restart of tourism.Support for the standardization, digitalization and interoperability of testing protocols and certification systems, based on commonly agreed evidence and risk-assessment indicators for origin and destination country/territory is one of the key agenda that the committee had called for.Based on these developments, here is the status of vaccine passports around the world:Sweden plans to launch a digital coronavirus "vaccine passport" by summer, assuming there is an international standard in place for the document by then, the government said last Thursday.Iceland is the first Schengen country to issue digital Covid-19 vaccine certificates. Certificates meeting the Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland’s guidelines given by an EFA/EFTA state will be considered valid at the border of the country. Travellers with the certificate need not undergo screening and are also exempted from official border restrictions.The government of Denmark had also planned to roll out vaccine certification but thousands of people have taken to streets protesting against the digital vaccination certificates as they claim the passport implies the obligation to be inoculated.Britain has rejected the introduction of vaccine passports but people can seek proof from doctors' to travel, news agency Reuters quoted vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi as saying.Also Read | You may need vaccine passport for travel next year: All you need to know about itSingapore firms have also developed digital vaccine passports to verify travellers' Covid-19 test results as the borders reopen. These digital health passports allows hospitals and clinics to share healthcare data across borders using the blockchain technology, as reported by Channel News Asia.Hungary is planning to launch an 'immunity passport' that can act as evidence that the traveller had been earlier infected by the coronavirus and thus has antibodies against the disease, CNN reported.Thailand has also proposed to launch vaccine passports to avoid quarantines for the travellers who have been vaccinated, as per media reports. Thailand will also campaign for adoption of same system for easier travel within bloc without the need to quarantine.Israel has unveiled a Green Booklet that will allow people who have been inoculated against the virus to travel and access public spaces/large social gatherings. The passport is available on mobile application and can also be printed out. The booklet will be issued after the administration of both the doses of the vaccine.Australia too is in support of vaccine passports as a way of avoiding mandatory quarantine for both domestic and international travel, as per a local media report.Coronavirus vaccine passports might become the currency for travel in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/status-of-covid-19-vaccine-passports-around-the-world-all-you-need-to-know-101612696450918.html

The sessions are part of a broader effort to negotiate a political solution to the nearly six-year conflict pitting Iran-allied Houthi rebels against Yemeni government forces supported by a Saudi-led military coalition.The trip comes just days after President Joe Biden announced that the US will end its support, including some arms sales, of the Saudi-led coalition’s war against the Houthis. The long-awaited move refocused a spotlight on the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and was welcomed by many Yemenis and aid groups that hope the policy change might add to momentum for peace talks.Griffiths’ “immediate priority” in Tehran is to push a nationwide ceasefire, urgent humanitarian measures and the resumption of the political process, his office added. Those goals repeatedly have proved elusive over years of ruinous war that have left the country deeply divided. The visit was planned long before Biden’s announcement, Griffiths’ spokeswoman Ismini Palla said.The Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north in 2014. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and other countries, launched a bombing campaign to expel the Houthis and restore the internationally recognized government months later.Iran, seeing an opportunity to aid a war of attrition against rival Saudi Arabia, has provided the Houthis with military and political support, according to Arab countries, the West and United Nations experts. Tehran long has denied the allegations, despite evidence to the contrary.The war has killed some 130,000 people, including over 13,000 civilians slain in targeted attacks, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Project, and pushed millions to the brink of famine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-yemen-envoy-makes-first-visit-to-iran-to-push-for-peace-101612702428445.html

The guidelines are expected to put new pressure on the country's leading internet services, including e-commerce sites such as Alibaba Group's Taobao and Tmall marketplaces or JD.com. They will also cover payment services like Ant Group's Alipay or Tencent Holding's WeChat Pay.The rules, issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on its website, bar companies from a range of behaviour, including forcing merchants to choose between the country's top internet players, a long-time practice in the market.SAMR said the latest guidelines would "stop monopolistic behaviours in the platform economy and protect fair competition in the market."The notice also said it will stop companies from price fixing, restricting technologies and using data and algorithms to manipulate the market.In a Q&A accompanying the notice, SAMR said reports of internet-related anti-monopoly behaviour had been increasing, and that it was facing challenges regulating the industry."The behaviour is more concealed, the use of data, algorithms, platform rules and so on make it more difficult to discover and determine what are monopoly agreements," it said.China has in recent months started to tighten scrutiny of its tech giants, reversing a once laissez-faire approach.In December, regulators launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba Group following the dramatic suspension of the $37 billion initial public offering plan of its payment affiliate, Ant Group. At the time, regulators warned the company over practices including forcing merchants to sign exclusive cooperation pacts at the expense of other internet platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-issues-new-anti-monopoly-rules-targeting-its-tech-giants-101612701244537.html
07-02-2021||World||Which Covid-19 tests are required for international travel? All you need to know||Which Covid-19 tests are required for international travel?It depends on where you're going.In an effort to limit the spread of new coronavirus variants, many countries are requiring incoming travelers to show a recent negative test.The US, for example, will accept results from either a test that detects the genetic material of the virus — considered the most sensitive type of test — or a rapid test that looks for viral proteins called antigens. The tests must have been taken no more than three days before departing for the US.Health professionals usually give more sensitive lab tests via a nasal swab that take a day or more to yield results. Rapid tests have a turnaround time of about 15 to 30 minutes and are increasingly used to screen people at testing sites, offices, schools and nursing homes. For some rapid tests, users can swab themselves at home.With either test, the US requires electronic or printed proof of the negative result from a medical laboratory. That means that even if you plan to get the faster test you’ll likely need to see a health care provider who can provide documentation.England has a similar setup, accepting results from both types of tests. But health authorities there are imposing extra requirements, including that the tests meet certain thresholds for accuracy. Travelers are told to check to make sure their test meets the standards.After countries instituted varying requirements, officials in the European Union agreed to standardize requirements across the 27-nation bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-covid-19-tests-are-required-for-international-travel-all-you-need-to-know-101612698841702.html

07-02-2021||World||Explained: Why South African Covid-19 variant remains a concern amid vaccination||While governments around the world are rolling out vaccines to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the South African variant continues to be the Achilles’ heel for authorities. The variant, known as B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa in samples dating back to the beginning of October 2020 and was driving the surge in infections in the country. The strain was later detected in the UK as the country reported two cases on December 23.On February 2, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that B.1.351 has been reported from 10 additional countries in the past week, taking the total to 41 countries. Though the modes of transmission have not changed, the UN health agency cautioned that the variants of concern may be more transmissible.The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has had several mutations during the ongoing pandemic but the South African variant has remained a concern due to the efficacy of vaccines against the strain.Why the South African variant remains a concern?Last month, US biotechnology company Moderna Inc announced that its Covid-19 vaccine will be effective against the variants identified in the UK and South Africa. But the storage requirement and effective cost have made it a less attractive choice in middle- and low-income countries.On the other hand, AstraZeneca, which has signed multiple deals with such countries to provide Covid-19 vaccine, has revealed that the vaccine developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford has shown limited efficacy against mild disease occurring due to the South African variant.According to a Financial Times report, a study conducted by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine had significantly reduced efficacy against the virus variant B.1.351. After the report was published, AstraZeneca spokesperson responded to it, saying, “In this small phase I/II trial, early data has shown limited efficacy against mild disease primarily due to the B.1.351 South African variant.” The spokesperson, however, clarified that the company has not been able to properly ascertain the effect against severe disease and hospitalisation since the subjects of the study were “predominantly young healthy adults”.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-south-african-covid-19-variant-remains-a-concern-amid-vaccination-101612695515057.html

A search is on and let's pray for their safe return home,” Haideri told The Associated Press.On Saturday, choppers flew to a height of 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) to try to locate the missing mountaineers with no success.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement saying Iceland's foreign minister, Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson, spoke to his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, by telephone. Qureshi assured him that Pakistan will spare no effort in the search for the missing mountaineers.Sadpara and his team left their base camp on Feb. 3, a month after their first attempt to scale the mountain failed because of weather conditions.Haideri said Sadpara’s son, Sajid, had returned to the base camp safely after his oxygen regulator malfunctioned at 8,000 meters.Haideri noted Sadpara's experience as a mountaineer who has climbed the world's eight highest mountains, including the highest, Mount Everest, and was attempting to climb K2 in winter.K2 is the most prominent peak on the Pakistani side of the Himalayan range and the world’s second tallest after Mount Everest. Winter winds on K2 can blow at more than 200 kph (125 mph) and temperatures drop to minus 60 degrees Celsius (minus 76 Fahrenheit).A team of 10 Nepalese climbers made history on Jan. 16 by scaling the K2 for the first time in winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-underway-for-3-climbers-on-k2-mountain-in-pakistan-101612683471564.html

The case could complicate the Biden administration’s attempts to re-engage with Tehran after Trump abandoned a nuclear accord in 2018 and crushed the economy through sanctions.Also read| American soldiers reach Rajasthan for joint Indo-US military exerciseThe lawsuit states that the ship’s owner, Capital Ship Management Corp., was deceived about where the oil came from.Iran has increased petroleum exports in recent months, according to ship-tracking firms, though they remain far below levels from early 2018.Global markets would be able to absorb more supplies of Iranian oil, Zamaninia said. Prices have risen rapidly since November due to the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines and because the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and allies such as Russia are curbing supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-claims-no-knowledge-of-oil-cargo-us-is-trying-to-seize-101612689893681.html

The plan is a collaboration between the ministry and the Department of Manpower of the Ministry of Human Resources, it said.Overcrowded conditions in employee dormitories have been a key source of infections, spurring record cases and pressuring Malaysia’s health system. The nation has more than 1.5 million documented migrant workers, 91% of whom live in accommodation that doesn’t meet minimum housing standards, according to the Ministry of Human Resources.The government’s plan also provides a lifeline for the tourism industry. More than 100 hotels have closed since the outbreak began almost a year ago, according to a Feb. 5 statement by the Malaysian Association of Hotels.A recent video of a hotel manager selling the hotel’s food by the roadside in a popular hawker area is an example of many who have resorted to scaling down to cover expenses and employees’ payroll, the association said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-house-migrant-workers-in-hotels-to-curb-virus-spread-101612672351450.html

The surge forced Dubai to reintroduce curbs on hotels and air travel, and the emirate replaced its top health official last month.Last week, an official from Dubai’s tourism department criticized the lack of compliance that’s driven cases up but said the city is confident about growth prospects.While cases have jumped in recent months, the country has also rolled out an aggressive inoculation program. It has administered 4.2 million vaccine doses in a population of about 10 million, one of the highest rates of vaccinations per 100 people globally.“The current approach for the country is we make available for the people whatever vaccines have been going through the clinical trials, and at the same time partner with different entities to enhance this industry,” Sharif said.The UAE has approved shots developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, as well as China’s Sinopharm. It has also given Russia’s Sputnik vaccine authorization for emergency use, while Dubai last week received the first shipment of AstraZeneca Plc-Oxford University vaccine from India.For the UAE, the priority now lies in striking a balance. “We need to make sure we strike a balance between the numbers of cases but also the social well being and economic well being of our people,” Sharif said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-aims-to-vaccinate-all-eligible-adults-by-end-of-year-101612682522552.html
07-02-2021||World||Erdogan rivals see hidden agenda in new pledge to overhaul laws||Having accrued broad executive power through a 2017 rewrite of Turkey’s constitution, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is promising to have another swing at the country’s basic laws.Just like four years ago, the pledge has kicked off a political storm -- but this time, opposition politicians say, that’s exactly what Erdogan intended.The president’s vowing to take aim at the remains of a charter first adopted by a military junta in 1982, a move that might appear to strengthen democracy. Turkey’s opposition parties instead see an attempt to divert attention from a stumbling economy mismanaged by an authoritarian Erdogan and his increasingly unpopular party.“This is about preventing our citizens from seeing the real problems,” in Turkey, said Ali Babacan, a former economy minister under Erdogan and now chairman of the opposition DEVA Party. “We should never fall victim to efforts to deflect the public’s agenda.”No MajorityThe motives alleged by Babacan and other party leaders tally with parliamentary arithmetic: Erdogan’s coalition of Islamist-rooted conservatives and Turkish nationalists is 23 seats short of the majority needed to enact major legal changes.What’s more, officials accept the reform proposal hasn’t progressed much beyond presidential musings; and there’s no expectation Erdogan plans to hand powers he wields back to the national assembly, a demand made by leading rivals.Any overhaul would cement the role of the new political system in remaking Turkey in Erdogan’s vision, according to a person with direct knowledge of constitutional plans who asked not to be identified.Popularity HitWhen criticizing the current constitution, Erdogan frequently mentions an organization created by the military to keep a close eye on the country’s universities. Yet his oversight has gone even further -- presidential powers to pick loyal university chiefs were expanded, and in recent weeks scores of students in Istanbul who protested just such an appointment have been arrested.Erdogan’s popularity has suffered as the economy and currency were weakened by tussles with the U.S. and Europe, and in the last 12 months by pandemic restrictions. Unemployment and prices have risen, while the president’s AK Party lost local elections in both the business hub of Istanbul and Ankara, the capital.Turkey’s $750 billion economy has rebounded from the Covid-19 slump faster than most of its peers, but the recovery came at a cost.Reserves BingeErdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, who resigned as economy czar in November, is estimated by Wall Street banks to have spent more than $100 billion of Turkey’s foreign reserves supporting the currency while he engineered a credit explosion.Mortgages and consumer loans at negative real rates kept the economy humming but also maintained inflation in double digits, widened the deficit in Turkey’s current-account and eventually derailed the lira.After replacing Albayrak and the central bank governor, Erdogan said the nation had to swallow “bitter-pill policies” of higher interest rates. Stabilizing the economy will require a slowdown in credit, which will eventually mean a slower pace of job creation.The challenging economic outlook gives the president reason to shift the focus.For much of the past week, Erdogan has attacked the students protesting in Istanbul, claiming the trouble was stirred up by a LGBT community that has no place in Turkish culture.The governing party portrayed the rallies as an example of Turkish elites bent on undermining Erdogan. Its opponents see things differently.“They have thrown a ball of yarn in front of the people,” opposition IYI Party leader Meral Aksener said on Thursday, using a Turkish saying for an attempt to distract attention.“This is about suppressing the voice of mothers who can’t feed their babies, industrialists who can’t produce, and shopkeepers who lost their businesses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-rivals-see-hidden-agenda-in-new-pledge-to-overhaul-laws-101612675921583.html

The central bank has been particularly concerned about a case where it said foreign banks helped grains companies engage in currency speculation through deliverable forwards, affecting the stability of Taiwan's foreign exchange market.Sources told Reuters on Friday that the central bank had sent letters outlining punishments to Deutsche Bank, CitigroupInc, ING and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) for their involvement.Apart from the punishment for Deutsche Bank's Taipei branch, the central bank said in statement that ING and ANZ's Taipei offices would not be allowed to trade Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards for nine months.Citi's Taipei office would be suspended from trading Taiwan dollar deliverable forwards for two months, it added.Citi declined to comment. Representatives for the other three banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The punishments will come into effect on Monday, the central bank added.The central bank announced its probe into the case last month, which it said involved eight grain-trading companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-punishes-deutsche-bank-others-in-currency-speculation-case-101612677894589.html

Otherwise, the letter stated, the 2022 Games will go down in history as ‘The Games of Shame’ just as the 1936 edition provided a propaganda platform to Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.The letter was signed by MPs across party, including those from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party, as well as the opposition Conservatives, Bloc Quebecois, New Democratic Party and the Green Party.The letter referenced the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights statement released in October last year, which accused China of committing “genocide” against it Uighur and other Turkic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.“We have a unique opportunity to come together with all the world’s humanitarians and democrats and take action by refusing to participate in this global sports festival, on the grounds that doing so would amount to taking part in a sinister, self-aggrandising spectacle staged for the benefit of a regime that is perpetrating the worst possible crimes against humanity against its own people,” the letter stressed.Unlike previous calls for boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, the MPs wanted them to continue but at another venue selected by the IOC. “We are not asking our athletes to give up their Olympic dream, because we know full well how much effort will have gone into pursuing it.However, we believe that there is still time to demand that the International Olympic Committee move the Games to another country if the Chinese government continues its genocidal campaign,” they said.It also added that some may argue that sports and politics do not mix, but in this instance, “We would respond that when genocide is happening, it is no longer a matter of politics, but of human rights and crimes against humanity. We cannot accept the current status quo.”All five of Canada’s main federal parties were represented among the signatories to the letter, which was started by Bloc Québécois MP Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-lawmakers-seek-shifting-of-winter-olympics-from-china-over-uighur-genocide-101612679807207.html
07-02-2021||World||Biggest protests in Myanmar since 2007 draw tens of thousands||Tens of thousands of people marched for a second day in Myanmar’s biggest city on Sunday, and thousands more assembled across the country to protest against the military junta's coup and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi last week.The protests, which took place despite an internet blackout and restrictions on phone lines, were the biggest demonstrations in the country since the 2007 Buddhist monk-led Saffron Revolution.Crowds in Yangon, the commercial capital, carried red balloons, the colour representing Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy Party (NLD), and chanted, “We don’t want military dictatorship! We want democracy!”Myanmar's military seized power in the early hours of Monday, bringing the Southeast Asian nation's troubled democratic transition to a sudden halt and drawing international outrage.On Saturday, tens of thousands took to the streets in the first mass protests since the coup.On Sunday morning, massive crowds from all corners of Yangon converged on Hledan township, some walking through stalled traffic, and marched under bright sunshine in the middle of the road.They waved NLD flags and gestured with the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of protest against the coup. Drivers honked their horns and passengers held up photos of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi.The scenes broadcast on Facebook were some of the few that have come out of the country since the junta shut down the internet and restricted phone lines on Saturday. Speaking as he filmed the streets, the broadcaster said getting information out might help keep the protesters safe.There was no comment from the junta in the capital Naypyitaw, more than 350 km (220 miles) north of Yangon."They already started shutting down the internet - if they rule more they will repress even more on education, business, and health," said Thu Thu, a 57-year-old who was arrested by a previous junta during pro-democracy protests in the late 1980s. "This is why we have to do this," he said."We cannot accept the coup," said a 22-year-old who came with 10 friends, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. "This is for our future. We have to come out."By mid-morning about 100 people had taken to the streets on motorbikes in the coastal town of Mawlamyine in the southeast, and students and doctors were gathering in the city of Mandalay in central Myanmar.Another crowd of hundreds spent the night outside a police station in the town of Payathonzu in Karen state in the southeast, where local NLD lawmakers were believed to have been arrested. They remained outside in the morning, singing pro-democracy songs.With no internet and official information scarce, rumours swirled about the fate of Suu Kyi and her cabinet. A story that she had been released, which drew huge crowds onto the streets to celebrate overnight on Saturday, was quickly quashed by her lawyer.More than 160 people have been arrested since the military seized power, said Thomas Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar."The generals are now attempting to paralyse the citizen movement of resistance - and keep the outside world in the dark - by cutting virtually all internet access," Andrews said in a statement on Sunday."We must all stand with the people of Myanmar in their hour of danger and need.

07-02-2021||World||China likely to retaliate against UK's citizenship offer for Hong Kong : Report||China is expected to step up retaliation in March against the UK's scheme to offer citizenship to millions of Hong Kong people through British National (Overseas) (BNO) passport, reported Asia Times.Hong Kong residents will now be required to declare if they hold British citizenship under the BNO passport scheme, according to Asia Times.Since last July, analysts suggested that Beijing may strip the Chinese citizenship and Hong Kong permanent residency of BNO passport holders.On January 29, China said that it will de-recognise BNO as a travel and identity document for Hong Kong people from January 31 and reserved the right to take further measures against the UK citizenship scheme.The UK offered a pathway to eventual citizenship for Hong Kong residents. London unveiled its plan in July last year to take eligible Hong Kongers after Beijing's imposition of the draconian National Security Law.Also read| Quad countries to arrange first meeting, amid China's growing influenceTian Feilong, an associate professor at Beijing's Beihang University Law School and director of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said in an interview with TVB on Wednesday that the standing committee would interpret China's Nationality Law for the second time in March if necessary."If the number of BNO visa applicants reaches 20,000 to 30,000 this month, I think it touches an alarming level," said Tian."After BNO status holders are granted British citizenship, their permanent residency, voting rights and social benefits in Hong Kong should be stripped. The Hong Kong government would have to amend its local election and social benefit rules after the reinterpretation of the Nationality Law," he said.In May 1996, the standing committee gave an explanation about China's Nationality Law's implementation in Hong Kong. From July 1, 1997, Hong Kong people were able to keep using British Dependent Territories Citizens or BNO passports as travel documents, but they would not be entitled to British consular protection in Hong Kong and mainland China.It is widely believed that by reinterpreting the Nationality Law, Beijing can easily strip the Chinese nationality of those who are granted British citizenship under the BNO citizenship scheme, reported Asia Times.Also read| Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandHowever, the newspaper said it is more complicated to strip a Hong Kong person's permanent residency as such a move may violate Article 24 of the Basic Law, which states clearly the definition of the city's permanent residents.Moreover, Tian suggested last year that the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee should interpret Article 24 of the Basic Law. He said, after the interpretation, BNO status holders given British citizenship would lose their rights to vote and to stand for election. These rights are stated in Article 26 of the Basic Law.Many Hong Kong netizens have pointed out that the Hong Kong government won't be able to distinguish whether a Hong Kong person is given British citizenship under the BNO scheme or other schemes, which include the British Nationality Selection Scheme launched in 1990 for 50,000 Hong Kong families, reported Asia Times.However, Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Hong Kong residents would be required to declare to the government if they were given British citizenship under the BNO scheme.Also read| Where Did Covid-19 Come From? Investigator Foreshadows Fresh Clues"People given British citizenship under the BNO scheme would enjoy fewer job opportunities in Hong Kong because they would face more challenges when applying for a visa to enter mainland China. These people would then have to return to the United Kingdom as 'second-class citizens' due to their gloomy prospects in Hong Kong," Lau said.Asia Times said these "punishments" do not seem to be immediate for those who have decided to leave, Beijing's move to stop recognising the BNO as a travel and identity document has hit hundreds of innocent people."Minorities from India, Pakistan and Nepal will have to face the brunt, who only hold BNO passports. They cannot apply for Hong Kong SAR passports and Mainland Travel Permits. These people used to apply for China visas with their BNO passports but they could not do so now," said Mohan Chugani, the former president of the India Association Hong Kong.According to Asia Times, there were about 36,000 Indians, 18,000 Pakistanis and 25,000 Nepals in Hong Kong, according to the last census in 2016. Many of these people hold foreign or Hong Kong SAR passports.14,645 non-Chinese people applied for Chinese nationality in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2018, according to Immigration Department data. Among the people who applied, only 75 per cent succeeded. The rest were rejected or withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-to-retaliate-against-uk-s-citizenship-offer-for-hong-kong-report-101612675434229.html

Two water cannon trucks were parked nearby.The protesters held placards calling for freedom for Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, who were put under house arrest and charged with minor offenses, seen by many as providing a legal veneer for their detention.Also read| Quad countries to arrange first meeting, amid China's growing influenceOn Saturday, new military authorities cut most access to the internet, making Twitter and Instagram inaccessible. Facebook had already been blocked earlier in the week — though not completely effectively.The US Embassy called on the military to give up power and restore the democratically elected government, release those detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence.“We support the right of the people of Myanmar to protest in support of the democratically elected government and their right to freely access information,” it said in a tweet.The communication blockade is a stark reminder of the progress Myanmar is in danger of losing after Monday's coup plunged the nation back under direct military rule after a nearly decade-long move toward greater openness and democracy. During Myanmar's previous five decades of military rule, the country was internationally isolated and communication with the outside world strictly controlled.Also read| Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala first woman, African national to head WTOSuu Kyi’s five years as leader since 2015 had been Myanmar's most democratic period despite the military retaining broad powers the continued use of repressive colonial-era laws and the persecution of minority Rohingya Muslims.Sunday's rally came a day after about 1,000 people — factory workers and students prominent among them — marched down a main street in Yangon. They were met by more than 100 riot police.There was no violence reported. Similar-sized demonstrations took place in at least two other areas of Yangon as well as in Mandalay, the second-largest city.

07-02-2021||World||Quad countries to arrange first meeting, amid China's growing influence||Members of the Quad framework- the US, India, Japan and Australia - are working to arrange the first meeting of their leaders amid China's growing clout in the region, reported the Japan Times.The move comes as the US President Joe Biden's new administration appears eager to build on renewed attention to the grouping of the four major Indo-Pacific democracies, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan calling it "a foundation upon which to build substantial American policy in the Indo-Pacific", reported the daily quoting a source.According to the source, the US has already proposed to other countries the idea of holding an online meeting of the Quad leaders.During the envisioned meeting, the Quad members are expected to discuss cooperation for the realisation of a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" amid concerns over China's maritime assertiveness in the region. It is speculated that China may react with displeasure to the meeting.The Japan Times reported that for the first time under the Quad framework, the foreign ministers of the four countries met in New York in 2019. The four countries held another meeting last year in Tokyo during the Covid-19 pandemic.During the October meeting, then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reprimanded the dragon (China) for using its economic power to increase its hegemony over the neighbouring countries in South Asia.Pompeo brought to the forum a denunciation of China's "exploitation, corruption, and coercion" of neighbouring countries. He said, "This is for the soul of the world. This is about whether this will be a world that operates in this sense that we're on a rules-based international order system or one that's dominated by a coercive totalitarian regime like the one in China."The Quad initiative is expected to put an end to the economic coercion tactics of China and cooperation with Japan and other allies will checkmate Chinese development assistance and its hegemony in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-countries-to-arrange-first-meeting-amid-china-s-growing-influence-101612661682842.html
07-02-2021||World||Thailand reluctant to join Covax program on strict conditions||The Thai government won’t procure Covid-19 vaccines through the World Health Organization-backed Covax program for now because the conditions are too strict. The move may put the country at risk of getting delayed vaccines at higher prices.Under the program, Thailand would be charged extra for booking and it would have limitations on the producers and delivery period. Covax also requires a minimum purchase of 10% of a country’s population for a fast order with conditions and costs, Nakorn Premsri, director of Thailand’s National Vaccine Institute, said in a statement late Saturday.“Acquiring the vaccines directly from the producers will be more flexible because we can decide how much we will buy and also negotiate pricing, which may lead to a cheaper price for large orders,” Nakorn said. Still, negotiations are continuing. With acceptable conditions, Thailand might procure the vaccine through the Covax program in the future.Thailand reported 490 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, increasing the nation’s total to 23,134. Of those, 18,897 infections have been reported since mid-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-reluctant-to-join-covax-program-on-strict-conditions-101612662768127.html
07-02-2021||World||Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala first woman, African national to head World Trade Organisation||Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was poised to become the first African and first woman to lead the embattled World Trade Organization, after a South Korean rival withdrew on Friday and the United States reversed its previous opposition.The government of President Joe Biden expressed its strong support for Okonjo-Iweala in a statement late Friday, lauding her experience at the World Bank and leading Nigeria's finance ministry, and pledging to work with her on needed reforms.The twin developments ended months of uncertainty over the leadership of the global trade body, and cleared the way for WTO members to conclude a consensus-based process and confirm Okonjo-Iweala as the next WTO director-general.The US administration of former President Donald Trump had blocked Okonjo-Iweala's candidacy after a WTO selection panel recommended her as chief in October. The decision required consensus.Okonjo-Iweala said she was looking forward to the conclusion of the race and moving forward with needed reforms."There is vital work ahead to do together," the former World Bank executive said in a statement.The US Trade Representative's office said it was ready to get work with Okonjo-Iweala, noting she was "widely respected for her effective leadership and ... proven experience managing a large international organization with a diverse membership.""The Biden Administration looks forward to working with a new WTO Director General to find paths forward to achieve necessary substantive and procedural reform of the WTO," it said. Last week it also pledged a commitment to "positive, constructive and active engagement" on reforms.The Geneva-based watchdog has gone without a director-general since Brazil's Roberto Azevedo quit a year early in August and his replacement must contend with a Covid-induced recession, US-China tensions and rising protectionism.South Korea's trade minister Yoo Myung-hee, a finalist selected from among eight candidates, on Friday withdrew her name after months of diplomatic pressure to bow out."In order to promote the functions of WTO and in consideration of various factors, I have decided to withdraw my candidacy," Yoo said in a statement. She said her decision was made after consulting with allies including the United States.Waiting for WashingtonObservers say the leaderless WTO is facing the deepest crisis in its 25-year history. It has not clinched a major multilateral trade deal in years and failed to hit a 2020 deadline on ending subsidies for overfishing.Many hope the change in US administration will lead to meaningful reforms of the WTO. Some of its functions are paralyzed after the Trump administration blocked judge appointments to its top appeals body.Okonjo-Iweala has previously stressed the need for the WTO to play a role in helping poorer countries with Covid-19 drugs and vaccines -- an issue on which members have failed to agree in ongoing negotiations.The WTO could in theory call a meeting of its 164 members to confirm the next chief at short notice.However, some delegates saw that as unlikely given that Biden's choice of trade representative, Katherine Tai, has not yet been sworn in. Nor has a Geneva-based deputy been selected.The International Chamber of Commerce's John Denton urged WTO members to act quickly."With geopolitical tensions high, the global economy in recession and 'vaccine nationalism' threatening an equitable recovery, there is now no reason for further delay in filling this critical role with the well-qualified candidate at the ready," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerias-ngozi-okonjo-iweala-first-woman-african-national-to-head-world-trade-organisation-101612666594298.html

07-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expand||Myanmar’s new military authorities appeared to have cut most access to the internet on Saturday as they faced a rising tide of protest over their coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government.Numerous internet users noted a slow disappearance of data services, especially from mobile service providers, that accelerated sharply late Saturday morning. Broadband connection also later failed, while there were mixed reports on whether landline telephone service and mobile voice connections were still working.Netblocks, a London-based service that tracks internet disruptions, said Saturday afternoon that “a near-total internet shutdown is now in effect" in Myanmar, with connectivity falling to just 16% of normal levels.The broad outage followed Friday's military order to block Twitter and Instagram because some people were trying to use the platforms to spread what authorities deemed fake news. Facebook had already been blocked earlier in the week — though not completely effectively.The communication blackout is a stark reminder of the progress Myanmar is in danger of losing after Monday's coup plunged the nation back under direct military rule after a nearly decade-long move toward greater openness and democracy. During Myanmar's previous five decades of military rule, the country was internationally isolated and communication with the outside world strictly controlled.Suu Kyi’s five years as leader since 2015 had been Myanmar's most democratic period despite the military retaining broad powers over the government, the continued use of repressive colonial-era laws and the persecution of minority Rohingya Muslims.The blockages are also adding greater urgency to efforts to resist the coup. In one of the largest protests so far, about 1,000 people — factory workers and students prominent among them — marched down a main street in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, and were met by more than 100 police in riot gear.They shouted “down with dictatorship” and other slogans, marched with their hands in the air and flashed three-fingered salutes, a symbol of defiance adopted from protesters in neighboring Thailand. There was no violence reported.Similar-sized demonstrations took place in at least two other areas of the city. At Yangon’s City Hall, protesters presented flowers to police, some of whom carried assault rifles.Other reports that slipped through the communications blockade said protests were held in other cities, including Mandalay, the second largest.Telenor Myanmar, a major mobile operator, confirmed it had received Friday's order to block Twitter and Instagram. In a statement, Twitter said it was “deeply concerned” about the order and vowed to “advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns.”“It undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard,” its spokesperson said.Since the coup, social media platforms have been major sources of independent news as well as organizing tools for protests.Amnesty International called the shutdown “a heinous and reckless decision” at a time when Myanmar was coping with the coup, years of civil conflict and the COVID-19 crisis.Those opposed to the coup and the arrests of activists and politicians have also been gathering at night at windows and on balconies around Yangon, banging on pots and pans.On Friday, nearly 300 elected lawmakers from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party who met in an online meeting declared themselves as the sole legitimate representatives of the people and asked for international recognition as the country’s government.They were supposed to have taken their seats Monday in a new session of Parliament following November elections when the military announced it was taking power for a year.The military accused Suu Kyi and her party of failing to act on its complaints that last November’s election was marred by fraud, though the election commission said it had no found no evidence to support the claims.Suu Kyi and President Win Myint are also under house arrest and have been charged with minor offenses, seen by many as merely providing a legal veneer for their detention.In addition to the 134 officials and lawmakers who were detained in the coup, some 18 independent activists were also held, said the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Myanmar. Some have been since released.The office of Australia's foreign minister said in a statement Saturday that the government was “deeply concerned about reports of Australian and other foreign nationals being detained arbitrarily in Myanmar.”The statement said the government was concerned in particular about one Australian who was detained at a police station. The statement did not provide details on the identities of those being held or the reasons for their detention.In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pledged Friday that the United Nations will do everything it can to unite the international community and create conditions for the military coup in Myanmar to be reversed.Guterres said Christine Schraner Burgener, the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, had a first contact with the military since the coup and expressed the U.N.’s strong opposition to the takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-blocks-internet-access-as-coup-protests-expand-101612661679184.html
07-02-2021||World||Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer taking on Donald Trump and the far-right||"I don't really like a bully," says Roberta Kaplan, explaining what drove her to become a lawyer - and is what is driving her now to sue Donald Trump and figures on the American far-right, even though it has led to multiple threats against her.The 54-year-old rose to fame in 2013 with victory in the Supreme Court in the Edie Windsor case, in which it declared unconstitutional a federal law limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman.The ruling paved the way for legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015.Armed with this fame and multiple professional distinctions, the Harvard and Columbia graduate, whose wife is a Democratic activist, is now at the forefront of several legal battles against Trump.Co-founder of the Time's Up movement that provides legal aid to victims of sexual assault, Kaplan has sued Trump for defamation on behalf of former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.Carroll has said she was raped by Trump in a New York department store in the mid-1990s.Trump denied the accusation, saying "she's not my type" and calling Carroll a liar, which prompted the defamation suit.Two friends that Carroll confided in at the time are expected to testify and Kaplan is confident her client will win.Kaplan, a commercial litigation specialist, represents a group of plaintiffs who invested in a marketing company called "ACN" that they accuse Trump and his children of fraudulently promoting.Kaplan also represents Trump's niece Mary Trump, who accuses the former president and his brother and sister of depriving her of part of the family inheritance."In all these cases, Trump has acted like a terrible bully, quite frankly," Kaplan told AFP in an interview over Zoom.She says it will take "a lot of patience and stubbornness" to defeat the former president, adding "he's willing and ready to use literally every trick in the book to stall and delay and play games."Beyond Trump, Kaplan is also leading the only civil action against the main neo-Nazis and white supremacists involved in the Charlottesville violence in August 2017.The trial is scheduled to begin in October."I really wish that I had been wrong about seeing Charlottesville as I did -- as a very scary and ominous warning of what was happening in this country and what was yet to come," said Kaplan.- Anti-Semitic attacks -The January 6 assault on the US Capitol proved that the right-wing forces at work in Charlottesville "have continued to grow" and now represent "the single most significant threat to the security of our country," she added.They are a threat to her personal security too, with a private company providing her with daily reports on threats circulating against her on social networks."I'm an open lesbian, I'm a New Yorker. I'm a woman. I'm head of Time's Up. There's a lot of things that people outside might want to criticize me for."But the thing that's been truly shocking to me is the vast majority of the statements they make is about the fact that I'm Jewish. They put up cartoons of me on the web that literally look like Nazi cartoons about Jews from the 1930s," she said.Other threats come from unlikely sources. As the one-time lawyer of Amber Heard, the ex-wife of actor Johnny Depp, Kaplan has felt the wrath of fans of "Pirates of the Caribbean."The election of Joe Biden makes her optimistic about the future, though.She says his administration is aware of the threat posed by domestic right-wing extremists."They (FBI agents) were very successful in infiltrating some of the jihadi terrorist groups after 9/11. It should be easier to infiltrate domestic American terrorist groups," said Kaplan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roberta-kaplan-the-lawyer-taking-on-donald-trump-and-the-farright-101612662724861.html

After a moment, he leaped out and rushed toward the officer. Several shots were fired and the man collapsed in the street.A local judge ordered the officer, who was not identified, held for investigation for two days.The video angered some in the country, which has seen repeated controversies over allegations of police brutality against protesters in recent years. The National Human Rights Institute says that more than 450 people suffered eye damage from supposedly non-lethal projectiles fired by police during street protests that erupted in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-sets-off-fiery-protests-in-southern-chile-101612661604371.html
07-02-2021||World||Where Did Covid-19 Come From? Investigator Foreshadows Fresh Clues||Scientists probing the origins of the coronavirus are wrapping up a lengthy investigation in China and have found “important clues” about a Wuhan seafood market’s role in the outbreak.Peter Daszak, a New York-based zoologist assisting the World Health Organization-sponsored mission, said he anticipates the main findings will be released before his planned February 10 departure. Speaking from the central city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 mushroomed in December 2019, Daszak said the 14-member group worked with experts in China and visited key hot spots and research centers to uncover “some real clues about what happened.”Investigators want to know how the SARS-CoV-2 virus -whose closest known relative came from bats 1,000 miles away -- spread explosively in Wuhan before causing the worst contagion in more than a century. Daszak said the investigation heralds a turning point in pandemic mitigation.“It’s the beginning of hopefully a really deep understanding of what happened so we can stop the next one,” he said over Zoom late Friday. “That’s what this is all about -- trying to understand why these things emerge so we don’t continually have global economic crashes and horrific mortality while we wait for vaccines. It’s just not a tenable future.”Read more: What We Don’t Know About Coronavirus Origins Might Kill UsWorldwide, Covid-19 has caused more than 105.7 million infections and 2.3 million deaths.The WHO was asked in May to help “identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts.”Lab TheoryThe lack of a clear pathway from bats to humans has stoked speculation - refuted by Daszak and many other scientists - that the virus might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum bio-containment laboratory studying bat-borne coronaviruses.Read more: Creature from 'Black Lagoon’: CDC warns of fungal infectionScientists visited the lab and asked Shi Zhengli, who has collected and analyzed these viruses for more than a decade, about the research and the earliest known coronavirus cases.‘Whole Gamut’“We really have to cover the whole gamut of key lines of investigation,” Daszak said. “To be fair to our hosts here in China, they’ve been doing the same for the last few months. They’ve been working behind the scenes, digging up the information, looking at it and getting it ready.”The work has been “collaborative,” with Chinese counterparts helping mission investigators dig deeper for clues, he said.“We sat down with them every single day and went through information, new data, and then said we want to go to the key places,” the British scientist said. “They asked for a list. We suggested where we should go and the people we should meet. We went to every place on that list and they were really forthcoming with that.”Daszak is one of 10 independent experts assisting the WHO mission. The agency also has five staff members participating, and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health have two each.Joining ThreadsMission delegates worked in three groups that focused on the potential involvement of animals, the epidemiology or spread of the disease, and the findings from environmental sampling. Genetic sequencing data are helping investigators identify threads linking the information across patients and wildlife, Daszak said.“My feeling is we will be able to say something of some value at the end of this trip -- quite a lot of value, but I don’t want to get into what that’s going to be or which way it points,” he said, adding that the group’s findings are confidential until they are released publicly.Daszak, who was focused on the animal side, said his trip to the Huanan fresh produce market in central Wuhan was especially useful.The so-called wet market sold mostly seafood, as well as meat that included freshly prepared wildlife. It was a focus early in the outbreak, when cases occurred among workers and shoppers, suggesting it might have been where the virus jumped from animals to humans.‘Important Clues’Subsequent research found earlier cases among people not linked to the market, undermining that theory. Investigators looked further and found “important clues” about the market’s role, Daszak said, declining to elaborate.“Right now, we’re trying to tease everything together,” he said. “We’ve looked at these three strands separately. Now we’re going to bring it together and see what everything tells us.”While the food market was shuttered and cleaned almost immediately after cases were recognized, “it’s still pretty intact,” Daszak said. “People left in a hurry and they left equipment, they left utensils, they left evidence of what was going on, and that’s what we looked at.”Scientists in China who took environmental samples inside the market identified sites where traces of SARS-CoV-2 were detected, he said. Investigators also benefited from greater understanding of Covid-19.“We know now what we didn’t know then -- that for every sick case, there were others that were asymptomatic or difficult to distinguish from a cold or cough,” Daszak said. “And so it’s not unexpected that there would have been other cases other than ones that got into hospital. But how many others, when did this start? That’s the sort of thing we’re still working on.”Viruses are passed along “convoluted rivers of emergence” and tracing that journey is complicated and will take “a really long time,” Daszak said. “What I have seen already tells me that there are some real clues about what happened, and I hope that we’ll be able to make a solid explanation of that by the end of this trip.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-did-covid-19-come-from-investigator-foreshadows-fresh-clues-101612659393973.html

"The urgency of that also cannot be overstated."When asked about recent hacks by Chinese and Russian groups of U.S. government computer systems, Majorkas said the administration was working with Congress to see what additional funding could be provided to enhance the security of federal infrastructure and information systems, as well as through public-private partnerships.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Daniel Wallis)Also read: Ex-Homeland security official Alejandro Mayorkas returns under Joe Biden||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-homeland-security-czar-vows-to-fight-domestic-terrorism-101612658159050.html

The United States will build on our strong relationships and support these governments' efforts to address forced displacement without placing undue burden on them, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our approach will continue to provide support for their national action plans under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework through international humanitarian partners," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-moves-to-reverse-trump-s-migration-agreements-101612658562621.html

07-02-2021||World||Joe Biden cleared to exercise after recent dog-playing foot fracture||President Joe Biden got a clean bill of health on Saturday after followup X-rays on his foot, which he fractured while playing with one of his dogs in November.“This injury has healed as expected, and he will return to his usual exercise regimen,” Dr. Kevin O’Connor, physician to the president, said in a statement. Both of Biden’s small fractures have completely healed, he said.The president’s motorcade stopped at Delaware Orthopaedic Specialists on Saturday afternoon for what O’Connor called a “regularly scheduled 10-week post-injury weight-bearing X-ray.”Biden, 78, injured his right foot while playing with one of his German Shepherds, Major, over the Thanksgiving weekend.O’Connor said Biden had been “adhering to a strict physical therapy regimen” since the injury.“Sprains of the foot can sometimes be a more significant injury than the bony fractures which accompany them,” he said. Saturday’s X-rays were “to check to assure that he has achieved good ligamentous stability.”Major and Biden’s other dog, Champ, will make an appearance during the Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet on Sunday.The dogs and first lady Jill Biden were filmed for a public service announcement focused on the importance of wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic that will air during the Puppy Bowl, a preamble to the Super Bowl.The annual event is focused on raising awareness about pet adoption. The Bidens adopted Major from the Delaware Humane Association in 2018 and he’s the first shelter dog to live in the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-cleared-to-exercise-after-recent-dog-playing-foot-fracture-101612656955688.html

Fifty-three years later, the 91-year-old has the wallet back along with mementos of his 13-month assignment as a US Navy meteorologist on Antarctica in the 1960s.“I was just blown away,” Grisham said told San Diego Union-Tribune after the wallet was handed over to him on January 30.At their home in the San Carlos neighbourhood of San Diego, California, Grisham and his wife Carole Salazar look at the items that were inside when he lost the wallet back in 1968 – his Navy ID card and an “Atomic, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Pocket Reference” card among others.Grisham, who joined the Navy in 1948, was sent to Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze, which supported scientists. He lost the brown leather wallet sometime in 1968 and forgot about it later. In 2014, it was found behind a locker during the demolition of a building at McMurdo station on Ross Island.It took a team of amateur detectives -- Stephen Decato and his daughter Sarah Lindbergh, from US’s New Hampshire, and Bruce McKee of the NGO Indiana Spirit of ’45 -- to track down Grisham. The three have previously worked to return a stolen bracelet to a Navy veteran, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune report.Decato had, in the past, worked for an agency that does research in Antarctica and was sent the wallet by his former boss, George Blaisdell. Decato’s daughter eventually tracked down Grisham through the Naval Weather Service Association, so he could receive 53 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wallet-lost-in-antarctica-found-53-years-later-101612646955503.html
