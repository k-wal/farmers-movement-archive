By raising that climate cash, rich countries "are really serving their own purposes".If emissions continue to rise in the developing world and a green transformation does not happen, then all the efforts made to reduce greenhouse gases in richer countries "will be negatively affected", she warned.Countries hit by virus-driven economic slowdown could make limited budgets do double duty by ensuring stimulus spending drives a global transition to clean energy and more resilience, she said.However, only a fraction of an estimated $13 trillion being poured into the world's economies was earmarked for green aims by the end of 2020, according to research by think-tanks Vivid Economics and Finance for Biodiversity.Among wealthier G20 countries, 15 out of 20 had announced stimulus packages that would have a net negative impact on the environment, the think-tanks said in a December report.But Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE, said a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century was accelerating green investment, including by business."This is the growth story of the 21st century - the drive to net-zero," the noted economist told the event."It is remarkable how fast people are moving," Stern said, but warned less than a decade remained to make the fundamental shifts in the global economy needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change."This decade, until 2030, will be absolutely decisive for our future," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-climate-chief-urges-world-in-a-tough-spot-to-keep-fighting-warming-101612376697183.html

03-02-2021||World||US plans record debt sale; no big changes before new stimulus||The US Treasury held steady its planned issuance of longer-dated securities at a quarterly debt auction next week as the department awaits the result of the Biden administration’s push for a fresh coronavirus relief package.The Treasury already boosted its so-called quarterly refundings in each of the last three quarters, and its stockpile of cash remains near an all-time high. With the outcome of President Joe Biden’s push for a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill uncertain, the department held off on tweaking its issuance of longer-dated securities.Officials followed through on plans detailed in November to lift auctions of inflation-linked securities this year. The Treasury also said it will reduce bill issuance, which surged as it rushed to fund pandemic-related spending. The aim now is to bring the share of bills in the nation’s debt back toward historic norms.The Treasury will sell $126 billion in long-term debt next week, broken down as follows:The debt management team also said it won’t be expanding sales of any other tenors of nominal coupon-bearing debt over the quarter. Officials didn’t specify the amount by which bill supply will fall over the period. In August, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee recommended allowing the share of T-bills to fall gradually to a range of 15% to 20% of outstanding debt -- compared with nearly 24% now.The majority of Wall Street bond dealers had predicted the Treasury would make no changes to nominal coupon-bearing debt auctions. Yet, given the reprieve from the onslaught of ever increasing long-term debt supply, the yield curve did flatten slightly after the announcement. The gap between five- and 30-year yields narrowed briefly, before widening back toward the widest since 2016.The Treasury pushed forward with the initiative it started in January to increase sales of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities compared with last year’s auction sizes:The department held off on making a decision on debt linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the heir presumptive to Libor as a benchmark for short-term dollar lending rates. The government has been analyzing the idea for months, and said Wednesday it “continues to actively explore the possibility” of SOFR-linked issuance.Meantime, the Treasury is following through on expanded floating-rate note sales, after boosting its new-issue FRN last month by $2 billion. The reopenings planned for February and March will also rise by $2 billion each, bringing them to $26 billion per auction. No other FRN changes were announced.On Monday, the Treasury as part of its quarterly borrowing estimates said it would reduce its cash balance to $800 billion by the end of March and to $500 billion by June, from about $1.6 trillion now.The Treasury in 2015 instituted a policy of keeping the equivalent of at least five days’ worth of expenditures, or a minimum of $150 billion, in the cash account in case unexpected disruptions locked it out of debt markets. Before that, the Treasury kept enough cash for just two days. As budget deficits had begun to soar even prior to the pandemic, so has the size of the cash buffer.Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, told reporters Wednesday that the 2015 cash-balance policy “still holds.”“We are still looking to make sure we can meet any outflows in the case of a market disruption -- generally targeting a week of outflows,” Smith told reporters. “It’s really the size of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 outbreak that has changed the situation” for now.That cash balance will be drawn down over coming months in part by trimming bill issuance. The Treasury said it’s modifying the “cadence” of its shortest-dated securities, called cash management bills, or CMBs.Cutting the cash balance also gets the government ready for the risk of a protracted battle over the debt limit, with the current suspension set to expire at the end of July. By law, the Treasury has to shrink its cash to the level when the suspension was put in place, back in 2019.“The debt ceiling looms large,” Zachary Griffiths, a rates strategist at Wells Fargo wrote in a note with his colleagues on Wednesday. Getting the cash balance down to the mandated level of roughly $120 billion “will be particularly challenging,” the group wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-record-debt-sale-no-big-changes-before-new-stimulus-101612368332254.html
03-02-2021||World||UN court says it can hear case brought by Iran against US||The United Nations' highest court ruled Wednesday that it can hear a case brought by Iran against the United States in a bid to end sanctions the Trump administration re-imposed in 2018 after pulling out of an international deal aimed at curtailing Tehran's nuclear program.Lawyers for the United States argued at hearings last year that the case should be thrown out by the International Court of Justice for lack of jurisdiction and admissibility.However, the court's president, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, said that judges rejected U.S. arguments.Iran filed the case in July 2018 a few months after then-President Donald Trump said he was pulling the U.S. out of a 2015 international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don’t cut off Iranian oil imports by early November.In its case, Iran alleges that the sanctions breach a 1955 bilateral agreement known as the Treaty of Amity that regulates and promotes economic and consular ties between the two countries.The ruling Wednesday comes as new President Joe Biden is seeking to enhance diplomacy toward Iran while Washington looks at restoring constraints on the country’s nuclear program and reining in its regional ambitions.Secretary of State Antony Blinken appointed a new special envoy for Iran on Friday as Biden’s national security adviser said that restoring limits on the Iranian nuclear program is a top administration priority.The court based in The Hague had ruled in favor of Iran at an earlier stage, saying in a preliminary ruling in October 2018, that Washington should “remove, by means of its choosing, any impediments arising from” the re-imposition of sanctions to the export to Iran of medicine and medical devices, food and agricultural commodities and spare parts and equipment necessary to ensure the safety of civil aviation.The Trump administration responded by pulling out of the treaty.“The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time, we ought to have pulled out of it decades ago,” then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department at the time.Now that the court has ruled it can hear the case, it will likely take years to reach a conclusion. Rulings by the world court, which settles disputes between nations, are final and legally binding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-court-says-it-can-hear-case-brought-by-iran-against-us-101612365320111.html
03-02-2021||World||World Economic Forum again delays annual meeting in Singapore||The World Economic Forum has again pushed back its 2021 annual meeting in Singapore, rescheduling it for August from May given what it called "challenges in containing the pandemic".The Geneva-based WEF, which last month delayed the event by 12 days in May, said on Wednesday it would now be held from Aug. 17-20."Although the World Economic Forum and Government of Singapore remain confident of the measures in place to ensure a safe and effective meeting, and local transmission of Covid-19 in Singapore remains at negligible levels, the change to the meeting's timing reflects the international challenges in containing the pandemic," it said in a statement.Global travel restrictions have made planning difficult for an in-person meeting in the first half of the year, while differing quarantine and air transport regulations increased the lead time needed to ensure participants can join, it added.Singapore's ministry of trade and industry said the government understood the challenges the WEF faced and had agreed to reschedule.The annual meeting typically takes place in January in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, but the pandemic made that impossible this year.

03-02-2021||World||EU faces 100 billion-euro price tag for bungled vaccine push||The European Union is facing a cost of tens of billions of euros for the slow and chaotic rollout of coronavirus vaccinations compared to countries such as the U.K. and U.S.Lockdowns mean the bloc’s economy is operating at about 95% of its pre-pandemic level, equating to about 12 billion euros ($14 billion) a week of lost output, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics. It’s also weeks behind its peers in inoculations, and progressing at a slower pace.Unless it can make up ground, the EU will be forced to keep lockdowns or similar restrictions in place even as other major economies get fully back to work. A delay of 1-2 months would amount to a 50-100 billion-euro blow.The numbers highlight the massive stakes for the European Commission, which became embroiled in a public standoff with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc over supply curbs before imposing export restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines. That turned into a U-turn for President Ursula von der Leyen over shipments into Northern Ireland.“Every week that the lockdown has to be extended because the population isn’t vaccinated and vulnerable means substantial economic costs,” said Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “Those costs are a lot higher than the costs of the vaccinations themselves.”So far, the EU has administered just 3 doses per 100 people, far behind the 15 in the U.K. and 10 in the U.S., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. In the meantime, more contagious strains of the coronavirus are spreading, forcing governments to extend lockdowns.“The U.K.’s early progress means we expect a vigorous economic recovery to take root sooner than in mainland Europe,” said Jamie Rush, chief European economist at Bloomberg Economics. “The higher transmissibility of new Covid-19 strains is prompting tougher containment measures in much of Europe, raising the cost of vaccine delays.”The EU predicts a surge in vaccine supply in the second quarter, and still plans to have 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the summer. That’s a level that should allow governments to lift many of the current restrictions that have shut down shops, restaurants and travel.Yet Allianz SE estimates that countries are five weeks behind with respect to meeting that target, and vaccinations need to happen at six times the current pace to catch up. It puts the cost at 90 billion euros, taking into account knock-on effects later in the year.“In vaccine economics there is only black or white: Economies that finish the race first will be rewarded with strong positive multiplier effects supercharging consumption and investment activity in the second half of 2021,” economists led by Ludovic Subran said in a report. “Vaccination laggards will remain stuck in crisis mode and face substantial costs -- economic as well as political.”Southern countries including Spain and Italy -- already the worst-affected by the pandemic -- will suffer most from a delay if it hits international tourism. Even a partial opening around the Easter holidays at the beginning of April would bring much-needed revenue, according to Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS Group AG.“With the slow progress on vaccinations, it’s not clear we’ll have a good Easter season,” he said, adding that the summer is also under threat, as many travelers books their holidays in the spring and may opt to stay closer to home for another year.Each extra week the economy is subject to restrictions also increases the risk that companies that ate into their financial buffers for the last year will be pushed over the edge and file for insolvency. That would raise unemployment and undermine the prospect of rapid rebound.The EU could still catch up with its peers, or all nations could yet be plunged into another crisis, for example if further coronavirus mutations emerge that are resistant to the current vaccines.On current form though, the likelihood is that continental Europe is headed for a painful reckoning.“To the extent that we don’t get the necessary run rates in the coming weeks and months, our concerns will rise on a daily basis,” said Cluse.(Updates with vaccination rates, comment from Bloomberg Economics starting in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-faces-100-billion-euro-price-tag-for-bungled-vaccine-push-101612341463977.html

The military coup took place at a time when Bangladesh was spearheading a desperate campaign for safe return of some 1.1 million Rohingyas.Momen said Dhaka wants to continue talks with Myanmar for "advancing the ongoing process to commence Rohingya repatriation"."Our discussion will continue with the Myanmar government, not with any individual,” he said. "We did the agreement (regarding repatriation) with the Myanmar government, not with any individual… (so) the (repatriation) process should be continued."Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, who fled Myanmar facing military crackdown, often considered as "ethnic cleansing" by many rights groups.In an immediate reaction after the military takeover, Dhaka issued a statement saying “as an immediate and friendly neighbour, we would like to see peace and stability in Myanmar.”Bangladesh firmly adheres to and promotes democratic ethos, it added.Momen said Rohingya repatriation remained to be Dhaka's top agenda in its relations with Myanmar."The border situation remains normal but we have enforced an extra security vigil to prevent any fresh Rohingya influx," BGB's 34 battalion's commander Lieutenant Colonel Ali Haidar Azad said in Cox's Bazar.Another BGB official at the frontier town said Bangladesh border guards were "kept alert" as "we will not allow any influx from Myanmar"."We understand the international pressures on Myanmar army. If the pressure mounts, they will be forced to take us back," a Rohingya representative, Nur Hossain of Leda Camp, said.Rohingya leader at Jutupalang camp Saiful Islam said the "Burmese military forced us to flee our homes, but we are concerned as they took over the total control".The minister said in previous such influxes repartitions took place in 1978 and 1992 under the Myanmar’s military government and "if that time they could do so, why not this time".On January 19, the secretary level tripartite meeting among Bangladesh, China and Myanmar decided to hold the next joint working group meeting on February 4 for advancing the discussion about commencing repatriation of Rohingyas.But, the meeting scheduled on Thursday is uncertain as Dhaka did not communicate with Myanmar officially after the coup."We were not able to contact with Myanmar as still their (Myanmar's new authority) communication is shut down," the minster said.In the last three years, Myanmar did not take back a single Rohingya despite its pledges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-intensifies-vigil-along-its-border-with-myanmar-101612370458446.html

Kozak is the listed owner of the three TV channels covered, which Ukrainian media said were associated with Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent opposition figure seen as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin."These media have become one of the tools of the war against Ukraine, so they are blocked in order to protect national security," Zelenskiy's spokeswoman Iuliia Mendel said on Facebook.She said Ukraine had evidence the channels received funding from Russia. The channels have not commented on that accusation.Zelenskiy said in a tweet that the sanction had been a difficult decision and that Ukraine supported freedom of speech but not "propaganda financed by the aggressor country".Kyiv and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.Kozak and Medvedchuk both condemned the move as illegal."President Zelenskiy threw 1,500 journalists and employees of three TV channels into the street and deprived millions of viewers of the right to receive objective information," Medvedchuk said on his website.The sanctions against Kozak were imposed for a period of five years and limit his ability to use and dispose of property and withdraw capital from Ukraine, as well as revoking the licences he holds for the TV channels.The media organisations and TV channels are prohibited from broadcasting and their assets blocked."We regard this decision ... as a political reprisal against objectionable media," channels 112 Ukraine, NewsOne and ZiK said in a joint statement.All three channels went off air on Wednesday morning.Ukraine's move drew criticism from Russia."By shutting down opposition television channels, Zelenskiy acknowledged his inability to withstand political competition," prominent Russian senator Alexei Pushkov wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by Pavel Polityuk; Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets in Kyiv and Andrew Osborn in Moscow; Editing by Alex Richardson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraines-president-imposes-sanctions-against-pro-russian-media-101612344997129.html

Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden all breached particulate matter limits, while France had illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.In a case brought by the Commission in 2018, the court ruled that Hungary had breached limits on particulate matter pollution from 2005 to 2017 in Budapest and the northeast Sajo river valley region, and in the southwest city of Pecs from 2011 to 2017, with the exception of 2014.The court also said that, since 2010, Hungary had failed to ensure that breaches were kept as short as possible.The ruling orders Hungary to comply or face potential further legal action by the Commission to impose financial penalties.The court acknowledged Hungary did adopt air quality plans - but it said these plans did not require fast action to rein in particulate matter.Particulate matter is produced by industry and vehicle emissions, as well as some agriculture, and is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.In Hungary, 13,100 premature deaths were attributed to fine particulate matter in 2018, according to the European Environment Agency. Per capita, such fatalities in Hungary were the same as the Czech Republic and Greece, and behind only Bulgaria and Poland in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-systematically-breached-eu-air-pollution-limits-says-court-101612351401460.html
03-02-2021||World||UK says 10 million people have received coronavirus vaccine||Ten million people in the UK have been given coronavirus vaccine, as the government’s program to immunize the most vulnerable groups makes rapid progress.The milestone puts the country on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk from the disease by Feb. 15, potentially paving the way for ministers to begin easing lockdown restrictions.“It’s fantastic that 10 million people in the UK have got their first dose of the vaccine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet. “Thank you to everyone who has helped make this possible.”The rapid roll out of coronavirus vaccines is a rare bright spot for the UK government in its handling of the pandemic, which has left more than 100,000 people dead and caused the deepest recession for more than 300 years.InfectionsThe country is a month into its third national lockdown, and while death rates and hospitalization numbers have declined in recent days, medics are still battling high levels of infections.Johnson is under mounting pressure to ease restrictions from lockdown skeptics in his own party who fear shutting up businesses and schools will inflict lasting scars on the economy and society. News that vaccines are effective at cutting transmission of the disease has fueled their argument.“With better and better news by the day on the vaccination roll out and its effectiveness, the government has got to start addressing its mind to the harms caused by the measures we’re putting in place,” said Mark Harper, chairman of the so-called Covid Recovery Group of Conservative members of Parliament. “Lockdowns and restrictions cause immense damage to people’s health and livelihoods and we need to lift them as soon as it is safe to do so.”Johnson has promised to review the pandemic response after the priority groups have been given vaccines and said he will publish a roadmap in the week of Feb. 22 for lifting lockdown. Schools will be the first facilities to reopen in England, starting no earlier than March 8 under the government’s plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-10-million-people-have-received-coronavirus-vaccine-101612366040170.html

Its efficacy is between 79 to 86 per cent,” he said, adding that 70 per cent of the population would be vaccinated by the end of the year.He said presently over 500 vaccine centres were administering the vaccines with a capacity of 40,000 people per day and that the capacity would be increased soon.Pakistan's Covid-19 death toll stood at 11,802 on Wednesday, after 56 fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours.In the same period, 1,384 new cases were reported, taking the total number of cases to 549,032, according to the ministry of National Health Services.So far, 504,046 people have recovered from the disease in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-kickstarts-countrywide-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101612361653009.html

He later collapsed and died.The Senate next week will begin an impeachment trial of Trump over his alleged role in inciting the deadly mob, which walked to the Capitol from a political rally near the White House after the former president exhorted them to protest the count. Trump’s lawyers are arguing that his impeachment trial is “substantively flawed,” unconstitutional and should be dismissed.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced last week said that Sicknick, 42, would lie in honor in the Capitol’s rotunda. Two Capitol Police officers who were killed in 1998 when a gunman entered the building and opened fire were given similar recognition.“The heroism of Officer Sicknick and the Capitol Police force during the violent insurrection against our Capitol helped save lives, defend the temple of our democracy and ensure that the Congress was not diverted from our duty to the Constitution,” the Democratic lawmakers said in a statement. “His sacrifice reminds us every day of our obligation to our country and to the people we serve.”A viewing period for members of the Capitol Police was scheduled for Tuesday night, and Sicknick will be interred Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-visit-capitol-pay-respects-to-officer-killed-in-riot-101612360201926.html
03-02-2021||World||‘Regrettable’: Japan on Sri Lanka not sticking to trilateral deal for port||Japan on Wednesday said it was “regrettable” that the Sri Lankan government had opted to hand over the operations of a key port terminal in Colombo to a state-run body instead of sticking to a trilateral agreement involving India for the development of the facility.The position taken by Japan endorsed India’s stance on the development of the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. New Delhi had on Tuesday asked Colombo to abide by the agreement signed by the three countries in 2019.The Sri Lankan government gave in to pressure from labour unions, which opposed a joint venture with Indian and Japanese investors having a 49% stake in the ECT, and the cabinet decided on Monday to run the facility as a fully owned operation of the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA).“It is regrettable that the government of Sri Lanka unilaterally made a cabinet decision and announced the development and operation of ECT as a wholly owned container terminal of Sri Lanka Ports Authority,” said an official of the Japanese embassy in New Delhi.“We are aware of the cabinet decision by the government of Sri Lanka and looking into the details,” the official said.Japan, India and Sri Lanka “have been discussing the details about the cooperation on ECT” since the three countries signed a memorandum of cooperation (MOC) for developing the terminal in May 2019, the official added.The reaction from the Japanese side came a day after Indian high commissioner Gopal Baglay held separate meetings with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawerdene in Colombo to convey India’s position that the Sri Lanka must abide by the trilateral agreement, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.India’s Adani Group and several Japanese investors were to form a joint venture to hold 49% stake in the ECT, with the majority stake in the hands of SLPA. The Indian side also made it clear to the Sri Lanka side that the latest decision on ECT could affect investor confidence, the people said.The Indian high commission in Colombo has called for the “expeditious implementation” of the trilateral agreement and said: “All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment.”The Sri Lankan government has said it will allow the development of the West Container Terminal (WCT) by India and its partners.The agreement for the port terminal was signed by the previous government of president Maithripala Sirisena and has been in trouble since he was voted out of power in 2019. A group of 23 labour unions in Sri Lanka have demanded that ECT should be a 100% government entity. They also described a planned deal with the Adani Group as a sell-out.In a meeting with labour unions on Monday, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said he had announced ECT “will not be handed over to any foreign country or institution”. Following this assurance, the unions agreed to suspend a protest that was to begin on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/regrettable-japan-on-sri-lanka-not-sticking-to-trilateral-deal-for-port-101612359466290.html
03-02-2021||World||Biden team in talks with utilities, car companies about emissions||US President Joe Biden's administration has started discussions with the utility and automobile sectors about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, White House domestic climate change adviser Gina McCarthy told Reuters.The talks are part of a broad effort by the Biden administration that McCarthy will spearhead to engage every federal agency to decarbonize the US power sector by 2035 and the whole economy by 2050.The United States is the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, with the power and transport sectors making up more than half of the emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.McCarthy's first major task will be to come up with a 2030 emission reduction target under the Paris climate agreement before Biden convenes world leaders for a climate summit on April 22."We're already having conversations with the utility world and we're having conversations with the car companies," McCarthy said in an interview."The car companies understand now that the future for them is electric vehicles ... so we're going to be sort of working to make sure that we move forward with some kind of an agreement on that and a strategy to get us out of the gate fast."The White House has met some major automakers - including General Motors Co - as it prepares to begin talks with the industry about revising vehicle emission standards through 2026 or beyond. GM said last week it aimed to sell only electric cars by 2035.She met virtually with the board of the Edison Electric Institute, the main utility lobby, which discussed its "support for recent energy-related executive orders," a spokesman for the group told Reuters.McCarthy will chair a task force composed of the heads of all Cabinet agencies to see what measures can be taken through regulation, budget appropriation and legislation to combat climate change, she said.Input from that task force will help McCarthy come up with a feasible emission reduction target the United States can achieve by 2030 that her international policy counterpart, John Kerry, Biden's special envoy on climate change, can submit to the United Nations.Biden brought the United States back into the international agreement after his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew.Oil and gas companies will also face new proposed limits on methane emissions later this year, she said, after Trump withdrew previous rules late last year.The main US oil lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute, long resisted mandatory methane regulations but lifted its opposition in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-in-talks-with-utilities-car-companies-about-emissions-101612355974843.html

He denied any discussions over competing agendas.In Kabul, deep divisions have emerged between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his political opponents over what some see as Ghani's unwillingness to consider a power-sharing deal with the Taliban that could prematurely end his presidency, before 2024.Ghani's opponents have set up a 21-member parliament committee to possibly meet separately with the Taliban, accusing Ghani of stalling peace talks to remain in power. Ghani's supporters, meanwhile, say the committee us trying to unseat the president.The Pentagon said last week that the Taliban’s refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all U.S. troops will be able to leave by May as required under the U.S.-Taliban deal.The deal calls for all international troops to pull out, but only if the Taliban honor a promise to abandon their connection with terrorist groups — such as al-Qaida — and guarantee that their territory would not be used to attack the U.S. or its allies.“A political settlement needs to happen before the exit of foreign troops because after their exit, chances of agreement among Afghans is slim to none,” increasing prospects for a civil war, said Torek Farhadi, a political analyst.The Taliban have threatened to step up their their war if U.S. and NATO troops remain in Afghanistan after the May deadline.Since the agreement signed last February under former President Donald Trump, the Taliban have not attacked U.S. and NATO troops but accuse the U.S. of breaking its promise not to carry out preemptive attacks. The U.S. denies the allegations and says it has responded to Taliban attacks against Afghan security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-on-diplomatic-blitz-after-afghan-peace-talks-stall-101612352526550.html
03-02-2021||World||Covid vaccine Sputnik V turns out to be a scientific and political win for Putin||First greeted with scepticism, experts have since been convinced of the effectiveness of the Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, with positive results published in The Lancet medical journal on Tuesday.The development represents a scientific and political victory for Vladimir Putin's Russia.Putin at the forefrontFrom the first weeks of the pandemic, the Russian president ordered the scientific, political and military apparatus of the country to work in overdrive to develop the world's first Covid vaccine -- even if that meant taking shortcuts.Last spring, Alexander Gintsburg, the director of the state-run Gamaleya research centre that developed Sputnik V, boasted of having personally injected himself with an experimental version of the jab.A few months later, in mid-August, Putin announced the approval of the world's first coronavirus vaccine.With the shot at that point having only been tested by a few dozen volunteers, the proclamation was greeted with scepticism abroad.The vaccine nonetheless soon became available to Russia's elite, including one of Putin's daughters, even before the beginning of Phase III clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers.Russia made the vaccine available to the wider public in December, when Europe and the United States were just deploying the first doses of the vaccines made by their pharmaceutical companies.Global ambitionsFor the Kremlin, the homemade vaccine -- first vilified by the West -- demonstrates Russia's excellence, with Putin having called Sputnik V "the best vaccine in the world".The choice of name for the jab is highly symbolic. A tribute to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, Sputnik V recalls a scientific feat for Russia and a historic setback for its rival the United States.The success of the vaccine restores Russian research capabilities to the world's top echelons, after the sector had been decimated by crises and corruption in the wake of the USSR's collapse in 1991.Sputnik V has been approved in more than 15 countries, including ex-Soviet nations like Belarus and Armenia, allies like Venezuela and Iran, but also Argentina, Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan.Sputnik V in Europe?Last month the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped finance Sputnik V, announced that it had applied for registration of the vaccine in the European Union.But the Russian vaccine has been treated with suspicion due to a lack of publicly available scientific data.Denouncing European delays, Viktor Orban's Hungary sidestepped the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and registered the vaccine on its own.For her part, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered Putin the possibility of "joint production".Production capacity?Russia says it has received pre-orders of more than a billion doses of Sputnik V, but it is unable to meet that level of demand.The quantities of doses that have been delivered abroad have mainly been symbolic, like the 20,000 exported to Bolivia.In some cases the figures were not revealed, while Argentina experienced a shipment delay last month.No official source has made clear how many doses have been produced or deployed, though authorities in mid-January said that 1.5 million people had been inoculated with Sputnik V around the world.Rather than exporting Sputnik V in bulk, Moscow hopes to develop production partnerships with local factories.Brazil, India, Kazakhstan and South Korea are currently producing the jab, though not all them have made it available to the public yet.Other Russian vaccinesAt least three more Russian coronavirus vaccines are expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks.Sputnik V -- a two-dose vaccine using adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that causes the common cold -- is set to be produced as "Sputnik Light", a less effective single-dose version.Mass production of the EpiVacCorona vaccine, developed by the Siberian Vektor laboratory, is set to launch this month.The Russian government has said that a third vaccine named CoviVac is expected to be approved this month too.And there may even be a fourth, with the Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca and the developers of Sputnik V having said they are working to combine their respective vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-sputnik-v-turns-out-to-be-a-scientific-and-political-win-for-putin-101612356457023.html
03-02-2021||World||More sanctions on Russia over Navalny cannot be ruled out: Germany||The German government said on Wednesday further sanctions against Russia cannot be ruled out after a Moscow court jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and police used force against opposition protesters.Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday's verdict against Navalny was "far from any rule of law standards" and demanded an end to violence against peaceful protesters in Russia.Asked if Germany was mulling new sanctions against Russia, Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told a regular news conference the European Union had already imposed sanctions against Moscow following a nerve agent attack on Navalny."Further sanctions are not to be ruled out," Seibert said, adding that Berlin would discuss further steps with its European partners.Seibert said Moscow's handling of the Navalny case violated basic human rights principles which Moscow had signed up to and that Berlin condemned "the systematic use of force" against demonstrators by Russian police.The EU in December imposed sanctions on six Russians and a state scientific research centre accused of deploying against Navalny a banned nerve agent designed for military use.Western countries have urged Moscow to immediately free Navalny.Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead. He said in December that reports the Russian state had poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-sanctions-on-russia-over-navalny-cannot-be-ruled-out-germany-101612356889663.html

Supply problems should ease in the second quarter of 2021, but increasing production remained a challenge, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccination-delay-could-cost-eu-economy-90-billion-euros-study-101612353838396.html
03-02-2021||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi charged with possessing illegal radios||Police in Myanmar have charged deposed national leader Aung San Suu Kyi with having several illegally imported walkie-talkies in her home, members of her party said Wednesday.Suu Kyi was detained Monday along with other senior politicians when the military staged a coup the day the newly elected Parliament was supposed to open its session. Party officials say she has not been moved from her residence, where she was being held under house arrest.The charges against Suu Kyi appear to carry a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The charge sheets indicate the unregistered walkie-talkies were for use by Suu Kyi’s bodyguards.National League for Democracy spokesman Kyi Toe confirmed the charge on his Facebook page. He also said the country’s ousted president, Win Myint, was charged with violating natural disaster management law. An NLD lawmaker, Phyo Zayar Thaw, also confirmed the charges.Police and court officials in the capital Naypyitaw could not immediately be contacted.The coup was a dramatic backslide for Myanmar, which had been making progress toward democracy, and highlighted the extent to which the generals have ultimately maintained control in in the Southeast Asian country.The takeover also marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals and even defended their crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, damaging her international reputation.The military has announced it will hold power under a state of emergency for a year, and then hold elections whose winner will take over government.Suu Kyi’s party has called for non-violent resistance to the military takeover, and on Tuesday night, scores of people in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, honked car horns and banged on pots and pans in a noise protest called by activists. They included shouts wishing Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.Supporters of the military have also staged demonstrations, attracting as many as 3,000 people to a Tuesday rally.While in power, Myanmar’s new leader said the military government plans to investigate alleged fraud in last year’s elections. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the moves Tuesday at the first meeting of his new government in the capital, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.The military has said one of its reasons for ousting the elected civilian government was because it failed to properly investigate its allegations of electoral irregularities. The state Union Election Commission has said there were no significant problems with the vote.In the November 2020 election, Suu Kyi’s party captured 396 out of 476 seats contested in the lower and upper houses of Parliament. The main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.The military, known as the Tatmadaw, is automatically allocated 25% of the seats in the combined houses under the 2008 Constitution that was drafted under a previous military government.The state newspaper reported that Min Aung Hlaing told Cabinet members that a new Union Election Commission, with what he described as independent and unbiased personnel, “would examine the voting data to find correct results, and actions would be taken accordingly in the process.” He said voter lists would be scrutinized against family household registrations.Min Aung Hlaing also said that Covid-19 containment measures taken by Suu Kyi’s government would be continued.Myanmar has confirmed more than 140,600 cases including some 3,100 deaths. Its health care infrastructure is one of the weakest in Asia, according to UN surveys.A statement issued Wednesday in the name of the executive members of Suu Kyi’s party said that authorities began raiding the party’s offices in Mandalay and other states and regions on Tuesday and seized documents and laptop computers.The statement on the Facebook page of party spokesman Kyi Toe said locks were broken at several offices. It denounced the raids as illegal and demanded that they stop.The takeover presents a test for the international community. US President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday but took no action.The foreign ministers of the Group of 7 leading industrial nations on Wednesday issued a statement calling for Suu Kyi and others to be released, the state of emergency to be scrapped and power restored to the democratically elected government. It also expressed concern about restrictions on information, an apparent reference to cuts to phone and internet service on Monday.“We stand with the people of Myanmar who want to see a democratic future,” it said. The group comprises the United States. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-charged-with-possessing-illegal-radios-101612351105259.html

03-02-2021||World||Bidens bring an unexpected piece of furniture to White House||There's a crib in President Joe Biden's White House.Upstairs in the family residence, the bed is set for the president's youngest grandchild, Beau Biden Jr. The baby was born last year to Biden's only surviving son, Hunter Biden, brother of Beau Biden, the president's other son, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.The baby bed's addition came to light during a People magazine interview in which the president said the Senate must put former President Donald Trump on trial since the House had impeached him over last month's riot at the US Capitol, which left five people dead.“Otherwise it makes a mockery of the system,” Biden said in his first White House interview since his Jan. 20 swearing-in as president.Biden doubted that enough Republicans — at least 17 are needed — would join Democrats to convict Trump on a charge of inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to keep lawmakers from certifying Trump’s election loss to Biden.A former senator himself, Biden has avoided saying whether he thinks the Senate should convict Trump, but he told People, “I'm not looking for retribution.”“My job is to try to heal the country and move us forward, because I think we have so many opportunities as a country,” he said in interview excerpts released Wednesday.Biden also pledged anew that no family member will work in the administration.“We’re going to run this like the Obama-Biden administration,” he said. “No one in our family and extended family is going to be involved in any government undertaking or foreign policy. And nobody has an office in this place.”Biden made that pledge during the 2020 presidential campaign — as Trump and other Republicans tried to make an issue out of some of Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings. He sought to differentiate himself from Trump, whose daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served him as high-level White House advisers.Biden represented Delaware for 36 years in the Senate. Barack Obama, a senator from Illinois, and Biden were elected president and vice president, respectively, in 2008.Biden told the magazine a folksy story about rejecting the advice of an accountant who had told him years ago that he could bill the Senate for some of the gasoline he pumped into the family car.Biden said he told the accountant: “Here’s how I look at it: The foul line is 15 feet away from the basket. Never get me closer than 17 feet, because it really is a matter of the public trust.”“And we need to rebuild that trust in government,” added Jill Biden, who joined her husband for the interview in the magazine’s Feb. 15 issue, hitting newsstands nationwide on Friday, days before Trump’s impeachment trial is set to open in the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-bring-an-unexpected-piece-of-furniture-to-white-house-101612350233802.html

The explosion occurred minutes after the experimental launch at Boca Chica, Texas.The SN9 rocket was a test model of the heavy-duty rocket being developed by Elon Musk's company to carry humans and cargo into space. SN8, the model before it, had also met a similar fate during a test launch in December. No injuries occurred in either incident.SpaceX’s live stream covered a 16-story-tall SN9 taking a flawless liftoff from the Gulf Coast in South Texas. The spacecraft hovered in midair at an altitude of 10 km before shutting off its engines for planned “belly-flop” execution.While landing, the Starship tried to reactivate two of its three Raptor thrusters but failed to ignite one. The rocket then fell, exploding into a ball of flames, smoke, and debris - 6 minutes and 26 seconds after launch.There was no immediate comment from Musk, who also heads the electric carmaker Tesla Inc. Hours earlier, he tweeted about staying off social media platform “for a while.”Also read| Elon Musk keeps sparring with regulators as Joe Biden cabinet takes reinsA SpaceX commentator, after the live stream, said that the test altitude “looked very good and stable, like we saw last December. We just have to work on that landing a little bit.”The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will investigate Tuesday’s mishap despite the tensions with Musk - from the previous inquiry. SpaceX conducted December’s launch “without demonstrating” public safety measures, according to the FAA. But “corrective actions” the company later took were approved and incorporated into Tuesday’s launch.Musk expressed his disagreement over the agencies’ broken structure. In his tweet, he said, “FAA’s space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure” and that “humanity will never get to Mars under its rules.The complete Starship rocket, with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is the company’s next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle - planned for year’s end.Musk aims to make human space travel more affordable and systematic. He intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-starship-explodes-during-landing-faa-launches-probe-101612344895537.html

We have a very, very strong and close relationship with U.S. ... the sticking points have been largely addressed," Wadhawan added.India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar last month told Reuters that talks had become bogged down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trade-secretary-stands-by-digital-tax-opposed-by-us-101612344926866.html

The virus is much more about the virus being able to continue to survive, rather than trying to cause harm to us."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-may-protect-against-severe-disease-even-as-covid-variants-evolve-says-oxford-s-pollard-101612344197394.html
03-02-2021||World||China’s Covid comeback is bad news for climate as emissions rise||China was likely the only major economy that grew last year after swiftly containing the coronavirus. It’s also the only major economy that saw carbon emissions rise.In December, emissions surpassed 2019 levels for the first time all year, according to data from Carbon Monitor, a collaborative effort between researchers in China, Europe and the US that offers near real-time monitoring. That lifted total emissions in the country for 2020 to 10.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, 0.5% higher than the year before.The increase comes as global emissions likely dropped by 4.4% in 2020, according to Carbon Monitor, with declines in Brazil running to about 10% and nearly 13% in the US China’s emissions dropped 11% in the first quarter, during its intense pandemic lockdown, as gross domestic product shrank 6.8% from a year earlier.Carbon Monitor’s research captures emissions from burning fossil fuels and from cement production. Its estimates are subject to change as more data becomes available.Also read| South Korea curbing travel, gatherings for holidayThe emissions comeback underscores the challenge China and the rest of the world face as they balance economic revival and long-term climate goals. Because it was the first country to encounter and contain the virus, China’s pandemic path has often foreshadowed the experiences of other countries.China’s recovery picked up speed last month, putting it further ahead of rivals. Industrial production surged in the fourth quarter, with the country producing more than 1 billion tons of crude steel in 2020, an annual record.The nation’s long-term climate plans including hitting peak emissions by 2030 at the latest, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2060. Reaching that will require an overhaul of its mostly coal-based power sector, which contributed nearly half of the country’s emissions in 2020, according to Carbon Monitor data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-comeback-is-bad-news-for-climate-as-emissions-rise-101612342522843.html
03-02-2021||World||Ant Group reaches agreement with China regulators on overhaul||Ant Group Co. and Chinese regulators have agreed on a restructuring plan that will turn Jack Ma’s fintech giant into a financial holding company, making it subject to capital requirements similar to those for banks.The plan calls for putting all of Ant’s businesses into the holding company, including its technology offerings in areas like blockchain and food delivery, people familiar with the matter said. One of Ant’s early proposals to regulators had envisioned putting only financial operations into the new structure.An official announcement on the overhaul could come before the start of China’s Lunar New Year holiday next week, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns about a third of Ant, erased losses in Hong Kong trading on Wednesday after Bloomberg reported the agreement. The stock closed with a 0.4% gain.Ant’s restructuring plan marks the first big step in what’s expected to be a lengthy overhaul process, as regulators draw up detailed capital requirements and other guidelines for companies that span multiple financial business lines.China only introduced its framework for financial holding companies in September and many of the specifics are still being ironed out. While the rules will eventually provide more regulatory clarity for Ant, they’ll almost certainly force the company to slow the torrid pace of expansion that has made it China’s dominant fintech player and one of the world’s most valuable startups.Ant is still exploring possibilities to revive its initial public offering, which was abruptly halted by regulators in November, one person familiar with the matter said. But given the financial holding company framework is so new, it’s unclear how long it might take for authorities to sign off a listing.Ant declined to comment. The People’s Bank of China, which oversees financial holding companies, didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.Ant’s restructuring is part of a broader government campaign to increase supervision of the financial and technology sectors. Regulators have in recent months targeted everything from health-care crowdfunding to consumer lending. In January, they proposed measures to curb market concentration in online payments, where Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are the biggest players.The clampdown has fueled intense speculation over the status of Ma, who co-founded both Ant and Alibaba. The e-commerce giant has also faced increased government scrutiny in recent months, becoming the target of an antitrust investigation in December.Ma’s appearance in a live-streamed video conference in January -- after several months out of public view -- has helped quell talk of worst-case scenarios for his business empire. Still, plenty of uncertainty remains: even after Wednesday’s gain, Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares are trading about 15% below their record high in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ant-group-reaches-agreement-with-china-regulators-on-overhaul-101612342660234.html
03-02-2021||World||China to send 10 million coronavirus vaccine doses abroad||China on Wednesday announced a plan to provide 10 million coronavirus vaccine doses to developing nations through the global COVAX initiative.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China is responding to a request from the World Health Organization as developing countries seek to fill shortages predicted to run through March.COVAX, coordinated by WHO and others, seeks to ensure low and middle-income countries have enough coronavirus vaccines, as wealthy nations have snapped up many of the millions of upcoming doses.“We hope countries in international society with the capability will swing into action, support COVAX through practical actions, support the work of the World Health Organization, assist developing countries in obtaining vaccines in a timely manner and contribute to international society's conquering the pandemic at an early date," Wang said a daily briefing.China has already shipped large amounts of domestically developed vaccines to mainly developing countries, and WHO is in the process of approving Chinese vaccines for emergency use.That is seen by many as an attempt to boost China's reputation amid concerns over its growing military and economic influence and willingness to use its political leverage to defend what it considers its core interests.China is also anxious to dismiss criticisms of missteps in handling COVID-19 after the first cases were detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. A team of WHO experts is currently in the city to collect data in a search for clues about the virus's origins and how it spread around the world.China has called the virus a mutual challenge facing humanity and even questioned its origin.Earlier, as the pandemic spread around the world, it sent medical teams and supplies to affected countries and signed agreements with developing nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines to provide priority access to one of its vaccine candidates.While Chinese vaccines are considered a cheaper and possibly more plentiful alternative, others are also stepping in. Pfizer last month committed to supplying up to 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year through COVAX.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-10-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-abroad-101612342951103.html

Several other favorites of the Reddit community -- including movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and clothing retailer Express Inc. -- also tumbled, with AMC falling a further 12% in early trading on Tradegate.GameStop’s rapid retreat has coincided with a sharp reduction in short interest after bearish investors appeared to cover their positions. That has loosened a squeeze on the stock caused by day traders who used Reddit forums to tout and bid up out-of-favor stocks that also included American Airlines Group Inc. and BlackBerry Ltd.“The loss of momentum in the short-squeeze frenzy highlights that triggering such reverberation in the market is not easy, after all,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said in written comments. “We could wait a while before seeing a similar phenomenon in the future.”GameStop has now given up more than 80% of the sharp gains that were fueled by last month’s attack on short sellers. Even with the latest pullback, however, the Grapevine, Texas-based retailer is still up 377% year-to-date, based on most recent closing values.Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban told Reddit investors on Tuesday morning to hold on to their GameStop stocks if they could afford it.“If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I don’t own it, but that’s what I would do,” the 62-year-old wrote on Reddit during a “Ask Me Anything Session” to discuss investment strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gamestops-giant-bubble-deflates-further-after-27-billion-rout-101612341874951.html
03-02-2021||World||House Republicans tie Biden Commerce department pick to Huawei stance||Several House Republicans are asking their Senate counterparts to delay the confirmation of Gina Raimondo for Commerce secretary until President Joe Biden clarifies whether he supports keeping Huawei Technologies Co. on a restricted trade list.Led by Texas Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the group released a statement Tuesday highlighting the threat they say the Chinese technology company poses to national security. McCaul said while he agrees that the president should be able to pick his own cabinet -- and the confirmation process is up to the Senate -- removing Huawei from the Commerce Department’s “Entity List” is an issue that the nominee should clarify before moving ahead.“The fact that the Biden Administration has still refused to commit to keeping Huawei on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List is incredibly alarming and dangerous,” the House Republicans said in the statement. “We urge those Senators who have a history of calling for Huawei to remain on the Entity List to stick to their principles and place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies their intentions for Huawei and on export control policies for a country that is carrying out genocide and threatening our national security.”The Trump administration instituted a Huawei export ban that requires U.S. firms to obtain government licenses if they want to sell American tech and intellectual property to the Chinese telecommunications-equipment giant.Raimondo didn’t specifically commit to keeping Huawei on the list when asked about the issue during her Jan. 26 Senate confirmation hearing.“We can’t have the Chinese or really anyone having a back door into our network and compromising in any way our national or economic security,” Raimondo said in her hearing last week. “I will use the bold toolkit at my disposal to the fullest extent possible to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of back-door influence into our network -- and that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company,” she said, referring to China’s ZTE Corp., another telecommunications equipment firm.“The last U.S. administration and some anti-China politicians, to uphold the U.S. monopoly, have been doing all they can to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Wednesday. “This is a denial of the market economy principles and fair competition which the U.S. champions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-republicans-tie-biden-commerce-department-pick-to-huawei-stance-101612341403549.html
03-02-2021||World||Astra shot shows 82% efficacy With UK’s two-dose interval||AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid vaccine showed 82% effectiveness with a three-month gap between two shots, according to a new study that bolsters the UK’s controversial decision to adopt an extended dosing interval.The vaccine may also significantly reduce transmission of the virus, according to analysis of trial data by the University of Oxford, which developed the shot with the British drugmaker. Swabs taken from volunteers in the UK arm of the trial showed a 67% reduction in transmission after the first dose, the report showed.The UK approved giving the first and second injections of two-shot vaccines from four to 12 weeks apart in an effort to stretch scarce supplies while manufacturing is ramped up. AstraZeneca executives had previously said the longer gap, compared with the three- to four-week period between shots that’s been recommended for other vaccines, could also boost effectiveness.The new results are a further boost for the immunization program in the UK, which has raced ahead of countries in the European Union and has given initial shots to 14% of residents. If the Astra vaccine also reduces transmission, it will speed up the process of achieving herd immunity, when the virus can no longer make inroads into a population. The effect on asymptomatic transmission fell after the second shot to 50%, the report showed.“Extending the dosing interval not only boosts the vaccine’s efficacy, but also enables more people to be vaccinated upfront,” said Mene Pangalos, Astra’s executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals research, in a statement. “Together with the new findings on reduced transmission, we believe this vaccine will have a real impact on the pandemic.”AstraZeneca shares rose 0.5% early Wednesday in London.Vaccine efficacy rose from 55% with a dosing interval of less than six weeks to 82% when spaced 12 or more weeks apart, according to new data. The analysis also found the shot showed 76% protection after the first of two injections. That level of immunity was achieved from 22 days after the first shot.Questions have swirled around the AstraZeneca vaccine since the company reported early trial results that showed 70% protection, on average. Those results came from two subsets, one of which delivered 62% effectiveness, the other 90%, with the higher level coinciding with a mistake in dosing. When the U.K. approved the vaccine in December, regulators signaled that they thought the discrepancy was more likely linked to the interval between shots than the dosing level.More CasesThe initial results were based on 131 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 in the trials, a number that has since grown to 332, allowing for more in-depth analysis. The new data are based on information from more than 17,000 trial participants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, Oxford said.The European Union has also approved the vaccine, with France, Germany and some other countries restricting its use in the elderly, citing a lack of trial data in older age groups.“These new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators,” said Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford trial and co-author of the paper, in a statement. It also supports the policy recommendation made by the UK vaccine advisory panel, he said.Oxford is also planning to publish data on how the vaccine interacts with new variants of the coronavirus in coming days. The university said it expects the findings to be in line with those from other developers.Moderna Inc. said last month its vaccine will protect against two known coronavirus variants, but it plans to start human studies of a booster shot for a strain from South Africa that may cause immunity to wane more quickly. Pfizer Inc. is also looking to develop a booster shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astra-shot-shows-82-efficacy-with-uk-s-two-dose-interval-101612340409113.html

The army chief’s remarks seen to be aimed at New Delhi were a sharp contrast to his strident pitch against India, particularly after New Delhi carried out aerial strikes at terror training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after the 2019 Pulwama bombing and later scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.General Bajwa, who made the statement at the graduation ceremony of Pakistan Air Force cadets, continued. “Pakistan and India must also resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a dignified and peaceful manner as per the aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir and bring this human tragedy to its logical conclusion,” General Bajwa said at the military event, according to a statement issued by the military.New Delhi has not reacted to the army chief’s remarks. A counter-terror official said it may be too early to conclude that General Bajwa had changed his position. “We will need to track if this is a one-off comment or there are other indicators of a possible change as well,” he said.Either way, it will take a lot more than words to help put bilateral ties between the two arch-rivals back on an even keel. Pakistan, the official said, would have to take concrete steps to dismantle the terror infrastructure on its soil and end support to terrorists to convince New Delhi that it was serious about improving ties.General Bajwa’s move to tone down his rhetoric against India came at a time he and Prime Minister Imran Khan have been facing fierce attacks from an alliance of opposition parties that joined hands last year to try to force PM Khan to step down.A Pakistan watcher said New Delhi could be expected to respond to action rather than words, particularly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took steps in the early part of his first tenure to mend ties. But his honest attempt to end the animosity by making an unscheduled visit to Pakistan was followed by an attack on the Pathankot airbase in December 2015.Unwilling to let terrorists derail the peace process, India worked with Islamabad to act against the Jaish-e-Mohammed but found Islamabad unwilling to deliver on its promise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-extend-hand-of-peace-pakistan-army-chief-gen-bajwa-springs-a-surprise-101612337327104.html
03-02-2021||World||Days before coup, IMF sent Myanmar $350 million in emergency aid; no precedent for refund||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week sent $350 million in cash to the Myanmar government, part of a no-strings-attached emergency aid package to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic.Days later, military leaders seized power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected officials, in what the US State Department said on Tuesday constituted a coup.There appears to be little the IMF can do to claw back the funds, part of rapid-disbursing Covid-19 financing programs with almost no conditions and approved by the IMF board on Jan. 13, sources familiar with the payments and international finance experts said."We are following the unfolding developments closely. We are deeply concerned about the impact of events on the economy and on the people of Myanmar," an IMF spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, confirming the payment was completed last week.US President Joe Biden, facing his first international crisis since taking office less than two weeks ago, has threatened new sanctions against the generals, and the State Department said it would review its foreign assistance to the southeast Asian country.The United States is the dominant shareholder in the IMF, which has provided Myanmar with $700 million in emergency coronavirus financing over the past seven months, including last week's payment, which included $116.6 million through the IMF's Rapid Credit Facility and $233.4 million through the Rapid Financing Instrument.The Fund said in a statement on Jan. 13 the money would help Myanmar meet "urgent balance-of-payments needs arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the government’s recovery measures to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability while supporting affected sectors and vulnerable groups."Unlike the IMF's regular financing programs, which disburse funds in smaller increments as performance benchmarks are met for agreed policy reforms, coronavirus emergency aid has been sent quickly, often all at once."It's not a program that was negotiated, there isn't conditionality and there aren't forward-looking reviews with disbursements tied to those reviews," said Stephanie Segal, a former IMF economist and US Treasury official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington."I'm not aware of any precedent where money that's been approved by the IMF board can be recalled," Segal added.Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis last year, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 80 countries.The timing of the latest disbursement to Myanmar was unfortunate, two sources familiar with the payments said, and pointed to the risks of using rapid financing that gives governments broad discretion over how they spend the money.The best-case scenario is that the Myanmar government that emerges from the current political turmoil will spend the money appropriately because it wants to have a productive relationship with the Fund, one of the sources said.The IMF's counterparty in Myanmar is the Central Bank of Myanmar, and the source expressed hope it can maintain its independence from the country's finance ministry.But on Tuesday, the ruling Myanmar military appointed Than Nyein as the country's new central bank governor, reinstating him to a post he previously held between 2007-2013, during the rule of the last junta.The World Bank, which has provided more than $150 million in financing to Myanmar since the pandemic started a year ago, said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the military takeover, warning it risked a major setback to the country’s transition and its development prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/days-before-coup-imf-sent-myanmar-350-million-in-emergency-aid-no-precedent-for-refund-101612333960592.html
03-02-2021||World||Biden, Yellen say GOP coronavirus aid too small, Democrats push on||President Joe Biden panned a Republican alternative to his $1.9 trillion COVID rescue plan as insufficient as Senate Democrats pushed ahead, voting to launch a process that could approve his sweeping rescue package on their own, if Republicans refuse to support it.Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined the Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting Tuesday, both declaring the Republicans' $618 billion offer was too small. They urged big fast action to stem the pandemic crisis and economic fallout.As the White House reaches for a bipartisan bill, Democrats marshaled their ever-slim Senate majority, voting 50-49, to start a lengthy process for approving Biden's bill with or without GOP support. The goal is to have COVID-19 relief approved by March, when extra unemployment assistance and other pandemic aid expires.“President Biden spoke about the need for Congress to respond boldly and quickly,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the lunch meeting.“If we did a package that small, we’d be mired in the COVID crisis for years.”The swift action from Democrats on Capitol Hill underscores the urgency of delivering Biden's top legislative priority even as talks are progressing privately between Republicans and the White House, as well as with centrist Democrats, on potential changes to the package to win over broader bipartisan support.Biden framed his views during the virtual lunch meeting with Democrats by talking about the need not to forget working and middle-class families — even those like nurses and pipefitters making $150,000 for a family of four — who are straining during the crisis, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private call.The night before, Biden met with 10 Republican senators pitching their $618 billion alternative, and let them know it was insufficient to meet the country's needs. The president made it clear that he won’t delay aid in hopes of winning GOP support.While no compromise was reached during the late Monday session, White House talks with Republicans are privately underway.The outcome will test the new president striving to unify the country but confronting a rising COVID-19 death toll and stubbornly high jobless numbers, with political risks for all sides. Vaccine distributions, direct $1,400 payments to households, school reopenings and business aid are all on the line.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Democrats for pressing ahead on their own. He said he had spoken to Biden ahead of his meeting with the 10 GOP senators.“They’ve chosen a totally partisan path,” McConnell said. “That’s unfortunate.”The two sides are far apart, with the Republican group of 10 senators focused primarily on the health care crisis and smaller $1,000 direct aid to Americans than the $1,400 payments Biden proposed, while the president is leading Democrats toward a more sweeping rescue plan to shore up households, local governments and a partly shuttered economy.At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Biden’s view that the risk is not in crafting too large a package, but in providing too little aid. She said the president was hopeful GOP ideas will be brought forward, and said nothing precludes Republicans from participating in the process.“We need to make sure people get the relief they need,” she said.White House officials have previously cited the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as evidence of broad support for their plan, but the nation's most prominent business group issued a letter Tuesday that urged a bipartisan compromise.“There ought to be common ground for a bipartisan proposal that can become law,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in an interview.The cornerstone of the GOP plan is $160 billion for the health care response — vaccine distribution, a “massive expansion” of testing, protective gear and funds for rural hospitals, similar to what Biden has proposed.But from there, the two plans drastically diverge. Biden proposes $170 billion for schools, compared to $20 billion in the Republican plan. Republicans also would give nothing to states, money that Democrats argue is just as important, with $350 billion in Biden’s plan to keep police, fire and other workers on the job.The GOP's $1,000 direct payments would go to fewer households, individuals earning up to $40,000 a year, or $80,000 for couples. That’s less than Biden’s proposal of $1,400 direct payments at higher income levels, up to $300,000 for some households..The Republicans offer $40 billion for Paycheck Protection Program business aid. But gone are Democratic priorities such as a gradual lifting of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.According to Schumer, Biden told Democratic senators he had let the Republicans know “he’s willing to make some modifications."But both Biden and Yellen recalled the lessons of the government response to the 2009 financial crisis, which some have since said was inadequate as conditions worsened. Biden said he told the Republicans their offer was “way too small,” Schumer said.Winning the support of 10 Republicans would be significant, potentially giving Biden the votes needed in the 50-50 Senate to the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaker.Wary Democrats pushed ahead with Tuesday's vote, unwilling to take too much time in courting GOP support that may not materialize or may lead to too meager a package.The procedural steps are groundwork for eventual approval under the budget reconciliation process that would allow the bill to pass with a 51-vote majority in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes typically needed.The vote Tuesday opens 50 hours of debate on a budget resolution, with amendment votes expected later this week. The House is poised to launch a similar process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-yellen-say-gop-coronavirus-aid-too-small-democrats-push-on-101612334551522.html
03-02-2021||World||Myanmar's military junta plans probe of last year's election||Myanmar's new leader said the military government installed after Monday's coup plans an investigation into alleged fraud in last year's elections and will also prioritize the COVID-19 outbreak and the economy, a state newspaper reported Wednesday.Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the moves Tuesday at the first meeting of his new government in the capital, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.The military had said one of its reasons for ousting the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi was because it failed to properly investigate its allegations of alleged widespread electoral irregularities. The state Union Election Commission four days before the military takeover had declared there were no significant problems with the vote.The military has declared it will hold power under a state of emergency for a year, and then hold elections whose winner will take over government.In the November 2020 election, Suu Kyi’s party captured 396 out of 476 seats contested in the lower and upper houses of Parliament. The main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.The military, known as the Tatmadaw, is automatically allocated 25% of the seat in the combined houses under the 2008 Constitution that came into effect under a previous military government.The state newspaper reported that Min Aung Hlaing told Cabinet members that a new Union Election Commission, with what he described as independent and unbiased personnel, “would examine the voting data to find correct results, and actions would be taken accordingly in the process.”″ He said voter lists would be scrutinized against family household registrations.Min Aung Hlaing also said that COVID-19 containment measures taken by Suu Kyi’s government would be continued.Myanmar has confirmed more than 140,600 cases including some 3,100 deaths. Its health care infrastructure is one of the weakest in Asia, according to U.N. surveys.The general also urged measures to boost the COVID-19-impacted economy, especially the agricultural sector upon which the 70% of the country’s population who live in rural areas depend.Suu Kyi and other senior members of her National League for Democracy party serving in government remain under detention after being rounded up on Monday, as do an unknown number of lower-ranking officials and political activists around the country.The NLD has called for non-violent resistance to the military takeover.On Tuesday night, scores of people in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, honked car horns and banged on pots and pans Tuesday in a noise protest called by activists. They included shouts wishing Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.Supporters of the military have also staged demonstrations, attracting as many as 3,000 people to a Tuesday rally.The takeover presents a test for the international community. U.S. President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday but took no action.The takeover marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals, who despite allowing elections maintained control of key ministries and guaranteed themselves enough seats in Parliament to have veto power over any constitutional changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-military-junta-plans-probe-of-last-year-s-election-101612334073001.html
03-02-2021||World||Explainer: Myanmar, Burma and why the different names matter||This week, the military upended years of quasi-democratic rule in Myanmar, with soldiers taking control of the country in a carefully orchestrated coup. The military said the seizure of power was necessary because the government had failed to act on its unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in November elections, which the party of the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, won in a landslide. It claims the takeover was constitutional.But where exactly did the coup happen? Was it in Myanmar, as the the country is officially called? Or was it in Burma, the name Washington continues to use?The answer is complicated. Because when it comes to Myanmar, pretty much everything is political. Including language.Also read| The genesis of the military coup in MyanmarWHY ARE THERE TWO NAMES FOR ONE COUNTRY?For generations, the country was called Burma, after the dominant Burman ethnic group. But in 1989, one year after the ruling junta brutally suppressed a pro-democracy uprising, military leaders suddenly changed its name to Myanmar.By then, Burma was an international pariah, desperate for any way to improve its image. Hoping for a sliver of international legitimacy, it said it was discarding a name handed down from its colonial past and to foster ethnic unity. The old name, officials said, excluded the country’s many ethnic minorities.At home, though, it changed nothing. In the Burmese language, “Myanmar” is simply the more formal version of “Burma.” The country’s name was changed only in English.It was linguistic sleight-of-hand. But few people were fooled. Much of the world showed defiance of the junta by refusing to use the new name.Also read| US in touch with India, Japan on Myanmar coupWHEN DID THINGS CHANGE?A little over a decade ago, the country began a stumbling semi-democratic transition. The military retained extensive political power, but opposition leaders were freed from prison and house arrest, and elections were allowed. Longtime pro-democracy activist Suu Kyi became the country’s civilian leader.Over the years, many countries and news outlets, including The Associated Press, had begun using the country’s official name. As repression eased and international opposition to the military became less vocal, “Myanmar" became increasingly common. Inside the country, opposition leaders made clear it didn’t matter much anymore.Unlike most of the world, the U.S. government still officially uses “Burma.” But even Washington has mellowed its stance.In 2012, during a visit to the country, then-President Barack Obama used both “Burma” and “Myanmar.” An adviser to Myanmar’s president called that “very positive” and said it was an “acknowledgement of Myanmar’s government.”Also read| Why did the military stage a coup in Myanmar?WHAT NOW?Washington’s response to the coup seemed designed to highlight old criticisms, with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden pointedly avoiding the country’s legal name.“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy,” Biden said in a statement. “The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws.”Most other countries, though, continued to call it Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-myanmar-burma-and-why-the-different-names-matter-101612326144898.html
03-02-2021||World||US, Europe condemn Russia’s imprisonment of Navalny||Russia imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny for two years and eight months, drawing renewed condemnation from Western leaders as President Vladimir Putin seeks to crush a resurgence in protests against his rule.A Moscow court converted a suspended sentence that Navalny, 44, received for a 2014 fraud conviction into a prison term for alleged violations of his probation. His 3-and-a-half-year sentence will be reduced by the 10 months he spent under house arrest in the case, the judge in a Moscow court ruled Tuesday.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated calls for Navalny’s immediate release after the ruling. “We will coordinate closely with our allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for failing to uphold the rights of its citizens,” he said.Navalny was arrested in mid-January as he returned from Germany, where he recovered from a near-fatal attack involving a nerve agent applied to his underwear that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security services. The Kremlin denies responsibility. The prison term could isolate Navalny but risks escalating the confrontation between the authorities and opposition supporters.“Someone didn’t want me to return to Russia a free man. We know who,” Navalny said in a defiant statement to the court, branding Putin “Vladimir the underpants poisoner.” His comments drew objections from the prosecutor and a warning from the judge that “this isn’t a demonstration here.”Some of the biggest crowds in recent years have joined unsanctioned protests across the country since Navalny was detained. The unrest has resulted in more than 9,000 detentions at rallies in dozens of cities in the last two weekends. More than 1,400 protesters were detained Tuesday, mostly in the capital where Navalny’s supporters called for protests near the Kremlin after the sentencing, according to monitoring group OVD-Info.Leaders across Europe spoke out against Navalny’s imprisonment. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she condemned the sentencing “in the strongest possible terms.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Twitter that the ruling was “far from any rule of law.” France’s President Emmanuel Macron called the sentencing “unacceptable,” while in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the ruling was “pure cowardice and fails to meet the most basic standards of justice.”While the Kremlin’s move to jail Putin’s most prominent critic aims to put a stop to his political activities, Navalny’s backers say he’ll become a powerful symbol of resistance behind bars.“There are lots of Navalnys,” Ivan Zhdanov, director of the activist’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on TV Rain.A major test will come when Russia holds parliamentary elections in September.“The main point of this trial isn’t how it turns out for me -- putting me in jail isn’t hard,” Navalny told the court from the glass defendant’s cage. “They’re imprisoning one person to frighten millions.” His lawyers vowed to appeal.More PressureIn a separate case, Navalny also faces possible new fraud charges that could carry an additional 10-year punishment.“This is a message to the security services that we’re firm and won’t give in,” said Alexei Makarkin, vice president at the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. “And it’s a message to the opposition: international notoriety and support don’t give you even minimal immunity.”Navalny received the suspended sentence in a fraud trial involving the Russian branch of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher that also led to a 3 1/2 year jail term for his younger brother, Oleg. Both men denied wrongdoing, and the European Court of Human Rights has called the case politically motivated.Defense attorneys cited that ruling and argued that Navalny was recuperating in Germany last year and couldn’t check in with probation authorities. The prison service contended that he had breached the terms of the sentence before going to Germany as well.Putin, 68, has been in power since 2000, the longest rule since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In July, he pushed through constitutional changes that would allow him to stay as president until 2036. Last year his support fell to a record low amid the Covid-19 downturn, and the continuing slide in incomes is weighing on the Russian leader’s popularity, pollsters say.Navalny raised the focus on officials’ opulent lifestyles in a video released after his arrest that got more than 100 million views and alleged that Putin owns a giant $1.3 billion Black Sea palace. Putin dismissed the claim and a billionaire ally, Arkady Rotenberg, said last week that he is the beneficial owner of the residence.“The opposition outside the system is seen by the Kremlin as a hostile force, a threat to national security, which requires harsh, merciless, repressive tactics against Navalny” and his allies, said Tatiana Stanovaya, head of political consultancy R.Politik. “This is only the beginning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-condemn-russia-s-imprisonment-of-navalny-101612333232795.html
03-02-2021||World||Microsoft backs Australian plan to make Google pay for news||Microsoft said on Wednesday it supports Australia’s plans to make the biggest digital platforms pay for news and would help small businesses transfer their advertising to Bing if Google quits the country.Microsoft has been positioning itself to increase market share for its search engine Bing after a Google executive told a Senate hearing last month that it would likely make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the government goes ahead with a draft law that would make tech giants pay for news content.Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement that he and Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella had told Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher in an online meeting last week that “Microsoft fully supports” the so-called News Media Bargaining Code.Morrison this week confirmed he had spoken to Nadella about Bing replacing Google in Australia.“I can tell you, Microsoft’s pretty confident” that Australians would not be worse off, Morrison said on Monday.Smith said he had assured the government leaders that small businesses who wished to transfer their advertising from Google to Bing could do so simply and without transfer costs.“We believe that the current legislative proposal represents a fundamental step towards a more level playing field and a fairer digital ecosystem for consumers, business and society,” Smith said.The Australia Institute's Center for Responsible Technology, an independent think tank, welcomed Microsoft's stance and called on Google to withdraw its threat to close its search services within Australia."This is a significant development and should send a message to both Google and Facebook that their network dominance in Australia is only as strong as their respect for Australians,” the center's Director Peter Lewis said in a statement.Although Bing is Australia’s second most popular search engine, it has only a 3.6% market share, according to web analytics service Statcounter. Google says it has 95%.Swinburne University senior lecturer on media Belinda Barnet said Bing and other search engines could fill the void left by Google and deliver benefits.“People need to realize it will not be personalized in the sense that Google advertising in searches is, so Bing doesn’t know and frankly doesn’t care that you’re in the market for yoga pants, for example,” Barnet said.“Some of these platforms, Google and Facebook in particular, feed you more misinformation if you’re already prone to clicking on misnformation, so they create this echo chamber, in a sense,” she said. “But a product like DuckDuckGo and Ecosia is not going to know that in the past you’ve looked at 100 articles about how vaccines are bad and they will just give you the most accurate information that they can find.”Peter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organizations Australia, an advocacy group, expected the disruption to small businesses created by Google’s departure from Australia would be short lived.“We're not panicking,” Strong said. “But it would have a short-term impact.”“It would be a bad thing if Google quits, but if Bing took over, the situation would be the same,” he added. “One organization has the capacity to blackmail a country and that should never happen," he said, calling for more government regulation.A Senate committee that is scrutinising the draft legislation will report to the government next week.The mandatory code proposed by the government aims to make Google and Facebook pay Australian media companies fairly for using news content the tech giants siphon from news sites.There are no plans to make smaller search engines such as Bing pay for linking users to Australian news, but the government has not ruled that option out.Google has faced pressure from authorities elsewhere to pay for news. Last month, it signed a deal with a group of French publishers paving the way for the company to make digital copyright payments. Under the agreement, Google will negotiate individual licensing deals with newspapers, with payments based on factors such as the amount published daily and monthly internet site traffic.But Google is resisting the Australian plan because it would have less control over how much it would have to pay. Under the Australian system, if an online platform and a news business can’t agree on a price for news, an arbitration panel will make a binding decision on payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-backs-australian-plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-101612331319391.html

The Canadian company, which was not identified, is looking at importing 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in the UK and manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India under the Covishield brand. This is not part of the Canadian programme, even though it has ordered millions of doses from AstraZeneca.Canada has among the highest per capita volumes of orders of Covid-19 vaccines, with deals in place with Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax, accounting for over 350 million doses in total.However, its vaccination programme, which began in December after emergency authorisation was given to the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, has come to a standstill due to supply issues caused by the former delaying sending its jabs while it ramps up production at a plant in Belgium and also the European Commission placing export controls on vaccines made within the bloc.While AstraZeneca is among the companies that has sought its vaccine’s clearance by Canadian public health authorities, there was no response to queries from Hindustan Times sent to the office of the minister of public services and procurement, Anita Anand, over whether these will be sourced, even partly, from India.Anand, however, told CBC News that shipments from the EU should be expected to resume very soon. While some batches have started arriving, she said “all systems are a go for these shipments”.Canadian officials led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have spoken to EU officials, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, on the vaccine issue. During a media interaction, Trudeau said, “The conversations I had with the president of the European Commission were enough to reassure me, and should be enough to reassure all Canadians, that the EU is extremely mindful that Canada’s contracts be respected, and that our supply of vaccines not be interfered with.”Canada also entered into an agreement on Tuesday with the American company Novavax for manufacturing their vaccine in the country, though those vials are unlikely to be available before the end of 2021. The botched vaccine campaign has taken a toll on the popularity of the PM and his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-pharma-company-plans-to-import-covishield-doses-from-india-101612329949929.html
03-02-2021||World||UK’s Gove meets EU’s Sefcovic for talks on Northern Ireland border||UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove on Wednesday will demand that the European Union takes steps to ensure the smooth flow of trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, amid rising tensions in the region.In a meeting with European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, Gove will call for post-Brexit grace periods for trade in Northern Ireland -- which were due to expire at the end of March -- to be extended.On Tuesday, he condemned the EU’s threat to impose border checks on Northern Ireland, warning it had provoked anger on all sides of the political divide. “Trust has been eroded, damage has been done,” Gove told the House of Commons. “It was a serious mistake from the commission, I think everyone recognizes that now.”Faced with a shortage of coronavirus vaccines, the EU threatened on Friday to limit exports from the bloc by invoking Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol -- part of the Brexit agreement -- and imposing border controls.It retreated within hours, after the plan emerged and drew condemnation from both unionists and nationalists as well as the Irish government.The move threatened to undermine one of the most controversial parts of the Brexit deal -- the avoidance of border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In four years of negotiations, the EU had made avoiding a hard border a precondition for any accord, saying it was necessary to protect the peace process.‘Menacing Behavior’Updating members of Parliament on Tuesday, Gove was blunt about the damage the EU had done, saying the European Commission in Brussels had “mucked up.”“In recent days we’ve seen an increase in community tension,” Gove said. “We will work over coming days to fix the difficulties on the ground.”Officials from both the EU and the UK have temporarily halted some checks at the region’s ports after what Mid & East Antrim Council called “an upsurge in sinister and menacing behavior.” That included “graffiti within the local area referencing increasing tensions around the Northern Ireland Protocol and describing Port staff as targets.”The EU told staff working in Northern Ireland not to go to work Tuesday, a day after the region stopped physical inspections of products of animal origin at the ports of Belfast and Larne amid security concerns. Document checks will continue, and the measure will be kept under review, Northern Ireland’s agriculture ministry said in a statement.“It is obvious that for us the first and utmost priority is the safety of people,” European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said. “We are in contact with the UK authorities on this matter, both from a security perspective and from the perspective of the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”‘Ugly Development’The threats are a “sinister and ugly development,” Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin told reporters in Dublin. “We will be doing everything we possibly can to assist and to defuse the situation,” he said.Democratic Unionist Party lawmaker Ian Paisley linked the growing tensions to the operation of the protocol, which effectively keeps the UK region of Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union after Brexit and entails checks on goods coming across the Irish Sea.Unionists such as Paisley have opposed the protocol because it draws a customs border between the UK and Northern Ireland.“I condemn all threats to staff outrightly,” Paisley said. “The protocol was bound to end in tears.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-gove-meets-eu-s-sefcovic-for-talks-on-northern-ireland-border-101612328656921.html

The United States continues to remain the worst affected nation by the deadly disease though the number of cases and deaths from the viral disease have started to decline. The situation in the United Kingdom, the country with the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases, remains equally tense with the emergence of the new variant of the virus that causes the infection.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereAs vaccination under the Joe Biden administration in the US gathers pace, Covid-19 deaths have begun to decline in every section of the country. As of Wednesday morning, there were a total of 446,731 fatalities in the US and 26,430,237 positive cases, according to Johns Hopkins University’s dashboard. According to news agency Bloomberg, now, the seven-day average has shown signs of having peaked in all four US Census Bureau regions, even the laggard South. The declines will buy states time as they attempt an unprecedented vaccination effort to get shots to most of the country’s 330 million people, Bloomberg reported.Also Read: Covid-19 variant in UK picks up worrying South Africa mutationIn the past week, the US has administered about 1.35 million doses of Covid vaccines a day, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. Around 31.8 million doses have been given in the country overall.Meanwhile, Britain, which has been forced into another lockdown following the spike in cases, recorded 1,449 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19 on Tuesday, up from 406 a day earlier, with a further 16,840 cases of the disease, a decrease from a day earlier, Reuters reported. Official data showed that 9.65 million people have been given the first dose of a vaccine, up from a figure of 9.29 million people announced on Monday.The steep spike in the number of fatalities due to the disease comes a day after the deaths dropped to 406 on Monday, the lowest daily figure since December 28.The nation continues to worry as its UK variant of the coronavirus has developed a new, concerning mutation in a small number of cases, which scientists said makes it similar to the South African and Brazilian variants and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines, Reuters reported, with Public Health England saying there had been 11 reports of the UK variant which feature the E484K mutation, mostly in south-west England. The E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, is the same change as has been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants that have caused international concern, the report added.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-drop-uk-witnesses-sharp-one-day-rise-in-fatalities-101612320514844.html

03-02-2021||World||Treasury secretary Yellen to name ex-IMF official Lipton as adviser: Reports||David Lipton, an economist who served as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and U.S. Treasury, will return to government service as a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, six sources familiar with the matter said.Lipton will focus on the U.S. role within the Group of Seven advanced economies and the larger Group of 20 economies in a temporary role, several sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. His appointment comes as the world's top economies are struggling to manage the coronavirus pandemic and ensure a nascent global recovery stays on course.The White House and Treasury had no comment. Lipton did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Bringing Lipton on board to guide international matters will free Yellen to focus on the U.S. economy and work to ensure passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, the sources said. The plan has run into resistance from Republicans in Congress, and Democrats on Tuesday took a first step toward fast-tracking the bill without Republican support. [nL1N2K81MU]"Lipton's presence in the Yellen Treasury is a huge boost for the department's international efforts. He brings immediate credibility and signals that the Biden administration intends to hit the ground running in responding to the economic dimensions of this crisis globally," said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former Treasury official."That would be great news!" tweeted German Finance State Secretary Wolfgang Schmidt.Lipton's experience on international economic issues and his tenure as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs from 1993 to 1998 in the administration of former President Bill Clinton will help Washington as it seeks to rebuild ties with allies and multilateral institutions, people familiar with his assignment said.Several of the sources said Lipton's assignment would help bridge a gap in staffing as Yellen assembles her team.The Senate has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for Yellen's nominated deputy, Wally Adeyemo, and the Biden administration has not yet announced its pick for the international post at Treasury, or who will serve as the G7/G20 sherpa, a job normally housed at the White House.The sources welcomed Lipton's return to official life after IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva ousted him as her top deputy one year ago, some 19 months before his official term was due to expire. He had served nearly 8-1/2 years in the role.Widely respected in economic circles, Lipton, 67, was often critical of former President Donald Trump's trade policies and tariff actions, which triggered heavy costs for U.S. companies and farmers and spawned significant tensions with allies.Lipton began his professional career as an economist at the IMF in 1981, and in addition to his role in the Clinton administration, he held a senior role in the administration of former President Barack Obama.Allies are looking for more muscular U.S. leadership on global issues ranging from climate change, battling the pandemic and staving off a wave of sovereign debt defaults among low-income countries. IMF officials have warned of continued uncertainty and divergent economic trends that threaten to push an additional 90 million people into poverty, as even advanced economies struggle to distribute COVID-19 vaccines.Lipton will also likely have to wade into global talks on taxation after those negotiations came to a standstill under former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.It was not immediately clear when Lipton would start in his new role, but the move could happen quickly since the job does not require Senate confirmation.G7 finance officials are due to meet remotely on Feb. 15, while G20 finance officials are due to meet Feb. 26-27, with debt issues and the financing needs of low-income and emerging market economies a priority.Consensus is building for a new allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights, a move akin to a central bank printing money, that was blocked by Mnuchin. Such a move would provide extra reserves to every IMF member at a time when funding needs remain large, especially for low-income countries hit hard by COVID-19.The Biden administration has signaled support for a new allocation of SDRs, and legislation to back such a move is working its way through the now Democratic-controlled Congress.Yellen spoke with both the IMF's Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass on Tuesday, underscoring the need for close coordination and efforts to reduce debt vulnerabilities and support recovery in low-income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treasury-secretary-yellen-to-name-ex-imf-official-lipton-as-adviser-reports-101612319544156.html
03-02-2021||World||Mexico approves Russia's Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V||Mexico approved the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V for use Tuesday, just hours after the publication of early results of an advanced study saying it is about 91% effective.Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell, the government’s pandemic spokesman, said the health ministry signed a contract Monday for 400,000 doses of Sputnik V that will arrive this month. That is still a tiny amount for Mexico's 126 million people.It couldn't come a moment too soon. Mexico has been hit so hard that hospitals in the capital were 87% full, and ambulance drivers waited hours to find an open bed for patients. Mexico has reported about 159,500 test-confirmed deaths related to COVID-19, but excess-death estimates place the real toll at well over 195,000.“Unfortunately, because of the saturation of the hospitals and the phone lines, we are waiting about three or four hours before they can assign us a hospital, and to get there,” said ambulance crew chief Eduardo Vigueras.Vigueras noted patients are sometimes sent to the only available beds at hospitals, far away from the overwhelmed east side borough of Iztapalapa. He said some relatives get angry and aggressive with paramedics because of the delays in treatment.Because some patients are in such bad shape, some families make an even harder choice. Paramedics say they often go to pick up a seriously ill coronavirus patient only to find their loved ones want to cancel the emergency call, because they know treatment is in such short supply and they may never see their relative again.“A lot of people prefer to keep their relative at home, knowing that they are going to die, but with their loved ones there for the last few minutes, hours, days,” paramedic Paulina Cervantes said.That desperation was on display Tuesday, when the Mexican government launched a new website for people over age 60 to register for appointments to get vaccines that the country doesn't yet have.So many people logged on that the Health Department apparently didn’t have the bandwidth to handle requests. The department’s website was quickly overwhelmed and the registration page didn’t load, returning a message: “Due to the overload of registrations, service has been interrupted. We are correcting and strengthening our infrastructure to avoid such interruptions."The Russian vaccine would become the third to receive emergency approval in Mexico. The regulating agency approved the Pfizer vaccine in December and AstraZeneca’s in January. Mexico turned to the Russian vaccine following delays in obtaining others it was counting on.A dozen countries have already approved the Russian vaccine for use, including Bolivia and Argentina, where López-Gatell visited in January to learn more about it. He acknowledged that there had a been a “legitimate concern” among Mexicans, but that the early results published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet should alleviate them.“The Russian Sputnik V vaccine is safe, it has 92% efficacy against COVID, it can be used safely and is effective in seniors,” López-Gatell said. “It allows us now to accelerate the step of vaccination against COVID in Mexico.”Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a week ago.Mexico has so far given about 675,000 doses of vaccine, all of them from Pfizer. On Tuesday, a second batch of the active substance in the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Mexico, where it will be packed and distributed through the rest of Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-approves-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-101612319329326.html

03-02-2021||World||Days before coup, IMF sent Myanmar emergency aid it cannot get back||Last week, the International Monetary Fund sent $350 million in cash to the Myanmar government, part of a no-strings-attached emergency aid package to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic.Days later, military leaders seized power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected officials, in what the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday constituted a coup.There appears to be little the IMF can do to claw back the funds, part of rapid-disbursing COVID-19 financing programs with almost no conditions and approved by the IMF board on Jan. 13, sources familiar with the payments and international finance experts said."We are following the unfolding developments closely. We are deeply concerned about the impact of events on the economy and on the people of Myanmar," an IMF spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, confirming that the payment was completed last week.U.S. President Joe Biden, facing his first international crisis since taking office less than two weeks ago, has threatened new sanctions against the generals, and the State Department said it would review its foreign assistance to the southeast Asian country.The United States is the dominant shareholder in the IMF, which has provided Myanmar with $700 million in emergency coronavirus financing over the past seven months, including last week's payment, which included $116.6 million through the IMF's Rapid Credit Facility and $233.4 million through the Rapid Financing Instrument.The Fund said in a statement on Jan. 13 that the money would help Myanmar meet "urgent balance-of-payments needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the government’s recovery measures to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability while supporting affected sectors and vulnerable groups."Unlike the IMF's regular financing programs, which have performance benchmarks, the emergency aid is provided quickly, with no way to yank it back."It's not a program that was negotiated, there isn't conditionality and there aren't forward-looking reviews with disbursements tied to those reviews," said Stephanie Segal, a former IMF economist and U.S. Treasury official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington."I'm not aware of any precedent where money that's been approved by the IMF board can be recalled," Segal added.Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis last year, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 80 countries.The timing of the latest disbursement to Myanmar was unfortunate, two sources familiar with the payments said, and pointed to the risks of using rapid financing that gives governments broad discretion over how they spend the money.The best-case scenario is that the Myanmar government that emerges from the current political turmoil will spend the money appropriately because it wants to have a productive relationship with the Fund, one of the sources said.The IMF's counterparty in Myanmar is the central bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/days-before-coup-imf-sent-myanmar-emergency-aid-says-cannot-get-it-back-101612318166392.html

03-02-2021||World||Elon Musk keeps sparring with regulators as Joe Biden cabinet takes reins||Elon Musk has a long history of run-ins with the local, state and federal officials who oversee his growing empires at Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. The world’s richest person shows no signs of changing his ways as US President Joe Biden takes office and bolsters the regulatory agencies defanged by his predecessor.In the past week alone, Musk has tangled with the Federal Aviation Administration over a December rocket test flight that ended in flames and begrudgingly agreed to recall some Tesla cars at highway-safety officials’ urging. And while he announced Tuesday he was taking a break from Twitter -- the platform that previously got him fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- Musk had already used his favorite social-media megaphone in the preceding days to roil stocks of companies from Etsy Inc. to Shopify Inc. during a retail-trading frenzy.The potential for more conflict is building as Biden works to confirm his cabinet secretaries and reinvigorate agencies following the Donald Trump era. Democratic administrations have historically been tougher on industry regulation, and Musk’s empire intersects with government oversight of automobiles, spaceflight, energy, telecommunications and medical equipment.On Tuesday, the FAA said that Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. had ignored the agency back on Dec. 9 to go ahead with a test launch of its massive Starship rocket -- a test that ended in a blazing fireball when the prototype malfunctioned on landing. The FAA said it had rejected SpaceX’s request to exceed the maximum public risk for that launch.The FAA’s comments added some clarity to the dispute that triggered an angry tweet from Musk on Jan. 28 in which he accused the agency of having a “fundamentally broken regulatory structure.” Musk’s ire against the FAA was triggered after another SpaceX test flight was delayed.Without giving much detail, the FAA in a Tuesday email said that SpaceX was now in compliance and could proceed with another test. Within hours, the unmanned Starship SN-9 lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at 2:25 p.m. Tuesday in Boca Chica, Texas, flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) -- and exploded as it attempted to land, much like the earlier rocket.Meanwhile, Tesla has been engaged in a long back and forth with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the failure of touch screens in some of its Model S and Model X vehicles. Last month, NHTSA sent a letter to Tesla saying it had determined the failures constituted a defect. Tesla responded that it “respectfully disagrees” with the finding but will voluntarily initiate a recall. Impacted Tesla customers received emails that said they will be notified “when the parts become available.”“Tesla makes it very clear that they don’t think this is necessary, but they are doing this to make the issue go away,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business, in a phone interview Tuesday. “If NHTSA had not written the recall request letter, Tesla would not have done this.”Musk, 49, is widely heralded for disrupting the auto industry with high performance electric cars and upending Big Aerospace with reusable rockets.His companies are growing: Tesla is building two new factories in Berlin and in Austin, Texas, while SpaceX -- which has contracts with the Air Force and NASA -- is rolling out Starlink, its high speed Internet service, to rural and remote customers across the US, Canada and the UK. There’s also the Boring Co., his tunnel-construction business, and Neuralink, which is testing its brain machine interface device on monkeys and pigs and hopes to begin human trials this year.Musk’s frustration with regulators is legendary.He once hung up during a testy call with the head of the National Transportation Safety Board over Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system; the NTSB was irked in part by the company’s public comments about a crash probe. Tesla has aggressively pushed out Autopilot -- including what it calls a Full Self-Driving upgrade -- much to the consternation of some safety advocates, even as driverless tech rivals like Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit in recent weeks have taken pains to be more transparent and circumspect with their claims.When public health officials in California’s Alameda County ordered Tesla to close its factory last spring, Musk railed against the shut down orders as “fascist” on the company’s earnings call. And despite settling with the SEC over his failed go-private bid in 2018, Musk has continued to taunt the agency, referring to them as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.”The settlement stripped Musk of the chairmanship of Tesla’s board for three years, meaning he could potentially resume the role this fall -- just as the Biden administration is re-establishing the government’s role in oversight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-keeps-sparring-with-regulators-as-joe-biden-cabinet-takes-reins-101612315101582.html
03-02-2021||World||'He invited us': Accused Capitol rioters blame Trump in legal defense||Emanuel Jackson, a 20-year-old Washington area man, was caught on video using a metal bat to strike the protective shields wielded by police officers as they tried to fend off rioters storming the US Capitol on Jan. 6.Jackson, awaiting trial in federal court on assault charges, is now adopting a novel legal defense: seeking to pin the blame on Donald Trump, citing the former president's remarks at a "Stop the Steal" rally shortly before the Capitol siege.Trump told the crowd to "fight like hell," said "we will not take it anymore" and repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. Trump exhorted his followers to go to the Capitol. The ensuing rampage interrupted the congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead including a police officer.Jackson's lawyer, Brandi Harden, wrote in a Jan. 22 court filing that "the nature and circumstances of this offense must be viewed through the lens of an event inspired by the President of the United States."Also Read | Trump 'provoked violence': Lawmakers say in impeachment trial briefThe Capitol siege, Harden added, "appears to have been spontaneous and sparked by the statements made during the 'Stop the Steal' rally." Harden argued that Jackson should be released while awaiting trial. A judge on Jan. 22 denied the request.At least six of the 170 people charged in connection with the Capitol siege have tried to shift at least some of the blame onto Trump as they defend themselves in court or in the court of public opinion.Other defendants to take this route include Jacob Chansley, who donned a horned headdress and face paint during the attack, and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group who is accused of shattering a window in the Capitol with a stolen police shield so rioters could enter."The boss of the country said, 'People of the country, come on down, let people know what you think,'" Pezzola's defense lawyer, Michael Scibetta, told Reuters. "The logical thinking was, 'He invited us down.'"Lawyers have not yet sought dismissal of charges or acquittal during a trial based on the idea that Trump incited their clients, instead making the claim as part of efforts to spare them from pretrial detention.No defendant will be able to avoid criminal culpability by saying they were incited by Trump, said Jay Town, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Trump administration."If anything, it is an admission to criminal conduct," said Town, now the general counsel of cybersecurity firm Gray Analytics. "While this ineffective tactic may help with headlines, it will not help the fate of any defendant."Trump took to a stage near the White House and exhorted supporters to "fight" - using the word more than 20 times. Trump told the crowd that "everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol." About 50 minutes into the speech, many of them did.Trump adviser Jason Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the legal strategy of blaming the former president. Trump has called his speech "totally appropriate."Impeachment trialThe Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on a charge of "incitement of insurrection" stemming from his Jan. 6 speech. He faces an impeachment trial next week in the Senate.Enough of his fellow Republicans in the Senate have signaled opposition to impeachment to indicate that the chamber almost certainly will fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict him. Democrats hope to use the trial to disqualify him from future public office.Lori Ulrich, a defense lawyer in Pennsylvania, said that her client Riley June Williams was motivated by Trump's remarks. Williams, 22, is accused of stealing a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during the siege.It is "regrettable that Ms. Williams took the president's bait and went inside the Capitol," Ulrich told a judge at a Jan. 21 court hearing as she argued against Williams being detained while her case proceeds. The judge released Williams to home confinement.Some legal experts said the "blame Trump" defense could complicate matters for defendants if they eventually plead guilty in hopes of getting a lesser sentence. Town noted that federal judges require defendants who plead guilty to accept full responsibility for their conduct.Scibetta acknowledged the limits of the effectiveness of blaming Trump."It would be reckless to put all your eggs in that basket," Scibetta said.But Scibetta said Trump's speech helps explain how people got swept away in the riot."These were people acting in a way they have never acted before," Scibetta said, "and it begs the question, 'Who lit the fuse?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-invited-us-accused-capitol-rioters-blame-trump-in-legal-defense-101612314980901.html

It challenges the assumption that the area was destroyed by the Mongol invasion of Genghis Khan in the early 13th century.The examination of long-term river dynamics and ancient irrigation networks showed the changing climate and dryer conditions may have been the real cause. “It was climate change, not Genghis Khan, that was the ultimate cause for the demise of Central Asia’s forgotten river civilisations,” Mark Macklin, the study’s author from the University of Lincoln, said in a release from the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-not-genghis-khan-destroyed-central-asia-101612314827166.html
03-02-2021||World||Citizens in Myanmar protest coup with noise barrage||Scores of people in Myanmar's largest city honked car horns and banged on pots and pans on Tuesday evening in the first known public resistance to the coup led a day earlier by the country's military.What was initially planned to take place for just a few minutes extended to more than a quarter hour in several neighborhoods of Yangon. Shouts could be heard wishing detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.“Beating a drum in Myanmar culture is like we are kicking out the devils,” said one participant who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals.Several pro-democracy groups had asked people to make noise at 8 pm to show their opposition to the coup.A senior politician and close confidante of Suu Kyi also urged citizens to defy the military through civil disobedience.Win Htein, a leader of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, spoke Tuesday from a small party office in the capital, Naypyitaw, not far from where hundreds of lawmakers elected in November national polls were detained when the military seized power Monday in a lightning takeover.“The curse of the coup is rooted in our country and this is the reason why our country still remains poor. I feel sad and upset for our fellow citizens and for their future,” the former political prisoner said.“All the voters who gave their backing to us in the 2020 general election should follow Aung San Suu Kyi’s instructions to carry out civil disobedience,” he said, referring to a note posted Monday on Facebook attributed to her.The military began to lift restrictions Tuesday on the hundreds of members of Parliament who had been confined at a guarded government housing complex, with the new government telling them to go back to their homes, party spokesman Kyi Toe said.He said Suu Kyi was in good health at a separate location where she was being held and would stay there for the time being. His comments couldn't immediately be confirmed.The coup came as lawmakers gathered in the capital for the opening of a new parliamentary session. The military said the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud in November’s election, in which Suu Kyi’s party won a majority of seats. It claimed the takeover was legal under the constitution. The move was widely condemned abroad.The coup highlights the extent to which the generals ultimately maintained control in Myanmar, despite more than a decade of talk about democratic reforms. Western countries had greeted the move toward democracy enthusiastically, removing sanctions they had in place for years.Myanmar is facing a growing coronavirus outbreak. As of Tuesday, it had over 140,300 confirmed cases, including about 3,100 deaths. The country has just received its first supply of vaccines from India.Win Htein heavily criticized the generals for the impact he said the coup would have on efforts to protect people’s lives.“These people, they are super crazy to do this. They are not courageous,” he said. “The virus still remains and the people are struggling a lot. Their only priority is power and their personal desire." As a result, he said, "vaccines will be delayed, the economy will go down and there will be pressure from other countries.”The takeover presents a test for the international community. U.S. President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The U.N. Security Council was expected to meet later Tuesday about the military’s actions.Suu Kyi’s party released a statement Tuesday calling for the military to honor the results of the election and release all of those detained — as have the leaders of many other countries.“The commander in chief seizing the power of the nation is against the constitution and it also neglects the sovereign power of people,” the party said.An announcement read on military-owned Myawaddy TV on Monday said Commander in Chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing would be in charge of the country for one year. A new Cabinet composed of current and former generals and former advisers to a previous government headed by former Gen. Thein Sein held its first meeting Tuesday.The takeover marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals, who despite allowing elections maintained control of key ministries and guaranteed themselves enough seats in Parliament to have veto power over any constitutional changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizens-in-myanmar-protest-coup-with-noise-barrage-101612314802911.html
03-02-2021||World||Democrats make case for conviction; Trump denies charges||Donald Trump endangered the lives of all members of Congress when he aimed a mob of supporters “like a loaded cannon” at the US Capitol, House Democrats said Tuesday in making their most detailed case yet for why the former president should be convicted and permanently barred from office. Trump denied the allegations through his lawyers and called the trial unconstitutional.The Democratic legal brief forcefully linked Trump's baseless efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election to the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, saying he bears “unmistakable” blame for actions that threatened the foundation of American democracy.Also Read | Trump 'provoked violence': Lawmakers say in impeachment trial briefIt argued that he must be found guilty when his impeachment trial opens before the Senate next week on a charge of inciting the siege. And it used evocative language to conjure the day's chaos, when “terrified members were trapped in the chamber" and called loved ones “for fear they would not survive.”“His conduct endangered the life of every single member of Congress, jeopardized the peaceful transition of power and line of succession, and compromised our national security," the Democratic managers of the impeachment case wrote.“This is precisely the sort of constitutional offense that warrants disqualification from federal office.”Trump's lawyers responded with their own filing that denied that he had incited the riot by disputing the election results or by exhorting his followers to “fight like hell.” In any event, they said, the trial was unconstitutional now that Trump has left the White House.The dueling filings offer the first public glimpse of the arguments that both sides intend to present at the impeachment trial, Trump's second. They show how Democrats will look to explicitly fault Trump for his role in the riot and to also make the case that his behaviour was so egregious as to require permanent disqualification from office.On the other side will be challenges to the trial's constitutionality and claims that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment.“It is denied that President Trump ever endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,” defense lawyers wrote in a 14-page brief.The Constitution specifies that disqualification from office can be a punishment for an impeachment conviction.“This is not a case where elections alone are a sufficient safeguard against future abuse; it is the electoral process itself that President Trump attacked and that must be protected from him and anyone else who would seek to mimic his behavior,” the Democrats wrote.The Democrats drew heavily on the words of prominent Republicans who have criticized the former president.Among them are Wyoming Rep Liz Cheney, who voted for Trump's impeachment and said there has never been a “greater betrayal” by a president, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Trump “provoked” the rioters.“The only honorable path at that point was for President Trump to accept the results and concede his electoral defeat. Instead, he summoned a mob to Washington, exhorted them into a frenzy, and aimed them like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue,” the Democrats wrote in their 77-page brief.Still, Republicans have signaled that acquittal is likely, with many saying they think Congress should move on and questioning the constitutionality of an impeachment trial — Trump's second — now that he has left office. In a test vote in the Senate last week, 45 Republicans, including McConnell, voted in favor of an effort to dismiss the trial over those constitutional concerns.Though no president has been tried after departing the White House, Democrats say there is precedent, pointing to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who resigned his office in a last-ditch attempt to avoid an impeachment trial. The Senate held it anyway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-make-case-for-conviction-trump-denies-charges-101612314606123.html
03-02-2021||World||Jeff Bezos to give reins to cloud boss Andy Jassy as Amazon's sales rocket past $100 billion||Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday said founder Jeff Bezos would step down as CEO and become executive chairman, as the company reported a third consecutive record profit and quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.The transition, slated for the summer, will make current cloud computing head Andy Jassy the next chief executive of Amazon.Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding Amazon Web Services (AWS) and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions, the company's website said.Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at Mindshare Worldwide, said Jassy's promotion underscored the importance of web services to Amazon's future."Jassy’s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon's business strategy. It’ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth," he said.Jassy is known for understanding technical details, and he has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales.He has bestowed a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS's annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.Bezos, who started the company 27 years ago as an internet bookseller, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon's website, "As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions." Blue Origin is Bezos' space company, and the Post is his private newspaper holding.Bezos, age 57, added, "I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring."COVID SPENDING DOWNNet sales rose to $125.56 billion as consumers turned to the world's largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Amazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.Jassy's AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division announced deals in the quarter with ViacomCBS , the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.Amazon said it was not announcing an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.Meanwhile Amazon's e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon, recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.That has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease. The company has taken an array of COVID-19 precautions and written government officials - including U.S. President Joe Biden - saying it is eager to offer vaccine shots to staff.Amazon beat fourth-quarter estimates for online store sales, subscription sales, third-party service sales such as warehousing and other sales to merchants on its platform.A boost in revenue came from moving Amazon's marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, lengthening the holiday shopping season.(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Lisa Shumaker)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-to-give-reins-to-cloud-boss-andy-jassy-as-amazon-s-sales-rocket-past-100-billion-101612313920624.html

Bezos will transition to the role of executive chairman in the third quarter of 2021 and Andy Jassy who is currently heading Amazon Web Services will take over as the CEO of the company, which he founded almost 27 years ago.The announcement came as Amazon released its financial results for its fourth quarter that ended December 31, 2020. The company recorded USD 100 billion in sales for last three months of 2020.Also Read | Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to step down from company's CEO role this yearAmazon is built from a startup into one of the world's most valuable firms by Bezos. It was launched in 1995 and currently worth nearly $1.7 trillion.In a letter to employees, Bezos said he will now focus on "new products and early initiatives" being developed by Amazon. He also said that he would have more time for side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns.Read the full letter here:Fellow Amazonians:I'm excited to announce that this Q3 I'll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, "What's the internet?" Blessedly, I haven't had to explain that in a long while.Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We've done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime's insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.I don't know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon's, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it's working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you're proud of that as well.I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you've been humble. When times have been tough, you've been strong and supportive, and we've made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.As much as I still tap dance into the office, I'm excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I've never had more energy, and this isn't about retiring. I'm super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.Amazon couldn't be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we've pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian's idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we're flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.Keep inventing, and don't despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-to-step-down-as-amazon-ceo-writes-to-his-1-3-million-employees-read-full-text-here-101612312103214.html
03-02-2021||World||Joe Biden treads carefully in unwinding hardline Trump immigration policies||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered a review of asylum processing at the US-Mexico border and the immigration system as he seeks to undo some of former President Donald Trump's hardline policies.Biden also created a task force to reunite migrant families who were separated at the border by Trump's 2018 'zero tolerance' strategy."We are going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families," Biden said as he signed the orders at the White House.Immigration advocates have urged the new Democratic administration to move quickly but Biden aides say they need time to unravel the many layers of immigration restrictions introduced during the Trump era and to put in place more migrant-friendly systems."It's not going to happen overnight," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier in the day.The cautious strategy reflects the tightrope Biden is walking to reverse hard-line Trump policies while simultaneously trying to prevent a surge in illegal immigration. Biden opponents could also derail or slow down his agenda with lawsuits if his administration moves too quickly and fails to follow proper procedures.In a sign of the wary approach, Biden's executive orders on Tuesday did not address repealing an order known as 'Title 42,' which was issued under the Trump administration to stop the spread of the coronavirus and allows U.S. authorities to expel almost all people caught crossing the border illegally.He did, however, mandate a review of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a Trump program that ordered 65,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings.The Biden administration has already stopped adding people to the program but has not yet outlined how it will process the claims of those already enrolled."I can't tell you exactly how long it will take to put in an alternative to that policy," a senior administration official told reporters on Monday in response to a question about processing MPP enrollees.Chad Wolf, former acting US Department of Homeland Security secretary under Trump, said in an interview that halting the MPP program was a mistake because it had been an effective deterrent to illegal immigration."If you do have a surge (of migrants), you're taking one of your tools off the table," he said in reference to the program.Michelle Brane, a senior director with the New York City-based Women's Refugee Commission, said Biden's latest orders do not appear likely to bring the sort of quick change sought by immigrant advocates."I think we were all hoping for something more immediate and operational, but these seem like they will be more visionary," she said.Brane said advocates will now need to "wait and see" what concrete steps US immigration agencies take to implement Biden's directives.HURDLESBiden's efforts face logistical challenges and opposition from Republicans, according to immigration policy experts, former officials, and activists on both sides of the issue.Lawsuits by conservative groups could potentially slow down Biden's agenda. A federal judge last week temporarily blocked one of his first immigration moves - a 100-day pause on many deportations - after the Republican-led state of Texas sought an injunction.Trump won the presidency in 2016 while making border security a major theme of his campaign. If Biden fails to prevent surges in illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border, he could give ammunition to Republicans in the 2022 congressional elections, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute."This is the thing that rallied Donald Trump supporters," she said.On Tuesday, Biden also called for a review of Trump's so-called 'public charge' rule, which makes it harder for poorer immigrants to obtain permanent residency in the United States.The review is expected to start the process to rescind it, according to two people familiar with the plan.Biden's order setting up the task force to reunite parents and children separated at the southern border was a key election promise.However, the task force will face a daunting challenge in trying to track down the parents of more than 600 children who remain separated, according to a January court filing in a related case. The children are living with relatives or in foster care, an attorney representing plaintiffs in the litigation told Reuters.The task force will be led by Alejandro Mayorkas, one of the senior officials said on Monday. The US Senate on Tuesday confirmed Mayorkas as the new head of the Department of Homeland Security, the first Latino and immigrant to hold that position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-treads-carefully-in-unwinding-hardline-trump-immigration-policies-101612313598818.html

The Biden administration has insisted Iran return to compliance before it would do so."We haven't ... had any discussions with the Iranians, and I wouldn’t expect we would until those initial steps go forward," State Department spokesman Ned Price said, referring to the Biden administration's consultations with allies, partners and the US Congress."There are (many) steps in that process ... before we're reaching the point where we are going to engage directly with the Iranians and willing to entertain any sort of proposal," he added.Another US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Price's comments should not be taken as a rebuff of Zarif's idea, but rather reflected the fact that Biden's Iran team is just settling in and has committed to consult widely."There is no rejection," this official said. "We have not begun negotiating with Iran, or with anyone else, because our priority is to consult" with partners in the nuclear deal and in the region.Under the 2015 accord between Iran and six major powers, Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program, making it harder to develop nuclear weapons in return for relief from economic sanctions.Trump abandoned the deal, which Iran struck with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, reimposed prior US sanctions and placed new ones that have squeezed Iran's economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cool-to-but-does-not-reject-iran-s-idea-on-reviving-nuclear-deal-101612312892664.html
03-02-2021||World||Long-detained immigrant families in US could soon face deportation||Lawyers working with immigrant families detained by the US government for more than a year say they’re worried the families could be deported as soon as this week.Six parents and six children could be placed on deportation flights as early as Wednesday, even though they continue to fight to win asylum, the lawyers said. The families say they were unfairly denied protections under several policies enacted by former President Donald Trump's administration that courts later prohibited.Hundreds of people have been deported in the early days of President Joe Biden's administration, including a woman who was a witness to the 2019 massacre at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. While a federal judge barred Biden from enforcing a 100-day moratorium on deporting most people in the US without authorization, the judge's order did not require the US government to resume deportations as before. Legal experts say ICE generally has the discretion to delay deportation flights, keep immigrants detained, or release people on bond even if they have final deportation orders.Since the judge's order, ICE has deported people to at least five countries, according to the agency and advocates for people deported.The families facing deportation have been held at the family detention center at Dilley, Texas, created by the former administration of President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. Biden on Tuesday announced executive orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration intended to unwind Trump-era policies.ICE said last week that 230 people were detained at the Dilley facility. The agency declined to confirm the pending deportations of the families.In a letter sent to Department of Homeland Security officials Tuesday, immigration groups called on the Biden administration to “immediately halt the deportations of asylum seeking parents and their children.” It noted that new Homeland Security guidance that went into effect Monday — and was not affected by the federal judge's moratorium bar — established the department's enforcement priorities as “protecting national security, border security, and public safety.”Many of the families at Dilley who have been detained for more than a year came within hours of being deported under the Trump administration before last-minute appeals delayed the process. Some have been taken to airports and brought back.Shalyn Fluharty, director of the legal group Proyecto Dilley, which represents the families, noted that the parents and children facing deportation fought throughout the Trump administration, which enacted a series of restrictive immigration policies, including the separation of thousands of immigrant families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longdetained-immigrant-families-in-us-could-soon-face-deportation-101612312382948.html
03-02-2021||World||Pentagon chief purges defence boards; Donald Trump loyalists out||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered hundreds of Pentagon advisory board members to resign this month as part of a broad review of the panels, essentially purging several dozen who were appointed last-minute under the Trump administration.During the last two months of his tenure, former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller removed a number of longtime members from several defence policy, health, science and business boards and replaced many with loyalists of former President Donald Trump. More than 30 of those replacements will now be forced to resign, including former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski."I am directing the immediate suspension of all advisory committee operations until the review is completed unless otherwise directed by myself or the deputy secretary of defense," Austin said in a memo released Tuesday. And he ordered all committee members who were appointed by the defence secretary to resign no later than February 16.Austin said the review will assess whether each board provides value and make sure its focus aligns with "our most pressing strategic priorities and the National Defense Strategy"Tata, a former Fox News commentator, failed to get through Senate confirmation for the top Pentagon policy job early last year because of offensive remarks he had made, including about Islam. In November, however, Trump appointed him to that same post, just days after firing then-Defence Secretary Mark Esper and putting Miller in the job.Miller appointed Tata to the Defense Policy Board on January 19, his last full day on the job. Gingrich was appointed to that same board. Lewandowski was appointed to the Defense Business Board.A senior defence official said Austin's decision was driven by the frenetic activity of Miller to remove dozens of board members and replace them in such a short amount of time between Trump's election loss and the inauguration of President Joe Biden.Of the 42 advisory panels listed in Austin's memo, 31 will have their members removed, six will be part of the review but their members will be retained, and five others have either no members at this time or have concluded their business. Among the 31 are some of the department's most well-known boards, including those with purview over defence policy, science, health, innovation, Arlington National Cemetery and women in the military.Altogether there are more than 600 members on the 42 boards. Defence officials said they do not know exactly how many are being asked to resign, but it will be hundreds.The boards of visitors for the Army, Navy and Air Force academies will keep their members, because those are presidential appointments that Austin does not have the authority to overturn. Among the Trump appointees who will remain on those boards are his former press secretary Sean Spicer and longtime adviser Kellyanne Conway. Those boards, however, will be subject to the review.One new congressionally-mandated commission is also being purged of the four members that Miller appointed in early January. The panel has not started its work yet, but will be responsible for figuring out how to go about renaming military bases and property that honour Confederate leaders. The panel is not subject to Austin's broader review, but he intends to appoint four new members.In a letter to Austin this week, US Reps. Anthony Brown, D-Md., and Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, called for the removal of the four Miller appointees on the renaming board. Trump had opposed the renaming of bases, and cited that as a reason for vetoing the defence bill, which included a provision setting up the panel to handle the process."Those who are called to serve their nation in this matter must have a deep understanding of and expertise in the history of Confederate monuments and their role in the white supremacist movement," Brown and Beatty wrote to Austin.The defence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Austin believed that stopping the activity of all the boards and doing a more intensive review was the fairest and most consistent process.Officials said the review will look at whether the boards have overlapping jurisdictions and whether they should be realigned or if money could be saved by trimming some of them. It also will make recommendations on the membership balance, size and mission of all the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-purges-defence-boards-donald-trump-loyalists-out-101612311741567.html

Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, however, said McDonald's was justified in relying on Easterbrook's statements that he had only a single inappropriate relationship when the Chicago-based company ousted him.A lawyer for Easterbrook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.McDonald's said it looked forward to proving Easterbrook's misconduct."He violated the company's policies, disrespected its values and abused the trust of his co-workers, the board, our franchisees and our shareholders," it said in a statement.McDonald's sued Easterbrook in August, nine months after reaching the severance package, claiming he never gave directors a complete picture of his relationships with employees.It said that after Easterbrook's ouster, an anonymous tip led to the discovery of dozens of nude or sexually explicit photos of women, including three employees, that Easterbrook sent to his personal email account from his company account.McDonald's said Easterbrook deleted the emails shortly before his ouster, but they remained on a company server."This active concealment makes it at least reasonably conceivable the company had no way of knowing the full extent of Easterbrook's misconduct," Slights wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-can-sue-ousted-ceo-over-alleged-lies-about-affairs-judge-101612311195773.html

03-02-2021||World||Suspected China hackers used SolarWinds bug to spy on US payroll agency: Report||Suspected Chinese hackers exploited a flaw in software made by SolarWinds Corp to help break into US government computers last year, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a new twist in a sprawling cybersecurity breach that US lawmakers have labeled a national security emergency.Two people briefed on the case said FBI investigators recently found that the National Finance Center, a federal payroll agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was among the affected organizations, raising fears that data on thousands of government employees may have been compromised.The software flaw exploited by the suspected Chinese group is separate from the one the United States has accused Russian government operatives of using to compromise up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including sensitive federal agencies, by hijacking the company's Orion network monitoring software.Security researchers have previously said a second group of hackers was abusing SolarWinds' software at the same time as the alleged Russian hack, but the suspected connection to China and ensuing US government breach have not been previously reported.Reuters was not able to establish how many organizations were compromised by the suspected Chinese operation. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations, said the attackers used computer infrastructure and hacking tools previously deployed by state-backed Chinese cyberspies.A USDA spokesman said in an email "USDA has notified all customers (including individuals and organizations) whose data has been affected by the SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise."In a follow-up statement after the story was published, a different USDA spokesman said the NFC was not hacked and that "there was no data breach related to Solar Winds" at the agency. He did not provide further explanation.The Chinese foreign ministry said attributing cyberattacks was a "complex technical issue" and any allegations should be supported with evidence. "China resolutely opposes and combats any form of cyberattacks and cyber theft," it said in a statement.SolarWinds said it was aware of a single customer that was compromised by the second set of hackers but that it had "not found anything conclusive" to show who was responsible. The company added that the attackers did not gain access to its own internal systems and that it had released an update to fix the bug in December.In the case of the sole client it knew about, SolarWinds said the hackers only abused its software once inside the client's network. SolarWinds did not say how the hackers first got in, except to say it was "in a way that was unrelated to SolarWinds."The FBI declined to comment.Although the two espionage efforts overlap and both targeted the U.S. government, they were separate and distinctly different operations, according to four people who have investigated the attacks and outside experts who reviewed the code used by both sets of hackers.While the alleged Russian hackers penetrated deep into SolarWinds network and hid a "back door" in Orion software updates which were then sent to customers, the suspected Chinese group exploited a separate bug in Orion's code to help spread across networks they had already compromised, the sources said.'EXTREMELY SERIOUS BREACH'The side-by-side missions show how hackers are focusing on weaknesses in obscure but essential software products that are widely used by major corporations and government agencies."Apparently SolarWinds was a high value target for more than one group," said Jen Miller-Osborn, the deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks' Unit42.Former U.S. chief information security officer Gregory Touhill said separate groups of hackers targeting the same software product was not unusual. "It wouldn't be the first time we've seen a nation-state actor surfing in behind someone else, it's like 'drafting' in NASCAR," he said, where one racing car gets an advantage by closely following another's lead.The connection between the second set of attacks on SolarWinds customers and suspected Chinese hackers was only discovered in recent weeks, according to security analysts investigating alongside the US government.Reuters could not determine what information the attackers were able to steal from the National Finance Center (NFC) or how deep they burrowed into its systems. But the potential impact could be "massive," former U.S. government officials told Reuters.The NFC is responsible for handling the payroll of multiple government agencies, including several involved in national security, such as the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security Department and Treasury Department, the former officials said.Records held by the NFC include federal employee social security numbers, phone numbers and personal email addresses as well as banking information. On its website, the NFC says it "services more than 160 diverse agencies, providing payroll services to more than 600,000 Federal employees.""Depending on what data were compromised, this could be an extremely serious breach of security," said Tom Warrick, a former senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security. "It could allow adversaries to know more about US officials, improving their ability to collect intelligence."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-china-hackers-used-solarwinds-bug-to-spy-on-us-payroll-agency-report-101612310857146.html

Last week, he announced a plan to reopen New York City’s indoor dining on Feb. 14 to 25% capacity, raising questions about whether restaurant workers should then be included in eligibility lists. He has also been asked to make those with health conditions eligible to receive the vaccine.Facing supply shortages in New York, Cuomo has pushed back against requests to open up vaccines to even more groups of people. “Without a significant increase in the supply, it’s all just posturing,” Cuomo said.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier Tuesday that he supported including restaurant workers in the category of people who are eligible to receive the vaccine.“The restaurant workers now are going to be in enclosed places with people eating and drinking. And every doctor on this line or any place else will say, that’s an area of concern,” de Blasio said in a Tuesday briefing. “ Now that the state has made this decision, it follows that we have to protect those workers and they should be added to the 1b category.”Cuomo said the state has administered about 2 million vaccine doses for about 7 million eligible residents. Expanding eligibility to the immuno-compromised would add another 4 million in a state that’s getting about 300,000 doses a week from the federal government, Cuomo said.Cuomo said the Biden administration told governors on Tuesday that the state’s vaccine allocation will rise by another 5% over the next three weeks, on top of a previous boost of about 16%. The federal government also told governors during a call earlier Tuesday that they would give an additional 10% of the states’ allocation to pharmacies, which will result in another 30,000 doses for those in New York, Cuomo said.New York’s Covid numbers continue to improve, the governor said. The state’s seven-day average rate of positive tests is below 5% for the first time since early December, Cuomo said.The state plans to test targeting vaccine supply in areas with high positivity, Cuomo said. The Yankee Stadium will be open only for for residents in the Bronx, which has the highest positive rate among New York City’s boroughs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-says-earlier-covid-shot-for-cabdrivers-waiters-101612293902837.html
03-02-2021||World||India key production partner for Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, says RDIF CEO||India is the key production partner for Russia's Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus, Kirill Dmitriev, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Tuesday."India is a key partner in terms of production of vaccine and we do expect that there will be restricted emergency use order for Sputnik V vaccine this month or next. After that, we will be able to start our vaccine delivery to India" Dmitriev told ANI."The data published by The Lancet shows that Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with the efficacy of over 90 per cent but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of 2 to 8 degrees, and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind," Dmitriev said.Dmitriev further stated that "For many other vaccines that have efficacy less than 90 per cent Sputnik V vaccine is willing to partner with them with one of our shots just as we are working with AstraZeneca to increase the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine."According to the result of an interim analysis of the phase 3 trials published by the journal Lancet, Russian's Sputnik V is 91.6 per cent effective at protecting people from COVID-19."Sputnik V is already registered in 16 countries including Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Argentina, Bolivia, Algeria, Palestine, Venezuela, Paraguay, Turkmenistan, Hungary, UAE, Iran, Republic of Guinea, Tunisia and Armenia," read the Lancet's paper.The paper further stated that in the first week of February, vaccination with Sputnik V will start in the 12 countries including Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Palestine, UAE, Paraguay, Hungary, Armenia, Algeria, Bosnian Serb Republic, Venezuela and Iran.

03-02-2021||World||Oxford finds AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot 76% effective for 3 months after single dose||Oxford University and AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine showed in a study it had 76% efficacy against symptomatic infection for three months after a single dose, which increased if the second shot is delayed, backing Britain's vaccine rollout policy.The findings of the pre-print paper, which had not been peer-reviewed, supported Britain's decision to extend the interval between initial and booster doses of the shot to 12 weeks, Oxford said on Tuesday.However, the new study did not address concerns about a lack of data on efficacy among the oldest, who the British government have given highest priority in its vaccine rollout.Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said the data showed the 12-week interval between doses was "the optimal approach to roll out, and reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose".Britain has decided to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible by lengthening the amount of time between initial shots and booster shots to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.AstraZeneca's research chief has said 8-12 weeks between doses seems to be the "sweet spot" for efficacy, contrasting with US drugmaker Pfizer, which has warned that the vaccine it has developed with Germany's BionTech was not trialled with such an interval.The results for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, gathered from trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, showed that immune responses were boosted with a longer interval to the second dose among participants aged 18 to 55 years."Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination was 76%, and modelled analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3 month period," Oxford academics said in the preprint.The paper said that vaccine efficacy was 82.4% with 12 or more weeks to the second dose, compared to 54.9% for those where the booster was given under 6 weeks after the first dose.The longest interval between doses for those aged 56 and over was between 6-8 weeks, so there was no data for the efficacy of a 12 week dosing gap in that cohort.Europe's medicine regulator has flagged that there is not enough data to determine how well the vaccine will work in people aged over 55, but Britain has expressed confidence the vaccine works in all age groups.The study said that no-one out of the 12,408 people vaccinated with a single dose of the vaccine was hospitalised with Covid-19 from 22 days after immunisation.Oxford also said data seemed to suggest the vaccine reduced transmission of infections, with a 67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated in the British arm of the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-finds-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-shot-76-effective-for-3-months-101612292539936.html

03-02-2021||World||Biden’s executive orders to undo more of Trump’s immigration policies||US President Joe Biden will sign three executive orders on Tuesday that will reunite families separated by the Trump administration’s hardline policies, improve access to the asylum system and make it more humane and remove barriers from legal immigration.This will be the second lot of executive orders issued by Biden. In the first, seven orders issued on his first day in office, he had rescinded former president Donald Trump’s “Muslim ban”, stopped work on the border wall and reinstated protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. The president had also sent to Congress an immigration reforms legislation, which among other things, provided a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants.Also read: Accused Capitol rioters blame Trump in legal defenseA memo issued by the White House on Tuesday said the president’s new orders are based on a strategy that is “centered on the basic premise that our country is safer, stronger, and more prosperous with a fair, safe and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families together, and allow people — both newly arrived immigrants and people who have lived here for generations — to more fully contribute to our country”.The first executive order will create a task force to reunite parents and children separated by the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy. The exact number of affected children is not clear, but Associated Press has reported that 5,500 such children have been identified in court documents. The task force will be headed by Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s nominee to head the department of homeland security.The second order will seek to address the root of irregular migration” in the region the US in a three-step plan, to be coordinated with countries in the region. It will also review the asylum protocol — essentially the “Remain in Mexico” policy — that forced applicants to stay in Mexico as they awaited months for court hearings.The third order will seek to remove barriers from legal immigration. It will instruct government agencies dealing with immigration to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of recent regulations”.Under the scanner will be the “public charge” rule, under which the US could turn down immigration applicants who, it deemed, would need government assistance to survive. Though the order will not end that rule yet, it will rescind a Trump-era memorandum that required Americans to reimburse the government for any public benefits extended to relatives they were sponsoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-executive-orders-to-undo-more-of-trump-s-immigration-policies-101612285544794.html
