A counter demonstration also took place in southern Paris against the controversial group.Generation Identity has scraped through several legal battles, but is up against Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who wants to disband the controversial group. Critics contend it is a militia espousing a racist cause.The Lyon-based group has influence throughout France and beyond. It contends its members are whistle-blowers on a mission to preserve French and European civilization, seen as undermined by newcomers, notably Muslims.Generation Identity was the backbone of a 2017 “Defend Europe” mission on the high seas with a chartered anti-migrant ship manned by European citizens.Darmanin announced earlier this month the start of proceedings to dissolve Generation Identity. The group was given 10 days to make its case. The Interior Ministry cited France’s security code forbidding “combat or private militia groups” and groups that “provoke discrimination, hate or (racial) violence,” according to the daily Liberation which saw a copy of the seven-page justification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-protest-in-support-of-anti-migrant-group-in-paris-101613842654033.html

A Tennessee farmer died trying to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.About 260,000 homes and businesses in the Tennessee county that includes Memphis were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and pumping station problems. Restaurants that could not do so or did not have bottled water were ordered to close.Water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights, but the passenger terminal was expected to reopen by midafternoon Saturday.The storms left more than 300,000 still without power across the country by Saturday morning. About 60,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a half hours after arriving.“We need water, the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have,” Davis said.The water woes were the latest misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week forced rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand that buckled the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the system.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached breaking point.The rolling blackouts resulted in a lawsuit filed Friday in a Nueces County court at law in Corpus Christi, claiming ERCOT ignored repeated warnings of weaknesses in the state’s power infrastructure.A Dallas law firm alleged ERCOT and the American Electric Power utility caused property damage and business interruptions during the cold wave.Also, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and electric utility companies, vowing to get “to the bottom of this power failure.” The investigation will cover power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter storm.“The large-scale failure of Texas power companies to withstand the winter storm left multiple millions of Texans without power and heat during lethal, record-low temperatures across the state,” Paxton’s office said in a statement.In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.As of Friday afternoon, more than 1,300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.More than 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director, Greg Maszaros, implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”In Dallas, David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.“It’s pretty much first come, first served,” said Lopez, as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water until Sunday or Monday, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals, but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled, spokeswoman Gale Smith said.St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled drinking water and bagged ice and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.Rhodes College in Memphis said Friday that about 700 residential students were being moved to hotels in the suburbs of Germantown and Collierville after school bathrooms stopped functioning because of low water pressure.Central Arkansas Water in the Little Rock area asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.A broken pipe at the Museum of Discovery in Little Rock flooded its building, causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skink lizard.More than 192,000 Louisiana residents -- some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura -- had no water service Friday, according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned for the hardest-hit areas with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.In the Louisiana community of Hackberry, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warmer-temps-bring-relief-as-cold-weary-south-starts-cleanup-101613842404445.html

The hospital's website says visits are only allowed in “exceptional circumstances” because of the coronavirus pandemic.Philip, 99, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday on the advice of his doctor in what Buckingham Palace described as “a precautionary measure.”The husband of Queen Elizabeth II is expected to remain through the weekend and into next week.Philip’s illness is not believed to be related to Covid-19. Both he and the queen, 94, received a first dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus in early January.Philip, who retired from public duties in 2017, rarely appears in public. His most recent public event was a military ceremony at Buckingham Palace in July.During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, has been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen, who has performed duties such as meetings with dignitaries remotely.The royal household is planning celebrations to mark Philip’s 100th birthday on June 10, lockdown restrictions permitting.Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.The youngest great-grandchild, son of Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, was born Feb. 9 and has been named Augustus Philip Hawke Brooksbank, with one of his middle names a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-charles-visits-99-year-old-prince-philip-in-hospital-101613842189659.html

Those in the industry say many of the licensed prostitutes, who work as independent contractors, have struggled to qualify for unemployment benefits since closures began last March and some have opted to take their work into the shadows, offering sex illegally.While the business of legal bordellos may seem incompatible with social distancing, sex workers and brothel owners say that’s not the case. Like other close-contact industries such as massage therapy and dental services, they contend brothels should be allowed to reopen with protective measures.“We could easily do work at arm’s length, just the same as they do within the massage parlors, which are open in the state of Nevada,” sex worker Alice Little said. “You can go to a dentist and have him put his hands in your mouth. You can go to a tattoo parlor and get your face tattooed right now. You can get piercings put in your face. You’re certainly not masked for any of those things."So far, Nevada officials haven't agreed.A state task force that makes recommendations on coronavirus restrictions hasn't responded to pleas from brothel owners seeking a way to reopen. And a lawsuit Little filed against Gov. Steve Sisolak last year fizzled.The Democratic governor recently said brothels, along with other adult entertainment like nightclubs and strip clubs, would stay closed at least through May 1. After that, the state may let counties decide whether to allow those businesses to open, as long as Covid-19 infections aren't surging.Nevada, like many states, saw a spike of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the winter holidays, but since mid-January, those numbers have been steadily declining.Prostitution is only legal in Nevada's estimated 20 licensed brothels, whose sex workers undergo regular tests for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS and obtain required work cards from local law enforcement after passing an FBI background check.A throwback to the state’s days as a Wild West mining territory, brothels were illegal but tolerated in some areas until Nevada legalized them in 1971.They’re only allowed to operate in counties with populations of less than 700,000 people. Brothels and prostitution are illegal in the counties that include Las Vegas and Reno, but some brothels are a half-hour to an hour away. Some offer free limo rides from the casino-heavy cities.Little, who was working at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel in the capital of Carson City, says she has lost 95% of her income amid the closures. She said she’s been providing virtual dates, webcam experiences and creating X-rated content through subscriber site OnlyFans, among other ventures.“At this point, I am able to survive. I am able to pay my bills. I’m able to put food on the table, but I have had to dip into my savings," Little said.Other brothel workers who are not comfortable linking their faces to online sex work have had a harder time pivoting to virtual services, she said. Finding a job outside the stigmatized sex industry also can be tough, Little said, because background checks can reveal the work authorization cards prostitutes must have in brothels.Allissa Starr, who was working at Sheri’s Ranch brothel in Pahrump, about an hour outside Las Vegas, said some women she worked with are illegally offering sex for money despite virus concerns.“They’re just doing what they can,” she said.Starr, like Little, started offering virtual dates, where she might share a glass of wine, dinner and conversation with clients. Starr said she eventually got assistance under the federal pandemic unemployment program for gig workers, but it was about 10% of what she had been making and is set to run out soon.Starr said she's able to cover her bills but can no longer put thousands in savings. She moved to Pittsburgh to live closer to family and save on rent. She's starting a self-care business but said if Nevada’s brothels reopen, she’d come back to work one week a month.“It’s a way to easily provide money for me and my family, and it’s a way to provide security,” Starr said.Reopening the brothels, Starr said, is “a personal risk, just like traveling. If you wear your mask, if the girls got Covid tests before they came to the ranch, I think it could be done safely.”Mustang Ranch, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Reno, appears to be the only brothel still offering some kind of companionship, taking advantage of an escort license it's had for about two decades. The license allows customers to hire women for nonsexual companionship.Owner Lance Gilman said temperatures are taken, masks are worn and customers must come to the ranch and say where they’ll go on a date, typically a restaurant or casino.Gilman said it’s a much-reduced operation — usually, about 30 women were available for hire 24/7. Only three or four women are working as escorts because many of them are uncomfortable leaving the security of the property for a date, he said.Mustang Ranch submitted a proposed plan to state officials that suggests reopening for contactless dates in private rooms, with masks and gloves worn by workers."In this industry, much, if not the majority, of the courtesan-customer interaction does not involve physical contact even during normal business operations,” the proposal says.State officials haven't approved the plan.Asked how the brothel could ensure sex workers and customers have no physical contact behind closed doors, Gilman said there’s no way to make such a guarantee: “All you can do is rely upon the credibility and the ethics of the commitments that are made.”“Human nature is human nature,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-makes-prostitution-taboo-in-nevada-s-legal-brothels-101613840468870.html

A Moscow City Court judge only reduced the sentence from two years and eight months to just over 2 1/2 years.The verdict came even as the country faced a top European rights court’s order to free Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-court-fines-opposition-leader-navalny-for-defaming-wwii-veteran-101613840889545.html
20-02-2021||World||India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines||India and the Maldives on Saturday signed five agreements, including one for a $25-million line of credit for development of roads, as visiting external affairs minister S Jaishankar handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Indian Ocean archipelago.Jaishankar held talks with Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid as he began a two-day visit to review bilateral ties and development cooperation. Jaishankar also offered a $40-million line of credit to support the development of sports infrastructure in Maldives, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Indian assistance in the neighbourhood.This is Jaishankar’s second foreign visit this year, and the trip will also take him to Mauritius on February 22. He visited Sri Lanka last month and will travel to Bangladesh in March to prepare the ground for a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The ‘India First’ foreign policy of President [Ibrahim] Solih is reciprocated in full measure by Prime Minister Modi’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, in which the Maldives enjoys a central position,” Jaishankar said at a media interaction with Shahid.Speaking in Hindi, Shahid described the two countries as the wings of a bird. “A bird in flight stays true on course, with not one but two wings in synchronised motion. Our two countries are just like those wings. We work in harmony; we work together, with the same interests, aiming to reach the same destination.”Among the five agreements signed by the two sides was one to repurpose the balance of a $40-million line of credit provided by India in 2011 and use $25 million to develop roads across the Maldives. India’s EXIM Bank and local authorities signed a letter of intent on financing a housing project of 2,000 units at Hulhumale.The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a grant of $500,000 for a fish processing plant at Kendhikulhudhoo in northern Maldives, a MoU between Prasar Bharati and Public State Media of the Maldives on capacity building and exchange of content and expertise, and a MoU on sustainable urban development.Jaishankar handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, provided as a grant, to Shahid and health minister Ahmed Naseem. The Maldives had earlier received another 100,000 doses last month under India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative.The Maldives, Jaishankar noted, was the “first and largest recipient of India’s Covid-19 support, and had received Indian-made vaccines within 96 hours of the rollout of New Delhi’s vaccination programme. The Maldives has since become third best in the world in terms of daily doses administered for every 100 people, he said.Jaishankar and Shahid also reviewed the ongoing India-backed infrastructure projects under two lines of credit worth $1.2 billion. A contract for a key infrastructure project for building roads in Addu will be signed on Sunday. Jaishankar also noted that the Greater Malé Connectivity Project, the largest connectivity venture in the Maldives, is in tendering stage, while other projects, such as the Hanimadhoo airport expansion and development of Gulifalhu port, are progressing well.“Needless to say, these projects will conform to the hallmarks of Indian development cooperation, which are transparency, full participation and ownership of the host country and competitive pricing,” he said.Jaishankar also reiterated India’s support to the candidature of Shahid for the post of president of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in 2022. Jaishankar said that Shahid, with his diplomatic experience and leadership qualities, is “best equipped to preside over the General Assembly of 193 nations”.He added, “We will work together to make this a reality. We would really like to work with you during our membership of the UN Security Council for 2021-22.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-maldives-sign-5-deals-eam-hands-over-1-lakh-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-101613839151370.html
20-02-2021||World||Impeachment vote becomes defining moment for Republican senator||When Sen. Richard Burr stood and said “guilty,” there were hushed gasps in the Senate chamber. But the North Carolina Republican’s vote to convict former President Donald Trump should not have come as a shock.In a way, he had been telegraphing his willingness to hold Trump accountable for several years.Months before Trump would begin falsely claiming the election had been stolen, the Senate Intelligence Committee led by Burr warned that sitting public officials should use the “absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering publicly calling the validity of an upcoming election into question.” Such grave allegations, the committee said in February 2020, can have “significant” consequences for national security.Explaining his vote to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Burr returned to that theme. He said Trump “promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election.”There was no widespread fraud in the election, as Trump claimed falsely over several months and again to his supporters just before the riot, a fact confirmed by election officials across the country and even Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr.When the Capitol was attacked, Burr said in the statement, Trump “used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault.”For Burr, it was an emphatic statement after years of careful commentary about Trump, much of it made as he investigated Trump's ties to Russia. The “guilty” vote placed him among a group of seven Republicans in the Senate -- and 10 Republicans in the House -- who made Trump’s second impeachment the most bipartisan in history.With Burr retiring at the end of his term in 2022, it’s a vote that could end up defining his career.It also came with price.The North Carolina Republican Party unanimously voted to censure Burr in the days after the Feb. 13 vote as Republicans in the state and across the country made clear their continued loyalty to Trump.“Wrong vote, Sen. Burr,” tweeted former Republican Rep. Mark Walker, who has already declared his Senate candidacy.Burr declined to be interviewed for this story. But many of his GOP colleagues praised him after the vote.North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who voted to acquit Trump, said after the state censure vote that Burr is a “great friend and a great senator” who had voted his conscience. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, one of the seven Republicans who voted to convict and a member of the Intelligence Committee, said Burr "is a leader, not a motormouth" who distinguished himself with bipartisan work on the committee.A quirky, quiet politician known for his dry sense of humor, his distaste for wearing socks and for driving a 1970s-era convertible Volkswagen plastered with bumper stickers, Burr has served in Congress for almost three decades. A former Wake Forest football player and lawn equipment salesman, he was elected to the House during the Republican wave of 1994 and became close friends with Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, before Boehner became speaker.First elected to the Senate in 2004, Burr said after his 2016 reelection that his third term would be his last —- a preemptive retirement from politics that proved consequential.After Trump’s victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrestled with how to respond to allegations of Russia’s interference in the election. With Burr not seeking another term, he was an ideal candidate to lead the politically explosive investigation.Empowered as committee chairman, Burr gradually became a quiet check on Trump’s powers during the three-year investigation. He worked closely the top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, as they sifted through highly classified information, some of it about Trump and his associates.Burr kept up the partnership even as Republicans turned sharply against the investigation and followed Trump’s lead in labeling it all a “hoax.”Warner said in an interview he thinks one of main things that guided Burr was to ensure that intelligence agencies got “the respect they deserve.” That meant pushing back on Trump, who criticized the agencies for investigating Russia and suggested they had conspired against him by undermining the 2016 election. Burr endorsed the agencies’ 2017 conclusion that Russia had interfered and favored Trump, even as Trump declined to do so.Burr has “shown time and again he’s going to do what he thinks is right,” Warner said.As the investigation dragged on, patience wore thin among Burr's GOP colleagues. More than two years into the investigation, in May 2019, Burr subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son who had met with a Russian lawyer during the campaign. The backlash from Burr's own party was swift.Exactly a year later, as the Russia investigation was wrapping up, Burr’s time leading the committee ended abruptly.Federal agents arrived at Burr’s Washington-area home and seized his cellphone. The Justice Department was investigating whether he had exploited advance information when he unloaded as much as $1.7 million in stocks in the days before the coronavirus outbreak caused markets to plummet. Burr denied trading on private information but stepped aside from his role on the committee.He wasn’t cleared until almost a year later — on Jan. 19, Trump’s last full day in office.As the impeachment process unfolded in January, Burr said very little. He sided with most Republicans in a vote to dismiss the trial, creating an expectation he’d also vote to acquit.So when Burr stood up to vote for Trump's conviction, many wondered if there would be other surprises. Could there be enough Republican “guilty” votes to make Trump the first president even convicted at an impeachment trial? Was Burr a bellwether?He wasn't. The 57-43 vote was 10 short of the needed two-thirds majority. Seven Republicans had voted to convict — but only Burr’s came with no warning.“I do not make this decision lightly,” Burr said in a statement after the vote, “but I believe it is necessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-vote-becomes-defining-moment-for-republican-senator-101613837290554.html
20-02-2021||World||Nigerian Instagram star aided North Korea cyber crime, US Says||A Nigerian social-media celebrity helped North Korean hackers launder money stolen from a Maltese bank, US officials said.Ramon Olorunwa Abbas played a supporting role in cyber-scams perpetrated by three computer programmers accused of extorting more than $1.3 billion of cash and cryptocurrency, the Justice Department said on Feb. 17. Abbas, who is widely known as “Hushpuppi” and is in US custody while awaiting trial, has 2.5 million followers on Instagram, where he regularly posted photographs posing with luxury cars or boarding private jets.North Korean state operatives “are the world’s leading bank robbers,” John Demers, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said, after unsealing the indictment of Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok. The trio and other unidentified North Koreans were involved in the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. in 2014 and the attempted theft of nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016, according to the US government. More recently, the group has focused on stealing cryptocurrencies, according to prosecutors.The hackers allegedly turned to a network including Abbas “to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist” from an unidentified Maltese bank in February 2019. The Nigerian worked with a Canadian, Ghaleb Alaumary, who US officials accused of organising teams to launder millions of dollars stolen by hacking automated teller machines, including from BankIslami in Pakistan and a bank in India, according to the Justice Department.Alaumary, 37, began cooperating with US authorities in October 2019 and secretly signed a plea agreement last November, according to court papers unsealed in Los Angeles on Feb. 17.Abbas was extradited in July from Dubai to the US where he faces criminal charges of allegedly conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from “business email compromise” frauds and other scams.Gal Pissetzky, Abbas’s former lawyer, told Forbes magazine in July 2020 that he was “absolutely not guilty” of those charges and hadn’t taken part in in any fraud. Pissetzky and Abbas’s other lawyer both quit the defense in January.The Nigerian was part of a group that allegedly tricked a paralegal at a US law firm into wiring them almost $923,000 in October 2019, according to US authorities. He and a partner also are accused of plotting to steal 100 million pounds ($125 million) from an unnamed soccer club in the English Premier League.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerian-instagram-star-aided-north-korea-cyber-crime-us-says-101613837266415.html
20-02-2021||World||New legislation would protect US drivers who hit protestors||When massive demonstrations against racial injustice erupted across the nation last summer, protesters used an increasingly common tactic to draw attention to their cause: swarming out onto major roads to temporarily paralyze traffic.This method sometimes resulted in searing images of drivers plowing through crowds, causing serious injuries and in some cases, deaths.Now, Republican politicians across the country are moving to stop the road-blocking maneuver, proposing increased penalties for demonstrators who run onto highways and legal immunity for drivers who hit them. The bills are among dozens introduced in Legislatures aimed at cracking down on demonstrations.“It’s not going to be a peaceful protest if you’re impeding the freedom of others,” said Rep. Kevin McDugle, the author of an Oklahoma bill granting criminal and civil immunity to people who drive into crowds on roads. “The driver of that truck had his family in there, and they were scared to death."He referred to an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.Tumultuous demonstrations by left-leaning and right-leaning groups have stirred new debate about what tactics are acceptable free speech and which go too far. In addition to blocking roads, Black Lives Matter demonstrators have taken over parks and painted slogans on streets and structures, while right-wing groups have brandished firearms and stormed capitol buildings. Local authorities' responses have wavered as they try to avoid escalating conflicts.Now legislators in Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah and about a dozen other states have introduced new counterprotest measures.The traffic-blocking tactic has attracted the most concern because of the obvious hazard.In one particularly chilling incident in Minneapolis, a large tanker truck drove at high speed through thousands of protesters gathered on a closed highway. Remarkably, no one was seriously hurt, though a criminal complaint says at least one protester suffered abrasions.Mark Faulk, a longtime Oklahoma activist who was arrested last year for blocking a roadway, said dramatic tactics are necessary to get people's attention.“The idea of escalating it to the point where you disrupt the convenience of the citizens and of the status quo, you have to do that sometimes to make a point," Faulk said.But Carmyn Taylor, 20, recalled the sight of a pickup truck bearing down on protesters spread across the six-lane I-244 in Tulsa.“The most vivid thing I remember is when I got pulled to the ground. I remember seeing both sets of wheels run over my legs, which was a little traumatizing," said Taylor, who suffered a broken leg and a sprained ankle. “For the first two weeks after the accident, I couldn't walk."In Seattle, Summer Taylor, 24, was killed and another person was seriously injured in July when a man drove his car into protestors on a closed Seattle freeway. A graphic video posted on social media showed the car swerving around several parked cars and slamming into the two protesters, sending them flying into the air.In an incident in St. Louis in May, a 29-year-old man was dragged to his death beneath a tractor-trailer that drove into a sign-carrying group on a road.Whether drivers face criminal charges in such incidents depends on the circumstances of each case, prosecutors say. The tractor-trailer driver in St. Louis has not been criminally charged, while the driver of the car in Seattle has pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving.District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler declined to file charges against the driver in Tulsa, saying several people in the crowd had attacked the vehicle with the driver’s children inside. But Kunzweiler stopped short of endorsing proposals for harsher penalties for protestors or blanket immunity for drivers.“There are any number of laws already in place that are readily available to be enforced,” he said.A bill granting drivers immunity for hitting protestors easily cleared an Oklahoma Senate committee recently on a 8-1 vote. Two others are pending in the state House.But critics say the proposals are only designed to intimidate people, not to solve a problem.“The biggest concern is that they chill speech and they chill folks gathering to protest,” said Nicole McAfee, policy director for the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.About 50 people were arrested during several days of protests in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, and rioting, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. At least two men accused of burning a sheriff's van were charged under the state's anti-terrorism law, a felony that carries a sentence of up to life in prison. Those cases are pending.Proposals in Oklahoma would increase the criminal penalties for blocking a roadway, including one making it a felony punishable by up to two years in prison, and making it more difficult for those arrested to be released from jail. Another bill would add participating in unlawful assemblies to the state's racketeering act aimed at organized crime.State Rep. Emily Virgin, the Democratic leader in the Oklahoma House, said she wishes her Republican colleagues would focus on the underlying issues of police brutality and systemic racism instead of seeking ways to punish protesters.“It seems that some of my colleagues took the wrong lesson from the demonstrations we saw this summer,” Virgin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-legislation-would-protect-us-drivers-who-hit-protestors-101613836817684.html

Nearly two dozen deaths have been attributed to the storm and a frigid snap.The action makes federal funding available to individuals across the state, including assistance for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans.Biden is also weighing a trip to Texas to survey the federal response to the first new crisis to develop since he took office a month ago. The White House is working closely with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who did not initially acknowledge Biden's November election win.All the state's power plants had returned to service, although more than 195,000 homes remained without electricity on Friday morning, and residents of 160 of Texas' 254 counties had water service disruptions, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-approves-major-disaster-declaration-for-texas-fema-101613835668647.html

It previously said such manoeuvres were a response to "collusion" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and weapons supplier, and to safeguard Chinese sovereignty.The Pratas Islands sit in the top part of the South China Sea and are also claimed by China.Lying roughly between southern Taiwan and Hong Kong, they are only lightly defended by Taiwan and are considered by some security experts as vulnerable to Chinese attack due to their distance - more than 400 km (250 miles) - from mainland Taiwan.Chinese aircraft fly in the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence zone on an almost daily basis, though the last such large-scale activity was on Jan. 24 when 12 Chinese fighters were involved.Taiwan on Friday unveiled a reshuffle of senior security officials including the appointment of a new, US-trained defence minister, to help bolster military modernisation and intelligence efforts in the face of what it sees as a rising Chinese threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-scrambles-air-force-again-after-chinese-exercises-in-south-china-sea-101613834540643.html

All you need to know||US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) earlier this week announced that it has received enough petitions needed to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa master’s cap for the fiscal year 2021. USCIS said the sending of non-selection notifications to registrants’ online accounts has been completed and the status of those accounts will show “Not Selected: Not selected for this fiscal year.”Since the department of homeland security (DHS) has delayed the implementation of proposed changes to the H-1B registration system and selection process until December 31, 2021, the lottery system will continue to apply for the upcoming season. The delay is supposed to provide more time for the immigration agency to train its staff and give stakeholders time to adjust to the new rule.Meanwhile, USCIS will continue to accept and process petitions that are exempt from the FY 2021 cap, including the foreign workers who have been previously counted against the cap and those who still retain their cap number. The immigration agency will also continue to accept and process the petitions filed to extend the amount of time a current H-1B visa holder may remain in the United States.Read | Indian-American Congressman to remove country quota for work-based Green CardOther petitions that USCIS will continue to accept and process:The H-1B visa allows American companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise, of which the vast majority are from India and China.

Notably, around 45 per cent of Covid-19 vaccine shots have been given to people in the wealthy Group of Seven (G7) countries, which accounts for only 10 per cent of the global population, according to news agency AFP. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly called for equitable access and distribution of vaccines and on Friday, G7 members pledged to share more vaccine doses to middle- and low-income countries.Here’s the list of countries/territories with the most number of Covid-19 vaccine shots administered:United States: Nearly 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the worst-hit nation, the highest in the world. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 78 million vaccine shots have been delivered and at least 42 million people have received on or both doses of the vaccine.China: It is second only to the US in terms of the absolute number of doses administered. As of February 9, China has administered more than 40 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.European Union: The 27-member bloc has administered more than 25 million Covid-19 vaccine shots amid a row over the contract with AstraZeneca. Germany, an EU and G7 member, on Friday announced to donate an additional 1.5 billion euros to boost the rollout of vaccines in the world's poorest countries.United Kingdom: The UK has administered more than 17 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, covering at least 26 per cent of the country’s population.India: After the Covid-19 vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, India has administered more than 10 million vaccine doses.

Another one died later with a bullet wound to the chest."Police were not available for comment.The protests against the coup that overthrew the government of veteran democracy campaigner Suu Kyi have shown no sign of dying down. Demonstrators are sceptical of the army's promise to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.A young woman protester died on Friday after being shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd in the capital, Naypyitaw, the first death among anti-coup demonstrators.The army says one policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest.On Saturday, young people in the main city of Yangon carried a wreath and laid flowers at a memorial ceremony for the woman, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, while a similar ceremony took place in Naypyitaw."The sadness from her death is one thing, but we've also got courage to continue for her sake," said student protester Khin Maw Maw Oo in Naypyitaw.The demonstrators are demanding the restoration of the elected government, the release of Suu Kyi and others and the scrapping of a 2008 constitution, drawn up under military supervision, that gives the army a major role in politics.The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept, detaining her and others. The electoral commission had dismissed the fraud complaints.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-killed-in-myanmar-city-of-mandalay-in-another-day-of-protests-101613823677943.html

A lunar day and night each equal 14 days on Earth,” the report said.The rover is in good condition, and all scientific payloads are working normally, it said.The Chang'e-4 probe, launched on December 8, 2018, made the first-ever soft landing on the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon on January 3, 2019.The rover Yutu-2 has far exceeded its three-month design lifespan, becoming the longest-working lunar rover on the moon, the report said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lander-and-rover-of-china-s-lunar-probe-switched-to-dormant-mode-report-101613821221802.html

Senior civil servants will also be based in Wolverhampton, ensuring this becomes a centre for policy development and decision making, MHCLG said.“As Communities Secretary, I am determined to spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of our nation. That is why I am delighted to be taking the historic step of moving significant numbers of senior roles out of Whitehall and creating the first ever ministerial office outside of Westminster in Wolverhampton – increasing the jobs in the Midlands to over 500,” said Robert Jenrick, the minister in charge at MHCLG.“With a dual headquarters in Wolverhampton my department will not only change where we work but how we work, signalling the end of the Whitehall knows best approach. All of us at the department are looking forward to having the opportunity to work there,” he said.The minister said the aim was to have more local voices at the heart of policy development and delivery, supporting communities more effectively, and to develop greater career options in government outside of London.“In choosing the city of Wolverhampton we are also backing our great smaller cities, some of which have been neglected for too long. We want to raise their stature, encourage civic pride and commercial success,” added Jenrick.This move, part of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s manifesto commitment to "level up" different parts of the country, signals a culture change in civil service. It marks a significant increase on the 300 roles currently in the region and is part of plans to have at least 800 roles outside of London by 2030 – including 50 per cent of the most senior positions.These moves will help provide an economic boost to these areas, bring a greater variety of voices and experiences into the civil service and provide improved career paths outside of Whitehall, MHCLG said.Recruitment is already underway, with 40 roles already relocated to the region in the last 12 months.MHCLG said it will be working in partnership with other government departments to improve collaborative working and develop greater career options outside London to retain talented civil servants based outside of London.The new building for the headquarters is expected to be unveiled in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ministry-confirms-second-hq-outside-london-in-historic-move-101613819273419.html

He refused to be admitted so was given antibiotics and went home.He returned that evening in worse shape and was put on oxygen. Two days later, Mattia's wife told doctors that a few weeks earlier he had gone to dinner with a colleague who had been in China.But Mattia did not fit national criteria for mandatory coronavirus testing because he had not been in China personally."I had to explain many times why I wanted to perform it (a Covid swab) anyway," said Malara, 39."Doctor Malara and myself decided to break protocol," Ricevuti recalled. They performed the nasal swab and sent it to a lab in Milan.At 9:30 p.m. the phone rang. The test was positive."We couldn't believe it. We thought this was a far away problem that had to do with China, but it was already here with us, and not just from that February 20th but probably from much earlier," Ricevuti, 44, said.In the days that followed, Codogno, a town of 15,000 residents, became the "capital" of the first "red zone" in Europe to be locked down."In the beginning I hoped - we all hoped - that the virus would be limited to a few people," said Malara. "But after a few hours a lot of people came to the emergency room with the same symptoms and after a few days it was clear that it had spread into the population."Since then 95,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Italy, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world.Both women are still treating Covid-19 patients."This is our mission. We cannot really retreat," Ricevuti said. "Day-by-day we go forward, facing the difficulties and the changes that life presents us ... you need a lot of physical and mental strength."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-doctors-remember-night-that-ushered-in-europe-s-first-covid-19-lockdown-101613813799006.html

It was the first G7 meeting that included Suga, US President Joe Biden and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.On the coronavirus pandemic, Suga said he has had an unwavering resolve to protect the lives and livelihoods of the people since assuming his post in September.He said much has been learned from last year, and that he has implemented what he believes to be the best measures.Suga said vaccines will be the key to containing infections, adding that fair access in developing countries will be essential.He called on the G7 to speed up the distribution of vaccines and oppose a protectionist approach to health issues.He also pledged to increase Japan's contribution to a global framework for purchasing vaccines to 200 million dollars, reported NHK World.Suga also expressed his determination to hold the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer. He said he will work with the International Olympic Committee to realize a safe Game. He called on the other countries for support.Suga said the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics can serve as proof that mankind has overcome the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suga-expresses-concern-over-china-s-dominance-in-east-and-south-china-sea-at-g7-101613816195450.html

Iran insists that the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump’s sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.The White House said on Friday that the United States plans to take no additional actions in response to pressure from Iran before potential talks with Tehran and major powers about returning to the deal.However, government spokesman Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Saturday: “We predict with confidence that diplomatic initiatives will result in a favourable outcome despite the diplomatic wrangling, which are a natural prelude to the return of the parties to their commitments, including the lifting of all sanctions in the near future.”Under the deal with major powers, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal in 2018, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal’s nuclear limits.Adding to pressure for a resolution to the impasse, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 23 to limit the sweeping access given to UN inspectors under the deal.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, is due in Tehran this weekend to discuss ways to work with Iran in light of the possibility of scaling back cooperation.Rabiei said the law “does not go against our commitment” to the agreement, nor is it “an obstacle to our appropriate response to American actions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tehran-confident-about-lifting-of-us-sanctions-despite-wrangling-iran-spokesman-101613815946478.html
20-02-2021||World||Russian court rejects Kremlin critic Navalny's appeal against jail term||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny lost his appeal on Saturday against what he said was a politically-motivated decision to jail him for nearly three years, but had his prison term slightly shortened.Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed earlier this month for parole violations that he said were trumped up. Western countries have condemned the case and are discussing possible sanctions on Russia.A Moscow court swiftly rejected his appeal, while shortening his original jail term by six weeks. The original term was 3.5 years.But, with the amount of time he had already spent under house arrest taken into account, it amounted to around two years and eight months. His lawyer said on Saturday he would now spend a little over 2.5 years behind bars.Navalny responded sarcastically to the ruling. "They've reduced the sentence by 1.5 months. Great!" he said from a courtroom glass cage.The opposition politician had earlier told the judge he was not guilty of parole violations as a previous court had found. Navalny returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia in August with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent.He said he had been unable to report to the Moscow prison service last year because he had been convalescing in Germany at the time."I don't want to show off a lot, but the whole world knew where I was," Navalny told the judge. "Once I'd recovered, I bought a plane ticket and came home."Navalny said he had no regrets about returning to Russia, that his belief in God helped sustain him, and that "strength was in truth.""Our country is built on injustice. But tens of millions of people want the truth. And sooner or later they'll get it."SLANDER CASENavalny is due to appear in court again later on Saturday for what is expected to be the culmination of a separate slander trial against him.In the slander case, Navalny is accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.Navalny described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys. But he has said his comments were not specifically directed against the veteran, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation.State prosecutors have asked the court to fine Navalny 950,000 roubles ($12,800) for slander.Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies say they have now paused major demonstrations until the spring.Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-rejects-kremlin-critic-navalny-s-appeal-against-jail-term-101613815032101.html
20-02-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup protesters honour woman shot dead by police||Anti-coup protesters in Myanmar's two largest cities on Saturday paid tribute to the young woman who died a day earlier after being shot by police during a rally against the military takeover.An impromptu memorial created under an elevated roadway in Yangon attracted around 1,000 protesters. A wreath of bright yellow flowers was hung beneath a photograph of Mya Thwet Thwet Khine, who was shot in the capital Naypyitaw on Feb. 9, two days before her 20th birthday.Her death on Friday, announced by her family, was the first confirmed fatality among thousands of protesters who have faced off against security forces since the military took power on Feb 1.Protesters at the memorial chanted and held up signs that read “End the dictatorship in Myanmar" and “You will be remembered Mya Thwet Thwet Khine.” The supporters also laid roses and rose petals on images of the woman.Video from the day she was shot show her sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated the motorcycle helmet she was wearing. She had been on life support in a hospital for more than a week with what doctors said was no chance of recovery.US State Department spokesman Ned Price offered his government's condolences Friday and reiterated calls on the military to refrain from violence against peaceful protestors.In Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, a protest led by medical university students drew more than 1,000 people, many of whom also carried flowers and images of Mya Thwet Thwet Khine.Others held signs saying “CDM,” referring to the nationwide civil disobedience movement that has encouraged doctors, engineers and others to protest the coup by refusing to work.Across the country protests showed no signs of slowing down on Saturday despite recent crackdowns by the military government — including a sixth consecutive night in which the internet was cut for many hours.Demonstrators also gathered elsewhere in Yangon, chanting and holding placards and images of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose democratically elected government was overthrown.Aerial images taken Friday showed streets in Yangon painted with the words “The military dictatorship must fall” in Burmese, and “We want democracy” and “Free our leaders" in English.Security forces have been relatively restrained so far in confronting protesters in Yangon, but appeared to be toughening their stance in areas where there is less media presence.Police used force for a second day Friday to arrest protesters in Myitkyina, the capital of the remote northern state of Kachin. The Kachin ethnic minority has long been in conflict with the central government, and there has been intermittent armed struggle against the army there for decades.The junta seized power after detaining Suu Kyi and preventing Parliament from convening, saying elections in November were tainted by voting irregularities. The election outcome, in which Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year's time.The US, British and Canadian governments have imposed sanctions on the new military leaders, and they and other nations have called for Suu Kyi's administration to be restored.The coup was a major setback to Myanmar's transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule. Suu Kyi came to power after her National League for Democracy party won a 2015 election, but the generals retained substantial power under the constitution, which was adopted under a military regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-protesters-honour-woman-shot-dead-by-police-101613810976844.html
20-02-2021||World||Ted Cruz's trip tests memory of voters if he runs for White House again in 2024||Ted Cruz's political career already featured many surprise twists before a jaunt to Mexico this week brought him a new level of notoriety.The Texas senator was once the biggest threat to Donald Trump capturing the 2016 presidential nomination. During a particularly bitter stretch of that year's Republican primary, Cruz called Trump a “coward” and “pathological liar.” By last month, however, Cruz was one of Trump's staunchest allies and a leader in the former president's baseless attempt to overturn the November election.Such shifts are intended to keep Cruz in a strong position with the GOP base if he runs for the White House again in 2024. But they've also turned him into one of Washington's most villainized figures, someone willing to take any politically convenient position if it keeps his future ambitions alive.Cruz is under further attack for traveling to Cancun while his constituents suffered through a deadly winter storm that left hundreds of thousands without power and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned.The optics of the trip are hardly ideal. But the question is whether, three years before he faces voters again, the political fallout will last.“Ted Cruz is feeling the first post-Trump controversy,” said New Hampshire-based Republican strategist Mike Biundo. “I don’t think anybody knows exactly what will happen in this new reality that we’re living in.”Before Trump got to Washington, scandals, lies and sometimes even simple but major gaffes wrecked political careers.Despite later winning a congressional seat, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford will forever be remembered for fabricating a trek along the Appalachian Trail, just as former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner was undone by repeated sexting scandals and ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry couldn’t live down the debate stage moment of forgetting the third of three federal agencies he’d promised to eliminate.Once Trump was in the White House, his outlandish antics attracted so much attention that something that simply looked bad, like a senator's leaving on vacation while his state was suffering, wouldn't receive much notice.Cruz is now navigating how much damage control is needed in a post-Trump political landscape.He rushed home on Thursday and told reporters the trip was “obviously a mistake.” But he made no public appearances on Friday, and his office didn't answer questions about his schedule or what he was doing to help Texans cope with the storm. His office simply released a statement backing Gov. Greg Abbott's request for federal assistance.Still, Cruz is still the best-known leader in the country's largest red state, with a far higher national profile than Abbott, who has also been mentioned as a possible 2024 presidential contender, and Sen. John Cornyn, who coasted to reelection last year by a more comfortable margin than Cruz, who narrowly edged Democrat Beto O'Rourke in 2018.Alice Stewart, a GOP strategist and veteran of Cruz’s presidential campaign, noted that the senator has years before he'll have to run for reelection or president or both in 2024. That's a lot of time to put the Cancun trip "in the rearview mirror,” even if Cruz's political opponents will continue to trumpet it.“People have come to tolerate a lot more during and after the era of Trump," said Stewart, who noted that while social media often intensifies political scandals, it also tends to shorten their lifespans.Rick Tyler also worked for Cruz's 2016 campaign but has frequently criticized the senator for kowtowing to Trump since then. He said that “when Texas was down and out and embarrassed, frankly," Cruz's trip to the beach was unforgivable: "There's no way this is going to be forgotten.”“Cruz is very beatable,” Tyler said of the senator's reelection prospects, especially if he tries again for the White House the same year. “He's got to decide. By doing one or the other, you risk losing both.”Of course, Cruz has effectively used being one of Washington's most detested figures to his advantage in the past. He came to Congress as a conservative insurgent who infuriated both parties — even prompting fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to once joke that no senator would convict one of their own for murdering Cruz in the chamber.In 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses and proved to have a solid national base of support, setting up a tense primary fight that would last for months. At one point, Trump attacked the looks of Cruz's wife and baselessly suggested that his father had a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Cruz lashed out at Trump in response and was later booed off the stage at that year's Republican National Convention for failing to endorse the New Yorker.But in the four years since, Cruz transformed into one of Trump's biggest champions in Congress.Among those close to Cruz, there is a sense that the senator hurt himself politically this week but that he remains well positioned for another White House bid should he opt to run again. His team believes Cruz is the most popular prospective 2024 candidate not named Trump among likely Republican primary voters.Cruz was a fundraising force for his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate leading up to November's election. And his own fundraising has surged in the months since — including after he stood against the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in early January. His small-dollar donor base, in particular, which was large to begin with, has grown dramatically, aides say.Even amid calls for Cruz to resign for his role in helping encourage Trump supporters who staged a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Republicans in San Antonio organized a rally celebrating him as “courageous.”Cruz is also planning to attend next week's influential Conservative Political Action Conference, where he can further ingratiate himself with the GOP's most fervent activists, who aren't likely to hold Cancun against him.Cruz allies note that the second-place finisher in the previous Republican primary often becomes the nominee in the next election. But moving forward, there is a sense internally that Cruz’s political strength is directly linked to his relationship with Trump, whose feelings are difficult to gauge.Regina Thomson, a former Cruz loyalist who fought Trump’s nomination at the 2016 GOP convention, has since warmed to Trump. She said that Cruz's Cancun trip didn't bother her, but that ultimately, she and other conservative activists would likely follow Trump’s lead.“If you would ask a lot of (Cruz’s former) grassroots supporters today, they’d say Trump did such a good job they’d like him to run again," Thomson said. “And if Trump doesn’t run, I think a lot of people will look to him to see who he’s supporting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ted-cruz-s-trip-tests-memory-of-voters-if-he-runs-for-white-house-again-in-2024-101613812317619.html

20-02-2021||World||Florida is a model for voting. The GOP wants change anyway||Florida was a model citizen when it came to elections in 2020. The state showed off its years of voting reforms. Even as Donald Trump railed against voting systems elsewhere, he praised Florida and urged his supporters to trust its vote-by-mail system. And, indeed, results were reported quickly and accurately. Turnout soared.It was all overseen by GOP officials. And Trump won, continuing Republicans' growing dominance in the state.Yet three months later, Florida Republicans have set out to overhaul the state's voting system anyway. GOP Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday proposed an array of voting changes, while state lawmakers have introduced legislation that makes it harder to vote by mail. To explain the efforts, Florida Republicans point not to evidence of problems but to the potential for voter fraud and suspicion about the process.“We want everyone to vote, but we don't want anyone to cheat," DeSantis said Friday.Florida Republicans' push to change voting laws shows how deep false claims about mass voter fraud spread by Trump have burrowed into Republicans' belief system. The party is now stampeding to solve a problem that most nonpartisan experts and courts say does not exist. Their efforts are threatening to dismantle years of bipartisan moves to boost voting in several states, including places where the GOP has thrived under the current system.And it would result in making it more difficult to vote.“We cannot comprehend where they're coming from,” said Anjenys Gonzalez-Eilert of Florida Common Cause, noting the GOP has long been a supporter and beneficiary of mail voting in the state.Similar efforts are being repeated across the country. State Republican lawmakers in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania have introduced voting bills, many aimed at curbing mail voting.The legislation reflects Republicans' widespread belief that new rules making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic largely benefited Democrats and caused “irregularities.” Although there were no signs of widespread irregularities, they often point to vote totals tilted in Democrat Joe Biden's favor as mail ballots were counted days after Election Day — a pattern that was new to many states but not a sign of fraud.But that was not an issue in Florida. It has long allowed its election offices to start the laborious process of preparing mail ballots for counting — removing them from their envelopes and verifying voters' signatures well before Election Day. While ballot counts in many states new to mail voting dragged on for days, Florida's count was quick and efficient.There was no evidence of fraud in Florida. Of the roughly 50 legal cases Trump and his allies brought challenging the election, none were filed in Florida. (Even in those states where Trump claimed there was fraud and tried to overturn the election, dozens of courts rejected his legal claims and no significant cases were proved.)Florida officials take pride in their recent record. Ever since the drama of the 2000 presidential election recount — when “hanging chads” turned the state into a national joke — the state has worked to shed its image as the exemplar for elections gone wrong.Election officers have worked to shore up trust in the state's election system — by changing how ballots are designed, modernizing vote-counting equipment and investing millions of dollars to protect against cyberthreats.Even DeSantis took credit for November's performance.“We did it right," he said Friday before supporters in West Palm Beach.Still, he argued for tightening voting laws. His proposal includes restricting the use of drop boxes where voters can deposit mail ballots and preventing other people from dropping off voters' ballots, a practice many label “ballot harvesting.”DeSantis also seemed to endorse the Republican bill that would make mail balloting harder by requiring voters to request a mail ballot every year, rather than allow them to make one request that stands for two years' worth of elections.The proposal is notable because for years Republicans dominated vote by mail in Florida, and it was embraced by the state's many older voters. It helped the GOP cement a durable statehouse majority and narrowly win state-wide races.But the Republicans in Florida lost that edge last year. Trump railed against mail voting, and GOP voters' trust in the system sank, according to polls.In Florida, his complaints alarmed state Republicans, and Trump sent out tweets stating that in Florida, where he voted by mail, the system was “Safe and Secure, Tried and True.”In the end, Democrats in the state outvoted Republicans by mail for the first time in years as a record 4.9 million Floridians voted by mail. Democrats cast 680,000 more mail ballots than Republicans did.The new bill would essentially wipe those new Democratic voters from the rolls ahead of 2022, when DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio lead the list of incumbent Republicans up for re-election."Republicans used to have the advantage, and now it's the Democrats who have the advantage. So now it's time to make a change," said campaign strategist Mac Stipanovich, a former Republican.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-is-a-model-for-voting-the-gop-wants-change-anyway-101613804368698.html
20-02-2021||World||France sends amphibious assault warships to South China Sea, expresses interest towards supporting Quad||Stepping up its presence in the South China Sea, France has planned two voyages through the disputed waters.According to South China Morning Post, the French Navy said an amphibious assault ship the Tonnere and the frigate Surcouf had left their home port Toulon on Thursday and would travel to the Pacific on a three-month mission.The website Naval News reported that the ships would cross the South China Sea twice and take part in a combined exercise with the Japanese and US militaries in May.Capt Arnaud Tranchant, commanding officer of the Tonnerre, told Naval News that the French navy would "work to strengthen" France's partnership with the US, Japan, India and Australia - Quad.When asked whether he was planning to transit the Taiwan Strait, he said he has "not yet traced our roads in this area".Similar missions in 2015 and 2017 also saw French navy vessels sailing through the South China Sea, but analysts said the latest exercise is a sign of France stepping up engagement in the Indo Pacific region.Last week, France deployed a nuclear attack submarine in the South China Sea, in line with US President Joe Biden's call to mount a multilateral challenge to China.In a tweet earlier this week, France's Defense Minister Florence Parly announced that the European power has deployed the nuclear attack submarine Emeraude along with naval support ship Seine to the maritime area to "affirm that international law is the only rule that is valid, whatever the sea where we sail."Other European powers such as the United Kingdom and Germany are also expected to deploy warships to the area in what increasingly looks like a concerted Western pushback against China's maritime ambitions.European powers' growing involvement in regional geopolitics is consistent with the strategic priorities of the Biden administration, which has underscored its commitment to "working with our allies and partners" based "on the international rules of the road".China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.

20-02-2021||World||Texas reels from power outage: Impact in pics||Texas witnessed a severely hard week this month as a winter storm froze the power grid of the US state leaving millions in the dark and as many as 40 people died due to the freezing cold. Since the winter storm and dropping temperature froze power grids, almost 40 per cent of the generators went offline and as the people started turning up the thermostats for heat demanding more energy, power companies had to implement rolling blackouts that wreaked havoc.Also Read | Extreme weather testing Biden's disaster management skillsThe power outage left the people of the state shivering in cold without heat or water. The southern central state of the United States is the only state with its own independent power grid.Around 7,000 local water utilities were offline or unable to supply drinking water as of Friday afternoon, reported Bloomberg. As water pipes burst in the winter storm, people were left without drinking water or heat prompting emergency officials to airlift bottled water to areas where supply was disrupted. People queued up early in the morning to receive water and Houston converted a football stadium being used as Covid-19 vaccination centre as a water supply distribution centre.As power outage affected 14.4 million people across the state, many restaurants in the state were forced to throw food with shorter shelf life. Supermarkets across the state also went out of food and bottled water.While many people inspected the leakage in the water pipes that happened due to the extreme weather conditions, many others volunteered in supplying bottles of water and food to affected areas as the energy supply began restoring.Companies like Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have begun restoring the power supply, however, it is not yet clear how much time it will take for gas and oil supply to be back. A crucial part of the natural gas system, the compressor stations that keep the gas flowing through the pipeline, was disrupted due to the power outage. The fuel makes half the state's power source. Ironically, Texas is America's biggest gas producer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-reels-from-power-outage-impact-in-pics-101613798273329.html
20-02-2021||World||UK urges UN resolution for pause in conflicts for Covid-19 jabs||Britain circulated a draft resolution to the UN Security Council on Friday demanding that all warring parties immediately institute a “sustained humanitarian pause” to enable people in conflict areas to be vaccinated for Covid-19.The proposed resolution reiterates the council's demand last July 1 for “a general and immediate cessation of hostilities” in major conflicts from Syria and Yemen to Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan and Somalia.The appeal was first made by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on March 23, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.The draft “emphasizes the need for solidarity, equity, and efficacy and invites donation of vaccine doses from developed economies to low- and middle-income countries and other countries in need, including through the COVAX Facility,” an ambitious World Health Organisation project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world's poorest people.The British draft stresses that “equitable access to affordable Covid-19 vaccines, certified as safe and efficacious, is essential to end the pandemic.”It would recognise “the role of extensive immunisation against Covid-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing, and stopping transmission, in order to bring the pandemic to an end.”The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, follows up on British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's appeal to the 15-member Security Council on Wednesday to adopt a resolution calling for local cease-fires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines.Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability.“Cease-fires have been used to vaccinate the most vulnerable communities in the past,” Raab said.“There's no reason why we can't... We have seen it in the past to deliver polio vaccines to children in Afghanistan, just to take one example.”At Wednesday's council meeting, Guterres sharply criticized the “wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, saying 10 countries have administered 75 per cent of all vaccinations and demanding a global effort to get all people in every nation vaccinated as soon as possible.The UN chief told the high-level council meeting that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.”The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. As manufacturers struggle to ramp up production of vaccines, many countries complain of being left out and even rich nations are facing shortages and domestic complaints.Guterres' appeal for cease-fires last March to deliver Covid-19 medical items received some initial support, but the cease-fires were almost always short-lived.While speed of developing vaccines has been impressive, COVAX has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries late last year.WHO says COVAX needs USD 5 billion in 2021.The draft resolution calls for the Covid-19 vaccination plans of countries to include “those at a higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 symptoms and the most vulnerable, including frontline workers, older people, refugees, internally displaced people, stateless people, migrants, persons with disabilities, among others, as well as people living in areas under the control of any non-state armed group.”The proposed measure calls for increased scientific collaboration on new variants of Covid-19.It asks Guterres to report at least every 90 days on all impediments to the Covid-19 response, including vaccination programs, in countries where conflicts and humanitarian emergencies are occurring.It's not clear whether the resolution will be adopted.Britain's UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, said Wednesday that humanitarian organsations and UN agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out their job.Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, objected to the council focusing on equitable access to vaccines, saying this went beyond its mandate to preserve international peace and security.He indicated Moscow was not interested in a new resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-un-resolution-for-pause-in-conflicts-for-covid-19-jabs-101613810641232.html
20-02-2021||World||US Air Force orders new review into racial, ethnic disparities||The Air Force inspector general will do a second investigation into racial and ethnic disparities across the force, service leaders said Friday, expanding the review to include gender and additional racial categories such as Asian and American Indian.The latest review comes just two months after the IG released a report concluding that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct. The December report found that “racial disparity exists” for Black service members but that the data did not explain why it happens.The new study also reflects broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism. President Joe Biden declared domestic extremism an urgent national security threat in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The crowd that breached the building as lawmakers were preparing to certify the election was overwhelmingly white and included members of far-right groups.Acting Air Force Secretary John Roth, who ordered the latest review, said the IG will go directly to Air Force and Space Force service members for input. A survey that will go out to the force soon will look at several different categories: Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino and gender.“The IG team has already begun to gather information contained in a wide array of previous reports, studies and various databases across the Department of the Air Force,” Roth said. “Although the data is helpful, the most important information will come directly from our Airmen and Guardians.” Guardians are members of the Space Force.The Pentagon is also grappling with a wider effort to expand diversity within the ranks, and a campaign to tackle racism and extremism. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, earlier this month, ordered military leaders to spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks, after a number of former and current military members took part in the US Capitol assault.Austin said units must take a day during February or March for the so-called “stand down.”In addition, the Defense Department late last year endorsed a new slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force. And it called for a plan to crack down on participation in hate groups by service members and draft proposed changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The report by the Air Force inspector general that was released in December said Black members of the Air Force and Space Force are less likely to be promoted to higher enlisted and officer ranks, and one-third of them believe they don't get the same opportunities as their white peers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-force-orders-new-review-into-racial-ethnic-disparities-101613809836158.html
20-02-2021||World||Extreme weather testing Biden's disaster management skills||Add Mother Nature to the pile of crises on President Joe Biden's plate.A month into the job and focused on the coronavirus, Biden is seeing his disaster management skills tested after winter storms plunged Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states into an unusual deep freeze that left millions shivering in homes that lost heat and power, and in many homes, water.At least 59 deaths across the US have been blamed on the blast of unseasonable weather.Biden came into office January 20 promising to tackle a series of brewing crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic and its ripple effects on the economy. He tacked on systemic racism and climate change as top priorities. And now he's contending with storms that have not only imperilled Americans but also delayed the shipment and administration of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines.Biden said Friday that he hopes to travel to Texas next week but doesn't want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.“They're working like the devil to take care of their folks,” Biden said of Texas officials. He said he'd make a decision early next week about travel.Biden, who offered himself during the campaign as the experienced and empathetic candidate the nation needed at this moment in time, is working on several fronts to address the situation — and to avoid repeating the mistakes of predecessors who got tripped up by inadequate or insensitive responses in times of disaster.Part of the job of being president is responding to the destruction left behind by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters, or events like deadly mass shootings, or even acts of terrorism.Some have handled such situations better than others.George W. Bush earned praised for his leadership after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but stumbled during his administration’s halting response to the humanitarian disaster that unfolded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast four years later.Barack Obama said he should have anticipated the blowback he got for going to the golf course right after he condemned the beheading of a kidnapped American journalist by Islamist militants in 2014. Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard at the time.Donald Trump was criticized for tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people in Puerto Rico who had endured Hurricane Maria’s pummelling of the island in 2017. He defended tossing the towels, saying the people were “having fun.”Bill Clinton, who famously claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign that “I feel your pain,” was a natural at connecting with disaster victims.Just this week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas showed how quickly one bad move during a crisis can become a public relations disaster for a politician.Cruz came under attack for traveling to Mexico while his constituents suffered without power, heat and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake.Biden has tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, while the White House has issued numerous statements aimed at demonstrating that the federal government is in command of the situation.The president is getting regular updates from his staff and has declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. He said Friday that he will soon declare a major disaster in the state of Texas and that he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.Biden has spoken to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's, was quick to praise Biden for swift action on a disaster declaration.After speaking with Biden by telephone earlier this week, Stitt specifically thanked the president for “taking the time to reach out this afternoon and offer the federal government’s help for Oklahomans. We had a very productive call and I look forward to working together to find solutions as we recover from this historic storm.”Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Biden is “well-suited" to deal with the disaster because of his decades of service in the U.S. Senate and as a former vice president and because of “his genuine concern for people.”“He's got to show empathy right off the bat,” Perry said in an interview. “It's important for a president to go to a place that’s been battered, but be careful about the footprint. He doesn’t want to make things worse.”Biden, should he decide to visit Texas next week, could also use the trip to press his point that climate change is real and must not go unaddressed, and that the state could do things like winterize its power plants to be better prepared for future storms, Perry said.But he should take care to not do so in a scolding kind of way.“We know he cares about climate change, and this is a way to convince people,” Perry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-weather-testing-biden-s-disaster-management-skills-101613803379996.html
20-02-2021||World||Kremlin critic Navalny back in court for jail appeal, possible fine||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny returned to court on Saturday to hear his lawyers appeal against what they say was a politically-motivated decision to jail him for nearly three years.Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed earlier this month for parole violations he said were trumped up. The West has condemned the case and is discussing possible sanctions on Russia.As proceedings got underway, a relaxed-looking Navalny said he had heard about a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights asking Russia to free him, a request that Moscow swiftly dismissed as unlawful.Speaking from a glass courtroom cage, wearing green trousers and a patterned shirt, Navalny told the presiding judge it would be good if the court would now let him go.Later on Saturday, he is due to appear in court again for what is expected to be the culmination of a separate slander trial against him.In the slander case, Navalny stands accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.Navalny, who returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a military-grade nerve toxin in Siberia, described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys.He has said his comment was not specifically directed against the veteran however, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation.State prosecutors have asked the court to fine Navalny 950,000 roubles ($12,800) for slander.Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies say they have now paused serious demonstrations until the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-navalny-back-in-court-for-jail-appeal-possible-fine-101613809032606.html

Mass vaccination was launched in December, after preliminary trial results showed the vaccine to be 91.4% effective.Since then, more than two million Russians have been vaccinated with at least the first dose of Sputnik V, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Feb. 10.Rollout of a second vaccine, developed by the Vector Institute in Novosibirsk, is beginning.Also read| Joe Biden believes US will approach normalcy defeating Covid-19 by year end"Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines against Covid-19," Prime Minister Mishustin said.The Chumakov Centre, founded in 1955 in St Petersburg by Mikhail Chumakov, is known for its work with U.S. scientist Albert Sabin at the height of the Cold War, which led to the production of the widely-used polio vaccine.Unlike the Sputnik V vaccine, which uses a modified harmless cold virus that tricks the body into producing antigens to help the immune system prepare for a coronavirus infection, the CoviVac vaccine is a "whole-virion" vaccine.This means it is made of a coronavirus that has been inactivated, or stripped of its ability to replicate."The vaccine we have developed... reflects the whole history of Russian, as well as global, vaccine science," the Chumakov Centre's director, Aidar Ishmukhametov, said on Saturday.The CoviVac shot is given in two doses, 14 days apart. It is transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 Fahrenheit), Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said in a government briefing in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-approves-its-third-covid-19-vaccine-says-pm-mishustin-101613806033010.html

20-02-2021||World||Indian-origin man sentenced for fraudulently selling workout supplements in US||A 37-year-old Indian-origin former executive has been sentenced to 41 months in prison in the US for his role in fraudulently selling popular workout supplements by concealing their true ingredients.Sitesh Patel, the former vice-president of S K Laboratories, was sentenced on Friday by a federal court in Texas, announced Acting US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Prerak Shah and Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.According to documents filed in the case, Patel of Irvine, California, played a key role in developing and manufacturing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by Dallas-based USPlabs.In pleading guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, Patel and several of his co-defendants admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labelling to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention.US District Judge Sam A Lindsay sentenced Patel to 41 months’ imprisonment and one year of supervised release. The court previously ordered Patel’s former company, S K Laboratories, to forfeit USD 6 million in connection with the case.Patel also pleaded guilty to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, the US Justice Department said in a statement.The misbranding charges relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers.An indictment returned by a Dallas federal grand jury in 2015 against Patel and four other individuals associated with USPlabs alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.“Dietary supplement manufacturers must not be allowed to mislead the public about untested ingredients mixed into their products,” said Acting US Attorney Prerak Shah.“We are proud to hold this defendant accountable for lying to the public about ingredients that had the potential to cause them harm," Shah said.“The defendant knowingly profited by deceiving American consumers, causing harm to them by concealing the true ingredients of a product intended to improve the very health it damaged,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Pearson of the IRS-Criminal Investigation, Dallas Field Office.The court previously sentenced Jacobo Geissler, 44, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of USPlabs, to 60 months’ imprisonment, and Jonathan Doyle, 41, of Dallas, the president of USPlabs, to 24 months’ imprisonment for their roles in the fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-man-sentenced-for-fraudulently-selling-workout-supplements-in-us-101613805650044.html
20-02-2021||World||Joe Biden believes US will approach normalcy defeating Covid-19 by year end||President Joe Biden has said that he believes the US will be approaching normalcy by the end of this year as the country races to deliver coronavirus vaccines to millions of Americans.Biden on Friday toured a manufacturing facility of Pfizer in Kalamazoo, Michigan, seeking to highlight efforts to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine as his administration looks for ways to increase supply and streamline distribution.“I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than the last,” Biden said responding to a question at the site in Michigan.At the same time, he refused to make any commitment.“I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don’t know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done,” he said.Biden said that getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone's arms. This is going to be a continuous rolling effort.Also read| Extreme weather testing Joe Biden's disaster management skills“We will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July. July 29th is the expected date. That could change. Look at what's happening with the weather now, for example: It's slowing up the distribution right now,” he said.Severe winter weather has gripped much of the US this week and delayed the distribution of 6 million vaccine doses, the White House said on Friday."I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later," he said. This administration is going to be guided by science to save lives and to make lives better, he said.Biden said parenthetically it's not enough that we find cures for Americans. There needs to be a cure that the world is able to take part of, because you can't build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out.“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor -- as my mother would say, "God love him" -- failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilise the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office,” he said.Also read| US' re-entry into Paris Climate Agreement a 'day of hope', says UN chiefBiden touted that the country’s vaccination rate has increased to about 1.7 million shots a day, well above the pace for the president’s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.Biden had said that in "the first 100 days,” before I was inaugurated, "that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days.”At the Pfizer factory in Michigan, where he met with lab workers and learned about the process behind creating one of the two Covid-19 vaccines that is being widely used across the country to inoculate Americans, the Hill reported.The US, which is the worst affected country from the pandemic, has reported 28,004,311 cases and over 495,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-believes-us-will-approach-normalcy-defeating-covid-19-by-year-end-101613802944535.html

He said no casualties had been reported.People posted photos on social media of residents wading through shoulder-high muddy waters, cars almost entirely submerged, and search teams evacuating elderly residents in rubber dinghies in the peak of the monsoon season."Two hundred neighbourhoods have been affected, according to the latest data," Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told local television early on Saturday, adding that more than two dozen evacuation centres have been prepared across the city."The rain has stopped, but water from other areas is still affecting Jakarta. Hopefully it won’t hit the city centre and when the water recedes people can resume their activities."The floods come at a time when Indonesia is already grappling with the highest caseload and death tally from COVID-19 in Southeast Asia and an economic recession.Indonesia’s meteorology agency (BMKG) has warned the heaviest rain of the season may fall in and around the densely populated capital in the coming days, with extreme weather, including heavy rain, thunder and strong winds, expected throughout next week."These are critical times that we need to be aware of," said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of BMKG."Jakarta and its surrounding areas are still in the peak period of the rainy season, which is estimated to continue until the end of February or early March."The BMKG said Jakarta would be on alert for the next four days with data from the meteorology agency showing intense rainfall in the past 24 hours with the area of Pasar Minggu, in Jakarta’s south, recording 226 millimeters of rain since Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jakarta-faces-severe-monsoon-floods-more-than-1-000-forced-to-evacuate-101613802581277.html
20-02-2021||World||Extreme weather testing Joe Biden's disaster management skills||Add Mother Nature to the pile of crises on President Joe Biden's plate.A month into the job and focused on the coronavirus, Biden is seeing his disaster management skills tested after winter storms plunged Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states into an unusual deep freeze that left millions shivering in homes that lost heat and power, and in many homes, water.At least 59 deaths across the US have been blamed on the blast of unseasonable weather.Biden came into office January 20 promising to tackle a series of brewing crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic and its ripple effects on the economy. He tacked on systemic racism and climate change as top priorities. And now he's contending with storms that have not only imperiled Americans but also delayed the shipment and administration of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines.Biden said Friday that he hopes to travel to Texas next week but doesn't want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.“They're working like the devil to take care of their folks,” Biden said of Texas officials. He said he'd make a decision early next week about travel.Biden, who offered himself during the campaign as the experienced and empathetic candidate the nation needed at this moment in time, is working on several fronts to address the situation — and to avoid repeating the mistakes of predecessors who got tripped up by inadequate or insensitive responses in times of disaster.Part of the job of being president is responding to the destruction left behind by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters, or events like deadly mass shootings, or even acts of terrorism.Some have handled such situations better than others.George W. Bush earned praised for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but stumbled during his administration’s halting response to the humanitarian disaster that unfolded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast four years later.Barack Obama said he should have anticipated the blowback he got for going to the golf course right after he condemned the beheading of a kidnapped American journalist by Islamist militants in 2014. Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard at the time.Donald Trump was criticized for tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people in Puerto Rico who had endured Hurricane Maria’s pummeling of the island in 2017. He defended tossing the towels, saying the people were “having fun.”Bill Clinton, who famously claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign that “I feel your pain,” was a natural at connecting with disaster victims.Just this week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas showed how quickly one bad move during a crisis can become a public relations disaster for a politician.Cruz came under attack for traveling to Mexico while his constituents suffered without power, heat and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake.Biden has tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, while the White House has issued numerous statements aimed at demonstrating that the federal government is in command of the situation.The president is getting regular updates from his staff and has declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. He said Friday that he will soon declare a major disaster in the state of Texas and that he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.Biden has spoken to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's, was quick to praise Biden for swift action on a disaster declaration.After speaking with Biden by telephone earlier this week, Stitt specifically thanked the president for “taking the time to reach out this afternoon and offer the federal government’s help for Oklahomans. We had a very productive call and I look forward to working together to find solutions as we recover from this historic storm.”Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Biden is “well-suited" to deal with the disaster because of his decades of service in the U.S. Senate and as a former vice president and because of “his genuine concern for people.”“He's got to show empathy right off the bat,” Perry said in an interview. “It's important for a president to go to a place that’s been battered, but be careful about the footprint. He doesn’t want to make things worse.”Biden, should he decide to visit Texas next week, could also use the trip to press his point that climate change is real and must not go unaddressed, and that the state could do things like winterize its power plants to be better prepared for future storms, Perry said.But he should take care to not do so in a scolding kind of way.“We know he cares about climate change, and this is a way to convince people,” Perry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-weather-testing-joe-biden-s-disaster-management-skills-101613802439425.html
20-02-2021||World||Australian PM warns of 'culture problem' after allegations of rape in parliament||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday he was "sickened" by allegations of sexual assault in Parliament House, adding that there was a "culture" problem at the government building.His comments followed reports that a second woman had said she had been assaulted by the same man whom a former media adviser to the government this week publicly accused of rape.Brittany Higgins said on Friday, in a statement reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), that the man had raped her two years ago in parliament. Reuters has been unable to contact her.Morrison apologised to Higgins on Tuesday for the way her complaint was handled at that time, ordering a probe into the government's workplace culture."I think we've got a problem in the parliament and the workplace culture that exists there," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. "We would be naive to think it's not a challenge that other workplaces face all around the country, but I agree the parliament should be setting the standard."Higgins told ABC she was raped by an unnamed colleague who also worked for Morrison's ruling Liberal party and that she would lodge a formal complaint to open a police investigation."These events truly do sicken me... as they should anyone," Morrison said. "That is why I'm seeking to try to address this as swiftly but as effectively as we possibly can."Media reports on Saturday said a second woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by the man in 2020, after he had been sacked following Higgins's allegations and while he was working in the private sector. The second alleged attack occurred at the woman's home after the two had been out for dinner, she was quoted as saying.Reuters was not able to reach the second woman or the man."I am telling my story because I want to support Brittany and I want to help shine a light on this awful culture," she said in anonymous comments reported by The Weekend Australian newspaper.A police media liaison officer in the capital Canberra said on Saturday there was an "open" investigation into the incident involving Higgins but that the case was not "active" because she had not filed a formal complaint.The accusation by the second woman had not been referred to police, the liaison officer said.Higgins told the ABC this week she had not been encouraged to make a police complaint at the time of her assault when she worked in parliament for Defence Minister Lynda Reynolds. Reynolds says Higgins was not pressured against making an official complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-warns-of-culture-problem-after-allegations-of-rape-in-parliament-101613802444512.html

He didn’t disclose financial details.The initial share sale will make it the first logistics company to list in Pakistan and lure investors to a business that’s crucial for the nation’s booming e-commerce industry, according to Topline Securities Pakistan Ltd., financial adviser for the IPO.“There is some crazy exponential growth that is being foreseen right now,” Baxamoosa said in a phone interview. “We have grown organically so far but now it’s about time that we get aggressive.”The courier company that started by handling cargo in 2005 entered the e-commerce business six years later by going door-to-door and convincing companies to start online sales. It even made websites, back-end software and set up a call center for its clients.It now has about 1,000 employees and over 350 vehicles. The company will use the proceeds to boost its network fourfold. It will also add servers and other IT equipment.The nation’s e-commerce industry is in its infancy but is growing rapidly as internet and smartphone penetration jump, according to Ruchir Desai, fund manager at Hong Kong-based Asia Frontier Capital Ltd. The pandemic could be a big trigger for the market, he said.The company handled 2.1 million shipments and 4.5 billion rupees in cash deliveries in the year ended June. It has grown annually by about 70% on average since 2012. The company forecasts revenue will rise more than three times to 4.3 billion rupees in fiscal 2023, according to Baxamoosa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unilevers-pakistan-delivery-partner-plans-ipo-to-expand-network-101613797064923.html

It agreed to strengthen the World Health Organization, a body that the previous US administration had chastized and left.“Drawing on our strengths and values as democratic, open economies and societies, we will work together and with others to make 2021 a turning point for multilateralism and to shape a recovery that promotes the health and prosperity of our people and planet,” leaders said in their communique. “We will intensify cooperation on the health response to covid-19.”Leaders are set to meet in person in Cornwall, south-west England, in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-pledge-to-protect-jobs-spur-recovery-101613802006104.html
20-02-2021||World||Google AI chief apologizes for researcher’s acrimonious exit||Google will start grading executives based on workforce diversity goals and increase human resources staffing, acknowledging fault in its acrimonious split with Timnit Gebru, a prominent former employee and one of the few Black women in the field of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of parent company Alphabet Inc., described the changes in an email to employees, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information. The email included comments by Jeff Dean, the executive who leads the company’s artificial intelligence and research efforts, saying he was sorry for how he handled Gebru’s exit, according to a copy of the message reviewed by Bloomberg“I understand we could have and should have handled the situation with more sensitivity,” Dean wrote. “And for that, I am sorry.” Dean said Google’s behavior toward Gebru hurt some female and Black employees and led them to question whether they belonged at the company. He did not apologize directly to Gebru in the email to staff.Executives’ performance evaluations will now be partly tied to diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and Google will double the amount of human resources staff working on employee retention, according to the memo.A spokesman for Google declined to comment. The changes were reported earlier Friday by news website Axios.Several large companies have made diversity a factor in executive performance and compensation. They include McDonald’s Corp. and Microsoft Corp.At Google, the changes came after turmoil stemming from Gebru’s departure. She said she was fired in December after refusing to retract a research paper critical of a key Google technology or remove the Google authors from it, prompting outrage from some of her former colleagues internally and online. Google has said that Gebru, the former co-head of ethical AI, resigned.On Thursday, the company appointed Marian Croak as vice president of engineering, elevating an experienced Black woman to lead a new, centralized organization to develop AI responsibly. The further changes outlined Friday marked the conclusion of an internal investigation into the handling of Gebru’s departure.Dean also detailed a plan to clarify the process for approving research papers by Google authors for outside publication. The current process has too many intersecting parts, particularly for “sensitive” research, he said, and what’s considered sensitive isn’t always clear.“We’re building a more unified, start-to-finish process with clearer guidance along the way on what steps are needed, who is accountable at each step and Google’s research goals and priorities,” Dean wrote.Dean did not address the questions raised by the Gebru example as to whether Google’s AI ethics team will be allowed to critically examine the very technologies the search and advertising giant uses in its commercial products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-ai-chief-apologizes-for-researcher-s-acrimonious-exit-101613802250832.html

Gebru, a Black woman, said she was fired in a dispute over a research paper, while Google said it had accepted her resignation.Hundreds of Google employees have signed an online petition protested Gebru's departure. Mitchell, though, was even more outspoken in a January 19 tweet that insinuated that a meeting company CEO Sundar Pichai had scheduled with the leaders of historically Black colleges and universities was merely window dressing.Google said Mitchell was fired after an internal investigation concluded she had broken multiple company policies. The violations included the unauthorized removal of confidential company documents and other private information about its employees, according to Google's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-fires-ai-manager-who-protested-her-peer-s-departure-101613790707857.html
20-02-2021||World||Britain’s next answer to Covid-19 is to prepare to live with it||Britain’s success at vaccinating faster than anywhere else in Europe is putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to figure out what comes next.While Israel is emerging as the global test case for a country’s ability to inoculate its way out of Covid, the UK is a pilot for whether nations can do enough to end damaging lockdowns and essentially learn to live with the disease. The key, Johnson believes, lies with mass testing in workplaces, schools, shopping centers and theaters to make sure that employees, pupils and customers are Covid-free. He’s expected to set out details in a statement to Parliament on Monday as part of a “road map” out of lockdown, and some companies in retail and hospitality are already gearing up. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Hundreds of thousands of tests could be sent out by post every day, including to secondary school pupils. The idea is to come down on outbreaks “like a ton of bricks,” according to foreign secretary Dominic Raab. It is these rapid tests, rather than “vaccination passports” being considered by other countries, that the government wants to be part of daily life. The UK has suffered the continent’s highest death toll and its economy sank by the most since the Great Frost of 1709, albeit with a rebound in the fourth quarter. But on the other extreme, Britain has injected more than a quarter of its population with at least one vaccine shot and is also a frontrunner in identifying potentially more dangerous mutations of the coronavirus.The question is not how to eradicate Covid, but to get to a point where people will never again be banished to their homes, schools closed and stores shuttered. Critics say previous testing failures contributed to the country’s death toll, while some epidemiologists say that potential route to a new normal is fraught with risk given the unreliability of so-called lateral flow tests compared with those that take longer to process.“If you just scatter tests around like fairy dust, it is not going to work,” said Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine. “They’re always looking for the silver bullet, the one thing that will sort it all out. Any public health doctor would tell you that doesn’t work.”Johnson is well aware he’s walking a tightrope. Many within his governing Conservative Party are calling for the reopening of the economy more quickly. Retail sales that are the economy’s lifeblood fell more than twice as fast as expected in January, a report on Friday showed. The concept of mass testing is nothing new for the UK In September, Johnson announced to great fanfare his “Operation Moonshot” plan for millions of tests a day. While that language appears to have been dropped, the plan was resurrected, with the prime minister declaring on Feb. 15 that rapid testing would allow the “toughest nuts to crack”—such as nightclubs and theaters—to open.A 22 billion-pound ($31 billion) testing program has ramped up UK capacity to rates that are among the highest in the world, with more than 760,000 tests carried out in one day earlier this month. That includes both lab-processed polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests that take a day or two, and the lateral flow tests that can give results within 30 minutes.Companies are keen to embrace the rapid tests. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of the UKHospitality group, said the industry stood ready to roll out mass testing to make sure nightclubs and events such as conferences and weddings could restart “as swiftly as possible.”Supermarkets are in talks with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on devising a workable solution for testing shop workers and want the focus to be on tests that can be taken at home or in the community, rather than in stores, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions. Workers in the warehouse depots of some supermarkets are already trialing lateral flow tests because that’s easier to manage than inside busy stores, one person said.More businesses need to be encouraged to use regular tests to ensure a safer working environment, the Confederation of British Industry said. “That’s where the business focus is right now, rather than clamoring for the introduction of a domestic vaccine passport,” a spokesperson said.Johnson has rejected the idea that venues will demand vaccination certificates before people can enter and the government is only looking into how it can give people proof of inoculation to travel overseas should other countries require evidence. Ministers have also said it’s up to businesses to decide if they want to require their employees to have the vaccine. Some companies are looking into potential “no jab, no job” contracts. Barchester Healthcare, which runs more than 200 care homes in the U.K., said it was considering whether “staff who refuse the vaccine on non-medical grounds will, by reason of their own decision, make themselves unavailable for work.”Health and social care workers already get regular tests, and businesses with more than 50 employees can order rapid tests via a government website.But there are concerns about false reassurances, and indeed how testing would work in practice for customers rather than workers.The UK Cinema Association told the Daily Mirror newspaper that asking a 250-strong audience to take a test and wait 30 minutes before seeing a two-hour film “seems impractical.” It is also unclear whether companies will—in the longer term—need to pay for the tests themselves rather than the state.Some scientists believe the real focus should be on incentivizing people to stay at home for the required 10 days of isolation to ensure they don’t pass on the virus regardless of any mass testing. Dido Harding, who runs the UK’s test-and-trace program, said this month that at least 20,000 people a day in England were failing to self-isolate properly.Government officials say that lateral flow devices are effective at detecting Covid-19, though anyone who tests negative should recognize that no test is 100% accurate.“If hundreds of thousands of people are tested per week with lateral flow tests, there will be many false results,” said Duncan Robertson, a disease modeler at Loughborough University in England. If a negative test is seen as a “green light” to visit a nightclub there’s a “very real risk that people will engage in more risky behaviors when they may in fact be Covid positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-next-answer-to-covid-19-is-to-prepare-to-live-with-it-101613801798716.html
20-02-2021||World||4 Taiwanese military intelligence officers held on espionage charges||Four retired Taiwanese military intelligence officers -- including a major general -- have been indicted for spying for China, prosecutors said Saturday.The quartet were charged with developing a spying network and collecting confidential information for Beijing, the Taipei district prosecutors' office said.The two sides have been spying on each other since the Nationalists fled to the island to set up a rival government in 1949, having lost a civil war on the mainland to the communists.China claims self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.Two Taiwanese former colonels were recruited by a Chinese national security official in the southern province of Guangdong, the government lawyers said, and had introduced several colleagues to the official since 2012.Among those allegedly introduced was the ex-major general, identified by his family name Yueh.Yueh received cash, gifts and free excursions during multiple trips to mainland China and Macau, and worked to recruit other officers to "develop an intelligence network" for Beijing, prosecutors said.The accused "were aware of the standoff between our country and the Chinese communists... but they coveted illegal gains such as the perks (offered by China) to do business there, the financial rewards and free trips," prosecutors said in a statement.They face charges under national security law and national intelligence work law.Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, in part because she regards Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation.In October, a Taiwanese court sentenced a lieutenant colonel to four years in prison for spying for Beijing, as Chinese state media reported a crackdown on "hundreds" of espionage cases linked to Taiwan and arrested "a batch of Taiwanese spies and their accomplices".Chinese state broadcaster CCTV also aired four television "confessions" by Taiwanese nationals detained in China's opaque judicial system.Multiple Taiwanese nationals have disappeared into Chinese custody accused of various anti-state crimes in cases that have caused an outcry at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-taiwanese-military-intelligence-officers-held-on-espionage-charges-101613800875529.html
20-02-2021||World||US' re-entry into Paris Climate Agreement a 'day of hope', says UN chief||Describing the US' re-entry into the Paris Climate Agreement as a “day of hope” for the world, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said the absence of a “key player” for the past four years was a “missing link” that created a gap and weakened the historic accord.On Friday, the US officially returned to the Paris climate accord, 107 days after it left at the behest of former president Donald Trump.“Today is a day of hope, as the United States officially rejoins the Paris Agreement. This is good news for the United States — and for the world," the Secretary-General said."It is a pleasure to mark this occasion with you all, and particularly with Special Envoy John Kerry, whose own work is reflected in this historic agreement,” Guterres said on Friday during a virtual event to mark the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement.Trump had withdrawn the US from the historic Paris Agreement and Guterres had termed that decision as a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.”President Joe Biden had signed several key executive orders just hours after being sworn-in as the 46th President of the United States last month and Washington rejoining the Paris climate accord was among the first steps of the new presidency.Kerry was the US Secretary of State when the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015. In a symbolic gesture, he had signed the treaty at the UN in April 2016 accompanied by his granddaughter.During the virtual ceremony, Guterres said that for the past four years, the “absence of a key player created a gap in the Paris Agreement; a missing link that weakened the whole.“So today, as we mark the United States re-entry into this treaty, we also recognise its restoration, in its entirety, as its creators intended. Welcome back.”Guterres said that while the Paris Agreement is a historic achievement, he warned that the commitments made so far are not enough and even those commitments made in Paris are not being met.“The warning signs are everywhere. The six years since 2015 have been the six hottest years on record. Carbon dioxide levels are at record highs. Fires, floods and other extreme weather events are getting worse, in every region,” he said.The UN chief cautioned that if nations don’t change course, “we could face a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees this century.” During a press conference on Thursday, Guterres said that the year 2021 is a “make-it-or-break-it year”.“We are not too late, but we need to make sure that we are able, not only to create the conditions for a drastic reduction of emissions in the horizon of the next decade, making it possible to achieve the limit of 1.5 degrees,” he said.The UN chief said a central objective for the United Nations this year is to create a truly global coalition for net-zero emissions by 2050.“In the past year, countries representing 70 per cent of the world economy and 65 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions committed to net zero,” he said.He expressed hope that the US will formally join this coalition very soon, as pledged by President Biden, and will present its concrete plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.“We rely on the United States to build on this with an ambitious and credible Nationally Determined Contribution for 2030, aligned with President Biden’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050,” he said. Outlining the actions needed now by the international community, Guterres said the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to rebuild a stronger and better world.“To do that, we must invest in a green economy that will help to heal the planet and its people, and create well-paying, stable jobs to ensure more equitable and sustainable prosperity,” he said.Now is the time to implement transformative change, by phasing out coal and supporting a just transition, with training and opportunities for people whose jobs will be impacted, he said.He also called on nations to stop investing in fossil fuel projects that ruin people’s health, destroy biodiversity and contribute to climate catastrophe.“The Paris Agreement is our pact with our descendants and the whole human family. This is the race of our lifetimes. We must go much faster, and much farther. It is within our power to build a future of renewable energy and green infrastructure that protects people and planet and ensures prosperity for all,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-re-entry-into-paris-climate-agreement-a-day-of-hope-says-un-chief-101613799699473.html
20-02-2021||World||Neera Tanden’s nomination as Joe Biden’s budget czar in jeopardy||Indian-American Neera Tanden’s nomination as US President Joe Biden’s budget czar is in peril after a Democratic senator announced his opposition to her confirmation on Friday.Tanden’s nomination as director of the office of management and budget had run into strong headwinds from the start. It has nothing to do with her qualifications for the job. She is widely seen as capable and had played a key role in shaping former president Barack Obama’s health care law. Instead, it was about the sharp language she has used while attacking Republicans over the years, mostly on Twitter. “I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the office of management and budget,” said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”Manchin’s opposition has jeopardised Tanden’s nomination because she needs the support of all 50 Democrats to manage at least a tie in the evenly divided 100-member Senate. Vice-president Kamala Harris’s constitutionally provided tie-breaking vote would then take Tanden across the finish line.Biden is confident of getting her confirmed, though. He told reporters during a visit to a Pfizer facility in Michigan, where the company is manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, that he’s not pulling her nomination. “I think we are going to find the votes and get her confirmed.”If confirmed, Tanden would become the first American of Indian descent to hold a regular federal cabinet position. Nikki Haley had held a cabinet-rank position as the US ambassador to the UN in the Trump administration. That post was downgraded after her exit. Biden has restored it to cabinet rank for his appointee, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.Anticipating opposition over her past remarks, Tanden had apologised several times at her confirmation hearing. “I do think the last several years have been very polarising and I apologise for my language that has contributed to that,” Tanden had said at a hearing on February 9. “I know it’s on me to demonstrate to this committee and to Republican members and Democratic members I can work with anyone.”Rob Portman, a Republican senator, had referred to her comments about other Republican senators at the hearing, saying, “You wrote that Susan Collins is, quote, ‘the worst’. That Tom Cotton is a fraud. That vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz. You called leader (Mitch) McConnell ‘Moscow Mitch’ and ‘Voldemort’.” In response, Tanden had apologised, saying, “For those concerned about my rhetoric and my language, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for any hurt that they’ve caused.”Tanden had been confronted by her non-Republican victims as well. “Your attacks were not just made against Republicans. There were vicious attacks made against progressives, people who I have worked with, me personally,” Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, had told her at another hearing. Tanden had apologised on that occasion, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neera-tanden-s-nomination-as-joe-biden-s-budget-czar-in-jeopardy-101613799490252.html
20-02-2021||World||Thailand's prime minister survives no-confidence vote||Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha survived a no-confidence vote Saturday in parliament amid allegations that his government mismanaged the economy, bungled the provision of Covid-19 vaccines, abused human rights and fostered corruption.Nine other ministers also survived the vote.It marked the second no-confidence test Prayuth’s government has faced since taking office in July 2019, following a contested election after Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup as the army chief. In February last year, Prayuth and five Cabinet ministers easily defeated a no-confidence vote in the lower house.In the latest motion, his government was also criticized for misusing its power to promote police officials and for establishing a cyber unit to attack government critics on social media, among other complaints.But a more serious allegation was that Prayuth has deepened divisions in society by using the monarchy as a shield against criticism of his government.A student-led protest movement has campaigned since last year for Prayuth and his government to step down. They want the constitution to be amended to make it more democratic, and for the monarchy to be reformed to make it more accountable.Also read| Thailand’s second locally-made vaccine set to enter human trials“The biggest fault of Prayuth is that he does not understand the principles of the constitutional monarchy,” said Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of the opposition Move Forward Party.“He used the monarchy to protect himself whenever he was criticized or opposed. This is an evil action, making him no longer qualified to be prime minister,” he said.His accusation refers to the enforcement of Article 112 in the criminal code, also known as the lese majeste law. Prayuth said in June last year that King Maha Vajiralongkorn had expressed his wish for the government not to use the law against defaming the monarchy to prosecute pro-democracy protesters.The legislation allows anyone to file a complaint with the police, with convictions carrying jail terms of up to 15 years per offense. According to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, at least 59 people including several minors were summoned under the law between November and February.The monarchy is widely considered an untouchable bedrock of Thai nationalism.Four well-known protesters including human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, student leader Parit Chiwarak, and political activists Somyos Prueksakasemsuk and Patiwat Saraiyaem were prosecuted under the law and on sedition charges earlier this month. Their lawyer requested bail but the court denied it.Also read| Pfizer promises to double supply as Joe Biden quickens Covid-19 vaccine rolloutPrayuth said the debate in parliament was "a good opportunity for both sides to do something together for our country and people. And I am ready to clarify every allegation.”Of the 487 lawmakers, 277 are part of the ruling coalition and 210 are with the opposition. The censure motion would require a simple majority, or 244 votes, to pass. Prayuth received 272 votes with 206 voting no-confidence and three remaining silent.On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters held a mock censure motion against Prayuth and the other ministers on the street in front of the parliament building, calling out their alleged corruption and noting their failure to address rising financial inequality in Thailand.Protesters said another rally was planned on Saturday afternoon.Police said they would deploy more than 10,000 officers in Bangkok over the weekend to control the crowds and maintain law and order. Police vehicles, including water canon trucks, have been dispatched near the parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailands-prime-minister-survives-no-confidence-vote-101613796812999.html

President Joe Biden, who served as the Vice President during the Obama administration, issued orders to join the Paris Agreement on day one of his presidency.“… what steps will we take in the next 10 years? And the truth is that everybody has to do that. China, which is the largest emitter in the world needs to be part of the 2020 to 2030 effort.“India needs to be part of it. Russia needs to be part of it. So is Japan… the major emitters, 17 nations, need to really step up and begin to lower those emissions,” Kerry said.Also read| Texas governor's biggest donors: Energy industry that failedThis challenge, he asserted, means that all countries setting bold and achievable targets have to do so here at home and in the course of their declaration of their national determined contributions (NDCs).“We have to drive investment toward climate solutions and innovations and resilience. We need to get the entire world on a path towards net zero emissions, and we need to absolutely make certain that happens no later than 2050 and sooner if possible,” he said.“Ultimately keeping alive the possibility of limiting the planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is critical because we now know that anything more than that will have catastrophic implications around the globe,” Kerry said.The UN Climate Conference, COP 26 will take place in Glasgow in November.“I believe that Glasgow is our last, best hope to get the world to pony up, to deliver, to get us on a safer path. To determine that we will do the things necessary in the next decade to keep alive the prospect of limiting the earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and we will keep alive--in fact create a better vision for what we can do by 2050 with net zero,” he said.In his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said green economy is much more job creator than the brown economy of the past.Also read| US airlines plan to ask passengers for contact-tracing details“If we invest in renewable energy, if you invest in greening our transportation systems, if we invest in greening our agriculture, if we invest in greening all the areas of our economy, we will be creating lots of jobs,” he said.Most of those jobs will benefit young people who have access to new technologies and knowledges of the 21st century, he noted.“But we need at the same time to look into a just transition. We need to make sure that we look at those who will lose their jobs because their activities will phase out. As it is the case already for many other reasons namely because of technology evolution,” he added.The world, he asserted, needs the drastic reduction in emissions in the next decade.“We need to get to net zero in 2050. The scientific community has told us that if the two things are achieved we will be able to keep the temperature below 1.5 degrees of growth at the end of the century,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-emitters-need-to-step-up-says-kerry-after-us-rejoins-paris-agreement-101613793229907.html

20-02-2021||World||US sanctions over pipeline from Russia deemed lacking by GOP||The Biden administration on Friday added a layer of sanctions to a Russian vessel and the shipowner for their work on a new gas pipeline from Russia that is strongly opposed in the US and eastern Europe.But the move was immediately criticised as inadequate by senior Republican lawmakers who noted the administration had not penalized any additional companies or individuals for work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.They also said the new sanctions were redundant as they duplicate existing penalties that the Trump administration had imposed on the pipelaying ship Fortuna and its owner KVT-RUS in January.The sanctions were announced in a report submitted to Congress by the State Department late Friday night, three days after a Feb. 16 deadline for its delivery had passed. Congressional aides expressed surprise that the word “Russia” did not appear in the report except in its title and that it did not discuss in detail any consultations with U.S. partners and allies that would be affected.Like the Trump administration before it, the Biden administration is opposed to the pipeline because it believes it will harm European energy security, particularly for countries in eastern and central Europe like Ukraine and Poland, which the pipeline bypasses.US officials have long said they fear Russia will use the pipeline as a political tool against its neighbours.“We've been clear for some time that Nord Stream 2 is a bad deal and that companies risk sanctions if they are involved,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters just hours before the report was transmitted to Congress.“We'll continue to work with our allies and partners to ensure that Europe has a reliable, diversified energy supply network that doesn't undermine our collective security. Our goal in all of this is to reinforce European energy security and safeguard against predatory behavior,” he said.However, congressional Republicans were unimpressed and denounced the administration for failing to impose any sanctions on additional targets, notably people and firms in Germany, which is a strong Nord Stream 2 proponent. Administration officials have pointed to their relatively short time in office thus far and said they want to review all options before imposing new sanctions.Still, the top GOP members on the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Michael McCaul, demanded explanations as to what exactly the administration is doing to oppose the completion of the pipeline.“I am deeply troubled and disappointed by the State Department's report on Nord Stream 2 activities and their decision to forgo additional sanctions on other entities involved in its construction," Risch said. “Congress has passed multiple bipartisan laws regarding this project, and specifically broadened the mandatory sanctions to include the types of pipe-laying activities occurring right now. The administration's decision to ignore these activities demands an immediate explanation.”“Simply put, today's sanctions designations are wholly inadequate," said McCaul, who added that simply adding a layer of sanctions to previously penalized targets does not meet lawmakers' intent to stop the pipeline. “Allowing this pipeline to be completed would be nothing short of a victory for Vladimir Putin.”Republican concern about the administration's actions will likely be echoed by some Democrats. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has co-sponsored legislation opposing the pipeline with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and has been outspoken in her criticism of Nord Stream 2.Opposition to the pipeline and its potential impact on Europe has increased since the poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and the crackdown against demonstrators protesting in his support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-over-pipeline-from-russia-deemed-lacking-by-gop-101613795875948.html
20-02-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman to remove country quota for work-based Green Card||American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi hailed the legislative move to eliminate country quota for employment-based Green Card asserting that these reforms will help the US to retain top talent from across the world while growing the economy.“As an original cosponsor of the Fairness For High-Skilled Immigrants Act, I am proud to announce that this immigration package has incorporated our bill’s fundamental reforms, including the elimination of country-based discrimination for employment-based green cards and the increasing of per-country caps on family-based green cards,” Krishnamoorthi said on Friday.“These reforms will help our country continue to attract and retain top talent from across the world while growing our economy and creating more good-paying jobs here. Any comprehensive immigration bill must include these necessary fixes to end the green card backlog once and for all, and I will continue to fight for these provisions until they become law,” he said.Non-profit South Asian Americans Leading Together, in a statement, said the bill is a historic piece of legislation that proposes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants, including more than 6,50,000 undocumented South Asians.The bill creates an earned roadmap to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, providing dreamers, TPS holders, and some farmworkers with an expedited three-year path to citizenship, and giving all other undocumented immigrants an eight-year path.It reforms the family-based immigration system to keep families together by recapturing visas from previous years to clear backlogs, including spouses and children of green card holders as immediate family members, and increasing per-country caps for family-based immigration.The bill updates the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries, giving dependents of H-1B holders work authorization, and preventing children of H-1B holders from aging out of the system.It also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, and incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.The bill also supports asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations by eliminating the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims, reducing asylum application backlogs, increasing protections for U visa, T visa, and VAWA applicants, including by raising the cap on U visas from 10,000 to 30,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-to-remove-country-quota-for-work-based-green-card-101613793180898.html
20-02-2021||World||Bolsonaro appoints army reserve general to head Petrobras||Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, appointed an army reserve general to lead state-owned energy giant Petrobras, after criticizing several successive increases in the price of fuel."The government decided to appoint Joaquim Silva e Luna to fulfil a new mission, as... president of Petrobras, after closing the cycle, exceeding two years, of the current president Roberto Castello Branco," said a brief note from the Ministry of Mines and Energy, published by the president on his Facebook account.Silva e Luna, formerly the defence minister under president Michel Temer, had been serving as general director of the Itaipu Binacional dam.His nomination will have to be confirmed by the Petrobras board of directors.Earlier Friday Bolsonaro had announced that there would be "changes" at Petrobras."We will never interfere in this great company, nor in its pricing policy, but people cannot be surprised with certain increases," Bolsonaro said during a morning event in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. He did not give further details.His statements were followed by a sharp drop in the oil company's share prices. They closed down 7.92 percent Friday, with preferred shares down 6.63 percent.Petrobras has increased fuel prices four times so far in 2021, a cumulative rise of nearly 35 percent.The price of gas cylinders, widely used by poor families, has also increased considerably this year, a new blow to people already severely affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Bolsonaro's criticism of the increases, which he called "excessive", calls into question the liberal agenda of his economic minister Paulo Guedes, according to analyst Leandro Giabati.On Thursday, the president announced he would eliminate federal tariffs on diesel and gas for two months, while his government finds a solution to the price hikes.While the situation "is far from signaling that the minister will fall or resign," it "reveals that Guedes has been constantly adapting to the political demands of President Bolsonaro, to the detriment of ... the interests they both represent," Giabati said.Leftist former president Dilma Rousseff froze fuel prices several times in 2014 and 2015 despite the price of oil increasing at the time.But that state intervention into Petrobras prices ended when Rousseff was impeached in 2016 and removed from office.Now prices are fixed by the company according to market variations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-appoints-army-reserve-general-to-head-petrobras-101613790813310.html
20-02-2021||World||Texas governor's biggest donors: Energy industry that failed||As frozen Texas reels under one of the worst electricity outages in US history, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has blamed grid operators and iced-over wind turbines but gone easier on another culprit: an oil and gas industry that is the state's dominant business and his biggest political contributor.And as the toll deepened Saturday from a week of historic winter storms, which have killed more than 20 people in Texas, the dogpiling on a power grid that is proudly isolated from the rest of the country ignores warnings known by the state's GOP leaders for years.“It's almost like a murder suspect blaming their right hand for committing the crime," said Democratic state Rep. James Talarico. His suburban Austin home lost power for 40 hours and had no working faucets Thursday, when roughly one in four people in Texas woke up under instructions to boil water.Like most of the state's 30 million residents, Talarico's power is controlled by grid managers at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which Abbott again laid into Thursday after more than 4 million people at one point were enduring outages in subfreezing temperatures.But that is not where the responsibility ends, as power plants that feed the grid were knocked offline by the extreme cold, and natural gas producers didn't protect wellheads or lines from freezing. “ERCOT is a convenient whipping boy," Talarico said.The crisis has put the fossil fuel industry that lavishes the Texas Capitol with money in the crosshairs in ways that Abbott has not had to navigate when steering America's second-largest state through other disasters, including hurricanes and the ongoing pandemic. For the first time Thursday, Abbott called on Texas to mandate that power plants be winterized.Oil and gas built and enriched Texas, and with that its politicians, including those who became president. But none has reaped campaign contributions on the scale of Abbott, who in six years in office has raised more than $150 million from donors, more than any governor in U.S. history.Texas' energy interests are the biggest backers of his political rise, and he has not ruled out a White House run in 2024. More than $26 million of his contributions have come from the oil and gas industry, more than any other economic sector, according to an analysis by the National Institute on Money in Politics.As Texas' grid first began buckling early Monday, Abbott drew overnight backlash after going on Fox News and laying fault on solar and wind producers, at a time when natural gas, coal and nuclear energy systems were responsible for nearly twice as many outages.Pressed on those comments later, Abbott took a softer tone and acknowledged every source of power had been compromised. Frozen natural gas lines also left millions without power in Mexico.Abbott accused ERCOT of misleading the public with messages that the grid was ready for the storm.“It's especially unacceptable when you realize what ERCOT told the state of Texas," Abbott said.ERCOT is overseen by the Texas Public Utility Commission, whose three members are appointed by Abbott. While ERCOT manages most of Texas' power grid, the commission and the Texas Legislature made key policy decisions that have factored into the ongoing crisis.After the state's last major freeze, during the 2011 Super Bowl held in Arlington, Texas, a federal analysis found that energy producers' procedures for winterising their equipment “were either inadequate or were not adequately followed” in many cases. The report repeatedly cites another Texas freeze, in 1989, as a clear warning.Girding power generators against fierce winter weather is essential in colder climates. In Iowa, where wind farms supply 40% of the state's electricity, windmills have been turning all week despite temperatures that dropped to minus 17 degrees (minus 27 degrees Celsius) in Des Moines. In Texas, grid officials say they can't speak for why power generators here don't do the same.A decade ago, the report on the last Texas failure listed a number of ways to winterise an oil well or a natural gas device and the estimated costs: installing a cold-weather production unit ($23,000), collecting gas vented from an injection pump to supply a heater ($675), or building a fiberglass hut to enclose the production equipment ($1,500).Winterising 50,000 wells — just under a third of the number of total natural gas wells active in Texas — was estimated in 2011 to cost as much as $1.75 billion, a figure that would almost certainly be higher today due to inflation. By comparison, the Texas oil and natural gas industry paid $13.9 billion in taxes and royalties last year alone, according to figures from the Texas Oil & Gas Association.Republican Ryan Sitton, the former commissioner of the peculiarly named Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, said an issue with bolstering power plants is the cost passed on to electric customers. Of Abbott's focus on ERCOT, Sitton said: “Calling for an investigation is easy. Actually performing a good investigation and taking ownership of the results is where the rubber meets the road."He said oil and gas interests, which generously funded his own political campaigns, don't hold the sway that the public imagines.“They make donations, sure. But unless the entire energy industry is speaking with a unified voice, which almost never happens, there's not that much influence," Sitton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-governor-s-biggest-donors-energy-industry-that-failed-101613789275299.html
20-02-2021||World||US airlines plan to ask passengers for contact-tracing details||The US airline industry is pledging to expand the practice of asking passengers on flights to the United States for information that public health officials could use for contact tracing during the pandemic.An industry trade group said Saturday that the carriers would turn over the information to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which could use it to contact passengers who might be exposed to the virus that causes Covid-19.Delta and United have been doing that since December. On Friday, an industry trade group said that American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue and Hawaiian will also ask passengers to make their names, phone numbers, email and physical addresses available to the CDC.The airlines had long resisted government efforts to require them to gather passenger information and provide it to health agencies. They said they don't have the information on passengers who buy tickets from other sellers such as online travel agencies. They also argued that gathering the information and making it immediately available to the government would be time-consuming and require costly upgrades to computer systems.The CEO of trade group Airlines for America, Nicholas Calio, said carriers hope that their offer of voluntary information gathering, along with testing of passengers entering the US, will lead the government to lift restrictions on international travel.Although the requests are only voluntary, United Airlines said Friday that since December most of its international customers have provided contact details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-plan-to-ask-passengers-for-contact-tracing-details-101613788849286.html

We want to work through this issue.”The prime minister also welcomed a report that a Facebook executive had apologized for the company mistakenly shutting down pages operated by charities and others that covered public-health and safety announcements. Morrison described the actions as “completely indefensible.”Facebook on Thursday blocked news sharing on its platform in Australian in response to a legal standoff with the government, which is expected to pass laws next week aimed at compensating the local media industry for advertising revenue lost to digital platforms.Facebook’s dispute on news sharing in Australia is part of a broader battle against global regulation, with lawmakers in other countries watching the case closely.In contrast, Alphabet Inc.-owned Google -- which also opposes the legislation -- negotiated a string of deals in the past week with media Australian companies in a bid to avoid the arbitration process enforced by the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-says-facebook-back-at-the-table-after-blocking-pages-101613785366643.html
20-02-2021||World||Joe Biden declares 'America is back' in welcome words to allies||President Joe Biden used his first address before a global audience Saturday to declare that "America is back, the transatlantic alliance is back,” after four years of a Trump administration that flaunted its foreign policy through an “America First” lens.Speaking to the annual Munich Security Conference virtually, Biden ticked through a daunting to-do list — salvaging the Iran nuclear deal, meeting economic and security challenges posed by China and Russia and repairing the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic — that he said would require close cooperation between the US and its Western allies.Without mentioning Donald Trump's name once in his speech, Biden mixed talk of a reinvigorated democratic alliance with a rebuke of his predecessor's approach, a message warmly received by Western allies.'I know the past few years have strained and tested the transatlantic relationship,” Biden said. “The United States is determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership.”The president also participated Friday in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, where leaders managed to work Biden's campaign theme into their closing joint statement, vowing to “work together to beat Covid-19 and build back better.”“Welcome back, America,” said European Council President Charles Michel, effectively summing up the mood of the Munich conference.But while such happy talk conveyed the palpable sense of relief among allies at Biden's full-throated commitment to mending frayed US-Europe relations, plenty has changed over the past four years in ways creating new challenges.China has cemented its place as a fierce economic competitor on the continent as the U.S. has reconsidered long-held national security and economic priorities embedded in the transatlantic alliance. Populism has grown through much of Europe. And other Western countries have, at moments, sought to fill the vacuum left as America stepped back from the world stage.German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that some differences between the US and Europe remain “complicated.” Europe sees China's economic ambitions as less of an existential threat than the US does and has its own strategic and economic concerns that are not always in sync with Biden on Russia as well.Still, Merkel, who had a strained relationship with Trump, didn't hide her preference for an American foreign policy informed by Biden's world view.“Things are looking a great deal better for multilateralism this year than two years ago, and that has a lot to with Joe Biden having become the president of the United States of America,” Merkel said.“His speech just now, but also his administration's first announcements, have convinced us that this is not just talk but action.”Biden made his address to a global audience as his administration this week took steps to reverse key Trump administration policies.He said that the US stands ready to rejoin talks about reentering the 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear deal abandoned by the Trump administration. The Biden administration announced Thursday its desire to reengage Iran, and it took action at the United Nations aimed at restoring policy to what it was before Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.Biden also spoke out about the two-decade war in Afghanistan, where he faces a May 1 deadline to remove the remaining 2,500 US troops under a Trump administration negotiated peace agreement with the Taliban. He also called for cooperation in addressing economic and national security challenges posed by Russia and China and identified cyberspace, artificial intelligence and biotechnology as areas of growing competition.“We must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China,” Biden declared.His message was girded by an underlying argument that democracies -- not autocracies -- are models of governance that can best meet the challenges of the moment. The president urged fellow world leaders to show together that “democracies can still deliver.”At the G-7, administration officials said, Biden focused on what lies ahead for the international community as it tries to extinguish the public health and economic crises created by the coronavirus pandemic. He announced the US will soon begin releasing $4 billion for an international effort to bolster the purchase and distribution of vaccine to poor nations, a program that Trump refused to support.Biden's turn on the world stage came as the US officially rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. Trump announced in June 2017 that he was pulling the US out of the landmark accord, arguing that the pact would undermine the American economy.Biden announced the US intention of rejoining on the first day of his presidency, but he had to wait 30 days for the move to go into effect. He has said that he will bake considerations about climate change into every major domestic and foreign policy decision his administration faces."This is a global existential crisis," Biden said.Biden also encouraged G-7 partners to make good on their pledges to COVAX, an initiative by the World Health Organization to improve access to vaccines, even as he reopens the US spigot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-declares-america-is-back-in-welcome-words-to-allies-101613787930924.html

But he also said that any semblance of normalcy may still many months away."We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. That doesn't mean it'll be in all Americans' arms, but enough vaccine will be available," Biden said in a warehouse filled with hundreds of ultra-cold freezers each holding 360,000 vaccine doses."I can't give you a date when this crisis will end," Biden said. But I can tell you: We're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later."Also read| Pfizer, BioNTech say Covid-19 vaccine can withstand warmer temperaturesLess than 15% of the US population has been vaccinated against the highly contagious illness that has claimed nearly 500,000 lives in the United States.Bourla said it is possible to increase supply because of improvements in the manufacturing processes at the plant, better lab testing methods and Biden's use of powers under the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacturing.During the visit to the Michigan plant, Biden challenged the company to deliver even earlier the 300 million doses of the vaccine it has agreed to supply by the end of July, and the company is looking for ways to speed production, Bourla said.To that end, Pfizer said that by the end of the year it will add manufacturing capacity in Michigan, raw material production capacity both in Michigan and Connecticut, and add production lines to put vaccine into vials in Kansas. It has also engaged two US contract manufacturers to help produce the shots.Biden also stressed vaccine production standards during the tour, as he encouraged Americans to get vaccinated. "I just toured where it is being made," he said. "It takes more time to do the check for safety than make that vaccine. That is how fastidious they are."Pfizer has said it will provide the US government with 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May. The company has already provided 40 million doses to the US government, as of Feb. 17, Bourla said.Also read| Covid-19 mutations N440K, E484K, V911I: All you need to knowPfizer is one of the largest employers in the Kalamazoo County area Biden visited. Heavily industrialized Michigan was key to Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Donald Trump.The US drugmaker has not yet met all of its global commitments on vaccine supply. As of Wednesday, it had not yet delivered to the European Union about 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that were due in December, EU officials told Reuters.Pfizer developed the two-dose vaccine with Germany’s BioNTech SE.Moderna Inc, which is also producing Covid-19 vaccine domestically, has agreed to supply the United States with 300 million doses of its own similar two-shot vaccine by the end of July.Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's top medical adviser, said on Tuesday that demand still far outpaces supply at the moment.Jeff Williams, mayor of Arlington, Texas, who met with Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in recent weeks, said his city of 400,000 was ready to vaccinate 40,000 people a day but only had enough supply to administer 3,000 doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-promises-to-double-supply-as-joe-biden-quickens-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101613781845149.html

He did not say who would replace González García as health minister.Gonzalez Garcia had not spoken publicly about the resignation request, but the official said he was no longer part of the government.The scandal erupted when journalist Horacio Verbitsky, whose stories and columns on a website and on the radio are seen as pro-government, said he called the minister to request a vaccination and González García summoned him to the Health Ministry where he received a Sputnik V vaccine shot Friday.Also read| India administers 10 million vaccine doses, second quickest drive in world“I decided to get vaccinated. I started to find out where to do it. I called my old friend Ginés González García, whom I have known long before he was a minister,” Verbitsky told a local radio station. “I went to the ministry and the team of vaccinators was there.”The case is not isolated in Argentina, where in recent days reports have emerged of mayors, legislators, activists and people close to political power receiving the vaccine despite not being in the priority group of doctors, health personnel and the elderly authorized to receive shots.Fernández's government has been harshly criticized for Argentina's slow vaccination operation. So far, the South American country has received about 1.5 million doses, mostly Sputnik V but also AstraZeneca, insufficient to immunize a population of 40 million.Argentina has had 2 million people infected by the coronavirus and 50,857 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentine-health-minister-verbitsky-resigns-amid-covid-19-vaccine-scandal-101613777892185.html

Cisco stated this in a 10-Q filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday (local time).The San Jose, California-based company said the investigation was focused on allegations of a "self-enrichment" scheme involving employees in China who have since left the company. Some of the employees are alleged to have made payments to various third parties, including employees of state-owned enterprises, said Cisco.The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law, prohibits US-linked companies from making payments to foreign public officials to obtain any business advantage. Under the law, public officials can include employees of state-owned enterprises, which are prevalent in China, The Wall Street Journal reported.The company takes such allegations seriously and expects employees to adhere to local and national laws and high ethical standards, said a Cisco spokesman in a statement on Wednesday (local time).He declined to comment further on the investigation but said Cisco didn't expect it to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position.Meanwhile, China's antitrust regulator this year approved a deal negotiated by Cisco to acquire Acacia Communications Inc., a Maynard, Massachusetts-based competitor. The regulator outlined several conditions to the deal, including ones that require Cisco to fulfil existing contracts with Chinese clients and keep commercial terms unchanged, The Wall Street Journal reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cisco-suspects-possible-embezzlement-scheme-in-its-china-operations-101613780455194.html
20-02-2021||World||Algeria frees imprisoned journalist, pro-democracy activists||Algerian authorities freed an imprisoned journalist and more than 30 other pro-democracy activists Friday, in a conciliatory gesture ahead of the second anniversary of their Hirak protest movement.Chanting “Free and Democratic Algeria,” dozens of people gathered at the prison where journalist and activist Khaled Drareni had been held in Kolea, west of the capital Algiers. Standing behind a police cordon, they cheered his release.“I thank all those who have shown solidarity with us in Algeria and abroad, because of our combat as free and independent journalists and the fight of all imprisoned journalists and all prisoners of opinion. We will all be free when all the prisoners are free," Drareni said after his release.Drareni was imprisoned for “inciting an unarmed gathering” and “endangering national unity,” charges linked to his coverage of the protest movement. His arrest drew criticism outside Algeria as a threat to press freedom.Drareni founded the Casbah Tribune news site and worked for French TV channel TV5 Monde, among others, as well as for the international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders.Also read| Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullback“I’m brought to tears, Khaled has just been freed!” said Mahrez Rabia, a friend and radio journalist.The Hirak movement helped push out Algeria’s long-serving former president in 2019 and inspire new efforts to fight corruption.

The Justice Ministry said the activists were all being pardoned for “their activities on social networks or public gatherings.”Tebboune said that up to 56 or 57 activists would be released overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/algeria-frees-imprisoned-journalist-pro-democracy-activists-101613777880261.html
20-02-2021||World||New Mexico legislature moves to preserve abortion rights||A Democrat-led Legislature in New Mexico pushed forward Friday to ensure future access to abortions by voting to repeal a dormant ban on most abortion procedures, marking a defiant counterpoint to efforts in some conservative states.New Mexico lawmakers approved the repeal of the 1969 statute that has gone unenforced since the US Supreme Court upheld the right to an abortion. Left in place, the statute could go back into effect if the high court eventually overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham previously said she would sign the proposal if approved by the Legislature.Abortion bans have been proposed in at least 10 states with Republican-led Legislatures that could test where the current US Supreme Court stands after the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.In South Carolina, a federal judge on Friday suspended a new law approved just two days earlier that would ban most abortions.New Mexico is a heavily Roman Catholic state where Democrats control every statewide office, the state Supreme Court and most congressional seats.Also read| Left in the dark, Texas slips on iceIts 52-year-old abortion statute allows medical termination of a pregnancy with permission of a specialized hospital board only in instances of incest, rape reported to police, grave medical risks to the woman and indications of grave medical defects in the fetus.The law has been dormant since 1973, when the nation’s highest court issued the Roe v. Wade decision, overriding state laws that banned or severely restricted access to abortion procedures.“With uncertainty at the federal level, New Mexico needs to be clear about women’s rights, women’s health care, women’s reproductive choices, abortion and abortion care,” Lujan Grisham said in a video conference with news media.Supporters of New Mexico's restrictions on abortions say a repeal would drive valued medical professionals from New Mexico who are conscientious objectors to abortion procedures.Also read| US extends travel restrictions at land borders with Canada, MexicoThe House deliberations Friday were dominated by pro-abortion rights comments from female legislators who make up a majority of the chamber and the Democratic caucus.“Should the protections of Roe v. Wade fall or be changed, we won’t go back to the days when I was a teenager and women had to take their chances with unsafe conditions and untrained abortion providers,” said Democratic state Rep. Joanne Ferrary of Las Cruces. “Many lost their lives or suffered permanent injury, such as infertility.”The state Senate approved the bill last week with a 27-15 vote. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposition.Five Democratic state senators who joined Republicans to keep the abortion law in place in 2019 were ousted from office last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-mexico-legislature-moves-to-preserve-abortion-rights-101613777871049.html

20-02-2021||World||Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullback||On a day when it finally admitted that it had suffered casualties at Galwan, China on Friday launched a renewed push to blame India both for tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the deadly clash last year, releasing several videos that sought to portray Indian troops as trespassers and aggressors.The move came after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Daily released details for the first time of four soldiers who were killed, and an officer who was injured in the clash at Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020. It is extremely rare for the Chinese military to publicly acknowledge casualties – for instance, it is yet to release official casualty figures for the war with Vietnam in 1979.China’s defence and foreign ministries issued statements that pinned the blame for the death of Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley on India. Twenty Indian soldiers were also killed in that clash, when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods, clubs covered with barbed wire and rocks. These were the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975.Experts questioned the timing of the release of the official statements and videos portraying India as the aggressor, just hours ahead of the 10th round of talks between military commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Saturday. The talks are meant to take forward the disengagement process following the drawdown of forces and armoured vehicles by both sides on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Lake. Some analysts also questioned the veracity of the Chinese numbers.China’s state media featured the videos and emotionally charged articles, urging citizens to remember the “martyrs” and recounting how four PLA soldiers sacrificed their lives while defending the western borders. The four soldiers and PLA regimental commander Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the clash, received military honours, the state media announced, citing the Central Military Commission (CMC).The title of “border-defending hero” was posthumously conferred on battalion commander Chen Hongjun, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran posthumously received a “first-class merit”. Qi Fabao received the title of “hero regiment commander for defending the border”.“They all died in a clash with trespassing foreign military personnel wielding steel tubes, cudgels and stones last June,” official Xinhua news agency reported, citing PLA Daily. The defence ministry said the families of all five soldiers would be well looked after.The videos, which purportedly portrayed the build-up to the Galwan Valley clash, identified the Indian soldiers only as “foreign” troops and the accompanying commentary painted them as trespassers – an allegation consistently denied by India.There were several versions of the videos, ranging in length from a little more than a minute to eight minutes, that were released by outlets such as national broadcaster CCTV’s English channel CGTN and the nationalistic tabloid Global Times. The videos, which appear to be edited, show troops from the two sides negotiating and jostling with each other. The background comprises ravines, a flowing river and steep cliffs. It is believed that China’s communication offensive may be aimed at shaping the narrative for its domestic constituency in the wake of the ongoing disengagement in Ladakh.There was no official response to China’s moves from Indian officials. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side has opted to focus on the military commanders’ talks on Saturday instead of being sidetracked by controversial allegations.“Our focus is on the talks to take forward the disengagement process. Besides, the Indian side’s position on the situation has been amply conveyed by the Indian Army’s Northern Commander in recent interviews,” one of the people cited above said, referring to Lt Gen YK Joshi’s interaction with the Indian media.The people and experts also pointed out that the articles in the PLA Daily and Global Times were about Chinese soldiers who were decorated for the role in the Galwan Valley clash and didn’t amount to a full listing of Chinese casualties.Global Times editor Hu Xijin wrote that Wang Zhuoran, the youngest of the four dead soldiers, was only 19 years old, while Chen Xiangrong and Xiao Siyuan were both 24.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while blaming India for the clash, contended the PLA Daily’s report had put the truth out in the open. “The Galwan (Valley) incident is so sad and the responsibility, as the Indian side has acknowledged, is with the Indian side. But due to the irresponsible rumours spread by the Indian media, they have misled public opinion, so the unveiling of the true story will help people to better know the whole story,” Hua told a regular news briefing.“This will be a way to pay tribute to our heroes and martyrs and also will help the Indian side to draw lessons from it and better work with China to uphold peace and stability in the border region and properly resolve the border issue,” she said.Hua added: “We hope the border issue will be put in the proper place in our bilateral relations.”Asked why China took more than eight months to release casualty statistics, Hua said the “truth” was long awaited and it was “necessary for people to know the true story”. Noting that one of the dead soldiers would become a father four months after his death and another was getting ready for marriage, she said: “I think our peace today is hard to come by.”Defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang, in a statement published on China’s social media, also blamed India for the clash. Ren contended the Indian Army illegally crossed the LAC, took the lead in provocation, and attacked Chinese negotiators, deliberately creating conflict in Galwan Valley and causing casualties on both sides.Ren added China’s position on resolving the border problem has been clear, consistent, and sincere. China, he said, is committed to resolve disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and is always ready to maintain stability in relations between the two militaries.The commentary in the Chinese videos too alleged that “foreign troops” had trespassed into Chinese territory since April last year and built bridges and roads, while conducting reconnaissance missions. The commentary further alleges the foreign troops altered the status quo and escalated the dispute on the LAC.The videos alleged the “foreign troops” assaulted Chinese soldiers, who were outnumbered. The commentary also alleged the “foreign troops were utterly defeated”. India has consistently denied allegations of acting in a provocative manner since the standoff began in May last year and said the PLA trespassed across the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-on-diplomatic-charge-amid-pullback-101613765782579.html
