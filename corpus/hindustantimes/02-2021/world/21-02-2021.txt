It is moving northwestward at 25 km per hour, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 km per hour with gusts of up to 80 km per hour, the bureau said."(Dujuan) is forecast to maintain its strength in the next 12 hours. However, the likelihood of weakening into a tropical depression before it makes landfall is not yet ruled out," the weather bureau added, warning of heavy rains and rough seas."Under these conditions, isolated to scattered flooding (including flash floods) and rain-induced landslides are likely during heavy or prolonged rainfall especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards as identified in hazard maps," the bureau said.Dujuan will affect several provinces in the southern Luzon island, the central Philippines, and the Mindanao region in the southern part of the country, the bureau warned.Typhoons and tropical storms regularly batter the Philippines from June through December, claiming hundreds of lives and cause billions of dollars in damages.Located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is among the most disaster-prone countries, including active volcanoes, frequent earthquakes, and an average of 20 typhoons a year, causing floods and landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-51-000-people-evacuated-in-southern-philippines-as-storm-approaches-101613929096429.html

The biggest plant will be located in Karbala province, with a designed capacity of 300 megawatts. The other plants will be in the provinces of Babel, Muthanna and Wasit, it said.Iraq, the second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is seeking to generate 20% of its total power production capacity from renewable sources to help ease the pressure on the country’s hydrocarbon-powered electricity plants. Iraqis continue to experience several hours of power outages every day.Iraq is in discussions with international companies such as Total SA and some Norwegian developers to build more renewable energy projects in the country, Abdul Jabbar said. Total has expressed readiness to work on renewable energy projects in Iraq, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-plans-to-build-10-gigawatts-of-solar-projects-over-10-years-101613921407485.html

We have lost four infected people," Eugene Syalita, the provincial health minister in North Kivu province in the DRC's east, told AFP.Syalita said one person died Friday and another on Saturday, while the two others died in early February.Two patients are receiving care at an Ebola treatment centre in Katwa near the major city of Butembo, he added.Syalita complained that the region's residents were not taking the new outbreak seriously enough."Some families categorically refuse to have their homes disinfected or to hold dignified and safe funerals," the doctor said."People have not yet understood that Ebola has reappeared. Everything is not yet clear for them."A vaccination drive was launched last Monday, but as with past outbreaks, people in the region doubt the existence of Ebola and reject measures aimed at checking its spread, including not to touch sick people and not to wash the dead.The 10th epidemic, which was declared on August 1, 2018, was finally eradicated on June 25 last year after being exacerbated by ongoing armed conflicts and resistance to anti-Ebola measures.With more than 2,200 deaths recorded, it is considered the most serious in the history of Ebola in the DRC since the scourge fist appeared in 1976, named after a river in the former Belgian colony, which was known as Zaire at the time.An 11th outbreak of the virus, which is believed to reside in bats, was declared over in November after claiming 55 lives in the northwestern province of Equateur.- Outbreak in Guinea, too -Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.Funeral practices often include washing, touching and kissing bodies that are still capable of transmitting Ebola, and may have particularly high levels of the live virus in excretions.The virus has also resurfaced in Guinea, where it has already killed five people in the first outbreak in West Africa since a 2013-16 epidemic that left more than 11,300 people dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.The United States last week said it would work with the affected governments and the World Health Organization over the outbreaks."The world cannot afford to turn the other way. We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-toll-hits-4-in-dr-congo-as-people-resist-health-measures-101613917890488.html
21-02-2021||World||Pakistan unlikely to exit ‘grey list’ as FATF meets to decide its fate: Report||Pakistan is unlikely to exit the 'grey list’ of the FATF as some European countries have taken the stand that Islamabad has not fully implemented all the points of a plan of action set by it, a media report said on Sunday, on the eve of the plenary meeting of the global watchdog for money laundering and terror financing.The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic.The virtual FATF plenary will be held in Paris from February 22 to 25 to consider cases of various countries on the grey list, including Pakistan, and a decision will be made at the conclusion of the meetings, Dawn newspaper reported.In the last plenary held in October 2020, the FATF concluded that Pakistan will continue in its “grey list” till February 2021 as it has failed to fulfil six out of 27 obligations of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that include failure to take action against two of India's most wanted terrorists – Jaish-e Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Jamaat-ud-Dawah head Hafiz Saeed.Azhar and Saeed are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in numerous terrorist acts, including 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir last year.An official source close to these developments told the paper on Saturday that Pakistan had complied with the six recommendations and also submitted details to the FATF secretariat.The members would now evaluate Pakistan’s responses during the meeting, the source said, adding that the decision would be taken after a consensus among the members.The paper, quoting a journalist covering the FATF said that some European countries, especially the host France, had recommended to the FATF to continue to keep Pakistan on the grey list and had taken the position that not all points had been fully implemented by Islamabad.Other European countries are also supporting France, he said.France was not happy with the recent response of Islamabad on the cartoon issue, he said.Pakistan has not even posted a regular ambassador in Paris, he said, adding that diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries were not up to the mark.The US has also expressed concern over the acquittal the accused in American journalist Daniel Pearl’s kidnapping and murder case.It is feared that the US may also lobby for continuation of Islamabad on the grey list at least until June this year.Pakistan’s Supreme Court last month ordered release of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides in the 2002 Pearl murder case, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice.".An official, who is not willing to be quoted, told the paper that Pakistan had submitted a compliance report to the FATF.“We can’t say what will be their response to it; let’s wait for the day,” he said.The official said Pakistan had already done major legislation regarding punishment of terror financing, which was around one year in the old legislation.In October 2020, Minister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar, who is the government’s point man on the FATF, announced that Pakistan had made progress across all action plan items and had now largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items.When the minister was approached for comments on the implementation status of the remaining six recommendations, he said he would make no comment until the plenary was over.“There is a strict confidentiality rule,” he said.With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey' list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the debt-ridden nation which is in a precarious financial situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unlikely-to-exit-grey-list-as-fatf-meets-to-decide-its-fate-report-101613920683072.html

Afghan police officials says that an investigation were underway.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government blaming the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled. It’s been over a month since the sides last met to discuss how to proceed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roadside-bombs-in-afghanistan-kill-3-wound-20-says-report-101613920108129.html

That level will probably be reached Sunday or Monday.“It’s something that is stunning when you look at the numbers, almost unbelievable, but it’s true,” Fauci said. “This is a devastating pandemic, and it’s historic. People will be talking about this decades and decades and decades from now.”On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Fauci said the U.S. could be approaching normality toward the fall or winter of this year.Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen considerably since peaking in early January. The pace of vaccinations is on the rise, with more than 60 million doses given so far, according to a state-by-state tally.Close to 13% of of the U.S. population has had at least the first of two doses, although the rollout has been criticized for leaving much of the minority population behind.At the current pace it would take an estimated nine months to cover 75% of Americans with a two-dose vaccine. But a one-dose version, from Johnson & Johnson, could be approved in the U.S. within weeks, which may start to break the logjam.Discussing the recent sharp decline in new Covid cases in the U.S., Fauci said it was “the natural peaking and coming down.”“I don’t think we’ve vaccinated enough people yet to get the herd immunity,” he said. “What I don’t and none of my colleagues want to see, is when you look at that slope to come down and to say, ‘Wow, we’re out of the woods now. We’re in good shape.’”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-weather-delays-to-covid-19-vaccinations-to-be-quickly-reversed-101613919746915.html

21-02-2021||World||Washington taps pastors to overcome racial divide on Covid-19 vaccine||Stately and deliberate, with a distinctive white streak in his black hair, the Rev. Wallace Charles Smith started his Valentine's Day sermon at Shiloh Baptist Church by talking about love and vaccinations.“That's what love's all about. When you get a vaccination, you are saying to everyone around you that you love them enough that you don't want any hurt, harm or danger to befall them,” he said. “In the spirit of love, keep at it until you get your vaccination. That’s the only thing that’s going to erase this terrible scourge."The church was empty except for a camera crew and a tiny choir. Thanks to Covid-19, Smith’s Sunday sermons are now virtual affairs.Still, health officials in the nation's capital are hoping that Smith and other Black religious leaders will serve as community influencers to overcome what officials say is a persistent vaccine reluctance in the Black community. Smith and several other local ministers recently received their first vaccine shots.Black residents make up a little under half of Washington’s population, but constitute nearly three-fourths of the city's Covid-19 deaths. The District of Columbia is now offering vaccinations to residents over age 65, but numbers show that seniors in the poorest and blackest parts of Washington are lagging behind.Officials partially blame historic distrust of the medical establishment, especially among Black seniors, who vividly remember medical exploitation horrors such as the Tuskegee syphilis study, where hundreds of impoverished rural Black men suffered syphilis effects with minimal treatment for decades as part of the medical study.“We know we need to focus on Black and brown communities,” Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the director of the district's health department, said earlier this month. "Let’s not give up on communities of color being interested in the vaccine. Let’s continue to answer their questions. Let’s continue to be very thoughtful in how we answer their questions.”The D.C. government is giving priority for vaccine registration to predominantly Black ZIP codes and running public information campaigns, including the clergy vaccinations. The latest numbers show the gap is narrowing, but the southeastern core of the city's Black community is still getting vaccinated at the slowest rate.“There's distrust in our community. We can't ignore that,” said Rev. James Coleman of All Nations Baptist, who was vaccinated along with Smith. “The church, and particularly the Black church, is essential. ... That's what pastors do.”Coleman said he has worked to create a vaccine-positive atmosphere among the seniors in his church. Before a recent Sunday morning sermon, conducted via audio conference call , elderly parishioners in Coleman's church updated one another on their progress and congratulated those who had been vaccinated.“There was some nervousness to overcome at first,” Coleman said. "People outside the Black community sometimes can't relate to that sensitivity.”Health departments nationwide are dealing with the same challenges, and other jurisdictions also are calling on religious leaders to help dispel vaccine fears.“Our role as clergy and as faith-based leaders is to be optimistic and hopeful. We say to our people that these vaccines are the gift of life. We believe in the science,” said Rev. HB Holmes Jr. of Bethel Missionary Church in Tallahassee, Florida.Holmes has gotten vaccinated, and his church has hosted vaccination drives.“We knew that because of hesitation and reluctance that we needed trusted voices. So we brought together persons of great influence in Black and brown communities, particularly from our community, to say, you know, I’m going to take the vaccine and roll up our sleeves and do that publicly." he said.In Washington, the Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church has been designated a “faith-based vaccination partner,” with a portable vaccination trailer set up in the church's parking lot twice a week. The vaccinations have gone smoothly. But showing that vaccine skepticism transcends racial lines, a white D.C. resident, Kathy Boylan, crossed the city on a recent icy day to stand on the sidewalk outside the church with a sign saying “Danger: Covid Vaccine Say No!”The city's community influencer campaign is targeting more than just religious leaders.Prominent Black Washington figures such as Vice President Kamala Harris, local radio host Kojo Nnamdi and Doug Williams, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback for the Washington football team, have all received their injections at southeast Washington's United Medical Center and used their public platforms to encourage others to follow suit.“I honestly believe that more people want to take it than don’t,” said hospital official Toya Carmichael, who said several people have asked for the same nurse that vaccinated Harris.But some D.C. officials are insisting that simple cultural reluctance, while real, doesn't fully explain Washington's racial vaccination lag. Interviews with Black residents revealed a common set of complaints: seniors failing to navigate the online registration system or sitting on hold only to be informed that all appointments had been filled.Lisa Chapman had to overcome both personal reluctance and logistical obstacles in order to schedule vaccinations for her parents, Walter Coates, 82, and Rosa Coates, 80.First she had to persuade them.“I just wasn’t certain. I wanted to wait and see for a while,” said Rosa Coates. ”But (Lisa) convinced me. She just kept talking to me about it.”Then it took waiting on hold for more than 90 minutes, leaving the phone on speaker and then leaping back on when a human answered.“That's a really long time to wait. I think a lot of people do want to get it. They just can't get through,” Chapman said.D.C. Council Member Kenyan McDuffie laid part of the problem at the feet of the government. In an interview, McDuffie, who represents southeastern Ward 5, called the city's vaccine rollout “overwhelmingly inequitable” and said talk of vaccine reluctance was obscuring a reality of vaccine frustration, made worse by the digital divide.“I think there is a larger percentage of people who want to receive the vaccine and have had challenges with scheduling appointments and being able to receive the vaccine,” he said. "My fear is that some of those residents have simply given up."Smith, in his Valentine's Day sermon, spoke not just of the fear but also the logistical hassles of a confusing process."I know many of you have tried to get the vaccine, but there have been so many challenges ... waiting for hours, only to find that what you thought was available is not there,” he said.Given the community reluctance, city health officials say they cannot afford to frustrate or discourage those seeking vaccination.Nesbitt said a new registration model would go into effect in March that would bring a further “equity lens” to the vaccination process. Also, officials have organized teams of “senior vaccine buddies” to go to the homes of seniors and help them get through the online process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-taps-pastors-to-overcome-racial-divide-on-covid-19-vaccine-101613914615009.html
21-02-2021||World||WHO’s draft recommendation on Wuhan Covid-19 probe triggers disbelief: Report||The two key lines of inquiry recommended in the World Health Organisation’s preliminary report on the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused surprise and disbelief among independent experts, according to a CNN report. A team of experts sent by the UN health agency returned from China’s Wuhan earlier this month after a four-week trip to investigate the origin of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The WHO panel is set to recommend further contact tracing of the first known Covid-19 patient, also known as “patient zero”, and an immediate investigation into the supply chain of the Huanan seafood market. Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team that visited Wuhan, reportedly said that the first known patient had no connection to the Huanan seafood market, a place initially believed to be connected to the early virus outbreak.Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told CNN it was implausible that such rudimentary investigative work wasn’t already done by Chinese scientists while looking for the origin of the virus months ago. "It's not realistic, given they have world-class scientists there, and the technology invested in over the last 20 years. They are sophisticated, they understand transmission pathways, and have been working on them for years," Miller was quoted by the US media network as saying.The team also discovered several signs of a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than it was reported earlier. WHO expert Peter Ben Embarek, who led the team in Wuhan, had earlier said in an interview that the investigators are seeking access to hundreds of thousands of blood samples from the Chinese city that Beijing has not allowed them to examine.The Chinese scientists presented the visiting WHO team with 174 Covid-19 cases detected from in and around Wuhan in December 2019, which, according to Embarek, suggested the virus could have infected more than 1,000 people in the Chinese city in that month, given the “vast majority are mild cases” that are not noticed by doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whos-draft-recommendation-on-wuhan-covid-19-probe-triggers-disbelief-report-101613914187310.html

21-02-2021||World||Texas freeze led to release of tons of air pollutants as refineries shut||The largest U.S. oil refiners released tons of air pollutants into the skies over Texas this week, according to figures provided to the state, as one environmental crisis triggered another.Refiners and petrochemical plants along the US Gulf Coast scrambled to shut production as an arctic air mass spread into a region unused to frigid temperatures.The extreme cold, which killed at least two dozen people in Texas and knocked out power to more than 4 million at its peak, also hit natural gas and electric generation, cutting supplies needed to run the plants.Shutdowns led to the refineries flaring, or burning and releasing gases, to prevent damage to their processing units. That flaring darkened the skies in eastern Texas with smoke visible for miles."These emissions can dwarf the usual emissions of the refineries by orders of magnitude," said Jane Williams, chair of the Sierra Club's National Clean Air Team.She said U.S. regulators must change policies that allow "these massive emissions to occur with impunity."TOP POLLUTERSThe five largest refiners emitted nearly 337,000 pounds of pollutants, including benzene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, according to preliminary data supplied to the Texas Commission on Environment Quality (TCEQ).Valero Energy said in a filing with the TCEQ that it released 78,000 pounds over 24 hours beginning Feb. 15 from its Port Arthur refinery, citing the frigid cold and interruptions in utility services.The 118,100 pounds of emissions from Motiva's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery between Feb. 15 and Feb. 18 were more than three times the excess emissions that it declared to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the whole of 2019.Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay Refinery released 14,255 pounds over less than five hours on Feb. 15, equivalent to about 10% of its total releases above permitted levels in 2019.Exxon Mobil said its Baytown Olefins Plant emitted nearly one ton of benzene and 68,000 tons of carbon monoxide, citing in its disclosure the halting of "multiple process units and safe utilization of the flare system."Exxon blamed the shutdown of two Texas refineries on the freezing weather and loss of natural gas supplies. A spokesman said its petrochemical plants in Texas and Louisiana have supplied 560 megawatts to local communities, helping power about 300,000 homes.Valero did not have an immediate comment. Motiva and Marathon did not respond to requests for comment.Final figures on pollution releases are due to be submitted to the state in two weeks.'NO SAFE AMOUNT'The flaring continued through the week as refiners kept plants out of service."We had six or seven flares going at one time," Hilton Kelly, who lives in Port Arthur, home to refineries operated by Motiva, Valero and Total SE, said on Friday. "It's still happening now."Sharon Wilson, a researcher at advocacy group Earthworks, said the releases are alarming, in part because "there is no safe amount of benzene for human exposure."State data showing oil and gas producers were flaring methane this week "is just making things worse, and it could have been prevented" by winterizing facilities, she said.Texas oil and gas companies filed 174 notices of pollution releases above permitted levels between Feb. 11 and Feb. 18, four times the number the prior week, according to TCEQ data.Total pollution at Houston-area facilities during the cold snap totaled approximately 703,000 pounds, about 3% of the total pollution over permitted amounts for all of 2019 and almost 10% of 2018's releases, according to TCEQ data analyzed by advocacy group Environment Texas.(Reporting by Laura Sanicola in New York and Erwin Seba in Houston; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Daniel Wallis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-freeze-led-to-release-of-tons-of-air-pollutants-as-refineries-shut-101613913606140.html

Israel's military said it was deploying thousands of soldiers to help with the effort. Authorities warned everyone else to keep their distance until further notice.Environmental groups called it an disaster. Attesting to the cost to wildlife, they posted pictures of tar-covered turtles.The event began last week during a winter storm, which made it harder to see the tar approaching and deal with it at sea, Israeli officials said.Together with European agencies, Israel was looking as a possible source at a Feb. 11 oil spill from a ship passing about 50 km (21 miles) from shore. Satellite images and modelling of wave movements were helping to narrow the search.Nine ships that were in the area at the time are being looked at, said Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel."There is a more than reasonable chance that we will be able to locate the specific ship," she told Ynet TV.If found, Israel could take legal action. One course would be to sue insurance companies for compensation to help deal with the ecological fallout, she said, which could cost tens of millions of shekels.Late last week a 17-metre-long (55ft) fin whale was found washed up on a beach in southern Israel. The Nature and Parks Authority said on Sunday that an autopsy had found oil-based material in the whale's body, with further tests pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-beaches-blackened-by-tar-after-offshore-oil-spill-101613913325655.html
21-02-2021||World||Huge crowds in Myanmar undeterred by worst day of violence||Huge crowds marched in Myanmar on Sunday to denounce a Feb. 1 military coup in a show of defiance after the bloodiest episode of the campaign for democracy the previous day, when security forces fired on protesters, killing two.The military has been unable to quell the demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes against the coup and the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others, even with a promise of new elections and stern warnings against dissent.Tens of thousands of people massed peacefully in the second city of Mandalay, where Saturday's killings took place, witnesses said."They aimed at the heads of unarmed civilians. They aimed at our future," a young protester told the crowd.Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun has not responded to attempts by Reuters to contact him by telephone for comment.He told a news conference on Tuesday the army's actions were within the constitution and supported by most people, and he blamed protesters for instigating violence.In the main city of Yangon, thousands of mostly young people gathered at different sites to chant slogans and sing."Us young people have our dreams but this military coup has created so many obstacles," said Ko Pay in Yangon. "That's why we come out to the front of the protests."In Myitkyina in the north, people laid flowers for the dead protesters. Big crowds marched in the central towns of Monywa and Bagan, in Dawei and Myeik in the south, Myawaddy in the east and Lashio in the northeast, posted pictures showed.At the tourist spot of Inle Lake, people including Buddhist monks took to a flotilla of boats holding aloft portraits of Suu Kyi and signs saying "military coup - end".The more than two weeks of protests had been largely peaceful until Saturday, unlike previous episodes of opposition during nearly half a century of direct military rule to 2011.The violence looked unlikely to end the agitation."The number of people will increase ... We won't stop," protester Yin Nyein Hmway said in Yangon.'AGGRESSIVE PROTESTERS'The trouble in Mandalay began with confrontations between the security forces and striking shipyard workers.Video clips on social media showed members of the security forces firing at protesters and witnesses said they found the spent cartridges of live rounds.U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Tom Andrews said he was horrified by the deaths of the two, one of them a teenaged boy."From water cannons to rubber bullets to tear gas and now hardened troops firing point blank at peaceful protesters. This madness must end, now," he said on Twitter.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the strikers sabotaged boats at the city's river port and attacked police with sticks, knives and catapults. Eight policemen and several soldiers were injured, it said."Some of the aggressive protesters were also injured due to the security measures conducted by the security force in accordance with the law," the newspaper said without mentioning the deaths.Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) condemned the violence by security forces in Mandalay as a crime against humanity.A young woman protester, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, became the first death among the demonstrators on Friday. She was shot in the head on Feb. 9 in the capital Naypyitaw.Hundreds of people attended her funeral on Sunday.Military media said the bullet that killed her did not come from any gun used by police and so must have been fired by an "external weapon".The army says one policeman has died of injuries sustained in a protest.'COORDINATING HARM'The army seized power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that the NLD swept, detaining Suu Kyi and others. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints.Facebook deleted the military's main page for repeated violations of its standards "prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm" and Western countries that condemned the coup decried the violence.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "deeply concerned".France, Singapore, Britain and Germany also condemned the violence while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said lethal force was unacceptable.The United States, Britain and others have announced limited sanctions, focusing on military leaders, but the generals have long shrugged off foreign pressure.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.A rights group said 569 people have been detained in connection with the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-crowds-in-myanmar-undeterred-by-worst-day-of-violence-101613913313865.html
21-02-2021||World||UK accelerates vaccine rollout as end of lockdown in sight||The UK government on Sunday vowed to offer a first coronavirus vaccine dose to every adult by the end of July, as it readied to announce a gradual easing of its third lockdown in England.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will outline the lockdown review in parliament on Monday, said the faster inoculation campaign would seek to offer a first dose to everyone aged over 50 by mid-April.The previous targets in the world-first campaign were to inoculate over 50s by May, and all adults by September."We will now aim to offer a jab to every adult by the end of July, helping us protect the most vulnerable sooner, and take further steps to ease some of the restrictions," Johnson said, while stressing the exit would be "cautious and phased".Britain, one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 120,000 deaths, was also the first nation to begin a mass vaccination campaign, in December.More than 17 million people have now received at least a first dose -- one-third of the UK population.But with infection rates and hospitalisations soaring after an easing of restrictions over Christmas, the government imposed a third lockdown at the start of January, closing schools, non-essential businesses and hospitality venues across England.Case numbers are falling again and early evidence suggests the vaccinations are helping to reduce serious illness, while political pressure is building on the government to return to normality.Johnson was meeting with senior ministers on Sunday to finalise his House of Commons statement, which is expected to endorse the reopening of English schools on March 8 -- although teaching unions say allowing all pupils to return on the same day is "reckless".- 'Last lockdown' -Johnson is expected to lay out a gradual easing more widely after March 8, including for outdoor activities. But the full reopening of retail and pubs, and attendance at sporting events, will be delayed until later."All of us understandably want to go back to normal, but it is right to be cautious," Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News on Sunday, noting that nearly 20,000 people remain in hospital with Covid.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour party, said he disagreed with the teaching unions' opposition but urged the government to widen extra-hours access so that children can catch up ahead of summer exams."We all want this to be the last lockdown so we've got to come out of it in a measured way, but make sure we are not back where we started in a number of weeks or months," he added on Sky News.The devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, which administer their own health policy, are letting some younger pupils return to school this week. In Northern Ireland, the administration is resuming younger classes on March 8 but has extended its overall lockdown to April 1.- 'Risk of resurgence' -John Edmunds, an epidemiologist and government advisor from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: "The vast majority of us are still not immune."Easing up too quickly will increase pressure, cases will increase again. We're not through this yet."Edmunds also called for the acceleration of vaccine trials on children, stressing "there is significant risk of a resurgence" until the entire population is inoculated, not just adults.The government and expert advisors are also watching carefully for the emergence of new Covid variants, such as ones first detected in Brazil and South Africa, which may be more resistant to vaccines.Hancock's health ministry said Sunday it was introducing mass testing in an area of Essex, east of London, after a single case of the South Africa variant was confirmed there.The UK's predominant strain is one that emerged in the southeast county of Kent last September and then spread rapidly, after the first wave of Covid had waned.jit/tgb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-accelerates-vaccine-rollout-as-end-of-lockdown-in-sight-101613913096224.html
21-02-2021||World||Prince Charles visits father Prince Philip in London hospital||Britain’s Prince Charles was driven to the London hospital where his father, Prince Philip, was admitted for “precautionary” reasons earlier in the week and spent half an hour by his bedside.Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has been at the King Edward VII's hospital since Tuesday and according to the BBC, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II is likely to remain there into next week.A sombre-looking Charles, 72, was seen entering the hospital wearing a facemask on Saturday and his Clarence House office later said that the Prince of Wales was then driven back to his Highgrove residence in Gloucestershire, south-west England.The exact reason for Prince Philip’s admission has not been disclosed but his stay is not related to coronavirus.He and the Queen had received their first dose of a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 last month.Under England's current coronavirus lockdown rules, visiting someone in a hospital is considered a "reasonable excuse" to leave home, although visits are being allowed on a case by case basis by most hospitals.The Queen, 94, remains at Windsor Castle and performed her first face-to-face event of the year on Thursday, when she knighted a royal aide during a private socially-distanced ceremony at her south-east England residence in Berkshire.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had sent his best wishes to the royal, with a Downing Street spokesperson saying: “The Prime Minister sends his best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh as he undergoes a few days of rest in hospital.”The Queen and her husband have been spending the recent lockdown in England at Windsor Castle with a small household staff, nicknamed “HMS Bubble”.The Duke, who turns 100 in June, was admitted to the same London hospital as a "precautionary measure" for treatment for a "pre-existing condition" in December 2019. He spent four nights in hospital at the time.In November 2020, the Queen and Prince Philip marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph of themselves opening a card made for them by their great grandchildren, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – the children of Prince William and Kate Middleton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-charles-visits-father-prince-philip-in-london-hospital-101613912828196.html
21-02-2021||World||French city of Nice asks tourists to stay away amid Covid-19 surge||(Adds government spokesman)PARIS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The mayor of Nice in southern France called on Sunday for a weekend lockdown in the area to reduce the flow of tourists as it battles a sharp spike in coronavirus infections to triple the national rate.The Nice area has France's highest Covid-19 infection rate, with 740 new cases per week per 100,000 residents, according to Covidtracker.fr."We need strong measures that go beyond the nationwide 6 p.m. curfew, either tighter curfew, or a partial and time-specific lockdown. A weekend lockdown would make sense," Mayor Christian Estrosi said on franceinfo radio.Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Saturday the government would decide this weekend on tightening virus control measures in the Mediterranean city.Before ordering a second national lockdown in November, the government imposed curfews some cities and closed restaurants in Marseille, but it has generally refrained from regional measures due to protest from local politicians and businesses."We do not rule out local lockdowns," government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on LCI television.He added that the trend in new cases was not good in recent days and that there was no case for loosening curfew."The weather is nice, everybody rushes to come here. A weekend lockdown would put a stop to that, without halting economic activity in the city," Estrosi said.Estrosi said infection rates had leapt due to the massive inflow of tourists over the Christmas holiday. International flights to the city had jumped from 20 a day before Christmas to 120 over the holiday - all this without people having virus tests in their country of origin or on arrival."We will be happy to receive lots of tourists this summer, once we win this battle, but it is better to have a period while we say 'do not come here, this is not the moment'. Protecting the people of Nice is my priority," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-city-of-nice-asks-tourists-to-stay-away-amid-covid-19-surge-101613912824826.html

21-02-2021||World||Still no details from Tanzania on its Covid-19 response: WHO chief||The head of the World Health Organization urged Tanzania on Sunday to share information on its measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, saying the authorities there had repeatedly ignored his requests.President John Magufuli's sceptical approach towards Covid-19 has caused alarm among WHO officials. A government spokesman told Reuters on Feb.12 that Tanzania had "controlled" the outbreak, but it stopped reporting new coronavirus infections and deaths in May last year. At the time it had registered 509 cases and 21 deaths.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday that Tanzanians testing positive for Covid-19 abroad underscored "the need for Tanzania to take robust action both to safeguard their own people and protect populations in these countries and beyond."Tedros also repeated a call he made with Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa head, in late January for Tanzania to bolster public health measures against Covid-19 and prepare to distribute vaccines.He added that since then he had spoken with several authorities there to no avail."This situation remains very concerning. I renew my call for Tanzania to start reporting Covid-19 cases and share data," Tedros said in a statement on WHO's website.Tanzania government spokesman Hassan Abbasi did not respond to a Reuters message seeking comment on Tedros' remarks.In a statement later on Sunday, Magufuli's office said the president wanted Tanzanians to follow measures to protect themselves against coronavirus. However, it also said that:"Magufuli wants Tanzanians to ... trust and put God first, given that wearing masks, social distancing and lockdowns have been seen to be insufficient as countries that implemented them have lost thousands compared to Tanzania."Magufuli attended a funeral service on Friday for a senior official in his office whose cause of death was not made public, and declared three days of national prayer.On Sunday, Magufuli said Tanzanians should wear only use locally-made face masks, saying foreign-made ones may be unsafe.On Monday, Oman's health minister said his country was considering suspending flights from Tanzania, after 18% of travellers arriving from Tanzania tested positive for Covid-19.Thailand reported on Monday its first case of the highly contagious Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa, in a Thai man who arrived from Tanzania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-no-details-from-tanzania-on-its-covid-19-response-who-chief-101613906715419.html

The second shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) under the name Covishield, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital city of Kathmandu on Sunday afternoon.Earlier, India had provided one million doses of the Covishield vaccine as ‘gift’ (free of cost) to the Himalayan nation in January after which Nepal had kicked off its vaccination drive on January 27 with doses being administered to the medical and frontline workers on a priority basis. The campaign aims to eventually inoculate 72 per cent of its total population of over 29 million.

I have suffered great financial loss," said Ali Fatullah, a fruit seller in the town of Bekasi on the outskirts of Jakarta.He said furniture and electronic devices were damaged by the water.Kurnianto said some 1,700 people remained in shelters, though many residents had started returning to their homes.Floodwaters had hit 200 neighbourhoods in the region, and 40 were still under at least one foot of water on Sunday.Jakarta saw some of its deadliest floods in years in January last year after downpours that also triggered landslides.At least 67 people in the capital and nearby cities were killed in that disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-floods-kill-five-in-indonesia-s-capital-jakarta-says-report-101613905024641.html
21-02-2021||World||Israel's Covid-19 vaccination pass opens fast track to normal life||Israel reopened swathes of its economy including malls and leisure facilities on Sunday, with the government saying the start of a return to routine was enabled by Covid-19 vaccines administered to almost half the population.Shops were open to all. But access to gyms, hotels and theatres was limited to people with a "Green Pass": those who have had both doses of the vaccine more than a week prior, or recovered from the disease with presumed immunity.Pass-holders could prove their status by presenting a vaccination certificate or downloading a Health Ministry app linked to their medical files.Coming exactly a year after Israel's first documented coronavirus case, Sunday's easing of curbs was part of a government plan to open the economy more widely next month, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up for reelection."We are the first country in the world that is reviving itself thanks to the millions of vaccines we brought in," he tweeted. "Vaccinated? Get the Green Pass and get back to life."Mask-wearing and social-distancing were still in force. Dancing was barred at banquet halls. Synagogues, mosques or churches were required to halve their normal congregation sizes.Elementary schoolchildren and pupils in the last two years of high school resumed classes in towns with contagion rates under control. Middle-school pupils were still home-learning, however, prompting some to stage a sit-down protest in a mall."I haven't been in school in a year," said 14-year-old demonstrator Rotem Bachar. "How does it make sense to open malls up to crowds, while we can't attend class if even they are capped at 15 to 20 pupils and have other precautions?"Israel has administered at least one dose of the Pfizer Inc vaccine to more than 46% of its 9 million population, the Health Ministry says. The ministry said on Saturday that the risk of illness from Covid-19 dropped 95.8% among people who received both shots.Israel has logged more than 740,000 cases and 5,500 deaths from Covid-19, drawing criticism of Netanyahu's sometimes patchy enforcement of three national lockdowns. The government has pledged that there will not be a fourth.But Nachman Ash, a physician in charge of the country's pandemic response, told Army Radio that another lockdown "is still possible ... Half of the population is still not immune."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-covid-19-vaccination-pass-opens-fast-track-to-normal-life-101613905584676.html
21-02-2021||World||Israel buys Covid-19 vaccines for Syria to secure release of prisoner: Reports||Israel paid Russia $1.2 million to provide the Syrian government with coronavirus vaccine doses as part of a deal that secured the release of an Israeli woman held captive in Damascus, according to Israeli media reports.The terms of the clandestine trade-off orchestrated by Moscow between the two enemy nations remained murky. But the fact that Israel is providing vaccines to Syria — an enemy country hosting hostile Iranian forces — has drawn criticism at home. It has also drawn attention to Israel’s refusal to provide significant quantities to millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Speaking at a news conference Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “not one Israeli vaccine” was involved in the deal. But he did not address the issue of whether Israel paid for Russian vaccines, and he said Russia insisted on keeping details of the swap secret.The Prime Minister’s Office has declined further comment.Israel announced Friday it had reached a Russian-mediated deal to bring home a young woman who had crossed the border into neighboring Syria earlier this month. In exchange, Israel said it had released two Syrian shepherds who had entered Israeli territory.As part of the prisoner swap mediated by Moscow, Israel paid Russia to supply Syria with an undisclosed number of doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, according to Israeli media reports. The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled the development of Sputnik V, said in November it will cost less than $10 per dose on international markets.In turn, Syria released an Israeli citizen who entered the country illegally and Israel returned two Syrian shepherds that had entered the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, according to the reports.The Syrian state news agency has denied the existence of such a deal.The released Israeli woman returned to Israel via Moscow and was questioned by Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency. The 25-year-old woman hails from the predominantly ultra-Orthodox town of Modiin Ilit and had previously attempted to cross Israel’s borders with the Gaza Strip and Jordan, according to Israeli media.The woman reportedly crossed into Syrian territory from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981, a move not widely recognized internationally.Her identity and motivation for crossing into Syria were not released by Israeli officials.Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu ally who is now running to unseat him in upcoming Israeli elections, said Sunday the government’s “censorship of something that Damascus and Moscow know about, and Israeli citizens don’t, is incomprehensible.”Israel and Syria remain in an official state of war and Israeli citizens are officially prohibited from visiting Syria. Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian-linked targets in the country since the start of its civil war a decade ago. Israel considers Iranian entrenchment on its northern frontier to be a red line and has repeatedly struck Iran-linked facilities and weapons convoys destined for Hezbollah.At the same time that Israel has paid for Syria to receive Covid-19 vaccines, the government has refused to provide large quantities of vaccines to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, drawing outcry from human rights organizations.The disparities have drawn criticism from UN officials and rights groups, and have shined a light on the inequities between rich and poor countries getting access to vaccines.These groups contend that Israel is responsible for vaccinating the Palestinians in the occupied territories.

21-02-2021||World||Niger voters return to polls in second round for president||Polls opened Sunday morning in Niger for the second round of voting in the country's presidential elections, after none of the 28 candidates won an absolute majority in December's vote.Former foreign affairs minister Mohamed Bazoum, who received about 39 per cent of the vote in the first round, is running against former president Mahamane Ousmane, who won nearly 17 per cent of the vote, according to the National Independent Electoral Commission.The winner of Sunday's vote will succeed President Mahamadou Issoufou who is stepping down after serving two terms, in accordance with Niger's constitution.Issoufou's decision to respect the constitution has been widely hailed and paves the way for Niger's first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since its independence from France in 1960. The West African nation has seen four coups.Issoufou's chosen successor is Bazoum, 71, a longtime Cabinet minister who is from Niger's small ethnic Arab minority.Of Niger's 23 million people, some 7.4 million are registered to vote. In the parliamentary and presidential elections which took place on December 27 turnout was approximately 67 per cent.Niger's next president will have to deal with major problems, including rising attacks linked to Islamic extremists. In January at least 100 people were killed when extremists attacked two villages near the border with Mali.Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced despite the presence of thousands of regional and international troops.”(There's) a significant risk that extremist groups will launch attacks to disrupt the poll,” said Alexandre Raymakers, senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk consultancy.While the new administration is unlikely to achieve rapid success against these groups, a peaceful transition of power would be a strong sign to western countries to continue supporting Niger's counter-terrorism operations, he said.The candidates are trying to entice voters through various campaign promises.A teacher by training, Bazoum who is of the ruling Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism, has promised to build boarding schools for girls to encourage them to remain in school longer, which he said would help reduce child marriage in a country with many teenage pregnancies.But peace is what locals say they really want from the country's next leader.“The new president needs to focus on our security at the borders and in our cities,” said Abdou Razak, a resident of the capital, Niamey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/niger-voters-return-to-polls-in-second-round-for-president-101613902131892.html

I apologise if anything herein has hurt or offended as that has not been my intention. I have said what I felt I needed to say in the hope that unstructured discretion is curtailed since it has never served any institution nor the interest of the people" .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-judge-lashes-out-at-sc-order-barring-him-from-hearing-cases-against-imran-101613902760700.html

But UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sunday that “we now think that we have the supplies” to speed up the vaccination campaign.More than 17.2 million people have been given the first of two doses of vaccine since the UK inoculation campaign began on December 8.The news comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with senior ministers Sunday to finalise a “road map” out of that national lockdown that is due to be announced on Monday.Britain has had more than 120,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-speeds-up-covid-19-vaccinations-aims-all-adults-by-july-31-101613902288716.html
21-02-2021||World||Decision ending snap inspections by IAEA does not breach 2015 nuclear deal: Iran||Iran's decision to end snap inspections by UN inspectors on Feb. 23 would not mean abandoning its 2015 nuclear deal, but the United States must still lift sanctions on Tehran to rescue the pact, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday."All our steps (to breach the deal) are reversible...The move on Feb. 23 is not abandoning the deal," Zarif said in a televised interview with Iran's English Language Press TV.Under a law enacted by hardline Iranian lawmakers last year, the government is obliged on Feb. 23 to limit IAEA inspections to declared nuclear sites only, revoking its short-notice access to any location seen as relevant for information-gathering, if other parties did not fully comply with the deal.President Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord, which aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons while lifting most international sanctions. Former President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.But Iran and the United States have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the accord. Iran insists the United States must first lift U.S. sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.Zarif reiterated Iran's stance that Washington should take the first step by lifting all sanctions, if it wants to revive the accord."The United States must return to the deal and lift all sanctions ... The United States is addicted to sanctions but they should know that Iran will not yield to pressure," he said. "We are not seeking nuclear weapons."Zarif also said that "for all practical purposes" the Biden administration is pursuing the same policy of "maximum pressure" as Trump.Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency who is in Tehran to discuss the agency's "essential verification activities" met on Sunday with Iran´s atomic chief, state media reported.Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said on Saturday that the agency's concerns over Iran's ending the implementation of the IAEA's Additional Protocol - which entails snap inspections - will be discussed during his meeting with Grossi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-ending-snap-inspections-by-iaea-does-not-breach-2015-nuclear-deal-iran-101613901577505.html

This move was met with large scale public resistance. Protestors had gathered at major cities and held demonstrations against the junta rule.During one such protest on Saturday in the city of Mandalay, the armed forces opened fire on the public causing chaos amidst the crowd. Two people were killed in the firing, according to reports. Many international agencies and governments, including the United Nations, have condemned the use of force by the military.Also read | Myanmar protesters' resolve strengthens following death of activistsHere is what has happened in Myanmar since the military’s coup:1. On February 1, 2021, the military took control of governance for a period of one year. A statement from them said “The voter lists which were used during the multi-party general election which was held on the 8th of November were found to have huge discrepancies and the Union Election Commission failed to settle this matter,” Reuters reported.2. The ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained along with other national leaders. The military promised to return their powers after a free and fair election.3. After minor protests by the citizens initially, the military on February 9, 2021, issued orders prohibiting public demonstrations in some areas of Yangon and Mandalay cities and warned of action against protestors, the Associated Press reported. Many people gathered in the streets in defiance of the rules, demanding restoration of power to the elected government.4. Internet services were cut off by the military several times to hinder the protests. Facebook on Sunday took down the military’s “Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page.”5. The UN has adopted a resolution against the military coup, demanding the immediate return of power to the government. The US government too had issued sanctions against Myanmar on February 12, according to a Reuters report. Many countries, including India, Japan and Australia have called for the return of democracy in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-on-after-2-demonstrators-shot-dead-in-myanmar-what-has-happened-so-far-101613901296841.html

We want to have a strong neighborhood.”The UAE and Bahrain last year normalized their ties with Israel in a historic shift for the Middle East as the Jewish state achieves official legitimacy and broad commercial ties in the heart of the Persian Gulf. Underpinning the rapprochement was a shared distrust of Iran, its nuclear program and its growing influence in the Middle East through a network of militant proxies.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last year the UAE’ decision to normalize ties with Israel was a betrayal of the Arab and Muslim worlds and unlikely to last.“If they believe they can buy security from Netanyahu, they can be my guest,” Zarif said on Sunday, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-ready-for-talks-with-arab-states-without-preconditions-101613900334187.html

They could've been. It costs money, and the trade off was made, and it didn't work out, and it's tragic that it has lead to people dying," Gates told CNN late on Saturday.Snowfalls, sub-zero temperatures and biting wind continue to test the United States' southwest and Texas, in particular, for a few weeks now. Earlier on Saturday, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Tiffany Young told Sputnik that nearly 15 million local residents were affected by the cold-caused disruption of water supply systems.

Lignadis, 56, was being held pending an appearance before a magistrate.According to media reports, at least three people have made allegations against Lignadis, including a 25-year-old man who accused him of having raped him in 2010.Lignadis has denied the accusations.Rumors of his alleged sexual misconduct swelled in recent weeks, leading to Lignadis' resignation two weeks ago as artistic director of Greece's National Theater, a post he had held since 2019.Revelations earlier this year by an Olympic gold medalist that she had been raped by a sailing federation official back in 1998 have sparked a #MeToo movement reckoning in Greece.People have come forward to accuse well-known figures in the entertainment of sexual harassment, assault and rape. Well-known actors and directors have come under fire, but Lignadis is the first to be arrested.The case has taken on political dimensions. The political opposition accused the Greek government of failing to follow up on complaints, while the culture minister responded Friday by accusing Lignadis of being a “dangerous man” who had “deceived” her with his acting ability.Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said she asked a Supreme Court prosecutor to investigate all abuse allegations in Greece's theater community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-greek-actor-director-arrested-charged-with-rape-101613898289383.html

21-02-2021||World||'I thought we were done': Parts fall from sky in plane scare||David Delucia was settling back into his airplane seat and starting to relax on his way to a long-awaited vacation when a huge explosion and flash of light interrupted an in-flight announcement and put him in survival mode.The Boeing 777-200, headed from Denver to Honolulu on Saturday with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard, suffered a catastrophic failure in its right engine and flames erupted under the wing as the plane began to lose altitude.As Delucia and his wife prepared for the worst, people in this Denver suburb reacted in horror as huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass rained down on a sports fields and on streets and lawns, just missing one home and crushing a truck. The explosion, visible from the ground, left a trail of black smoke in the sky, and tiny pieces of insulation filled the air like ash.The plane landed safely at Denver International Airport, and no one on board or on the ground was hurt, authorities said. But both those in the air and on the ground were deeply shaken.“When it initially happened, I thought we were done. I thought we were going down,” said Delucia, who stuffed his wallet in his pocket so he could be easily identified if the plane did go down. “The pilot did an amazing job. It was pretty unnerving.”The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the airplane experienced a right-engine failure shortly after takeoff.Video posted on Twitter showed the engine fully engulfed in flames as the plane flew through the air. Freeze frames from different video taken by a passenger sitting slightly in front of the engine and posted on Twitter appeared to show a broken fan blade in the engine.Incredible footage of UA 328 flight whose right engine caught fire soon after takeoff. The 777 safely landed back at Denver Airport. A passenger captured the moment. pic.twitter.com/WWAKrou2V9The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Authorities have not released any details about what may have caused the failure.United said in a separate statement that most passengers on United Flight 328 were rebooked on a new flight to Hawaii, but some chose to stay in a hotel overnight instead.The Broomfield Police Department posted photos on Twitter showing large, circular pieces of debris that appeared to be the engine cowling leaning against a house in the suburb about 16 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. Police asked anyone injured on the ground to come forward.Tyler Thal, who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that he was out for a walk with his family when he noticed a large commercial plane flying unusually low and took out his phone to film it.“While I was looking at it, I saw an explosion and then the cloud of smoke and some debris falling from it. It was just like a speck in the sky, and as I’m watching that, I’m telling my family what I just saw and then we heard the explosion,” he said in a phone interview. “The plane just kind of continued on, and we didn’t see it after that.”Kirby Klements was inside with his wife when they heard a huge booming sound, he said. A few seconds later, the couple saw a massive piece of debris fly past their window and into the bed of Klements' truck, crushing the cab and pushing the vehicle into the dirt.He estimated the circular engine cowling at 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. Fine pieces of the fiberglass insulation used in the airplane engine fell from the sky “like ash” for about 10 minutes, he said, and several large chunks of insulation landed in his backyard.“If it had been 10 feet different, it would have landed right on top of the house,” he said in a phone interview with the AP. “And if anyone had been in the truck, they would have been dead.”Based on initial photos and videos posted by passengers, aviation safety experts said the plane appeared to have suffered an uncontained and catastrophic engine failure.Such an event is extremely rare and happens when huge spinning pieces inside the engine suffer some sort of failure and breach an armored casing around the engine that is designed to contain the damage, said John Cox, an aviation safety expert and retired airline pilot who runs an aviation safety consulting firm called Safety Operating Systems.“That unbalanced disk has a lot of force in it, and it’s spinning at several thousand rotations per minute ... and when you have that much centrifugal force, it has to go somewhere,” he said in a phone interview.Pilots practice how to deal with such an event frequently and would have immediately shut off anything flammable in the engine, including fuel and hydraulic fluid, using a single switch, Cox said.Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall called the incident another example of “cracks in our culture in aviation safety (that) need to be addressed."Hall, who was on the board from 1994 to 2001, has criticized the FAA over the past decade as “drifting toward letting the manufacturers provide the aviation oversight that the public was paying for.” That goes especially for Boeing, he said.The last fatality on a U.S. airline flight involved such an engine failure on a Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas in April 2018. A passenger was killed when the engine disintegrated more than 30,000 feet above Pennsylvania and debris struck the plane, breaking the window next to her seat. She was forced halfway out the window before other passengers pulled her back inside.In that case, the breakdown was blamed on a broken fan blade in an engine of the Boeing 737. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to step up inspections of fan blades on certain engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France’s Safran S.A.In 2010, a Qantas Airbus A380 suffered a frightening uncontained engine failure shortly after takeoff from Singapore. Shrapnel from the engine damaged critical systems on the plane, but pilots were able to land safely. The incident was blamed on the faulty manufacturing of a pipe in the Rolls Royce engine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-thought-we-were-done-parts-fall-from-sky-in-plane-scare-101613897414573.html

It would also halt the implementation of an additional protocol that allows the IAEA inspectors to carry out more intrusive inspections to Iran’s nuclear facilities.Following the 2015 deal, Iran voluntarily agreed to implement the additional protocol.On Saturday, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Iran’s nuclear department, said he and Rafael Grossi would meet Sunday to discuss the U.N. agency’s concerns over the halt of the inspections as well as Iran’s cooperation with the agency.The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week the visit was aimed at finding “a mutually agreeable solution for the IAEA to continue essential verification activities in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/head-of-un-nuclear-watchdog-meets-iran-nuclear-chief-in-tehran-101613897462057.html
21-02-2021||World||UK to speed Covid-19 vaccine program, to offer shots to all adults by July-end||The U.K. will significantly accelerate its Covid-19 vaccination program, offering shots to all adults by the end of July and everyone over 50 by mid-April as the government beefs up efforts to contain one of the world’s worst outbreaks of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out the new targets on Monday when he reveals his “roadmap” to easing lockdowns. It is the first time the government has given a firm target for offering all adults their initial dose, having previously said it hoped to do so by autumn. The previous goal set for over-50s was the end of May. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky TV Sunday the U.K. had enough supply to meet the new targets.So far, more than 17 million people have been inoculated, around 30% of the adult population, making Britain a world leader in Covid vaccinations. The success of the program contrasts with the government’s failure to contain the initial outbreak and spread of Covid-19. The U.K. now has Europe’s highest death toll with more than 120,000 victims of the pandemic.The U.K. is now more than a month into its third national lockdown with schools closed and most businesses shuttered. With the economy suffering its worst recession in more than 300 years and cases and deaths falling rapidly, the prime minister is under growing pressure to lift lockdown curbs. Johnson, who was hospitalized with Covid-19 in April of last year, insists he will proceed with caution to make sure the current lockdown is the country’s last.Cases surged to record levels in the U.K. early this year as an easing of social distancing during the holiday period coincided with the spread of the highly-infectious U.K. variant. The latest lockdown, coupled with the vaccine program, has reversed that trend. Health authorities reported 10,406 new cases on Saturday, down from the peak week in January when cases averaged almost 60,000 a day.Going forward, Johnson is planning to complement the rapid-fire vaccination program with mass testing in workplaces, schools, shopping centers and theaters to help chart Britain’s way out of the pandemic crisis.Johnson said Britain had already achieved a significant milestone recording 15 million vaccinations by Feb. 15 to meet the government’s initial target, but the rollout needs to “go further and faster in the coming weeks.“But there should be no doubt -- the route out of lockdown will be cautious and phased, as we all continue to protect ourselves and those around us,” he said in an emailed statement.The government has yet to outline how it will roll out vaccinations to the under-50s and whether it will stick to age as the dominant criteria or prioritize other groups, such as critical workers including police and firefighters and teachers.Jonathan Ashworth, a Labour member of parliament and shadow health secretary, said the government needs to prioritize by occupation in the next rollout phase or explain why it can’t.“It’s perfectly reasonable for teachers, police officers and other key workers who haven’t been able to stay at home in the lockdown to ask when their turn will be,” he said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-speed-covid-19-vaccine-program-to-offer-shots-to-all-adults-by-julyend-101613897359129.html

A funeral was also held for a young woman killed earlier by police.Mya Thwet Thwet Khine was the first confirmed death among the many thousands who have taken to the streets to protest the Feb. 1 coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The woman was shot on Feb. 9, two days before her 20th birthday, at a protest in the capital Nayptitaw, and died Friday.About 1,000 people in cars and bikes gathered Sunday morning at the hospital where her body was held amid tight security, with even the victim's grandparents who had traveled from Yangon, five hours away, denied entry. When her body was released, a long motorized procession began a drive to the cemetery.In Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, about 1,000 demonstrators honored the woman under an elevated roadway.“I want to say through the media to the dictator and his associates, we are peaceful demonstrators," said protester Min Htet Naing. “Stop the genocide! Stop using lethal weapons!”Another large protest took place in Mandalay, where police shot dead two people on Saturday near a dockyard as security forces were trying to force workers to load a boat. The workers, like railway workers and truckers and many civil servants, have been taking part in a civil disobedience campaign against the junta.Shooting broke out after neighborhood residents rushed to the Yadanabon dock to try to assist the workers in their resistance. One of the victims, described as a teenage boy, was shot in the head and died immediately, while another was shot in the chest and died en route to a hospital.Several other serious injuries were also reported. Witness accounts and photos of bullet casings indicated that the security forces used live ammunition, in addition to rubber bullets, water cannons and slingshots.The new deaths drew quick and strong reaction from the international community.“The shooting of peaceful protesters in is beyond the pale,” said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Twitter. “We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy & choking dissent.”Britain last week froze assets of and imposed travel bans on three top Myanmar generals, adding to already existing targeted sanctions.Singapore, which together with Myanmar is part of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, issued a statement condemning the use of lethal force as “inexcusable.”Urging “utmost restraint” on the part of security forces, it warned that “if the situation continues to escalate, there will be serious adverse consequences for Myanmar and the region.”Another shooting death took place Saturday night in Yangon in unclear circumstances. According to several accounts on social media, including a live broadcast that showed the body, the victim was a man who was acting as a volunteer guard for a neighborhood watch group. Such groups were established because of fears that authorities were using criminals released from prison to spread panic and fear by setting fires and committing violent acts.Another live broadcast on Facebook showed the wife of actor Lu Min describing to neighbors how her husband was arrested and taken away from their home shortly after midnight. He was one of six high-profile people in the entertainment industry charged last week with inciting civil servants to stop work and join the protest movement, which he and the others have publicly championed.On Sunday, Facebook announced it took down the page run by the Myanmar military information unit “for repeated violations of our community standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm.” It had already taken down other accounts linked to the military.The junta took power after detaining Suu Kyi and preventing Parliament from convening, saying elections last November were tainted by voting irregularities. The election outcome, in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year’s time.The coup was a major setback to Myanmar’s transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule that began with a 1962 coup. Suu Kyi came to power after her party won a 2015 election, but the generals retained substantial power under the constitution, which was adopted under a military regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-protests-and-funeral-follow-deadly-shootings-in-myanmar-101613897150446.html

In exchange, Israel agreed to return two shepherds who crossed from Syria into Israeli territory, and pardoned a Druze woman from the Israeli-held section of the Golan Heights who had been sentenced to community service. The Ynet website said she was convicted of monitoring and photographing Israeli soldiers along the frontier.Syria’s state-run SANA news agency denied the report of the vaccine clause, saying it was a lie meant to improve Israel’s image.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only that Israel didn’t give the Syrians any vaccine from its own inventory, Ynet said. He didn’t comment directly on whether Israel bought Russian-made vaccines for Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-prisoner-swap-includes-covid-19-vaccines-for-syria-report-101613896747000.html

21-02-2021||World||Myanmar protesters' resolve strengthens following death of activists||Myanmar’s anti-military protesters plan to hold their largest mass rally yet on Monday after two demonstrators were shot dead this weekend.Shops and businesses are expected to close in solidarity, with the nation’s largest retailer, City Mart, announcing it will shut all of its outlets.The violent crackdown on the largely-peaceful movement risks stunting an already troubled economy. Nearly all private bank branches have closed, while automated teller machines are running out of cash amid surging demand.“We expect to see the biggest crowd of people across the country on Monday,” said Aung Kyaw Kyaw Oo, a lower house lawmaker representing the National League for Democracy. “We need to keep fighting against the brutal military.”Myanmar has seen nationwide demonstrations since the military seized control of the country on Feb. 1, with protesters ignoring a ban on public gatherings. A 20-year old student who was shot in the country’s capital of Naypidaw was the first casualty last week. Two men were killed and more than 20 people were injured on Saturday as authorities fired shots to disperse demonstrators in Mandalay.In an apparent warning to protesters, state-run television carried a broadcast notice on Sunday that said while peaceful demonstrations are lawful, undermining stability is not, and authorities may take action.The youth-led movement has mobilized supporters peacefully in major cities with three main demands: the release of civilian leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi, recognition of the 2020 election results that showed her party won, and a withdrawal of the military from politics. Suu Kyi’s first court hearing began earlier than expected last week, without her lawyer present.The military has ordered internet blackouts in recent nights as it tightens its grip on power. Facebook Inc. has pushed back against the coup, with Reuters reporting that the company removed the military’s main social media page for violations of community standards prohibiting the incitement of violence and coordinating harm.Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in statement on Saturday that the use of lethal force against unarmed civilians was “inexcusable.”Some automatic teller machines have run out of cash within the first few hours of each day as citizens rush to get a hold of money, according to Pe Myint, a senior consultant at Co-operative Bank.On top of this, bad traffic has prevented bank employees from going to their offices and changes in the senior management at the central bank may also complicate matters, he said. “It is still unlikely to see the reopening of all private banks before the end of February.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-resolve-strengthens-following-death-of-activists-101613894640158.html

Dujuan, locally known as Auring, is forecast to make landfall on the Dinagat Islands-Eastern Samar-Leyte area, about 600 to 700 kilometers south of Manila, between Sunday evening and Monday morning.The storm was 320 km east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur and has started moving northwestward at 15 km/h. It is expected to bring heavy rains and trigger landslides, although it may weaken into a tropical depression before it makes landfall.An average of 20 typhoons pass through the Philippines every year, in most cases forcing the evacuation of thousands of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/storm-dujuan-51-400-filipinos-evacuated-across-5-provinces-101613893972895.html

He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he and the Western countries said were trumped-up charges. He lost an appeal on Saturday.Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, told Reuters on Saturday he believes Putin would only consider releasing him if hit by sanctions."Putin is a dictator, but he is quite rational. If the upsides of having Navalny in prison become less than the downsides, he will change his decision," said Volkov."If many of his closest allies become unhappy, this can be dangerous to Putin and this could lead him to decide to change his mind," Volkov added. "Or maybe not - but sanctions is the best thing that Europe can do now."In Brussels on Sunday at the invitation of Lithuania, where he has been sheltering since 2019, Volkov said he will tell policymakers to use the "language of power" towards the Russian government, as he believes Putin sees bridge-building attempts by the West as a sign of weakness.Asked to comment on Navalny’s political future after the court decision on Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, “It is absolutely none of our business.”Navalny's allies have published a list of 35 people they believe should be sanctioned.His supporters are now gearing up to organise a "huge peaceful protest" in Russia this spring, Volkov said.Navalny's organization will then attempt to prevent Putin's party from achieving a comfortable win at elections in September by campaigning for its rivals, said Volkov.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-ally-volkov-says-language-of-power-sanctions-can-free-kremlin-critic-101613892238083.html

The move will raise an expected 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) a year, the report added.According to the report, at least 1 pence is set to be added to the bill for business from this autumn, at a cost to business of 3 billion pounds, with further rises in subsequent years.Allies of Sunak clarified he would not increase corporation tax higher than 23%.These measures will be helpful in paying for an extension to the furlough scheme, VAT cuts and business support loans until at least August.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of JulyUnlike the 2010 Conservative-led government, which pursued spending cuts to rebalance the economy after the global financial crisis, Sunak is expected to defer most of the toughest decisions about how to pay for that support in his budget speech."The corporation tax hike will be higher than expected and the extension of the support schemes will be longer than most people expect," the newspaper quoted a source as saying.Insiders indicated the stamp duty holiday on property purchases would also be extended in line with the other coronavirus support measures, the report said.Britain's economy had its biggest slump in 300 years in 2020, when it contracted by 10%, and will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021, the Bank of England predicts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-rishi-sunak-to-raise-business-tax-to-pay-for-covid-19-support-101613889716994.html

21-02-2021||World||Frozen pipes, electric woes remain as cold snap eases grip in Texas||Higher temperatures spread across the southern United States on Saturday, bringing relief to a winter-weary region that faces a challenging clean-up and expensive repairs from days of extreme cold and widespread power outages.In hard-hit Texas, where millions were warned to boil tap water before drinking it, the warm-up was expected to last for several days. The thaw produced burst pipes throughout the region, adding to the list of woes from severe conditions that were blamed for more than 70 deaths.By Saturday afternoon, the sun had come out in Dallas and temperatures were nearing the 50s. People emerged to walk and jog in residential neighborhoods after days indoors. Many roads had dried out, and patches of snow were melting. Snowmen slumped.Linda Nguyen woke up in a Dallas hotel room Saturday morning with an assurance she hadn’t had in nearly a week: She and her cat had somewhere to sleep with power and water.Electricity had been restored to her apartment on Wednesday. But when Nguyen arrived home from work the next evening, she found a soaked carpet. A pipe had burst in her bedroom.“It’s essentially unlivable,” said Nguyen, 27, who works in real estate. “Everything is completely ruined.”Deaths attributed to the weather include a man at an Abilene health care facility where the lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible. Officials also reported deaths from hypothermia, including homeless people and those inside buildings with no power or heat. Others died in car accidents on icy roads or from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.Roughly half the deaths reported so far occurred in Texas, with multiple fatalities also in Tennessee, Kentucky, Oregon and a few other Southern and Midwestern states.A Tennessee farmer died trying to save two calves from a frozen pond.President Joe Biden’s office said Saturday he has declared a major disaster in Texas, directing federal agencies to help in the recovery.U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted Saturday that she helped raise more than $3 million toward relief. She was soliciting help for a Houston food bank, one of 12 Texas organizations she said would benefit from the donations.The storms left more than 300,000 still without power across the country on Saturday, many of them in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.More than 50,000 Oregon electricity customers were among those without power, more than a week after an ice storm ravaged the electrical grid. Portland General Electric had hoped to have service back to all but 15,000 customers by Friday night. But the utility discovered additional damage in previously inaccessible areas.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in some areas to check on residents' welfare. At its peak, what was the worst ice storm in 40 years knocked out power to more than 350,000 customers.In West Virginia, Appalachian Power was working on a list of about 1,500 places that needed repair, as about 44,000 customers in the state remained without electricity after experiencing back-to-back ice storms Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. More than 3,200 workers were attempting to get power back online, their efforts spread across the six most affected counties on Saturday.In Wayne County, West Virginia, workers had to replace the same pole three times because trees kept falling on it.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott met Saturday with legislators from both parties to discuss energy prices as Texans face massive spikes in their electric bills after wholesale energy prices skyrocketed while power plants were offline.“We have a responsibility to protect Texans from spikes in their energy bills” resulting from the weather, he said in a statement.Water woes added misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice. Snow storms forced rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.Robert Tuskey was retrieving tools from the back of his pickup truck Saturday afternoon as he prepared to fix a water line at a friend’s home in Dallas.“Everything’s been freezing,” Tuskey said. “I even had one in my own house … of course I’m lucky I’m a plumber.”Tuskey, 49, said his plumbing business has had a stream of calls for help from friends and relatives with burst pipes. “I’m fixing to go help out another family member,” he said. “I know she ain’t got no money at all, but they ain’t got no water at all, and they’re older.”In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 lacked running water, and officials blamed city water mains that are more than 100 years old and not built for freezing weather.The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking. But residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.Incoming and outgoing passenger flights at Memphis International Airport resumed Saturday after all flights were canceled Friday because of water pressure problems. The issues hadn't been resolved, but airport officials set up temporary restroom facilities.Prison rights advocates said some correctional facilities across Louisiana had intermittent electricity and frozen pipes, affecting toilets and showers.The men who are sick, elderly or being held not in dormitories but in cell blocks — small spaces surrounded by concrete walls — were especially vulnerable, according to Voice of the Experienced, a grassroots organization founded and run by formerly incarcerated people. The group said one man at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, just south of Baton Rouge, described a thin layer of ice on his walls.Cammie Maturin said she spoke to men at the 6,300-inmate Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola who were given no extra provisions to protect themselves from the cold.“They give them no extra blankets. No extra anything. For them, it’s just been fend for yourself,” said Maturin, president of the nonprofit H.O.P.E. Foundation.In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.As of Saturday, 1,445 public water systems in Texas had reported disrupted operations, said Toby Baker executive director of the state Commission on Environmental Quality. Government agencies were using mobile labs and coordinating to speed water testing.That’s up from 1,300 reporting issues Friday afternoon. But Baker said the number of affected customers had dropped slightly. Most were under boil-water orders, with 156,000 lacking water service entirely.“It seems like last night we may have seen some stabilization in the water systems across the state,” Baker said.The Saturday thaw after 11 days of freezing temperatures in Oklahoma City left residents with burst water pipes, inoperable wells and furnaces knocked out of operation by brief power blackouts.Rhodes College in Memphis said Friday that about 700 residential students were being moved to hotels in the suburbs of Germantown and Collierville after school bathrooms stopped functioning because of low water pressure.Firefighters extinguished a blaze at a fully occupied 102-room hotel in Killeen, Texas, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Austin, late Friday. The hotel’s sprinkler system didn’t work because of frozen pipes, authorities said Saturday.Flames shot from the top of the four-story hotel, and three people required medical care. Displaced guests were taken to a nearby Baptist church.Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission returned to normal after the historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand that buckled the state's system.Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the system.Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached breaking point.The blackouts resulted in at least two lawsuits filed against ERCOT and utilities, including one filed by the family of an 11-year-old boy who is believed to have died from hypothermia. The lawsuits claim ERCOT ignored repeated warnings of weaknesses in the state's power infrastructure.Also, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and electric utility companies. His investigation will address power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frozen-pipes-electric-woes-remain-as-cold-snap-eases-grip-in-texas-101613888467750.html

Its True News page was no available on Sunday.The military spokesman did not respond to a Reuters phone call seeking comment.Two people were killed in Myanmar's second city Mandalay on Saturday when police and soldiers fired at protesters demonstrating against the overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, emergency workers said, the bloodiest day in more than two weeks of demonstrations.Facebook in recent years has engaged with civil rights activists and democratic political parties in Myanmar and pushed back against the military after coming under heavy international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns.In 2018, it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and 19 other senior officers and organisations, and took down hundreds of pages and accounts run by military members for coordinated inauthentic behaviour.Ahead of November elections, Facebook announced it had taken down a network of 70 fake accounts and pages operated by members of the military that had posted either positive content about the army or criticism of Suu Kyi and her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-main-page-of-myanmar-military-101613877044175.html
21-02-2021||World||UN experts: Trump ally, UAE firms violated Libya sanctions||American security contractor Erik Prince, a close ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, violated the U.N. arms embargo against Libya along with three United Arab Emirates-based companies and their top managers during an operation to help a rebel military commander take the capital Tripoli, U.N. experts said.In a key section of a report to the U.N. Security Council obtained Saturday by The Associated Press, the panel of experts outlined “a well-funded private military company operation” called “Project Opus” designed to provide military equipment to eastern-based commander Khalifa Hifter.“The Project Opus plan also included a component to kidnap or terminate individuals regarded as high value targets inThe plan was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post.Oil-rich Libya was plunged into chaos after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and split the country between a U.N.-supported government in Tripoli and rival authorities based in the country’s east, each side backed by an array of local militias as well as regional and foreign powers.In April 2019, Hifter and his forces, backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, launched an offensive to try and capture Tripoli. His campaign collapsed after Turkey stepped up its military support of the U.N.-supported government with hundreds of troops and thousands of Syrian mercenaries. An October cease-fire agreement has led to an agreement on a transitional government and elections scheduled for Dec. 24.The panel of experts report said it identified “Project Opus” in June 2019.It was designed to have private military companies provide Hifter’s forces with “armed assault rotary wing aviation, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, maritime interdiction, cyber, UAV, and intelligence fusion and targeting capabilities,” the experts said,Prince became involved when Jordanian authorities became aware of elements of the plan “and suspended the auction” of surplus military helicopters to Hifter on June 18, 2019, according to the experts.“This required the Project Opus team to initiate a contingency plan to rapidly identify and procure new aircraft,” the panel said.“These included three medium utility helicopters from a South African company and three light utility helicopters from a United Arab Emirates company,” the experts said. “Also purchased within a tight time frame were an Antonov AN-26B from a Bermudian company, a LASA T-Bird light attack aircraft from a Bulgarian company, and a Pilatus PC-6 ISR aircraft from an Austrian company.”The panel said the Antonov, LASA light attack aircraft and Pilatus “were deployed before any payment and the normal due diligence took place, thus demonstrating that a fourth individual, Erik Dean Prince (USA), who controlled the companies owning the aircraft, assisted in procurement for the operation.”“No one else was in a position to arrange the sale of these aircraft within such a short time frame,” the experts said.The panel said further investigations “identified that Erik Prince made a proposal for the operation to Khalifa Hifter in Cairo, Egypt on, or about, April 14, 2019.”The panel said it therefore “finds that Erik Prince” violated the 2011 Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo against Libya “in that, at the very least, he ... assisted in the evasion of, the provisions of the arms embargo in Libya.”Prince, founder of the controversial security firm Blackwater, soared to notoriety after Blackwater employees in 2007 shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians in central Baghdad during the Iraq war. After the scandal, the company’s name was changed and Prince sold his shares to a private equity fund. He reportedly now heads a private equity fund focused on investments in frontier emerging markets.Prince was accused of acting as a back channel on behalf of Trump. His sister, Betsy DeVos, was the secretary of education in the Trump administration.The panel of experts said “three United Arab Emirates based companies were primarily used for the planning, management and finance of the operation” under Project Opus.It identified them as Lancaster 6 DMCC, L-6 FZE, and Opus Capital Asset Limited FZE.The companies were “controlled and managed” by Christiaan Paul Durrant of Australia and Amanda Kate Perry of the United Kingdom, with the ground team leader being Stephen John Lodge of South Africa.The panel said “all three companies and individuals were found ... to have violated” the 2011 council resolution “in that they had each violated, or assisted in the evasion of, the provisions of the arms embargo in Libya.”It said the UAE, which could provide a lot of assistance to the panel, has not responded to any panel requests for information, “and the responses from Jordan and South Africa provided little of the substantive information requested by the panel.”According to the experts, the helicopter and maritime interdiction component of Operation Opus was aborted on June 29, 2019, when Lodge decided to evacuate a team of 20 private military operatives to Malta using two special forces “rigid hulled inflatable boats” for the 350 nautical mile voyage from the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi to Malta’s capital Valetta.“The decision to evacuate was taken as Hifter was unimpressed with the replacement aircraft procured for the operations and made threats against the team management,” the experts said.The panel said the Pilatus aircraft deployed to Libya on June 25, 2019 and was available for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ISR operations in Libya from Benghazi, Al Jufra and Brak Shati from at least June 26, 2019 to Dec. 24, 2020. Its capabilities provided Hifter with “a force multiplier” for these operations and targeting activities, the experts said.The panel said Project Opus private military operatives were deployed to Libya for a second time in April and May 2020 ’’in order to locate and destroy high value targets, but this time planning to use military equipment supplied by the UAE.”The operation was aborted, it said, because any helicopter assault would be “highly vulnerable to interdiction” by Libyan government air defense capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-trump-ally-uae-firms-violated-libya-sanctions-101613874367089.html

21-02-2021||World||Privacy faces risks in tech-infused post-Covid-19 workplace||People returning to work following the long pandemic will find an array of tech-infused gadgetry to improve workplace safety but which could pose risks for long-term personal and medical privacy.Temperature checks, distance monitors, digital "passports," wellness surveys and robotic cleaning and disinfection systems are being deployed in many workplaces seeking to reopen.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Tech giants and startups are offering solutions which include computer vision detection of vital signs to wearables which can offer early indications of the onset of Covid-19 and apps that keep track of health metrics.Salesforce and IBM have partnered on a "digital health pass" to let people share their vaccination and health status on their smartphone.Clear, a tech startup known for airport screening, has created its own health pass which is being used by organizations such as the National Hockey League and MGM Resorts.Fitbit, the wearable tech maker recently acquired by Google, has its own "Ready for Work" program that includes daily check-ins using data from its devices.Fitbit is equipping some 1,000 NASA employees with wearables as part of a pilot program which requires a daily log-in using various health metrics which will be tracked by the space agency.Microsoft and insurance giant United HealthCare have deployed a ProtectWell app which includes a daily symptom screener, and Amazon has deployed a "distance assistant" in its warehouses to help employees maintain safe distances.And a large coalition of technology firms and health organizations are working on a digital vaccination certificate, which can be used on smartphones to show evidence of inoculation for Covid-19.'Blurs the lines' With these systems, employees may face screenings even as they enter a building lobby, and monitoring in elevators, hallways and throughout the workplace.The monitoring "blurs the line between people's workplace and personal lives," said Darrell West, a Brookings Institution vice president with the think tank's Center for Technology Innovation."It erodes longstanding medical privacy protections for many different workers."A report last year by the consumer activist group Public Citizen identified at least 50 apps and technologies released during the pandemic "marketed as workplace surveillance tools to combat Covid-19."The report said some systems go so far as identifying people who may not spend enough time in front of a sink to note inadequate hand-washing."The invasion of privacy that workers face is alarming, especially considering that the effectiveness of these technologies in mitigating the spread of Covid-19 has not yet been established," the report said.The group said there should be clear rules on collection and storage of data, with better disclosure to employees.A delicate balanceEmployers face a delicate balance as they try to ensure workplace safety without intruding on privacy, said Forrest Briscoe, professor of management and organization at Penn State University.Briscoe said there are legitimate reasons and precedents for requiring proof of vaccination. But these sometimes conflict with medical privacy regulations which limit a company's access to employee health data."You don't want the employer accessing that information for work-related decisions," Briscoe said.Biscoe said many employers are relying on third-party tech vendors to handle the monitoring, but that has its risks as well."Using third-party vendors will keep the data separate," he said."But for some companies their business model involves gathering data and using it for some monetizable purpose and that poses a risk to privacy."The global health crisis has inspired startups around the world to seek innovative ways to limit virus transmission, with some of those products shown at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show.Taiwan-based FaceHeart demonstrated software which can be installed in cameras for contactless measurement of vital signs to screen for shortness of breath, high fever, dehydration, elevated heart rate and other symptoms which are early indicators of Covid-19.Drone maker Draganfly showcased camera technology which can be used to offer alerts on social distancing, and also detect changes in people's vital signs which may be early indicators of Covid-19 infection.A programmable robot from Misty Robotics, also shown at CES, can be adapted as a health check monitor and can also be designed to disinfect frequently used surfaces like door handles, according to the company.But there are risks in relying too much on technologies which may be unproven or inaccurate, such as trying to detect fevers with thermal cameras among moving people, said Jay Stanley, a privacy researcher and analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union."Employers have a legitimate interest in safeguarding workplaces and keeping employees healthy in the context of the pandemic," Stanley said."But what I would worry about is employers using the pandemic to pluck and store information in a systematic way beyond what is necessary to protect health."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/privacy-faces-risks-in-tech-infused-post-covid-19-workplace-101613887821322.html
21-02-2021||World||Explained: What is H5N8? Strain of bird flu virus 1st to infect humans in Russia||Russia has reported the world's first case of a strain of bird flu virus that has infected humans via birds. The outbreak of the H5N8 strain has been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. What is the H5N8 strain?The strain is a subtype of the influenza A virus that causes flu-like symptoms in wild birds and poultry. It poses a low risk to people, but it is fatal for birds. This was found in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Until recently, it was not known to have affected humans. Humans infected Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south were infected with the H5N8 strain after an outbreak in birds in December last year, Popova said, adding that they all felt fine now. “Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results," she was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters. Where else has the H5N8 strain been reported? Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa in recent months but so far only in poultry. Several states in India had also reported the outbreak of avian flu in January but there was no report of transmission to humans. Experts had said the outbreak was caused by the H5N8 strain, though there are other strains circulating globally. A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease, they had said in early January. According to experts, both H5N1 (another strain of avian influenza) and H5N8 have high pathogenicity or the ability of a pathogen to cause disease, but they don’t infect humans very effectively. However, past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes.How was H5N8 transmitted to humans in Russia?"Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks," Reuters said citing an email from WHO's European arm. They were asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported. "We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event," the email added.Is eating poultry safe? The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe, Reuters reported. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-h5n8-strain-of-bird-flu-virus-1st-to-infect-humans-in-russia-101613885803710.html

21-02-2021||World||Myanmar police arrest actor Lu Min after two killed in protests||Myanmar police arrested a famous actor wanted for supporting opposition to a Feb. 1 coup, his wife said on Sunday, hours after two people were killed when police and soldiers fired to disperse protests in the second city of Mandalay.The violence in Mandalay on Saturday was the bloodiest day in more than two weeks of demonstrations in cities and towns across Myanmar demanding an end to military rule and the release from detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others.The demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes and disruptions show no sign of dying down with opponents of the military sceptical of an army promise to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.The actor, Lu Min, was one of six celebrities who the army said on Wednesday were wanted under an anti-incitement law for encouraging civil servants to join in the protest. The charges can carry a two-year prison sentence.Lu Min has taken part in several protests in Yangon.His wife, Khin Sabai Oo, said in a video posted on his Facebook page that police had come to their home in Yangon and taken him away."They forced open the door and took him away and didn't tell me where they were taking him. I couldn’t stop them. They didn’t tell me."Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun, who is also the spokesman for the new military council, has not responded to repeated attempts by Reuters to contact him by telephone for comment.An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said on Saturday 569 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced in connection with the coup.In another incident in Yangon on Saturday night, a night watchman was shot and killed. The Burmese service of Radio Free Asia said police had shot him but it was not clear why.Communities have been posting more guards in fear of sweeps by the security forces.'DEEPLY CONCERNED'The more than two weeks of protests had been largely peaceful, unlike previous episodes of opposition during nearly half a century of direct military rule, which ended in 2011.Members of ethnic minorities, poets, rappers and transport workers marched on Saturday in various places, but tension escalated quickly in Mandalay where police and soldiers confronted striking shipyard workers.Some of the demonstrators fired catapults at police as they played cat and mouse through riverside streets. Police responded with tear gas and gunfire, and witnesses said they found the cartridges of live rounds and rubber bullets on the ground.Two people were shot and killed and 20 were wounded, said Ko Aung, a leader of the Parahita Darhi volunteer emergency service.Police were not available for comment.A young woman protester, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, died on Friday after being shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd in the capital, Naypyitaw, the first death among anti-coup demonstrators.The army says one policeman has died of injuries sustained in a protest.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "deeply concerned" by reports that security forces had fired on protesters and continued to detain and harass demonstrators and others."We stand with the people of Burma," Price wrote on Twitter. Myanmar is also known as Burma.Britain said it would consider further action against those involved in violence against protesters, and the French foreign ministry called the violence "unacceptable.""The shooting of peaceful protesters in Myanmar is beyond the pale," British foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Twitter. "We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy & choking dissent."The United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand have announced limited sanctions since the coup, with a focus on military leaders.State television MRTV's evening news broadcast made no mention of the protests or casualties.The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept, detaining her and others. The electoral commission had dismissed the fraud complaints.Nevertheless, the army says its action is within the constitution and is supported by a majority of the people. The military has blamed protesters for instigating violence.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios.

21-02-2021||World||Big US companies slash donations to politicians after Trump election challenge||Ten US corporations slashed donations to candidates seeking federal office by more than 90% in January, after pledging to cut off giving to the Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn his election defeat.None of the political action committees of 10 major companies reviewed by Reuters, including Microsoft Corp , Walmart Inc, AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp , donated to any of the 147 congressional Republicans who voted to support Trump's claims just hours after his supporters launched a deadly assault on the US Capitol.Disclosures to the Federal Election Commission ahead of a Saturday filing deadline showed the group of corporate PACs affiliated with those 10 companies made $13,000 in new donations to candidates in January. The reports were the first by the PACs to detail contributions made since the January 6 Capitol attack.The money donated during the month was less than one-tenth the roughly $190,000 the 10 company PACs gave candidates in January 2017, and tiny relative to the roughly $10 million donated to candidates during the 2019-2020 election season. The 147 lawmakers who voted to overturn President Joe Biden's victory had received more than $2 million from those 10 PACs during the last two-year political cycle.Also read: A dozen Republican senators to oppose certification of Joe Biden’s winAlso read: US justice department probes if staff tried to alter election outcomeOnly committees tied to two of the companies - General Electric Co and American Express Co - reported any new giving to federal candidates in January.American Express' PAC gave $5,000 to Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, while GE's gave $5,000 to Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a prominent Republican Trump critic, and $1,000 to Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, a Democrat.Political giving usually slows down in the months after a US general election and money from corporate political action committees is a small slice of the funds raised by political campaigns.But the paucity of corporate-affiliated giving in January points to a slower start in one corner of political finance ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.Corporate PACs cannot donate money from the company treasury but generally serve as a conduit for contributions from managers and shareholders.Committees affiliated with Best Buy, State Street Corp, Dow Inc and Nike Inc did not report new donations to any candidates in January.While more than a thousand PACs are associated with corporate America, the 10 reviewed by Reuters include major companies which made clear public statements that they would throttle back donations following the January 6 Capitol attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-us-companies-slash-donations-to-politicians-after-trump-election-challenge-101613871247241.html

21-02-2021||World||Why a predictable cold snap crippled the Texas power grid||As Texans cranked up their heaters early Monday to combat plunging temperatures, a record surge of electricity demand set off a disastrous chain reaction in the state’s power grid.Wind turbines in the state’s northern Panhandle locked up. Natural gas plants shut down when frozen pipes and components shut off fuel flow. A South Texas nuclear reactor went dark after a five-foot section of uninsulated pipe seized up. Power outages quickly spread statewide - leaving millions shivering in their homes for days, with deadly consequences.It could have been far worse: Before dawn on Monday, the state’s grid operator was “seconds and minutes” away from an uncontrolled blackout for its 26 million customers, its CEO has said. Such a collapse occurs when operators lose the ability to manage the crisis through rolling blackouts; in such cases, it can take weeks or months to fully restore power to customers.Monday was one of the state’s coldest days in more than a century - but the unprecedented power crisis was hardly unpredictable after Texas had experienced a similar, though less severe, disruption during a 2011 cold snap. Still, Texas power producers failed to adequately winter-proof their systems. And the state’s grid operator underestimated its need for reserve power capacity before the crisis, then moved too slowly to tell utilities to institute rolling blackouts to protect against a grid meltdown, energy analysts, traders and economists said.Early signs of trouble came long before the forced outages. Two days earlier, for example, the grid suddenly lost 539 megawatts (MW) of power, or enough electricity for nearly 108,000 homes, according to operational messages disclosed by the state’s primary grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).The crisis stemmed from a unique confluence of weaknesses in the state’s power system.Texas is the only state in the continental United States with an independent and isolated grid. That allows the state to avoid federal regulation - but also severely limits its ability to draw emergency power from other grids. ERCOT also operates the only major U.S. grid that does not have a capacity market - a system that provides payments to operators to be on standby to supply power during severe weather events.After more than 3 million ERCOT customers lost power in a February 2011 freeze, federal regulators recommended that ERCOT prepare for winter with the same urgency as it does the peak summer season. They also said that, while ERCOT’s reserve power capacity looked good on paper, it did not take into account that many generation units could get knocked offline by freezing weather.“There were prior severe cold weather events in the Southwest in 1983, 1989, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010,” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corp staff summarized after investigating the state’s 2011 rolling blackouts. “Extensive generator failures overwhelmed ERCOT’s reserves, which eventually dropped below the level of safe operation.”ERCOT spokeswoman Leslie Sopko did not comment in detail about the causes of the power crisis but said the grid’s leadership plans to re-evaluate the assumptions that go into its forecasts.The freeze was easy to see coming, said Jay Apt, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center.“When I read that this was a black-swan event, I just have to wonder whether the folks who are saying that have been in this business long enough that they forgot everything, or just came into it,” Apt said. “People need to recognize that this sort of weather is pretty common.”This week’s cold snap left 4.5 million ERCOT customers without power. More than 14.5 million Texans endured a related water-supply crisis as pipes froze and burst. About 65,000 customers remained without power as of Saturday afternoon, even as temperatures started to rise, according to website PowerOutage.US.State health officials have linked more than two dozen deaths to the power crisis. Some died from hypothermia or possible carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators running in basements and garages without enough ventilation. Officials say they suspect the death count will rise as more bodies are discovered.THIN POWER RESERVEIn the central Texas city of Austin, the state capital, the minimum February temperature usually falls between 42 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 9 degrees Celsius). This past week, temperatures fell as low as 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 degrees Celsius).In November, ERCOT assured that the grid was prepared to handle such a dire scenario.“We studied a range of potential risks under both normal and extreme conditions, and believe there is sufficient generation to adequately serve our customers,” said ERCOT’s manager of resource adequacy, Pete Warnken, in a report that month.Warnken could not be reached for comment on Saturday.Under normal winter conditions, ERCOT forecast it would have about 16,200 MW of power reserves. But under extreme conditions, it predicted a reserve cushion of only about 1,350 MW. That assumed only 23,500 MW of generation outages. During the peak of this week’s crisis, more than 30,000 MW was forced off the grid.Other US grid operators maintain a capacity market to supply extra power in extreme conditions - paying operators on an ongoing basis, whether they produce power or not. Capacity market auctions determine, three years in advance, the price that power generators receive in exchange for being on emergency standby.Instead, ERCOT relies on a wholesale electricity market, where free market pricing provides incentives for generators to provide daily power and to make investments to ensure reliability in peak periods, according to economists. The system relied on the theory that power plants should make high profits when energy demand and prices soar - providing them ample money to make investments in, for example, winterization. The Texas legislature restructured the state’s electric market in 1999.LOOMING CRISISSince 2010, ERCOT’s reserve margin - the buffer between generation capacity versus forecasted demand - has dropped to about 10% from about 20%. This has put pressure on generators during demand spikes, making the grid less flexible, according to North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit regulator.That thin margin for error set off alarms early Monday morning among energy traders and analysts as they watched a sudden drop in the electrical frequency of the Texas grid. One analyst compared it to watching the pulse of a hospital patient drop to life-threatening levels.Too much of a drop is catastrophic because it would trigger automatic relay switches to disconnect power sources from the grid, setting off uncontrolled blackouts statewide. Dan Jones, an energy analyst at Monterey LLC, watched from his home office in Delaware as the grid’s frequency dropped quickly toward the point that would trigger the automatic shutdowns."If you're not in control, and you are letting the equipment do it, that's just chaos," Jones said.By Sunday afternoon about 3:15 p.m. (CST), ERCOT's control room signaled it had run out of options to boost electric generation to match the soaring demand. Operators issued a warning that there was "no market solution" for the projected shortage, according to control room messages published by ERCOT on its website.Adam Sinn, president of Houston-based energy trading firm Aspire Commodities, said ERCOT waited far too long to start telling utilities to cut customers' power to guard against a grid meltdown. The problems, he said, were readily apparent several days before Monday.“ERCOT was letting the system get weaker and weaker and weaker,” Sinn said in an interview. “I was thinking: Holy shit, what is this grid operator doing? He has to cut load.”Sinn said he started texting his friends on Sunday night, warning them to expect widespread outages.‘SECONDS AND MINUTES’Early Monday morning, one of the largest sources of electricity in the state - the unit 1 reactor at the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station - stopped producing power after the small section of pipe froze in temperatures that averaged 17 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius). The grid lost access to 1,350 MW of nuclear power - enough to power about 270,000 homes - after automatic sensors detected the frozen pipe and protectively shut down the reactor, said Victor Dricks, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.About 2:30 a.m. (CST), the South Plains Electric Cooperative in Lubbock said it received a phone call from ERCOT to cut power to its customers. Inside the ERCOT control room, staff members scrambled to call utilities and cooperatives statewide to tell them to do the same, according to operational messages disclosed by the grid operator.Three days later, ERCOT Chief Executive Bill Magness acknowledged that the grid operator had only narrowly avoided the calamity of uncontrolled blackouts.“If we hadn’t taken action,” he said on Thursday, “it was seconds and minutes (away), given the amount of generation that was coming off the system at the same time that the demand was still going up."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-a-predictable-cold-snap-crippled-the-texas-power-grid-101613868661448.html

I renew my call for Tanzania to start reporting Covid-19 cases and share data," Tedros said in a statement on WHO's website.Tedros said that in late January he had joined Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa head, in urging Tanzania to scale public health measures against Covid-19 and prepare to distribute vaccines. "I also encouraged the sharing of data in light of reports of Covid-19 cases among travellers," he said.Tanzanian authorities were not immediately available for comment.Tanzanian President John Magufuli has a reputation as one of the national leaders most sceptical of efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.On Wednesday, a senior politician died of Covid-19, his party said, adding to concern about a hidden epidemic running rampant in a country that insists it has no local transmission of the disease and says it has no plans to receive vaccines.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of JulyOn Friday, during a funeral service for a senior aide, Magufuli urged Tanzanians to remove fear, take precautions and put God first.

21-02-2021||World||US President Biden approves Texas disaster declaration after deadly freeze||President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas on Saturday as the state struggles with the fallout from a winter storm that killed at least two dozen people and caused widespread blackouts and water shortages.Millions of residents in the United States' biggest oil and gas producer have had to contend with days of electricity outages, and nearly half of all Texans are still suffering from disruptions to their water service.Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, said on Friday authorities were reporting 10 deaths due to hypothermia. Officials said an accurate death toll will take time to establish.The action by the Biden administration makes federal funding available to affected individuals, including assistance for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans.Biden is also weighing a trip to Texas to survey the federal response to the first new crisis to develop since he took office a month ago. The White House is working closely with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who did not initially acknowledge Biden's November election win.Read more: Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in ParisAbbott thanked the president for approving the major disaster declaration, saying in a statement that it was "an important first step." But, he added, individual assistance had only been approved for 77 counties, not all the state's 254 counties as he had requested.FROM RESPONSE TO RECOVERYWith all the state's power plants back online, millions of Texans were finally able to turn on the lights and heat their homes again. However, outages persisted and more than 78,000 homes remained without electricity as of Saturday morning.With the weather set to improve and temperatures expected to return to normal in the coming days, the main concern has shifted from power to water.More than 1,200 public water systems have reported service disruptions, many of them leading to boil water notices, said Gary Rasp, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ.) He said 14.3 million people in 190 counties were affected as of Saturday morning.Toby Baker, TCEQ's executive director, said the agency will do a full review of the regulations governing the state's water systems."I'm not aware of ever having issues of this magnitude from a water system standpoint in the history of the state," he said at a press conference on Saturday. "We're going to take full advantage of this event to learn."At his home in Houston, plumber Jay Farrell said he would have "rather gone through a hurricane than this freeze."Read more: Texas homes hit with thousand-dollar bills after winter woesFarrell said he has not been able to take showers and for days has been using buckets of water from his hot tub to flush the toilet. As Texas shivered in the dark during the freeze, he said the temperature in his house dropped to 22 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5.5 Celsius).In Houston, officials struck a more optimistic tone after power was restored to most residents and with mass distributions of bottled water under way."Things are looking up... We are headed in the direction of normalcy," Hidalgo said in a video address on Friday. "Right now it's about shifting from response to recovery."Meanwhile, Abbott said he was convening an emergency meeting with officials on Saturday to discuss the spike in energy bills received by many residents following the power outages.FINGER POINTINGThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a cooperative responsible for 90% of the state's electricity, has come under fire after the power grid collapsed as demand spiked during the freeze.Abbott lashed out at ERCOT last week, saying the corporation had told officials before the storm that the grid was prepared.A lawsuit against ERCOT was filed on Friday in Nueces County court in Corpus Christi alleging the council failed to heed warnings and take action to address weaknesses in the power infrastructure.Separately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and other power companies regarding power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter weather.In a statement on Friday, Paxton said the companies "grossly mishandled" the weather emergency, and vowed to "get to the bottom of this power failure."On Saturday, Senator Tina Smith wrote to federal regulators calling for an investigation into any price gouging by natural gas producers and suppliers."I urge you to launch an investigation into the conditions in the natural gas market over the last week," Smith said in the letter to the Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Smith said the effects of the crisis in Texas could be felt in the region, including natural gas spot prices that in some cases rose to nearly 100 times usual levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-approves-texas-disaster-declaration-after-deadly-freeze-101613866580850.html

21-02-2021||World||Texas homes hit with thousand-dollar bills after winter woes||After enduring a wretched week of Arctic storms, hunger and cold, several Texans were handed another pain point -- massive electricity bills.Houston resident David Astrein, 36, a human resources director at a manufacturing company, said he’s been charged $2,738.66 so far this month versus $129.85 in January for a three-bedroom home with a detached garage apartment. He and his wife stopped using their dishwasher, washer and dryer, and turned on as few lights as possible at night. They kept the heat on for their 5-month old son.Astrein is one of a swath of consumers facing sky-high payments in the aftermath of the storm -- many took to social media to show electricity bills ranging as high as $8,000. According to their screen shots, most are customers of Griddy Energy, a power supplier with a unique business model.The Macquarie Energy-backed company charges electricity based on real-time prices in wholesale power markets, therefore exposing consumers to the full swings. Griddy saw the problem developing and even urged its retail customers last weekend to switch to another provider. By Sunday, 20% managed to do so. But not Astrein.Also read| Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in Paris“We were stuck with Griddy and those astronomical prices,” he said by phone. “The failure in Texas as a whole to plan for this adequately is now a financial emergency for all of these customers on a program like Griddy.”But for some Griddy watchers, the furor comes as scant surprise after the scorching summer of 2019 also resulted in eye-watering bills. The phenomenon is unique to Texas, where the retail power industry is entirely deregulated.State ProbeTexas Governor Greg Abbott convened an emergency meeting for Saturday to address the latest spike. He said he’s working with members of the legislature to develop solutions to “ensure Texans are not on the hook for unreasonable spikes in their energy bills,” according to a statement.State Attorney General Ken Paxton has already opened a probe into the power failures and issued civil investigative demands to companies including Griddy.In a Feb. 18 blog post, Griddy said the prices were sky high because the Public Utility Commission of Texas forced wholesale prices to $9 a kilowatt-hour, about 300 times more than normal.“We know you are angry and so are we,” the blog said. “We intend to fight this for, and alongside, our customers for equity and accountability.”Also read| Covid-19 pandemic makes prostitution taboo in Nevada's legal brothelsGriddy referred a request for comment on Saturday to its blog post, and to Friday’s statement that it was seeking relief from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, and the PUCT for customers who were exposed to the high prices.As power is restored in Texas, new websites have sprung up to help organize potential class-action lawsuits. At least four of the new domains signal the target may be Ercot, which says it operates about 75% of the state’s electricity.Astrein plans to pay the bill out of his own funds and said Griddy hasn’t reached out to him with any relief or remedy plan. Griddy said on its website that starting next month, it will have “price protection” aimed at removing the risk from any future price events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-homes-hit-with-thousand-dollar-bills-after-winter-woes-101613864366141.html
21-02-2021||World||Trump eyeing return to spotlight with address to conservative meeting||Former US President Donald Trump will seek to return to the political spotlight in an address to a major meeting of conservatives, a source familiar with his plans said on Saturday, as the Republican plots his post-White House moves.Trump plans to speak to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 28, the last day of their meeting, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity."He’ll be talking about the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Also look for the 45th President to take on President (Joe) Biden’s disastrous amnesty and border policies," the source said.Trump's tumultuous four years in the White House ended shortly after he was impeached on a charge of inciting his supporters' deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, where lawmakers were gathering to certify Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election.After spending two months falsely claiming his election loss was the result of widespread fraud, Trump was acquitted in an impeachment trial held in the Senate after he left office. The 57-43 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a conviction.Read more: Warmer temps bring relief as cold-weary South starts cleanupTrump has expressed anger at the 17 Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate (swapped the order back for two reasons: It's chronological order, House voted before Senate and more people in House voted that way. If you want to keep it Senate first, need to reverse the order of impeach or convict later in sentence)who voted to impeach or convict him, and on Tuesday he aimed his rhetorical fire at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the nation's most senior elected Republican.The loss of both the White House to Biden and control of the Senate - which Democrats picked up in a pair of upset Georgia election runoff victories last month - has left Republicans on edge as they plot how to win back control of Congress in 2022.Trump and McConnell parted ways in the weeks after the November election, with Trump irked that the Kentucky Republican had recognized Biden as the winner in mid-December. They have not spoken since, a former White House official said this week.Trump called McConnell "a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack" this week and warned that if Republican senators stayed with him "they will not win again."The gap between Trump and McConnell widened when the latter declared after the Senate's acquittal of the former president that Trump was "practically and morally responsible" for the Capitol siege.A number of top Republicans who are considered possible candidates for the party's 2024 presidential nomination are also due to speak at CPAC, including Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota.Two notable Republicans from the Trump administration not on the CPAC speaker list are former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence.Another source told Reuters that Trump had rebuffed a request by Haley to meet with him recently after she was critical of him in a Politico article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-eyeing-return-to-spotlight-with-address-to-conservative-meeting-101613863934769.html

21-02-2021||World||Despite end of one-child policy, birth rates declined in China during Covid-19||Contrary to what population experts had expected, birth rates declined in China during the Covid-19 lockdown even though the communist nation has ended the one-child policy and given incentives to couples to have two children.When Covid-19 first broke out in China, many speculated and some government officials and demographers hoped that the widespread lockdowns, which confined millions of Chinese people to their homes, would yield a boom of quarantine babies, SupChina reported.Citing preliminary data, SupChina reported that the birth rates declined between 9 per cent and 32.6 per cent in the second half of 2020 compared with 2019 in some Chinese cities, including Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, and Hefei in Anhui Province.SupChina reported that the actual situation is likely to be less bleak than what these figures portray because they don't include children born in violation of China's family planning policies, which have been relaxed but not abolished in recent years.However, some researchers stressed that the data to fully gauge the number of lowered birth rates won't be available for a few months, many population experts are convinced that the pandemic had led to a sizable reduction in children born in 2020.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of July"Judging from the numbers that have been released so far, it's quite obvious that China's fertility rate has continued to drop. The downward trend is still in force," SupChina quoted Lu Jiehua, a sociology professor at Peking University. He also warned that in the long term, declining birth rates could leave China without enough workers, making the country unable to fund welfare programs for senior citizens.The country's birth rates have been steadily falling for years now, mostly because young people can't afford to have kids, and more financially independent women have decided to embrace a single, childless lifestyle.The combination of low fertility rates and an aging population has driven the government to roll out a wide range of policies to encourage births, including relaxing its decades-long one-child policy and offering extended benefits to couples having a second child, reported SupChina.In an article published in December last year, Civil Affairs Minister Li Jiheng urged the government to introduce more effective measures to boost the country's "dangerously low" birth rate.Moreover, in an online poll (in Chinese) involving nearly 57,000 Weibo users, Sina Finance found that more than 75 per cent of the respondents cited "high living costs" as the primary reason for their decisions to not have babies, reported SupChina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-end-of-one-child-policy-birth-rates-declined-in-china-during-covid19-101613864626445.html

21-02-2021||World||Iran considers EU-hosted informal meeting with US, says minister||Iran is studying a European Union proposal for an informal meeting between current members of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal and the United States, but has yet to respond to it, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Saturday.Iran and the United States have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the 2015 accord. Iran insists the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump's sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested earlier this month a way to overcome the U.S.-Iranian impasse over who goes first in returning to the nuclear deal, saying EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell could “synchronize” or “choreograph” the moves."We are studying Josep Borrell's proposal to hold an informal meeting of the 4 1 (nuclear deal members) with the United States and Iran, and we are consulting with our partners, including Russia and China, and we will respond to this proposal in the future," Araqchi said in an interview with state TV.Read more: Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in Paris"However, we believe a U.S return to the nuclear accord does not require a meeting and the only way for it is to lift the sanctions," Araqchi said.An Iranian government spokesman said earlier that Iran believes U.S. sanctions will soon be lifted despite continued "diplomatic wrangling" over reviving the nuclear deal, signalling Tehran's desire to end the impasse while not offering a new position.The White House said on Friday the United States plans to take no additional actions in response to pressure from Iran before potential talks with Tehran and major powers about returning to the deal.However, government spokesman Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Saturday:"We predict with confidence that diplomatic initiatives will result in a favourable outcome despite the diplomatic wrangling, which are a natural prelude to the return of the parties to their commitments, including the lifting of all sanctions in the near future."Under the deal with major powers, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal in 2018, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal's nuclear limits.Adding to pressure for a resolution to the impasse, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 23 to limit the sweeping access given to U.N. inspectors under the deal.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, arrived in Tehran on Saturday on a scheduled visit, Iran's envoy to the agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, said on Twitter.Grossi is due to discuss ways to work with Iran in light of the possibility of scaling back cooperation.Rabiei said the law "does not go against our commitment" to the agreement, nor is it "an obstacle to our appropriate response to American actions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-considers-eu-hosted-informal-meeting-with-us-says-minister-101613864458739.html
