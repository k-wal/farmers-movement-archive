To cope, some people are turning to bots that scan overwhelmed websites and send alerts on social media when slots open up.They've provided relief to families helping older relatives find scarce appointments. But not all public health officials think they're a good idea.In rural Buckland, Massachusetts, two hours west of Boston, a vaccine clinic canceled a day of appointments after learning that out-of-towners scooped up almost all of them in minutes thanks to a Twitter alert. In parts of New Jersey, health officials added steps to block bots, which they say favor the tech-savvy.What is a vaccine bot?Bots — basically autonomous programs on the web — have emerged amid widespread frustration with the online world of vaccine appointments.Though the situations vary by state, people often have to check multiple provider sites for available appointments. Weeks after the rollout began, demand for vaccines continues to outweigh supply, complicating the search even for eligible people as they refresh appointment sites to score a slot. When a coveted opening does appear, many find it can vanish midway through the booking.The most notable bots scan vaccine provider websites to detect changes, which could mean a clinic is adding new appointments. The bots are often overseen by humans, who then post alerts of the openings using Twitter or text notifications.A second type that's more worrisome to health officials are “scalper” bots that could automatically book appointments, potentially to offer them up for sale. So far, there's little evidence scalper bots are taking appointments.Are vaccine bot alerts helping?Yes, for the people who use them.“THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I GOT MY DAD AN APPOINTMENT! THANK YOU SO MUCH!” tweeted Benjamin Shover, of Stratford, New Jersey, after securing a March 3 appointment for his 70-year-old father with the help of an alert from Twitter account @nj_vaccine.The success came a month after signing up for New Jersey’s state online vaccine registry.“He’s not really tech-savvy,” Shover said of his father in an interview. “He’s also physically disabled, and has arthritis, so it’s tough for him to find an appointment online.”The creator of the bot, software engineer Kenneth Hsu, said his original motivation was to help get an appointment for his own parents-in-law. Now he and other volunteers have set a broader mission of assisting others locked out of New Jersey's confusing online appointment system.“These are people who just want to know they’re on a list somewhere and they are going to be helped,” Hsu said. “We want everyone vaccinated. We want to see our grandparents.”What do health officials think?The bots have met resistance in some communities. A bot that alerted Massachusetts residents to a clinic this week in sparsely populated Franklin County led many people from the Boston area to sign up for the slots. Local officials canceled all of the appointments, switched to a private system and spread the word through senior centers and town officials.“Our goal was to help our residents get their vaccination,” said Tracy Rogers, emergency preparedness manager for the Franklin Regional Council of Governments. “But 95% of the appointments we had were from outside Franklin County.”New Jersey's Union County put a CAPTCHA prompt in its scheduling system to confirm visitors are human, blocking efforts "to game” it with a bot, said Sebastian D’Elia, a county spokesperson.“When you post on Twitter, only a certain segment of society is going to see that,” he said. Even if they're trying to help someone else, D’Elia said others do not have the luxury of people who are advocating for them.But the person who created a bot that's now blocked in Union County, 24-year-old computer programmer Noah Marcus, said the current system isn't fair, either."The system was already favoring the tech-savvy and the person who can just sit in front of their computer all day, hitting refresh,” Marcus said.D’Elia said the county is also scheduling appointments by phone to help those who might have trouble online.How do they work?Marcus used the Python coding language to create a program that sifts through a vaccine clinic website, looking for certain keywords and tables that would indicate new appointments. Other bots use different techniques, depending on how the target website is built.This kind of information gathering, known as web scraping, remains a source of rancor. Essentially, scraping is collecting information from a website that its owner doesn’t want collected, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Some web services have taken web scrapers to court, saying scraping techniques violate the terms and conditions for accessing their sites. One case involving bots that scraped LinkedIn profiles is before the U.S. Supreme Court.“There’s disagreement in the courts about the legality of web-scraping,” Kerr said. “It’s a murky area. It’s probably legal but it’s not something we have certainty about.”What about scalper bots?The website for a mass vaccination site in Atlantic City, New Jersey says its online queue system — which keeps people waiting on the site as slots are allotted — is designed to prevent it from crashing and to stop bots from snapping up appointments “from real people.” But is that actually happening?Making a bot that can actually book appointments -- not just detect them -- would be a lot harder. And sites usually ask for information such as a person’s date of birth to make sure they are eligible.Pharmacy giants Walgreens and CVS, which are increasingly giving people shots across the US, have already said they've been working to prevent such activity.Walgreens said it is using cybersecurity techniques to detect and prevent bots so that “only authorized and eligible patients will have access to schedule a vaccine appointment.” CVS Health said it's encountered various types of automated activities and has designed its appointment-making system to validate legitimate users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-meet-the-vaccine-appointment-bots-and-their-foes-101614272844725.html
25-02-2021||World||Joe Biden revokes Trump-era ban on legal immigration||US President Joe Biden has revoked a ban on legal immigration that was ordered by his predecessor Donald Trump to protect American jobs for local citizens in an economy crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a proclamation issued on Wednesday, Biden said the ban “does not advance the interests of the United States”.“To the contrary, it harms the United States,” he added, “including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here. It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world.”The proclamation will allow people to begin applying for green cards with immediate effect, and not wait until the expiration of the ban in March.It did not revoke the ban on H-1B, L and other work visas. But they are set to lapse in March.Former president Trump had in April 2020 temporarily suspended for 60 days the entry of legal immigrants - affecting green cards - as layoffs had begun to spike. There were some exceptions, such as dependents of US citizens. In June, he had extended the suspension by another 60 days and added non-immigrants to the ban list, including holders of short-term work visas, such as H-1B and L visas used for intra-company transfers. He had further extended these bans in December for another 60 days.“Without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand,” Trump had said in the April proclamation. While the stated goal was to protect US jobs for Americans, critics said the former president was using the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue his hard-line immigration agenda under the “Buy American, Hire American” policy, ordered through an executive order he issued in April 2017. Among other things, his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, alleging it was been misused to bring foreign workers on lower wages in place of more expensive Americans.A sweeping immigration reforms legislation, which is backed by Biden, was introduced earlier this week in Congress. Since taking office in January, Biden has reversed many of his predecessor’s orders on an entire range of issues, from climate change to international engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-revokes-trump-era-ban-on-legal-immigration-101614273474127.html
25-02-2021||World||Majority of Americans support $15 minimum wage, poll shows||A majority of Americans support the idea of more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 per hour, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Thursday as Senate Democrats await a ruling on whether they can tuck that measure into a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.Democrats, who narrowly control the House of Representatives and Senate, are trying to pass the progressive policy without Republican votes through a maneuver known as reconciliation, which allows them to act with just a simple 51-vote majority rather than the chamber's normal 60-vote requirement.The Senate's parliamentarian on Thursday is expected to decide whether the rules will allow them to use the coronavirus spending bill to enact a sweeping wage policy.Regardless of the ruling, the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 from its current $7.25 is broadly popular, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 59% of respondents said they supported the idea, with 34% opposing it.When told that "raising the minimum wage should lift some families out of poverty, but government economists also expect it could eliminate some low income jobs, potentially making some families worse off," 55% of respondents said they supported it.Even if the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, rules that the minimum wage can be passed through reconciliation, it will not change the fact that the proposal faces an uphill battle in the Senate.Democrats are not united in support with two of their number - Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - against the idea.There is broader support in the Senate to raising the minimum wage by a lesser amount, and not through reconciliation.Two Senate Republicans, Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, on Tuesday proposed increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States between Feb. 18 and Feb. 24. It gathered responses from 4,430 adults, including 2,158 who identified as Democrats and 1,482 who identified as Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 3 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-americans-support-15-minimum-wage-poll-shows-101614272910709.html

25-02-2021||World||UK work visas plunged in pandemic as investors stayed away||The number of work-related visas granted to enter Britain plunged 35% last year during the coronavirus pandemic, led by a drop in applications from high-value individuals.The figures released by the Home Office coincided with the worst economic slump in three centuries and a surge in unemployment, with lockdowns to control the virus shutting vast sections of the economy.“Employers have hired fewer workers from abroad during the pandemic, given that domestic unemployment is rising and many businesses are struggling,” said Madeleine Sumpton, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Even in the current context, there could still be some industries that face recruitment challenges such as medicine and nursing.”The total number of work-related visas declined to 125,176 last year, which was the lowest since at least 2005. Intra-company transfer visas fell 63%. The number of grants of a Tier 1 visa for those seeking to invest at least 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) dropped by 70% to 1,669.That’s likely to fuel concern about the impact on the economy and productivity if highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs continue to shun the U.K. once the crisis over.A separate analysis of government data by the British Ports Association showed arrivals by sea were the lowest since 1962. Those figures counted short sea journeys between the U.K. and countries such as France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.The total fell 63% to 6.9 million from 2019, according to the analysis of data from the U.K. Department for Transport . The lobby group attributed the trends to a lack of public appetite to travel during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-work-visas-plunged-in-pandemic-as-investors-stayed-away-101614267676998.html
25-02-2021||World||Pakistan stays in FATF ‘grey list’, given June deadline to implement action plan||Pakistan was retained in the “grey list” of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which examined its efforts to counter terror financing and money laundering. The decision was taken at the meeting of the multilateral watchdog on Thursday."Pakistan should continue to work on implementing the three remaining items in its action plan to address its strategically important deficiencies, namely by: demonstrating that TF investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of designated persons or entities; demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions and demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf," the FATF said in a statement to.The anti-terror financing organisation noted today that Islamabad has now largely addressed 24 of the 27 action items and gave Islamabad time till June 2021 to complete the full action plan.FATF president Marcus Pleyer said that Pakistan has made "significant progress" but "some serious deficiencies remain" and all these deficiencies are "in the realm of terror financing". Pleyer added that Pakistan "remains under increased monitoring"."I strongly urge the completion of the action plan," he said.The FATF concluded its three-day virtual plenary meeting today, following several rounds of meetings of its working groups since February 11.Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list since June 2018.A research paper by an Islamabad-based independent think tank estimated that Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF's decision to keep the country on its grey list, the Express Tribune reported. It further reported that the losses are worked out on the basis of a decrease in consumption expenditures, foreign direct investment and exports.At its last plenary in October 2020, FATF concluded that Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan but warned the country that it could not be given “forever” to address outstanding issues. As all deadlines for the action plan had expired, FATF had urged Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by February 2021.Some European nations had supported the stance to keep Pakistan in the grey list also said that Islamabad has not fully implemented all the points of a plan of action set by the FATF.On Tuesday, a group of protesters had gathered at the FATF headquarters in Paris to persuade the anti-terror financing organisation to place Pakistan on the blacklist. The protesters said they want to highlight Islamabad's continued support to terror groups and terror financing."Pakistani courts recently ordered release Omar Sheikh, the terrorist who killed Daniel Pearl. Pakistani judiciary is compromised. It's working on dictates of Pakistani military which sponsors terrorism," tweeted South Asia Press, one of the groups which was part of then protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-stays-in-fatf-grey-list-given-june-deadline-to-implement-action-plan-101614270404068.html

The driver will still have to pay a $13,612 fine and some $925,660 to the families of the victims.The tour bus packed with foreigners was heading from Oman back to the UAE in the summer of 2019 when the driver took a wrong highway exit and veered into an overhanging steel barrier, killing 17 people, including 12 Indians. Several others were injured.The 54-year-old driver had accepted responsibility for the crash, the National reported, saying he was momentarily blinded by the sun's glare. He later appealed the verdict, arguing that the steel barrier was wrongly placed.Among the 31 people on the ill-fated bus were also citizens of Bangladesh, Germany and the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sentence-reduced-for-driver-in-fatal-dubai-tour-bus-crash-that-killed-12-indians-101614270548414.html

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday released the first 360-degree panorama taken by Mastcam-Z, a dual-camera system equipped with a zoom function.The Mastcam-Z sent 142 individual images after rotating its mast 360 degrees on the third Martian day of the mission and the US space agency stitched them together to create the instrument's first 360-degree panorama.The zoomable pair of cameras aboard the Perseverance rover has the capability of taking high-definition video, panoramic colour and 3D images of the Martian surface.The first high-definition panorama reveals the crater rim and cliff face of Jezero Crater, considered as an ancient lakebed formed billions of years ago.The two cameras of Mastcam-Z are mounted on the rover’s mast at the eye level of a 2 metres tall person and provide stereo vision. The cameras can produce colour images with a quality similar to that of a consumer digital HD camera. Another processed image of a wind-carved rock shows how much detail is captured by the camera systems. “We’re nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,” Jim Bell, the instrument’s principal investigator at Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration, said in a statement.The navigation cameras, known as Navcams, aboard the Perseverance rover also captured a panorama over the weekend which provided a good look at the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, one of the instruments on the rover’s stowed arm.The Mastcam-Z team will discuss the new panorama during a question and answer session at 2.30am IST on February 26. It will be aired live on Nasa television and the space agency’s website and social media accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highdefinition-zoomable-view-of-mars-captured-by-nasa-s-perseverance-rover-101614266700416.html
25-02-2021||World||US government revises fourth quarter GDP up slightly to 4.1%||The economy grew at a slightly faster pace in the final three months of 2020 than first thought, ending a year in which the overall economy shrank more than it had in the past seven decades.Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic health — grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the fourth quarter, up from an initial estimate of 4% growth, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.The revision does alter the nation's annual GDP which shrank 3.5%, the largest decline since 1946 when the U.S. demobilised after World War II.However, economists believe 2021 will see a significant rebound, helped by further government stimulus, more widespread distribution of vaccines and continued low-interest rate policies from the Federal Reserve.Some expect GDP growth in the current quarter could top 9% and for the year, economists are forecasting GDP growth perhaps as high as 6%. That would be the fastest annual GDP growth since the economy expanded 7.2% in 1984 when Ronald Reagan was president.The new forecasts represent a significant rebound in optimism in the past month as coronavirus cases have started to come down, sparking a big jump in retail sales.“You have massive government stimulus, low interest rates from the Fed and the vaccine supply is growing,” said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “The economy is beginning to fire on all cylinders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-revises-fourth-quarter-gdp-up-slightly-to-41-101614264800702.html

Consumer advocates have called for more stringent regulation of utilities and a review of retail marketing plans.Up to 48% of the state's power generation was offline at times last week. Utilities were ordered to cut power to prevent a larger catastrophe, Bill Magness, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state's grid operator, said on Wednesday.ERCOT, whose board is appointed by the state Public Utility Commission, faces lawsuits by customers and a generator claiming damages from misrepresentation and lack of planning. Six of its 15 directors resigned this week and a nominee withdrew before taking a seat.Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday said public anger was justified and pledged proposals to increase power supplies and to protect those residents hit with enormous power bills. He blamed ERCOT, saying it should have acted faster to prevent generators from falling offline.RETAIL DEFAULTS AHEADOf the about 100 retail electric providers in Texas, a quarter are at risk of default on multi-million dollar service charges levied by ERCOT. Some may sell customers to larger firms to cover costs, stifling retail competition, said Mark Foster, an attorney and former special counsel to the state's Public Utility Commission."They call it the blood week," Foster said. One of his clients, electricity marketer Young Energy LLC, faces a $19 million bill for services that cost $37,000 the prior month, he said. "There will be a significant decrease in competition for the consumer," he said.Electricity failures from storms and wildfires are raising costs for insurance providers, compounding residential and business damages, said Andrew Siffert, a vice president at reinsurance broker BMS Group.By one count, the winter storm that hit Texas spawned $18 billion in insured losses across 20 U.S. states affected. On average, winter storms cause $3 billion in insured losses.Siffert said the storm, wildfires and hurricanes have insurers pushing for more resilient networks to stop their losses from ballooning."Time and time again we see during a disaster the long-term lack of electricity compounds the overall insured loss. The insurance industry needs a seat at the table," he said.(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Christopher Cushing)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-lawmakers-kick-off-investigation-into-deadly-power-blackout-101614260632695.html
25-02-2021||World||China approves two more domestic Covid-19 vaccines, increasing number to 4||China's National Medical Products Administration said on Thursday that it had approved two more Covid-19 vaccines for public use, increasing the number of domestic vaccines approved in China to four.The two newly approved vaccines are made by CanSino Biologics Inc and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an affiliate of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm).They join a vaccine from Sinovac Biotech approved earlier this month, and another from Sinopharm's Beijing unit approved last year.So far, China has not approved Covid-19 vaccines developed by Western drug makers.Sinopharm's Wuhan unit said on Wednesday its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 72.51% against the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus, citing interim analysis of late-stage clinical trial data, without offering more details.It is one of two candidates from Sinopharm that have entered Phase III clinical trials overseas, and was earlier given to a limited group of people at higher infection risk.The four approved Chinese vaccines can be stored at normal freezer temperatures, making them a potentially attractive option for developing countries which might have difficulty deploying vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that require much colder temperatures for longer-term storage.China has been exporting the Sinovac and earlier Sinopharm vaccines to countries around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-two-more-domestic-covid-19-vaccines-increasing-number-to-4-101614262217830.html

US regulators announced Wednesday that Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine offers strong protection against severe Covid-19. It’s expected to be approved soon by the FDA.Fauci warns people not to hold off on getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while waiting for the slightly more effective Pfizer or Moderna shots.He says it’s a race “between the virus and getting vaccines into people” and “the longer one waits not getting vaccinated, the better chance the virus has to get a variant or a mutation.”Fauci says public health officials are always concerned about virus variants and stressed following public health measures of wearing masks and social distancing.The predominant coronavirus variant in the United States is from Britain. Fauci says the vaccines distributed in the US “clearly can take care of that particular strain.”President Joe Biden plans to distribute millions of face masks to Americans in communities hard-hit by the coronavirus.It’s part of his effort to ensure equity in the government’s response to the pandemic. Biden is aiming to reach underserved communities and those bearing the brunt of the outbreak. His plan will distribute masks not through the mail, but through Federally Qualified Community Health Centers and the nation’s food bank and food pantry systems.The White House announced it expects more than 25 million American-made cloth masks in both adult and kid sizes will be distributed.Biden has asked everyone to wear face masks for the first 100 days of his term. He’s also required mask-wearing in federal buildings and on public transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-asks-americans-to-take-whatever-vaccine-is-available-101614261222924.html
25-02-2021||World||China celebrates official end of extreme poverty, lauds Xi||The ruling Communist Party is celebrating the official end of extreme poverty in China with a propaganda campaign that praises President Xi Jinping’s role, part of efforts to cement his image as a history-making leader who is reclaiming his country’s rightful place as a global power.The propaganda apparatus has been linking national successes to Xi, including fighting the coronavirus, China’s rise as a technology creator and December’s successful lunar mission to bring back moon rocks.The party announced in November, with little fanfare, that China no longer had anyone in extreme poverty. That was down from an official estimate of almost 99 million living on annual incomes of less than 2,300 yuan ($355) per person a decade ago.The full-scale propaganda campaign launched this month has filled state-controlled newspapers and airwaves with reports on the anti-poverty milestone and Xi's personal role in it.They credit Xi with launching an initiative shortly after taking power in 2012 that enabled China to beat by a decade the 2030 target set by the World Bank for eliminating extreme poverty. A report by the party newspaper People’s Daily this week on the “historic leap” refers to Xi by his full name and title as party leader 121 times.“General Secretary Xi Jinping has stood at the strategic height of building a well-off society in an all-around way and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” the newspaper said.The event gives the ruling party a political trophy ahead of this year’s celebration of the 100th anniversary of its 1921 founding. It comes at a time when China's economy is growing again following the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other areas are still struggling with outbreaks.The party said it reached the milestone despite having to take the unprecedented step of shutting down most of China’s economy in early 2020 to fight the coronavirus.On Thursday, Xi cited anti-poverty work as a sign of the effectiveness of the ruling party’s system.“We have finished the arduous task of eradicating absolute poverty and created a miracle that shall go down in history,” Xi said at a ceremony honoring people who worked on the initiative.Xi presented medals, certificates and plaques to 10 individuals and 10 groups honored as anti-poverty “role models.”He acknowledged the “material foundation” built up over four decades of market-style reforms that have transformed China into the world’s second-largest economy and a middle-income society but mentioned no other officials or earlier leaders by name.The event gives Xi, who has amassed more personal power than any leader since Mao Zedong, Communist China's founder, a new opportunity to assert his historical importance.Abroad, Xi is pursuing an assertive foreign policy that has increased China's diplomatic influence but roiled relations with its neighbors and with the United States and Europe.The poverty milestone gives Xi ammunition to shore up power that some foreign analysts suggested was eroded by the coronavirus outbreak that began in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019.Anti-poverty campaigns also are aimed at narrowing the politically volatile gulf between an elite who have profited most from economic reform and the poor majority.Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, and then-Premier Wen Jiabao started that process by stepping up spending on rural schools and health care to spread prosperity from the thriving, export-powered east coast.China’s official definition of extreme poverty is an income per person of 11 yuan ($1.70) per day. That is lower than the World Bank’s standard of $1.90, but the National Bureau of Statistics says that due to differences in rural living costs, the Chinese standard is slightly higher.In some areas, low-income ethnic minority communities have been moved out of remote valleys into newly built towns. In others, officials went door to door signing up poor families for job training, grants to start businesses and other aid.Nearly 10 million people moved into new homes and those of 27 million more have been renovated, according to Xi. He said the government has spent a total of 1.6 trillion yuan ($250 billion).Average income per person among the “rural underprivileged” rose from 2,982 yuan ($356) in 2015 to 10,740 yuan ($1,665) last year, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Some experts suggest China might be less successful than it claims because it is still using standards for the poorest countries long after graduating to middle-income status. The World Bank’s middle-income poverty standard is income of $5.50 per person per day.In a report in January for the Brookings Institution, former World Bank expert Indermit Gill argued China is almost as well off as the United States was in 1960 when it became a high-income country. But Gill said that based on the U.S. income standard from that era, as many as 90% of China's people would be considered poor.“If our numbers are correct, China is years — if not decades — behind schedule,” Gill wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-celebrates-official-end-of-extreme-poverty-lauds-xi-101614258069773.html
25-02-2021||World||Israel, Bahrain leaders discuss Iran, possible vaccine plant||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Bahrain's Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa on Thursday discussed Iran and the possible involvement of the Gulf state in establishing a vaccine plant in Israel, the two countries said.Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates formalised ties with Israel on Sept. 15 in part over shared concerns about Iran, in a deal forged by former U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, a move praised by Israel which has objected to the accord. His successor, President Joe Biden, wants to rejoin the deal.But in the week since Washington offered to talk with Tehran about reviving the nuclear deal, Iran has curbed U.N. monitoring and threatened to boost its uranium enrichment. Tehran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons.An Israeli official said on Tuesday that Israel hopes to prevent personal tension between Netanyahu, who is seeking re-election on March 23, and Biden over their differences on Iran policy by delegating talks on the topic to their senior staff.Netanyahu and Khalifa both released statements about their telephone call on Thursday but only the Bahraini announcement mentioned Iran.Their conversation stressed the importance for the "countries of the region to take part in any talks about Iran's nuclear file," the kingdom's state media office said on Twitter.Netanyahu's office said he spoke with Khalifa about visiting Bahrain once coronavirus restrictions would allow it."The Bahraini regent also stated that he was interested in examining the possibility of Bahrain joining an investment in a vaccine manufacturing plant that is planned to be established in Israel together with other countries," the statement said.Netanyahu said on Wednesday he was in talks with the heads of Pfizer and Moderna to open facilities in Israel.

Reuters has not seen the letter.The Dubai government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cambridgeshire police confirmed it had received a letter, dated February 2018, in relation to the case and that it was part of an "ongoing review".Latifa, 35, is herself the subject of international concern. In a video message filmed in a bathroom and obtained by the BBC, she said she was being held captive in a barricaded villa.The UAE last week said Latifa was being cared for at home by family and medical professionals.The two women's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has rejected findings by a London High Court judge who said last year that he accepted as proved allegations that the sheikh had ordered the abductions of his daughters.Britain has called on the United Arab Emirates to show proof that Latifa was still alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubais-latifa-urged-uk-police-to-reopen-sister-s-kidnap-case-report-101614258779784.html

"Nobody has any idea what is actually in these vials...The best case is it's just not working, in the worst case it's a very serious issue."The official, who noted that most of the shots offered to EU governments by traders were purportedly the AstraZeneca vaccine, compared the situation to the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 when criminal exploited a shortage of masks and other protective equipment.A second official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Commission was worried about "ghost" vaccines."It is unclear whether these are genuine vaccine doses or if we are just talking about salt water in small vials," the official told Reuters.The EU had warned already that vaccine fraud was on the rise, with fake doses circulating on the market, but the extent of the problem has been unclear until now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fraudsters-offer-400-million-ghost-covid-vaccines-in-eu-officials-101614254344777.html

He said the new batch was ordered under an agreement between the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) of Sri Lanka and the Serum Institute of India.The distribution of vaccines will start on Friday.India gifted 500,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine which kicked off Sri Lanka’s vaccine rollout in late January. The vaccines were given to the frontline workers and the security personnel.The government has placed an order for 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India at a cost of USD 52.5 million and a further 3.5 million doses directly from AstraZeneca Institute of UK under the COVAX programme.Health officials here said the next batch of the Indian order would be coming in March.Ramesh Pathirana, who is also the Minister of Plantations, earlier said Sri Lanka is likely to go only with the AstraZeneca vaccines for the second phase of vaccination as the Chinese and Russian vaccines are not ready yet.Last month, India announced it will send Covid-19 vaccines under grant assistance to Sri Lanka and seven other countries - Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles, Afghanistan and Mauritius.India is one of the world's biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring coronavirus vaccines.Sri Lanka has recorded more than 80,500 coronavirus cases so far with 450 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-receives-500-000-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-india-101614256611747.html

It had retained executive recruitment firm Russell Reynolds to look for Zaks replacement as it hopes to get more drugs and vaccines to the market over the next few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-expects-18-4-billion-in-covid-19-vaccine-sales-in-2021-101614257442779.html
25-02-2021||World||Pfizer-BioNTech testing booster of their Covid-19 vaccine in new trial||Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE said on Thursday they are testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the virus.They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a vaccine modified to protect specifically against the highly transmissible new variant found in South Africa and elsewhere, known as B.1.351, as a second arm of the same study.The companies believe their current two-dose vaccine will work against the South African variant as well as one found in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. But the studies will allow the vaccine makers to be prepared if and when more protection is necessary, they said."The rate of mutations in the current virus is higher than expected," Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview."It's a reasonable probability that we would end up with regular boosts. And for potent vaccines, it may be that you need to do a strain change every few years, but not necessarily every year."In the first stage of the first arm of the study, a third 30 microgram dose will be given to as many as 144 people who received the vaccine 6 to 12 months ago in the original Phase I safety trial.Assuming regulatory approval, a redesigned vaccine would also be tested, both as a booster dose in people who have been vaccinated and in people who had not yet received the vaccine, Dolsten said.The trial would not seek to measure the efficacy of the vaccine like their large Phase III trial last year. Instead it would measure the antibody response and study whether blood from recipients can neutralize the new coronavirus variants, as well as the safety of a third dose.The United States discovered its first case of the South African variant in January and it has since turned up in 14 states, according to U.S. government data. Several studies suggest it is more resistant to existing vaccines than other variants of the coronavirus.Pfizer's Dolsten said that mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and BioNTech's create a potent response. But the immune response may wane over time.He believes that a third dose of their vaccine will create a similar or better response than the second dose, and could be the logical next step for staying ahead of circulating variants."We think our vaccine is robustly active against all strains," Dolsten said, noting that the companies "want to be prepared for all options and be data driven - led by science."Dolsten said the new trial would likely be predominantly conducted in the United States.Moderna Inc said on Wednesday it is also working with U.S. government scientists to study an experimental booster shot that targets the variant first found in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-testing-booster-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-in-new-trial-101614257178823.html
25-02-2021||World||Five things shaping Britain's financial rulebooks after Brexit||Britain is conducting a review of its financial rulebooks and policies to see how it can keep its 130 billion pound ($184 billion) finance sector competitive after Brexit left it largely cut off from the European Union.The government is due to issue papers in the coming days outlining its approach to financial technology (fintech) and capital markets, while further down the line it's expected to propose changes to the funds and insurance sectors.Here are five things set to shape the City of London financial hub following its loss of access to the EU:BIG BANG DEBATEBritain's finance ministry is reviewing financial regulation and insurance capital rules, with minister Rishi Sunak raising the prospect of a "Big Bang 2.0" to maintain the City's competitiveness, a reference to liberalisation of trading in the 1980s.But it's unclear how far any deregulation could go given that Britain says it won't undermine global standards.UK Finance, a banking body, wants a formal remit for regulators to ditch rules that put them at a competitive disadvantage globally. Insurers want cuts in capital requirements to free up cash for green and long term investments.But the Bank of England says the City must not become an "anything goes" financial centre, and that insurers hold the right amount of capital.Cross-border firms want to avoid Britain diverging from international norms as this would add to compliance costs.City veterans say Britain should focus on allowing firms to hire globally, and ensuring that regulators respond nimbly and proportionately to crypto-assets, sustainable finance, long-term investing and restructurings after COVID-19.COPYING NEW YORKLondon has fallen behind New York in attracting company flotations and a government-backed review of listing rules is likely to recommend allowing "dual class" shares and a lower "free float", perhaps for a limited period.Dual class shares are stocks in the same company with different voting rights, while "free float" refers to the proportion of a company's shares that are publicly available.The potential changes could attract more tech and fintech companies whose founders typically want to retain a large degree of control.It could also recommend making it easier for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) - businesses that raise money on stock markets to buy other companies - an area in which New York has also dominated, with Amsterdam catching up fast.UK asset managers warn that strong corporate governance standards could be diluted by tinkering with listing rules.BEYOND SANDBOXESBritain is home to one of the world's biggest innovative fintech sectors, its "sandboxes" - which allow fintech firms to test new products on real consumers under regulatory supervision - copied across the world. But Brexit means Britain has to work harder to attract and retain fintechs as they will no longer have direct access to the world's biggest trading area.A government-backed review to buttress the sector is due to report back on Friday with recommendations that could include cutting red tape for fintechs that want to recruit staff from across the world, and make listing in Britain more attractive.Other ideas could include helping fledgling fintech navigate government departments and regulators more easily, along with ways of boosting funding for start-ups.FUNDS ARE THE FUTUREBritain is reviewing how to make itself a more competitive place for listing investment funds, a core tool for bringing fresh capital into markets.UK-based asset managers run many funds listed in the EU, but this global system of cross-border management known as delegation could be tightened up by the bloc.Having more funds listed in Britain would also mean that the shares they hold would be traded in London. Billions of euros in trading euro shares have left the UK for Amsterdam since Brexit due to the bloc's restrictions on where funds can trade shares.THINK GLOBALAs the City will get only limited access at best to the EU, industry officials say it makes more sense to focus on getting better access to other markets like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, while at the same time keeping the UK financial market open to the world, including the EU.Negotiations between Britain and Switzerland for a "mutual recognition" deal in financial rules is the way to go, industry officials say. Better global access would also keep the City ahead of EU centres like Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-shaping-britain-s-financial-rulebooks-after-brexit-101614255738878.html

25-02-2021||World||African Union backs India's call to waive IP rights on Covid-19 drugs||The African Union is backing calls for drugmakers to waive some intellectual property rights on Covid-19 medicines and vaccines to speed up their rollout to poor countries, the head of its disease control body said on Thursday.South Africa and India, which both manufacture drugs and vaccines, made the proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) last year, arguing that intellectual property (IP) rules were hindering the urgent scale-up of vaccine production and provision of medical products to some patients.They have faced opposition from some developed nations, but the backing of the African Union (AU) may give renewed impetus for the push to relax IP rules.John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference that IP transfer was a "win-win for everybody" that would address the huge inequalities in global public health.He gave two examples where the developing world had suffered because of restricted access to medicines: the swine flu pandemic in the late 2000s and HIV/AIDS in the 1990s."In 1996, HIV drugs were available, and we saw how mortality in the developed world decreased drastically. But it would take 10 years before those drugs were accessible in Africa in any meaningful way," he said."In between, 12 million Africans died, so I just use those numbers to say: any IP transfer will be beneficial to everybody, because nobody wants to sit back and be proud of that sad event ... We want to be on the right side of history."Nkengasong added the Africa CDC's regulatory taskforce had approved two versions of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a day after Ghana received its first AstraZeneca doses from global vaccine distribution facility COVAX.He said the developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine had submitted a "full dossier" of data to the Africa CDC and that in the coming days an expert panel would review the data and make a pronouncement."We have not received dossiers yet from China colleagues, but we remain optimistic that they will submit to us," he continued.Several countries on the continent, including Egypt, Zimbabwe and Senegal, have already started rolling out Chinese Covid-19 shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-union-backs-india-s-call-to-waive-ip-rights-on-covid-19-drugs-101614254509127.html

25-02-2021||World||YouTube's new feature will allow parents to choose what children can watch||Online video-sharing platform YouTube is launching a new feature that would let parents control what their children can watch.As per The Verge, YouTube's upcoming feature called 'supervised experiences', will come with a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the video platform.According to a blog post, YouTube hopes that the filter will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app.The mode will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out "in the coming months."Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account.There is the 'Explore' level, which YouTube said is "generally suitable" for kids nine and up. 'Explore More', which is meant for kids 13 and up, and 'Most of YouTube', which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content.In the US, and most other countries, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts.It is not clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube said the 'Explore' level will have "vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more."As the name suggests, the 'Explore More' level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned 'Explore' categories. The company said that 'Most of YouTube' will contain "sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens."YouTube's 'supervised experiences' feature is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it will not be perfect, admitting that it "will make mistakes," which have been seen happen with the Kids app. As such, parents shouldn't think of it as a "set it and forget it" solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtubes-new-feature-will-allow-parents-to-choose-what-children-can-watch-101614245256256.html
25-02-2021||World||World’s top meat supplier envisions separate plant-based company||Demand for faux burgers is growing so rapidly that JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat supplier, said it will likely set up a new global company focused solely on plant-based products.Meat from animals will be a pricey luxury in the future, and people will have to turn to vegetable-derived alternatives, which will be cheaper, JBS’s Chief Executive Officer Gilberto Tomazoni told Bloomberg in an interview. In addition, the world’s population is booming and expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. The amount of meat needed to satisfy the world’s protein needs won’t be possible to produce.“Plant-based will help us to reduce this protein gap with more affordable products compared with animal protein, which will be more premium,” Tomazoni said. “We see plant-based as an independent business in the future.”Brazil-based JBS is just one of many sprawling, legacy food companies trying to up their meat-substitutes game as burgers and sausages made from plant proteins become mainstream. Consumer demand has soared after startups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods popularized veggie burgers that imitate real beef. The likes of McDonald’s and Starbucks have added alternative meat items to their menus.JBS, like U.S. rival Tyson Foods Inc., entered the plant-based meat market in 2019, and regional teams across the globe developed products. The new company Tomazoni envisions would gather all those regional businesses in a global enterprise.The company already has a sizable footprint, with about 57% of the plant-based burger market in Brazil. In Europe, its Moy Park subsidiary supplies faux chicken burgers. It also has 10 plant-based products in more than 3,000 U.S. stores under the OZO brand, where sales rose 300% last year.It will still be a challenge to compete with companies like Beyond Meat that created the fake meat craze. Investment money has been pouring into alternative protein startups, which raised a record $2.4 billion of funding in 2020, according to market researcher CB Insights.“We have the basis to grow on plant-based: innovation capacity, investments in research, agreements with global companies for ingredient supplies, presence in retail,” Tomazoni said.For now, JBS’s focus is developing new products and trying to better understand the market, Tomazoni said. While it’s still unclear how much plant-based meat will grow, one thing is for sure: it’s not just a niche market. Even now, rising middle-class populations in Asia and Africa are clamoring for more protein in their diets. Protein production must rise 70% in 30 years to meet demand, Tomazoni said, citing UN figures.“This is a long-term race,” he said. “Consumers will have more choices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-top-meat-supplier-envisions-separate-plant-based-company-101614248919431.html
25-02-2021||World||UK companies say Brexit paperwork is biggest headache stressing supply chains||British companies say new customs forms required following Brexit are the biggest hurdle to trading with the rest of the world, official data show.About 38% of exporters and 39% of importers identified form-filling as their main hurdle, according to a survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics. While half of exporters reported no difficulties trading internationally, the concerns on paperwork exceeded those about disruption at UK borders and transportation costs.The findings add to evidence that friction at ports is weighing on Britain’s ability to trade following after the nation left the European Union’s common customs system. Importers are warning they face even more red tape when new regulations come into force in April and July.Almost a third of the companies moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, in the past two weeks, almost a third said volumes had fallen.Separate research by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found that more than half of companies reported longer delays since the start of the year. Those totaled at least two to three days for imports.“Delays are continuing to get longer, putting more and more pressure on the UK’s supply chains,” said John Glen, an economist for CIPS. “The knock-on impact of these delays will trickle far down the supply chain and ultimately result in stock shortages and inflated prices for consumers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-companies-say-brexit-paperwork-is-biggest-headache-stressing-supply-chains-101614252441603.html

Some 1,176 previously issued boil water notices had been rescinded, he added.Once the current crisis is over, TCEQ plans to examine the ongoing experience to prevent such a disruption from taking place in the future, TCEQ Executive Director Toby Baker told Reuters on Wednesday.Texas Governor Greg Abbott pledged on Wednesday to overhaul the state's electric grid operator after a massive blackout left residents without heat, power or water for days.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the flow of power to about 90% of state residents, has faced sharp criticism over its failure to prepare for severe cold. Outages caused billions of dollars of damages to homes and businesses.Six ERCOT directors have resigned and a board nominee declined a seat in the wake of sharp criticism of the group's performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-1-3-million-texans-still-grappling-with-water-supply-disruptions-101614253620125.html
25-02-2021||World||Recent drone attack on Saudi royal palace launched from Iraq||Explosive-laden drones that targeted Saudi Arabia's royal palace in the kingdom's capital last month were launched from inside Iraq, a senior Iran-backed militia official in Baghdad and a US official said.Speaking to The Associated Press this week, the militia official said three drones were launched from Iraqi-Saudi border areas by a relatively unknown Iran-backed faction in Iraq and crashed into the royal complex in Riyadh on January 23, exacerbating regional tensions.Attacks on the Saudi capital have been sporadic amid the kingdom's yearslong war against neighbouring Yemen's Houthi rebels. Earlier this month, the rebels targeted an airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia with bomb-laden drones, causing a civilian plane on the tarmac to catch fire.The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, however, denied carrying out an attack that targeted Saudi Arabia's Yamama Palace on January 23.The comments by the senior Iraqi militia official mark the first time an Iran-backed group has acknowledged that Iraq was the origin of the attack and points to the challenge Baghdad faces in halting attacks by Iranian-backed militia factions in Iraq.It followed a responsibility claim allegedly issued by a little-known group called Awliya Wa'ad al-Haq, or “The True Promise Brigades,” that circulated on social media, calling it retaliation for a suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State group in a main Baghdad shopping district on January 21.The militia official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the attack, said the drones came “in parts from Iran and were assembled in Iraq, and were launched from Iraq.” He did not disclose where along the border the drones were launched and did not provide more details about the group claiming the attack.Iran-backed groups have splintered significantly since the Washington-directed strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad more than a year ago. Both were key in commanding and controlling a wide array of Iran-backed groups operating in Iraq.Since their deaths, militias have become increasingly unruly and disparate. Some Washington-based analysts argue the militias have become splintered only to allow them to claim attacks under different names to mask their involvement.A US official said Washington believes the January 23 attack on the Yamama Palace was launched from inside Iraq. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate or say how the U.S. came to this conclusion.An Iraqi official speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the US intelligence was shared with Iraq's government.Launching a strike from Iraq would pose a challenge to Saudi air defense, now focused on threats from Iran to the northeast and Yemen from the south. Such drones also are small enough and fly low enough to the ground to not be picked up on radar.The attack comes as Iraq seeks to deepen economic ties with Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over a variety of investment projects. Last week, President Barham Salih visited the United Arab Emirates and Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein visited Saudi Arabia this week, apparently to discuss the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recent-drone-attack-on-saudi-royal-palace-launched-from-iraq-101614253054104.html
25-02-2021||World||German police commissioner charged with sharing Hitler pictures||German prosecutors said on Thursday they had filed sedition and hate speech charges against a police commissioner suspected of sharing pictures of Adolf Hitler and images showing hostility towards Muslims, and possessing illegal weapons and explosives.The 46-year-old suspect, who served at the police headquarters in the city of Wiesbaden, had shared pictures of the Nazi leader performing the Hitler salute with 30 others, including police officers, on WhatsApp, they said.German police and security agencies have faced accusations of not doing enough to unearth potentially violent nationalists in their ranks.This is a sensitive issue in a country where awareness of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazis under Hitler is strong.The domestic intelligence agency said in a report last year that less than 1% of Germany's police force, security agencies and military personnel espouse far-right world views and sympathies. The report was part of a wider inquiry into far-right extremism in the civil service."The suspect shared pictures showing Adolf Hitler in uniform with an arm band bearing a swastika and performing the so-called Hitler salute with an outstretched right arm as well as images that convey hostility toward people with dark skin and Muslims," Frankfurt Senior Public Prosecutor Nadja Niesen said.She said the suspect had shared the images in late 2018, and officers found firearms, heavy weapons and explosives during a search of his residence a year later. She did not say why charges against him were being filed only now or how the suspect had pleaded.The suspect's brother, who was also a police commissioner and left the force voluntarily, is due to go on trial in April on charges of sharing illegal symbols, possessing illegal weapons and sharing secret police information with civilians, the prosecutor said.A third police commissioner, who has been relieved of his duties, has been charged with sharing sensitive information from the police computer systems with civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-police-commissioner-charged-with-sharing-hitler-pictures-101614252591791.html

This initial change will roll out by the end of the second quarter, and the majority of papers will not require extra vetting, she said.Reuters reported in December that Google had introduced a "sensitive topics" review for studies involving dozens of issues, such as China or bias in its services. Internal reviewers had demanded that at least three papers on AI be modified to refrain from casting Google technology in a negative light, Reuters reported.Jeff Dean, Google's senior vice president overseeing the division, said Friday that the "sensitive topics" review "is and was confusing" and that he had tasked a senior research director, Zoubin Ghahramani, with clarifying the rules, according to the recording.Ghahramani, a University of Cambridge professor who joined Google in September from Uber Technologies Inc, said during the town hall, "We need to be comfortable with that discomfort" of self-critical research.Google declined to comment on the Friday meeting.An internal email, seen by Reuters, offered fresh detail on Google researchers' concerns, showing exactly how Google's legal department had modified one of the three AI papers, called "Extracting Training Data from Large Language Models."The email, dated Feb. 8, from a co-author of the paper, Nicholas Carlini, went to hundreds of colleagues, seeking to draw their attention to what he called "deeply insidious" edits by company lawyers."Let's be clear here," the roughly 1,200-word email said. "When we as academics write that we have a 'concern' or find something 'worrying' and a Google lawyer requires that we change it to sound nicer, this is very much Big Brother stepping in."Required edits, according to his email, included "negative-to-neutral" swaps such as changing the word "concerns" to "considerations," and "dangers" to "risks." Lawyers also required deleting references to Google technology; the authors' finding that AI leaked copyrighted content; and the words "breach" and "sensitive," the email said.Carlini did not respond to requests for comment. Google in answer to questions about the email disputed its contention that lawyers were trying to control the paper's tone. The company said it had no issues with the topics investigated by the paper, but it found some legal terms used inaccurately and conducted a thorough edit as a result.RACIAL EQUITY AUDITGoogle last week also named Marian Croak, a pioneer in internet audio technology and one of Google's few Black vice presidents, to consolidate and manage 10 teams studying issues such as racial bias in algorithms and technology for disabled individuals.Croak said at Friday's meeting that it would take time to address concerns among AI ethics researchers and mitigate damage to Google's brand."Please hold me fully responsible for trying to turn around that situation," she said on the recording.Johnson added that the AI organization is bringing in a consulting firm for a wide-ranging racial equity impact assessment. The first-of-its-kind audit for the department would lead to recommendations "that are going to be pretty hard," she said.Tensions in Dean's division had deepened in December after Google let go of Timnit Gebru, co-lead of its ethical AI research team, following her refusal to retract a paper on language-generating AI. Gebru, who is Black, accused the company at the time of reviewing her work differently because of her identity and of marginalizing employees from underrepresented backgrounds. Nearly 2,700 employees signed an open letter in support of Gebru.During the town hall, Dean elaborated on what scholarship the company would support."We want responsible AI and ethical AI investigations," Dean said, giving the example of studying technology's environmental costs. But it is problematic to cite data "off by close to a factor of a hundred" while ignoring more accurate statistics as well as Google's efforts to reduce emissions, he said. Dean previously has criticized Gebru's paper for not including important findings on environmental impact.Gebru defended her paper's citation. "It's a really bad look for Google to come out this defensively against a paper that was cited by so many of their peer institutions," she told Reuters.Employees continued to post about their frustrations over the last month on Twitter as Google investigated and then fired ethical AI co-lead Margaret Mitchell for moving electronic files outside the company. Mitchell said on Twitter that she acted "to raise concerns about race & gender inequity, and speak up about Google's problematic firing of Dr. Gebru."Mitchell had collaborated on the paper that prompted Gebru's departure, and a version that published online last month without Google affiliation named "Shmargaret Shmitchell" as a co-author. Asked for comment, Mitchell expressed through an attorney disappointment in Dean's critique of the paper and said her name was removed following a company order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-pledges-changes-to-research-oversight-after-internal-revolt-101614252068588.html

Lots of effort is being made,” Yusuf said, speaking in Urdu.“This is our success and the success of diplomacy and, God willing, more roads will open in the future,” he added.As first reported by Hindustan Times, the joint statement by the armies of India and Pakistan on the ceasefire came months after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace on the borders.Doval and Yusuf have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, and the joint statement was the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country.Yusuf appeared to be alluding to these conversations when he spoke of things being done “behind the scenes”. He added: “Do you think that, without effort and without pressure, this thing happened that India was not agreeing to for so many months and years?”He also contended that the joint statement was a “victory for Pakistan” as India was not agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan, he said, was “repeatedly saying that we want peace and we want that there should be a ceasefire at the LoC” so that innocent civilians aren’t killed.“Today’s development is very solid and positive and it should be welcomed and it is the success of our policy that is being seen in this development,” Yusuf said. He added: “The problem of Kashmir that we want to resolve, and the way we want to resolve it, will happen.”People familiar with developments in Islamabad said Yusuf has been playing a key role in efforts to foster a rapprochement with India and that his work has the backing of the powerful military, including Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Addressing a graduation ceremony at the Pakistan Air Force Academy on February 3, Bajwa had said that Pakistan is committed to peaceful co-existence and the time had come to extend a “hand of peace in all directions”. He had also said that Pakistan and India should resolve the Kashmir issue in a “dignified and peaceful manner”.Bajwa’s remarks were then perceived as an offer for talks, but the external affairs ministry said on February 4 that the onus was on Pakistan for creating an environment free of terror, hostility and violence to foster normal neighbourly relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loc-ceasefire-outcome-of-behind-the-scenes-contacts-pakistan-s-de-facto-nsa-101614251572895.html
25-02-2021||World||Explained: Why Facebook, Instagram took extreme step of banning Myanmar military||Facebook Inc. has banned Myanmar’s military from its social media platforms in the aftermath of a coup that saw the ouster of the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The decision to ban the Tatmadaw came amid massive protests against the military rule and subsequent crackdown on the demonstrators. Days after Facebook took down the main page of the Myanmar military, the social media company on Wednesday said that it is banning the Tatmadaw, military-controlled state and media entities from Facebook and Instagram with immediate effect.What led to the complete Facebook ban on the Myanmar military?Citing the volatile situation in the country, Facebook announced a slew of measures on February 11 to “protect freedom of expression” of Myanmar citizens and “prevent online content from being linked to offline harm”. The social media firm accused Myanmar’s military of spreading misinformation through their Facebook Pages and profiles, saying it has decided to significantly reduce the distribution of all content on such pages and profiles.The military had questioned the authenticity of nearly 9 million votes in November elections, suggesting the possibility of “voting malpractice.” The United Elections Commission (UEC), a national level electoral commission responsible for organising and overseeing elections, later asserted that there was no evidence of electoral fraud. Facebook said that it will remove all misinformation claiming that there was widespread fraud or foreign interference in Myanmar’s November election.On Wednesday, Rafael Frankel, Facebook’s director of policy for APAC emerging countries, said in a statement that the “risks of allowing the Tatmadaw on Facebook and Instagram are too great.” He said that Facebook is treating the situation in Myanmar as an emergency and events following the military coup, including the deadly shooting, have precipitated a need for this ban.Read | Myanmar blocks Wikipedia in all languages: NetBlocksHere’s are the guiding factors that led to Facebook’s decision to ban the Tatmadaw:The Facebook official noted that Myanmar’s military has a history of “exceptionally severe human rights abuses” and there’s a clear risk of violence in future initiated by the military.Frankel cited Tatmadaw’s history of on-platform content and behaviour violations as one of the guiding factors.He said that that coup greatly increases the danger posed by the behaviours of military Pages and accounts and the online threats could lead to offline harm.How has Facebook fared in the past?During the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, the ethnic minority group in Myanmar, several reports claimed that Myanmar military personnel turned Facebook into a tool for ethnic cleansing. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims were forced to take refuge in several camps in Bangladesh after the Tatmadaw launched a crackdown on the minority group. Last year, Facebook announced course correction ahead of the November elections after admitting that it failed to prevent the misuse of its platforms to “foment division and incite offline violence” in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-facebook-instagram-took-extreme-step-of-banning-myanmar-military-101614250102864.html

25-02-2021||World||Xi Jinping declares ‘complete victory’ over rural poverty in China||President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced “complete victory”, led by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), against rural poverty in China at an event in Beijing celebrating one of his signature policy initiatives since taking office in 2012.“Shaking off poverty is not the finish line, but the starting line of a new life and new endeavour,” Xi Jinping said at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing where he presented medals to key figures in the poverty fight. “A human miracle has been created that will go down in history,” Xi added.Chinese state media called the achievement a “miracle” and said it was under Xi’s leadership that nearly 100 million people had been lifted out of poverty. Reports called it a gift for 100th the anniversary of the party, coming up later this year.The Communist party’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily, lauded the “historic leap” led by Xi.China will not forget those 1,800 people who sacrificed their lives while fighting on the front lines of China’s battle against poverty, Xi said, adding that they represented the original aspiration and mission of CPC members.State media reports said in the last eight years, the final 98.99 million impoverished rural residents living under the current poverty line have all been lifted out of poverty.“Since the launch of the reform and opening up in the late 1970s, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty when calculated in accordance with China’s current poverty line,” news agency Xinhua said.China vowed to stick with its poverty alleviation policies, while making some adjustments for a five-year transition towards what Beijing calls “rural revitalisation” in a “No. 1 policy document” released on Sunday.The current rural poverty line, according to a Xinhua report in December 2020, is 2,300 yuan per person per year at the 2010 price level. “The specific figure is subject to adjustment as the country’s price levels change. In 2019, the poverty line was 3,218 yuan (about $490.61)” - the equivalent of $1.34 per day.Indermit Gill, a non-resident senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development programme at Brookings Institution, wrote last month that the World Bank believes that a threshold of $1.90 a day is appropriate for countries with per capita incomes of less than $1,000 or so, such as Ethiopia.“For lower middle-income countries such as India - with per capita incomes between $1,000 and about $4,000 - it recommends a poverty line of $3.20 a day.”“For upper middle-income countries like China, it reckons that a reasonable poverty line is $5.50 a day. In other words, the Chinese government uses a poverty line appropriate for a country making the transition from low to lower middle-income, even though China is 10 times as wealthy,” Gill wrote.The urban poverty line is also different from the rural definition of poverty in China. There is no unified standard for the whole country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-declares-complete-victory-over-rural-poverty-in-china-101614249412655.html

Diplomats and other foreigners with special status are exempted from a ban on most foreigners entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-subjecting-us-diplomats-to-covid-19-anal-tests-101614247351818.html
25-02-2021||World||Poorer Texans already had trouble paying energy bills, then came the storm||Cleopatra Mancha had already lost her job in the pandemic. Then the winter storm came to her home state of Texas."We had all the pipes bust in our house. It wasn't just one area - it was everywhere. In the bathrooms, our sinks, where our washer and dryer are," she said. "So we're not having to just try to pay just our electric bill - we have to pay for all these repairs, too."The 44-year-old mother of two in Arlington, Texas, choked back sobs.Energy insecurity among poor and middle-class Americans had already deepened because of the economic crisis the pandemic created, according to experts. Even before the pandemic, low-income households in Texas were spending 10% of their income on energy - compared with 2% for the better off.Energy-burdened poorer Texans have been forced to buy less food to keep the lights on one month, or put off purchasing clothes another month to keep the heat going.In Texas last week, 4 million people were without power for days and half saw water services disrupted. Across the United States, experts say, households will suffer unless energy policies are reworked, grid infrastructure improved and deep investments made to fix the 30 million housing units that have serious physical or health hazards, over one-fifth of the nation's total.Dana Harmon is the executive director of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which has been tracking increasingly unaffordable electric bills in lower-income communities and in neighborhoods of color. The pandemic has forced people out of work and at home for increasingly long periods - including children learning at a distance. That has increased demand for household energy consumption."Now when you put a storm on top of that," Harmon said, "you see people facing real danger."There has been much attention cast on energy bills exceeding $10,000 for some Texas customers subject to variable energy market prices. Harmon said those customers only make up about 0.2% of all consumers in the competitive electricity market. She is more concerned about the 3.5 million low-income households across Texas that have already been paying a disproportionate chunk of their income for energy and likely face higher bills as fuel costs have risen for utility companies.Harmon said a saving grace from the widespread blackouts might be that leaders in Austin who are making decisions on planning for energy systems, along with industry leaders in Houston and elsewhere, "keenly experienced what it's like to go without energy during a crisis, and I hope we would see more empathy for what energy insecurity feels like."Other advocacy groups like the Southwest Workers Union in San Antonio say landlords are finding loopholes to evict tenants behind on rent and a wider moratorium on evictions is needed.Michelle Romero - national director for Dream Corps, an environmental, technology and social justice group - said that the grid in Texas and across the United States needs to be modernized to increase energy security.Romero also said federal programs meant to help low-income households by offering funds for weatherization or bill relief badly need more funding and to be reworked so they cover more people.A study released by Dream Corps on Wednesday found 30 million homes across the United States have serious physical or health hazards, from asbestos to structural damages, making it impossible for many to properly heat or cool their homes. The damage can also disqualify the homes from obtaining federal aid in the first place.Romero said that just as the pandemic has allowed a wider public to see the intersections between race and health care disparities, she thinks the events like the Texas freeze are driving home the realities about who bears the brunt of extreme weather events."Who is impacted first and worst by events like we saw in Texas is absolutely an issue of income inequality and racial injustice," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorer-texans-already-had-trouble-paying-energy-bills-then-came-the-storm-101614247574354.html

Imports also rose 37.7%, leaving a trade deficit of HK$25.2 billion ($3.9 billion), the government said Thursday.Exports to China have been a key driver of Hong Kong’s nascent economic recovery as the mainland continues to lead the regional rebound from the pandemic. While Hong Kong’s economy posted a record 6.1% contraction overall in 2020, a surge in exports to the mainland beginning in September helped the city to return to quarter-on-quarter growth in the latter half of the year.Hong Kong’s economy will return to growth this year and expand between 3.5% and 5.5%, Financial Secretary Paul Chan forecast in his budget speech Wednesday, although that is dependent on the global rollout of vaccines to spur a return of external demand and international travel.“We hope that from the second half of the year we will see more vibrancy in the economy,” Chan said at a press conference after announcing the budget.Chan announced more than HK$120 billion of stimulus Wednesday including HK$5,000 in spending vouchers for each resident and loans for the unemployed. He also proposed raising taxes on stock transactions to generate more revenue and narrow an expected record budget deficit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-january-exports-surge-most-since-1992-on-asia-boost-101614244504296.html

He pleaded guilty to the charge of treason, TASS said.His trial was held behind closed doors and its details were not made public because of its classified nature.Also read: Biden administration prepares to impose sanctions on Russia over Navalny stirVasilyev gathered and handed over information that constituted a state secret to China's intelligence services, TASS cited a law enforcement source as saying.The case points to the tensions behind the Kremlin's push for closer ties with China since 2014, when relations with the West collapsed over Russia's annexation of Crimea.Last year state prosecutors charged a prominent Russian scientist with treason for allegedly passing secrets to China. Another scientist was detained in Siberia last October for allegedly passing technology to China.There have been a spate of treason cases in recent months.One case in particular, that of former newspaper journalist Ivan Safronov who denies wrongdoing, has sparked anger among his supporters about the secrecy surrounding the treason allegation against him that makes it difficult to scrutinise the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-jails-man-for-eight-years-for-handing-over-secrets-to-china-tass-101614238484675.html

Five people died in the violence.More than 200 people have been charged so far for their roles in the riot, including some with ties to far-right fringe groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.An FBI warning that a protest by Trump supporters could turn violent reached the US Capitol Police the day before the assault, but top officials in charge of securing Congress that day did not see it, they told lawmakers on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-was-quickly-overwhelmed-during-riots-acting-chief-says-101614245204663.html

25-02-2021||World||US report on Khashoggi death expected to single out Saudi crown prince||A declassified version of a US intelligence report expected to be released on Thursday finds that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, four US officials familiar with the matter said.The officials said the report, for which the CIA was the main contributor, assessed that the crown prince approved and likely ordered the murder of Khashoggi, whose Washington Post column had criticized the crown prince’s policies.President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Donald Trump five weeks ago, told reporters on Wednesday he had read the report and expected to speak soon by phone with Saudi Arabian King Salman, 85, father of the crown prince, the country's 35-year-old de facto ruler.The report's release is part of Biden's policy to realign ties with Riyadh after years of giving the Arab ally and major oil producer a pass on its human rights record and its intervention in Yemen’s civil war.Biden is working to restore the relationship with Riyadh to traditional lines after four years of cozier ties under Trump.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday Biden would only communicate with the Saudi king and said the declassified Khashoggi report was being readied for release soon.While Biden restricts his contacts to the king, others in the Biden administration are talking to Saudi officials at various levels."We have been in touch with Saudi officials at numerous levels in the early weeks of this administration," said State Department spokesman Ned Price.The 59-year old Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, and killed by a team of operatives linked to the crown prince. They then dismembered his body. His remains have never been found.Riyadh eventually admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a “rogue” extradition operation gone wrong, but it denied any involvement by the crown prince. Five men given the death penalty for the murder had their sentences commuted to 20 years in jail after being forgiven by Khashoggi’s family.In 2019, a UN human rights investigator, Agnes Callamard, accused Saudi Arabia of a "deliberate, premeditated execution" of Khashoggi and called for further investigation.“There is sufficient credible evidence regarding the responsibility of the crown prince demanding further investigation,” Callamard said after the six-month probe.A classified version of the report was shared with members of Congress in late 2018.But the Trump administration rejected demands by lawmakers and human rights groups to release a declassified version, seeking to preserve cooperation amid rising tensions with Riyadh’s regional rival, Iran, and promote US arms sales to the kingdom.Biden's new director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, committed at her confirmation hearing to complying with a provision in a 2019 defense bill that required the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to release within 30 days a declassified report on Khashoggi's murder.Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign to reassess US-Saudi ties in part over Khashoggi’s murder. Since taking office, he has ended sales of offensive arms that Riyadh could use in Yemen and appointed a special envoy to boost diplomatic efforts to end that country’s grueling civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-on-khashoggi-death-expected-to-single-out-saudi-crown-prince-101614243786663.html

China then assured the US that the tests were given “in error” as diplomats were exempt, the report said, citing an unidentified State Department spokesperson.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday told reporters that he checked with his colleagues about the report, and said it wasn’t true “as far as I know.”“China never asked US diplomatic personnel in China to go through anal swabs in Covid testing,” Zhao said.While China doesn’t have a nationwide policy on use of anal swabs, they have been used increasingly this year on everyone from schoolchildren to travelers arriving to Beijing. The method involves the insertion of a saline-soaked cotton swab about two-to-three centimeters into the anus, with the sample then tested for active traces of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-never-asked-us-diplomats-to-take-anal-swab-tests-for-covid19-101614242280192.html

He further said that the US' too much reliance on China's CDC resulted in the American health officials not getting information about the outbreak sooner.However, China's CDC was "left in the dark and even the centre's director "did not know this thing was circulating until the last day of December", said the former security while adding that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had put the PLA in charge of handling the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan.The PLA tried to "cover this thing up, to try to contain it until it was too late", he reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-coverup-secret-experiments-in-wuhan-by-pla-fmr-us-security-advisor-101614230009385.html

Kim Chung Il was appointed as air and anti-air force chief and promoted to lieutenant general.The news agency did not specify their previous positions, just calling them "comrades." According to South Korean news outlets, these people are unknown to media and can be considered "new faces."Several dozen commanding officers have also been promoted to lieutenant general and major general.South Korean media stress that the promotions were given to young commanders, not the "mature" military leadership, in what may be a "generational change" to get rid of corruption in the army and improve morale and discipline.Media outlets also suggest that the reshuffle of the air force and navy command is related to the strengthening of border security after the 2020 incident, when a South Korean fisheries official who accidentally swam into North Korea's waters was shot dead by the military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-appoints-new-navy-air-force-chiefs-in-generation-shift-101614241971912.html

Doses from AstraZeneca will arrive in March, Roque said."I have to admit, if we insisted on Western brands, we will still wait for its arrival," he added.Duterte, who has pursued warmer ties with China and has a strained relationship with many Western countries, has previously said he wanted to procure Covid-19 vaccines from China or Russia.The vaccination programme will be crucial for Philippine efforts to revive its economy, which suffered a record 9.5% slump last year due to strict and lengthy lockdowns that hit consumer spending and saw big job losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-to-receive-first-covid-19-vaccines-inoculation-starts-next-week-101614235880465.html
25-02-2021||World||Capitol police were warned of violence before riot: Chief||Capitol Police knew armed extremists were primed for violence at the iconic building on January 6 and even provided officers with assault rifles to protect lawmakers, the acting chief acknowledged Wednesday. But the wild invasion of the Capitol was far worse than police expected, leaving them unprepared to fight it off.A day earlier, her predecessor as chief testified that police expected an enraged but more typical protest crowd of Donald Trump supporters. But Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said intelligence collected ahead of the riot prompted the agency to take extraordinary measures, including the special arming of officers, intercepting radio frequencies used by the invaders and deploying spies at the Ellipse rally where President Donald Trump was sending his supporters marching to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”Pittman's testimony, submitted ahead of a House hearing on Thursday, provides the most detailed account yet of the intelligence and preparations by US Capitol Police ahead of the insurrection when thousands of pro-Trump rioters invaded the Capitol aiming to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory over Trump.Three days earlier, On January 3, Capitol Police distributed an internal intelligence assessment warning that militia members, white supremacists and other extremist groups were likely to participate, that demonstrators would be armed and that it was possible they would come to the Capitol to try to disrupt the vote, Pittman says.“Based on the assessment, the Department understood that this demonstration would be unlike the previous demonstrations held by protesters with similar ideologies in November and December 2020,” Pittman says in her prepared remarks.But at the same time, she argues police didn't have enough intelligence to predict the violent insurrection that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer. They prepared for trouble but not an invasion."Although the Department's January 3rd Special Assessment foretold of a significant likelihood for violence on Capitol grounds by extremists groups, it did not identify a specific credible threat indicating that thousands of American citizens would descend upon the US Capitol attacking police officers with the goal of breaking into the US Capitol Building to harm Members and prevent the certification of Electoral College votes,” Pittman says in her testimony.Steven Sund, the police force's former chief who resigned after the riot, testified Tuesday that the intelligence assessment warned white supremacists, members of the far-right Proud Boys and leftist antifa were expected to be in the crowd and might become violent.“We had planned for the possibility of violence, the possibility of some people being armed, not the possibility of a coordinated military style attack involving thousands against the Capitol,” Sund said.The FBI also forwarded a warning to local law enforcement officials about online postings that a “war” was coming. But Pittman said it still wasn't enough to prepare for the mob that attacked the Capitol.Officers were vastly outnumbered as thousands of rioters descended on the building, some of them wielding planks of wood, stun guns, bear spray and metal pipes as they broke through windows and doors and stormed through the Capitol. Officers were hit with barricades, shoved to the ground, trapped between doors, beaten and bloodied as members of Congress were evacuated and congressional staffers cowered in offices.Should police have been better prepared?With the amount of information available to the Capitol Police, it's surprising that they didn't take additional steps to reinforce security and protect their officers, said Tom Warrick, a former counterterrorism official who served in the Obama administration.“On January 6, the one strategic location in the entire US national capital region that had to be defended was the US Capitol,” said Warrick, now with the Atlantic Council. “So it was really disappointing you have people testifying that we didn't know there would be violence.' When you are the target, you assume that things like that can happen even if you don't have the intel.”Even without access to secure intelligence, there were months of warning signs in public view that rioters would try to do what they did, said Bruce Hoffman, a former commissioner on the 9/11 Review Commission and a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security for the Council on Foreign Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-were-warned-of-violence-before-riot-chief-101614241110262.html

That was well within what the company and regulators previously believed was safe, according to two people familiar with the investigation.The fan blade, apparently weakened from a growing fatigue crack, broke shortly after takeoff, raining debris onto the ground and causing minor damage to the United Airlines Holdings Inc. plane, a Boeing Co. 777-200. No one was hurt.In 2019, the US Federal Aviation Administration had required additional inspections of blades on PW4000 models with 112-inch fans following a 2018 failure on a United flight to Hawaii. The FAA order called for initial inspections starting after blades had completed between 6,500 and 7,000 flight cycles.However, Saturday’s failure appears to have occurred well before then, said the two people, who requested anonymity because they weren’t permitted to discuss details of the inquiry.Also read| FAA met to discuss more frequent engine inspections days before Denver incidentThe fan blade’s inspection history was reported earlier by Reuters.The significance of the failure after only about 3,000 flights isn’t clear. It’s possible the inspection interval wasn’t adequate, but an investigation into the 2018 failure found that inspections had missed a growing crack. After that, the company had inspected more than 9,000 blades, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.The FAA on Tuesday issued an emergency order requiring all fan blades on the Pratt & Whitney models used on the 777 be tested before planes could return to carrying passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fan-blade-same-as-united-plane-in-denver-used-in-almost-3-thousand-flights-101614233535369.html
25-02-2021||World||US Congress introduces Countering Chinese Propaganda Act||A legislation has been introduced in the US Congress for countering the Chinese propaganda by creating a new sanctions authority against state-backed disinformation networks.Republican Study Committee Chairman Congressman Jim Banks and Senator Tom Cotton on Wednesday introduced the Countering Chinese Propaganda Act.The bill requires the Secretary of State to examine whether or not the United Front Work Department meets the criteria to be sanctioned under this new authority.The legislation is based on recommendations from the Republican Study Committee’s National Security Strategy and authorises sanctions against the United Front Work Department (UFWD), which is an overseas influence arm of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The United Front participated directly in the Uyghur genocide and the oppression of Christians in China, but its ultimate goal is to spread those persecutory tactics around the globe, Banks said."The leadership in Washington may have changed, but China’s political warfare hasn’t. It’s fallen to Congress to expose and counter Communist Party disinformation. We can’t back down now,“ he said.“The Chinese Communist Party expands its disinformation campaign each day – concealing information on the origin of COVID-19, lying about its oppression of Uighurs and other religious minorities, and infiltrating American universities and businesses,” Cotton said.“The United Front Work Department (UFWD) is just another venue for the CCP to spread its propaganda and to co-opt foreign groups to toe the CPC line. We must put an end to their tactics,” he said.Meanwhile, the Republican Study Committee Member Congressman Jody Hice sent a letter to the Carter Center in Georgia expressing concern over the group’s decision to co-host an event with the Chinese People’s Association for Peace and Disarmament, which is an organisation affiliated with the UFWD.Four Senators -- Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Chuck Grassley and Rob Portman -- on Wednesday wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden to implement a proposed rule requiring US academic institutions to disclose their relationships with Confucius Institutes, which are funded by the CPC headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-introduces-countering-chinese-propaganda-act-101614232699528.html
25-02-2021||World||Myanmar protests: Truck drivers join movement against military coup||Thousands of striking truck drivers in Myanmar protesting the military coup have slowed delivery of imports, trapping cargo containers at ports and prompting at least one international shipping line to halt new orders.About 100 containers a day are moving out of Yangon’s four main ports, said Myo Htut Aung, joint secretary of the Myanmar Container Trucking Association, down from an average of 800 boxes before the coup. About 90% of the city’s 4,000 container-truck drivers have halted work, he said.The situation may add to a global container shortage triggered by the pandemic as government lockdowns to curb infections limit travel and consumers buy more goods. Spot rates for transporting 40-foot boxes rose 50% on average in 2020, according to World Container Index data and Bloomberg Intelligence.“The truckers’ protest has severely affected operations at container terminals,” said Myo Htut Aung. “If drivers don’t pick up goods, all the containers have to be kept at the ports.”Massive protests opposing the Feb. 1 coup have persisted in defiance of a military ban on public gatherings, with hundreds of thousands of people flooding streets across the country during a nationwide strike on Monday. The coupmakers have urged civil servants to get back to work, insisting they will hold a fresh election after a yearlong state of emergency. Three protesters have been killed in clashes with police so far.German shipping line Hapag-Lloyd AG told customers last week that while vessel operations into and out of Myanmar ports haven’t been significantly impacted, container terminals were close to full and road transportation limited. The company temporarily suspended new import bookings into Myanmar.Truck drivers have said they will transport essential food, medicine and fabrics for factories but only about 30% of normal container volumes are moving through Yangon’s ports via truck, said Kyaw Lwin Oo, vice chairman of the Myanmar International Freight Forwarders’ Association.The disruptions could impact the global textile and garment industries. Myanmar imported more than $1 billion in woven fabrics and sold about $2.4 billion in suits in 2019, according to the World Trade Organization. Apart from fuels, the country’s top purchases include medicines and motorbikes, which are typically shipped in containers.Myanmar’s top trade partners in 2019 were China, Thailand and Singapore, according to International Monetary Fund data compiled by Bloomberg.Other international shipping lines are also worried about port congestion and have cut sailings to the country or halted new bookings in anticipation of further delays, according to the Myanmar International Freight Forwarders’ Association and maritime consultant Drewry.On Tuesday, protest crowds were smaller and factories, shops and transport companies restarted activity, said Nils Haupt, a spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd. However, with many major roads still blocked by demonstrators and with some drivers still protesting, trucking availability into and out of ports remains affected, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-truck-drivers-join-movement-against-military-coup-101614236076736.html

The UN and rights groups have reported that many of the about 90 refugees on board were suffering acute dehydration and their families back in refugee camps are worried many may have already died.UNHCR spokesperson Catherine Stubberfield said she appreciated the efforts of the Indian coast guard. "But given that the refugees are still adrift at sea, immediate disembarkation is absolutely critical to meeting their most basic human needs and ensuring that their safety is no longer threatened,” she said.Also read| Facebook bans all Myanmar military-linked accounts and adsThe UN agency said it did not know the boat’s exact location. On Monday it alerted nearby nations to look for the boat and said it was prepared to offer humanitarian assistance.The mother of a 25-year-old man reportedly on the boat said she was praying for his safety.“Oh God, save all of the people that are stuck on the boat including my son with your divine magic. Put them somewhere on the coast of the river. Please fulfill the wishes of my son to go there,” said Nasima Khatun. She spoke from Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar on the Bangladesh's border with Myanmar.“Is my son alive? Has anything happened to him because of hunger? I do not know anything about what my son is doing, how he is surviving. He only took four liters of water,” she said.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project that monitors Rohingya Muslims who had fled persecution and violence in Myanmar for refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, said her group heard of at least eight people who died on the boat.Also read| Pak caught in China's debt-trap diplomacy, seeks relief from 'iron ally': ReportLewa said the boat left the coast on Feb. 11 for a destination in Southeast Asia but its engine broke down. The Arakan Project has been unable to contact the refugees for several days.“We had talked to them. But now they are traceless. They have no water or food, they are drinking seawater and dying,” Lewa said by phone.Authorities in Bangladesh said they had no information about any boat that recently carried the refugees out of Bangladesh’s waters.More than 1 million Rohingya who fled Myanmar are living in crowded camps. Several attempts to repatriate them have failed because the refugees refuse to go back fore fear of more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.Human traffickers often lure the refugees, promising them work in Southeast Asian nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unhcr-praises-indian-coast-guard-for-helping-rohingya-adrift-in-andaman-sea-101614230603428.html

That compares with the World Bank's global threshold of $1.90 a day.Xi said China had invested 1.6 trillion yuan in fighting povery over the past eight years, but did not give figures for spending planned over the next five years.In a "No. 1 policy document" released on Sunday, China vowed to stick with its poverty alleviation policies, while making some adjustments for a five-year transition towards what Beijing calls "rural revitalisation".State media publicised the milestone, with a commentary of more than two pages in the party's main newspaper, the People's Daily, lauding the "historic leap" led by Xi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-trumpets-victory-in-1-6-trillion-yuan-campaign-to-end-rural-poverty-101614234941232.html
25-02-2021||World||Biden signs executive orders to address vulnerabilities in supply chains||President Joe Biden has signed a series of executive orders to address vulnerabilities in supply chains across additional critical sectors of the US economy in an effort to boost domestic production and avoid shortages in goods amid the coronavirus pandemic.The executive order, Biden told reporters on Wednesday is about making sure that the country can meet every challenge it faces in this new era - pandemics, but also in defence, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more.The order will help address the vulnerabilities in “our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy so that the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves.”“And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America's competitive edge by investing here at home. As I've said from the beginning, while I was running: We're going to invest in America. We're going to invest in American workers. And then we can be in a much better position to even compete beyond what we're doing now,” Biden said.He said that the solution to supply chain issues will be to increase domestic production in certain industries as well as work with allies to prevent future shortages.Observing that the US needs to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable, Biden said that he is directing senior officials in his administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.One of the executive orders signed by him orders a 100-day review of four vital products: semiconductors; key minerals and materials, like rare earths, that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes; three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients; four, advanced batteries, like the ones used in electric vehicles, he said.“There's strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they're essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness,” Biden said adding that this order initiates a long-term review of the industry basis of six sectors of the overall economy over the next year.These reviews will identify policy recommendations to fortify supply chains.“It should be to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically, to start implementing those recommendations right away."We're not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps,” he added.Later, Biden met with a bipartisan group of House and Senate members to discuss supply chain resilience and the need to work together in strengthening it.At a White House news conference, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili told reporters that creating more resilient supply chains is an opportunity for the country to come together to create well-paying jobs for workers across the US.“We know that even before the Covid-19 crisis, the economy was not working for most Americans. Worker pay was too low. Many families could not make ends meet. Many of the jobs that served as the heart of the middle class had been lost due to changes in both technology and the structure of the global economy,” she said.“Disruption is inevitable. But over the past few years, we have moved from crisis to crisis when some essential product was suddenly in short supply. What we need is the capacity to respond quickly when hit by a challenge. This executive order moves the whole government towards being more prepared,” she said.The executive orders signed by Biden asks agencies to review risks in supply chains and in domestic industrial bases, Fazili said.“They're going to think broadly about risk. There's climate risk and geopolitical risk, but there's also risk in not having enough workers ready to meet the needs of that sector, or enough factories or the right equipment to make a good -- or retool a shift -- to shift to a new spike in demand for an essential good,” she said.Fazili said that a big part of this executive order is consultation with stakeholders and experts.“This is a real opportunity to invest in the future of America and build on our nation's strengths. There are opportunities for small-business development to help diversify supplier networks and alleviate the risk of “too big to fail” companies in the supply chains for critical goods,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-executive-orders-to-address-vulnerabilities-in-supply-chains-101614229925616.html
25-02-2021||World||Out competing China will be key to national security: Biden's CIA nominee||Out competing China will be key to America's national security in the decades ahead, President Joe Biden's pick to lead the CIA has told lawmakers, stressing that Beijing is the "biggest geopolitical test" that the US will face.Willian Burns, 64, a former diplomat who served in Russia and the Middle East, shared the assessment with members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday for the post of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director.“Out competing China will be key to our national security in the decades ahead. That will require a long-term clear eyed bipartisan strategy underpinned by domestic renewal and solid intelligence,” Burns said.“There will be areas in which it will be in our mutual self-interest to work with China from climate change to non-proliferation. And I am very mindful that (President) Xi Jinping's China is not without problems and frailties of its own,” he said.Also read: Chinese official calls for 'joint efforts' in China-US trade“The challenge posed by Xi Jinping's China, by an adversarial China, it is hard for me to see a more significant threat or challenge for the United States as far out as I can see into the 21st century than that one. It is the biggest geopolitical test that we face,” Burns said.The relations between the US and China are at an all-time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist giant’s aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights.“There are, however, a growing number of areas in which Xi's China is a formidable authoritarian adversary, methodically strengthening its capabilities to steal intellectual property, repress its own people, bully its neighbours, expand its global reach, and build influence in American society,” Burns said.For the CIA, that will mean intensified focus and urgency, continually strengthening its already impressive cadre of China specialists, expanding its language skills, aligning personnel and resource allocation for the long haul, and employing a whole of agency approach to the operational and analytical challenges of this crucial threat, he told the lawmakers.“Another priority intimately connected to competition with China is technology,” he said.Responding to a question, Burns said that the evolution of China under Xi's rule over the last six or seven years has been a very sharp wake-up call in a lot of ways, the kind of aggressive, undisguised ambition and assertiveness has made very clear the nature of the adversary and rival that America faces today.Also read: Biden, Trudeau bypass tension for unity on virus, China, climate“The challenge is how do you build a long-term... We have to buckle up for the long haul, I think, in competition with China. This is not like the competition with the Soviet Union and the Cold War, which was primarily in security and ideological terms,” he said.“This is an adversary that is extraordinarily ambitious in technology and capable in economic terms as well. So it is buckling up for the long term and developing a very clear-eyed bipartisan strategy, which I think is entirely possible right now,” Burns said.Burns told lawmakers that it's important for the United States to view cooperation with China on climate issues is not a favour to the United States. It's in the self-interest of China to do that.“So, in other words, it's not something to be traded. It's in the self-interest of China as well to work on these issues. And it's important for us to be clear eyed about that, as I'm sure the president and Secretary (John) Kerry will be,” he said.The Chinese military has been flexing its muscles in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region and is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea.Also at the hearing, Burns stressed the importance of "firmness and consistency" in responding to Russia, CNN reported.Burns said he learned through his foreign policy work "in dealing with those threats, responding to them and deterring them, firmness and consistency is hugely important, and it's also very important to work to the maximum extent possible with allies and partners.""We have more effects sometimes on Putin's calculus, when he sees responses coming, firm responses coming not just from the United States, but from our European allies and others as well. So, it pays off to work hard at widening that circle of countries who are going to push back," he was quoted as saying by the report.Burns also said that "it's always a mistake to underestimate Putin's Russia," noting that under Vladimir Putin's leadership it can be at least as disruptive as a rising power like China."So we have to be quite cold-eyed in our view of how those threats can emerge," he said.If confirmed, Burns won't be a member of Biden's Cabinet, which represents a change from the Trump administration, but a return to the status the job had in the Obama administration, the report added.CIA deputy director David Cohen has served in the role of acting director as Burns awaits confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-competing-china-will-be-key-to-national-security-biden-s-cia-nominee-101614228019025.html

The event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing was televised live to the nation of 1.4 billion people by state media.Xi has made fighting poverty one of his main goals since becoming leader of the ruling Communist Party in late 2012. The party is expected to soon declare victory in building a “moderately prosperous” society, which would elevate living standards and bolster its legitimacy.Xi was the focus of a similar event in September last year in which he hailed China’s success in handling the coronavirus outbreak. Xi’s second term as party chief is set to expire next year, but he’s widely expected to stay on in that role after amending the constitution in 2018 to allow him to also remain in the position of president for a third term.Also read: Xi says, time, momentum on China's side as world faces unprecedented turbulenceThe People’s Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece, ran a three-page, 22,000-character article Wednesday summarizing the poverty-alleviation orders Xi has issued since taking power. His efforts “achieved great success and made a great contribution to global progress,” the newspaper said.China last year raised its official poverty line to people earning 4,000 yuan ($620) a year, up from 2,625 yuan in 2012, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. While that is higher than the World Bank’s absolute poverty line, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines anyone with income less than half the median as being poor.Using that standard, people in rural areas would need to earn above 7,500 yuan a year in China to escape poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-puts-personal-stamp-on-china-s-fight-against-poverty-101614223039845.html

Myanmar security forces burned down villages, killed civilians and engaged in mass rape in their campaign, which the World Court is investigating as a crime of genocide.Facebook in 2018 banned the accounts of several top Myanmar military leaders, including Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who led this month’s coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party. The general heads the junta that now acts as the government,The junta has tried to block Facebook and other social media platforms, but its efforts have proven ineffective. For more than a week it has also turned off access to the internet nightly from 1 a.m.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-bans-all-myanmar-military-linked-accounts-and-ads-101614230199827.html

25-02-2021||World||In boost for Covid-19 battle, Pfizer vaccine found 94% effective in real world||The first big real-world study of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be independently reviewed shows the shot is highly effective at preventing Covid-19, in a potentially landmark moment for countries desperate to end lockdowns and reopen economies.Up until now, most data on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines has come under controlled conditions in clinical trials, leaving an element of uncertainty over how results would translate into the real world with its unpredictable variables.The research in Israel - two months into one of the world's fastest rollouts, providing a rich source of data - showed two doses of the Pfizer shot cut symptomatic Covid-19 cases by 94% across all age groups, and severe illnesses by nearly as much.The study of about 1.2 million people also showed a single shot was 57% effective in protecting against symptomatic infections after two weeks, according to the data published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.The results of the study for the Clalit Research Institute were close to those in clinical trials last year which found two doses were found to be 95% effective."We were surprised because we expected that in the real-world setting, where cold chain is not maintained perfectly and the population is older and sicker, that you will not get as good results as you got in the controlled clinical trials," senior study author Ran Balicer told Reuters. "But we did and the vaccine worked as well in the real world.""We have shown the vaccine to be as effective in very different sub-groups, in the young and in the old in those with no co-morbidities and in those with few co-morbidities," he added.The study also suggests the vaccine, developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech, is effective against the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK. Researchers said they could not provide a specific level of efficacy, but the variant was the dominant version of the virus in Israel at the time of the study.The research did not shed light on how the Pfizer shot will fare against another variant, now dominant in South Africa, that has been shown to reduce the efficacy of other vaccines.'THIS IS MORE GREAT NEWS'Of the nine million people in Israel, a nation with universal healthcare, nearly half have received a first dose, and a third have received both doses since the rollout began on Dec. 19.This made the country a prime location for a real-world study into the vaccine's ability to stem the pandemic, along with its advanced data capabilities.The study examined about 600,000 vaccinated people against the same sized control group of unvaccinated people. Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital also collaborated."This is more great news, confirming that the vaccine is around 90% effective at preventing documented infection of any degree of severity from 7 days after the second dose," said Peter English, a British government consultant in communicable disease control."Previous recently studied papers from Israel were observational studies. This one used an experimental design known as a case-control study ... giving greater confidence that differences between the groups are due to their vaccination status, and not to some other factor."The study published on Wednesday was the first analysis of a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy to be peer-reviewed. It also offered a more detailed look at how the vaccine was faring at weekly intervals, while matching people who received the shot to unvaccinated individuals with similar medical histories, sex, age and geographical characteristics.Other research centres in Israel, including the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Institute of Technology have shared several studies in recent weeks that show the vaccine to be effective.At least three studies out of Israel have also suggested the vaccine can reduce coronavirus transmission, but the researchers have cautioned that wider studies must be conducted in order to establish clear-cut conclusions.GOT YOUR IMMUNITY PASS?The Weizmann Institute's latest data shows a dramatic drop in illness - which began this month with the first age group vaccinated, the over-60s - has now extended to the two subsequent groups to have completed both doses.As infections have fallen in Israel, the country has eased its third national lockdown and reopened swathes of its economy including malls, shops, schools and many workplaces in the past two weeks.Recreational venues such as theatres, gyms and hotels opened on Sunday, but are open only to those deemed immune - holders of a "Green Pass", a health ministry document available for download only by people seven days after their second dose or people who have recovered from Covid-19.On Wednesday, Tel Aviv held one of the country's first live concerts after months of gatherings being banned under coronavirus restrictions."This is so exciting, we are really so happy to be here today. It's unbelievable after one year of staying at home, it's great to be out to see some culture," said 60-year-old Gabi Shamir as she took her seat at the open-air show.Still, the vaccine's efficacy does not mean the country will be pandemic free any time soon. Like elsewhere in the world, a large proportion of the population are under 16 - about a third in Israel - meaning that they cannot yet get vaccinated as there have not been clinical trial results for children."This is definitely not the end of the pandemic," said Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University. "Once there is a safe vaccine for the children in Israel and all over the world we can then start to say that we could be approaching herd immunity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-boost-for-covid-19-battle-pfizer-vaccine-found-94-effective-in-real-world-101614224539126.html
25-02-2021||World||Military begins delivering vaccines in Texas, New York||The US military on Wednesday began delivering shots at coronavirus vaccination centres in Texas and New York and announced that service members will start staffing four centres in Florida and one in Philadelphia next week.The expanded vaccination effort came as Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met with military commanders overseeing the Covid-19 response effort. He also visited the vaccination centre in Los Angeles, the first staffed by the new active-duty military teams that are being developed.The Biden administration has said that delivering the vaccine to Americans is a top priority. The Pentagon is ramping up the deployment of what federal authorities say could be up to 100 vaccination teams around the country.The stepped-up efforts reflect the extent to which the coronavirus has devastated the United States, killing more than 500,000 Americans. While average daily deaths and new infections have been falling, some experts say too few Americans have been inoculated for the vaccine to be making enough of a difference. The decline instead is attributed to the passing of the holidays, more people staying indoors during the winter and better adherence to mask rules and social distancing.California has the highest coronavirus death toll in the nation, at more than 49,000. Austin is touring the federally run vaccination site that is set up on the campus of California State University of Los Angeles, which opened last week. The site, on the east side of LA, is staffed by a 222-member military team from Fort Carson, Colorado, and it highlights an effort by state leaders to make the vaccinations more available to communities hit hard by the pandemic.Watching the line of cars file slowly through the parking area on campus as people in their cars got shots, Austin spoke with troops who have been giving out vaccines. One soldier from the area told Austin how thrilled he was to be able to give his own mother a shot.“It almost brought me to tears,” Austin said later, recounting the story.Speaking to another group of service members working at the walk-up vaccination site, Austin said they need to take the leadership, coordination and compassionate skills they have learned doing this to their next mission.Austin told reporters later that the military is learning every day how to make the process more efficient. And he said one thing that has proved successful has been the mobile vaccination teams, and he intends to talk to agency leaders about expanding those.Despite the state's high death toll, the rates of new infections and hospitalizations continue to plummet across the state. Health officials said Sunday that the number of patients in California hospitals with Covid-19 has slipped below 7,000, a drop of more than a third over two weeks. Total cases are approaching 3.45 million.The positivity rate for people being tested has been falling for weeks, which means fewer people will end up in hospitals.In his first trip outside Washington as defence chief, Austin stopped in Colorado at US Northern Command and met with its commander, Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck, who also heads the North American Aerospace Defence Command. Military officials there told reporters traveling with Austin that service members are delivering 6,000 shots a day in Los Angeles and will build to that number at the centre in Houston, where the 222-member team started working Wednesday.Smaller, 139-member teams began operations in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and in Dallas, which has two. They are expected to soon be delivering 3,000 shots a day.Austin has so far approved the deployment of 25 military vaccination teams, which come in two sizes, 222 members and 139 members, and total about 4,700 service members. So far, 11 have either started or will begin next week.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked for 100 such teams, which would put the Defence Department on pace to deploy as many as 19,000 troops if all are needed. The troop number is almost double what federal authorities initially thought would be needed.The five military teams moving into cities this week include 139-member units going to Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville in Florida, and a 222-member team going to Philadelphia.The military has also sent three 25-member medical units to cities in New Jersey and is sending one to the US Virgin Islands.Military officials said developing new sites will depend on how much vaccine becomes available and whether states request the aid and can provide proper locations.Separately, in a video message to the military force, Austin urged service members to get the vaccine. The shot is voluntary because the vaccines have not yet gotten final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. And while rates vary, military units around the world say 30 to 60% percent of their troops who are offered the vaccine are declining. Military leaders said last week that they believe the overall declination rate is about 30%, but they say they do not have good data.Speaking to reporters in Los Angeles, Austin also acknowledged the reluctance in the Black community to the vaccine. As the first Black person to serve as defence chief, Austin said that he believes the vaccine is safe and that with enough information people will make the right decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/military-begins-delivering-vaccines-in-texas-new-york-101614219461659.html

25-02-2021||World||Biden to put Tanden in another post should her nomination fail||The Biden administration will find another role for Neera Tanden, the president’s pick for budget director, should her controversial nomination fail in the Senate, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on Wednesday.Klain said President Joe Biden is continuing to support Tanden as head of the Office of Management and Budget but his comments marked the first time a senior administration official described contingency plans if her nomination collapses.“If Neera Tanden is not confirmed, she will not become the budget director, we will find some other place for her to serve in the administration that doesn’t require Senate confirmation,” Klain told MSNBC. “But let me be clear: We’re gonna get Neera Tanden confirmed.”Klain said the White House is “fighting our guts out to get her confirmed” and hoping one Republican would offer support after West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would vote against her. Klain cited Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa as one of the lawmakers who has said he is open-minded about her nomination.Senate committees on Budget and on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs delayed votes planned for Wednesday on Tanden’s nomination, without announcing when they might be rescheduled. Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont progressive who had been at odds with Tanden in the past, said his panel’s vote was delayed because she didn’t have enough support.Also read: What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?Also read: Neera Tanden's committee vote delayed as doubts about confirmation mountThe Biden administration this week stepped up efforts to win over senators of both parties who have been put off by Tanden’s sharp words for lawmakers. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said they’re not yet at the point of withdrawing the nomination.“Neera Tanden has a record of working with people who disagree with her, working with people who have different viewpoints, and different objectives and priorities, and that’s something she would certainly take into the job if she’s confirmed,” Psaki said.Biden’s allies on Capitol Hill on Wednesday were reaching out to Democrats who haven’t expressed support yet for the nominee.“We’re doing a full scale effort, including the White House and members, to find support,” Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said Wednesday. Asked whether her nomination is in trouble, he said, “We’re working hard to make sure she’s out of trouble.”Wednesday’s committee postponements hint at further unease. Even before her confirmation gets to a floor vote in the 50-50 chamber, she has to clear both panels where Democrats can’t afford to lose any members because of their slim control.Tanden, 50, head of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, has ties to Hillary Clinton and would be the first South Asian woman to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Although she was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor union federation, she has made enemies on Capitol Hill by speaking negatively about Republicans and some progressives, including Sanders, the Budget chairman.Tanden faced criticism during her confirmation hearing for tweets about the very U.S. senators she now needs to win over. She deleted many of her more controversial posts, which led some lawmakers to question how transparent and nonpartisan she would be in a White House role that must work closely with Congress.Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who serves on the Homeland Security Committee, hasn’t said whether she’ll support Tanden. Her office didn’t respond to requests for comment.Opposition by her or Sanders, who also hasn’t said how he would vote, would require additional Republican votes for Tanden to win confirmation in the full Senate, which is divided evenly along party lines.One of the few Republicans the White House could still woo is Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate who has broken with her party on other issues. Murkowski was among the people Tanden has targeted on Twitter, including one 2017 tweet about tax policy.Murkowski said she wasn’t aware of that tweet when asked by reporters Wednesday. She said she had spoken with the White House about Tanden’s nomination.“I suggested to the White House that my colleagues were being very critical of the statements and rightly so. And some of them were clearly over the top,” Murkowski said. “I don’t think that’s a model that we want to set for anybody -- whether it’s a nominee, whether it’s a president or whether it’s a senator. So I’d like us all to cool that.”“I was trying to look at competence but apparently I’m going to have to do more looking into what she thinks about me,” Murkowski said, laughing.Grassley said earlier Wednesday he “had a couple of good conversations with her” and wants to discuss her nomination with other colleagues before deciding.But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is pushing all of the chamber’s GOP members to vote against the nomination.”I think that her record is pretty extensive of being very partisan, and there was a concern about whether or not that carries over to the job which is an important one and one we’re gonna have to work with people on your side,” Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota said Wednesday. “I personally am not worried about tweets, but I do think that your digital footprint now should be a reminder that stuff that’s all going to come back to bite you at some point.”Republicans still complain about Democratic delays confirming some of former President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks early in his term, some of whom later resigned amid ethics inquiries. Trump often used his Twitter feed for personal attacks on his opponents, which Republicans routinely declined to condemn.Alternative Candidate?If Tanden isn’t able to rally enough bipartisan support, some lawmakers are already pushing the Biden administration to elevate Shalanda Young, the House Appropriations Committee’s staff director and Biden’s pick for deputy budget director, as the top nominee.“The Black Caucus is fully supporting Shalanda Young’s confirmation should Neera Tanden’s nomination be unsuccessful,” said Dominic Manecke, a spokesman for Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat.Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said he doesn’t support Tanden, but he would support Young, saying “she’s very qualified, but that’s up to them.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-put-tanden-in-another-post-should-her-nomination-fail-101614217512606.html

There are concerns | Analysis"[Alvi] also discussed with his Chinese counterpart a 10-year extension in the debt repayment period. These two rebates, if approved, would save [Pakistan] about USD 600 million annually," said the source.The Pakistani government has recently re-approached Chinese officials on the issue but no information has leaked out in the public domain on their exchanges, reported Asia Times."First, the power purchase agreements made with Beijing provide for a highly overrated power supply, which eats up roughly USD 1.6 billion annually. Another USD 1.8 billion goes into power pilferage and line losses, and yet another USD 9 million is consumed in recovery losses of power dues from consumers," Asia Times quoted Dr Farrukh Saleem, an Islamabad-based political economist, analyst, and columnist, citing official statistics on power sector losses incurred by the state.Saleem said that the recent COVID-influenced downturn in gross domestic product growth from 5.8 per cent in 2018 to -0.4 per cent in 2020, the first time Pakistan's economy dipped into negative growth in over seven decades, has curtailed electricity demand across the country."This rendered thousands of megawatt electricity surplus, on which the government pays capacity charges in line with the agreements," Saleem added.Experts say that if the current overcapacity problem and debt repayment terms persist, the government's overall power sector liability may balloon beyond 1.5 trillion rupees (USD 9.4 billion) by the end of 2023, reported Asia Times.Asia Times further reported that official estimates indicate that Pakistan's energy-related debts will rise to 2.8 trillion (USD 17.5 billion) rupees by the end of June under current Belt and Road terms and conditions. The figures show that power sector liabilities surged by 538 billion rupees (USD 3.4 billion) in just one year from July 2019 to June 2020.Official figures indicate that Pakistan's total debt servicing liability could surpass USD 14 billion by the end of the year, at a time foreign exchange reserves are hovering around USD 13 billion.That's leading some analysts to the conclusion that China's Belt and Road lending to Pakistan is becoming a "debt trap", as total external debts and liabilities hit USD 115.76 billion at the end of 2020 and more owed in 2021 for what are now seen as unproductive Chinese power sector investments, Asia Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-caught-in-china-s-debt-trap-diplomacy-seeks-relief-from-iron-ally-101614221764956.html

Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Myanmar's military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, for talks in the Thai capital.Indonesia's interventions have raised suspicion among Myanmar democracy activists who fear dealing with the junta would confer legitimacy on it and its bid to scrap the November election.Retno, speaking to reporters in Bangkok, said the wellbeing of the people of Myanmar was the top priority."We ask for everybody to use restraint and not resort to violence ... to avoid casualties and bloodshed," Retno said after her talks with the Myanmar minister and her Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai.A Reuters report this week cited sources as saying Indonesia was proposing that ASEAN members send monitors to ensure the generals stick to their promise of fair new elections.The military has not given a time frame for the new election it has promised, although it imposed a one-year state of emergency when it seized power.Dozens of protesters gathered outside the Thai embassy in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday with signs reading: "Respect our vote" and "We voted NLD".Retno did not mention the issue of the election but said Indonesia emphasised "the importance of an inclusive democratic transition process".The crisis has restored Myanmar's reputation as the problem member of the 10-country ASEAN and the diplomatic scramble by its neighbours comes as wider international concern is growing.The United States, Britain and others have imposed limited sanctions aimed at members of the junta and military businesses.China has traditionally taken a softer line on Myanmar as have ASEAN neighbours.Washington has also expressed concern over Malaysia's deportation of nearly 1,100 Myanmar nationals and urged countries in the region to hold off on any repatriations in light of the coup.Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar and several Malaysian lawmakers and rights groups on Wednesday called on the government to explain its deportation, despite a court-ordered stay, with some saying the move could amount to contempt of court.The deported group is to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday, according to a post on Myanmar's navy Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-students-doctors-plan-more-protests-against-military-rule-101614217386495.html
25-02-2021||World||Pakistan awaits FATF ruling on terror||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will on Thursday take a call on Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing and money laundering, with the country widely expected to be retained in the multilateral watchdog’s “grey list”.The FATF will conclude its three-day virtual plenary meeting on Thursday, following several rounds of meetings of its working groups since February 11. Some of these meetings have focused on the latest report submitted by Pakistan regarding compliance with the FATF’s 27-point action plan that was drawn up after the country was placed on the grey list in June 2018.At its last plenary in October 2020, the FATF concluded that Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan but warned the country that it could not be given “forever” to address outstanding issues. As all deadlines for the action plan had expired, the FATF had urged Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by February 2021.The Australia-based Asia-Pacific Group (APG), a key regional affiliate of the FATF, had also concluded before the last plenary meeting that Pakistan was fully compliant with only two of 40 recommendations to counter terror financing and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-awaits-fatf-ruling-on-terror-101614219001650.html

The ruling conservative Liberal Party does not have a majority in the upper house, but support from the opposition Labour Party is expected to be enough to pass the bill.“What we’ve sworn to do is create a level playing field,” Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Sky News on Wednesday. “We’ve sought to sustain public interest journalism in this country, and we’ve also sought to enhance and encourage those commercial deals between the parties.”Facebook set to invest $1billn in news industryFacebook on Wednesday pledged to invest at least $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years, days after a high-profile standoff with the Australian government over paying news outlets for content.Facebook on Tuesday restored Australian news pages, ending a week-long blackout after wringing concessions from the government over a proposed law that will require all tech giants to pay media companies for their news content.In a blog detailing its version of the showdown, Facebook said the news ban was related to a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the relationship between the company and news publishers. It also acknowledged that some non-news content got inadvertently blocked when it had banned all news content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-mps-to-okay-changes-to-new-pay-for-news-law-101614218793503.html
25-02-2021||World||J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine closes in on FDA’s nod||The US drugs regulator has virtually cleared the path for a third Covid-19 vaccine, confirming the efficacy and safety of the Johnson & Johnson shot on Wednesday.J&J’s one-shot vaccine could join Pfizer and Moderna’s shots as early as this week in the battle against a pandemic that has killed more than half a million people in the United States, a grim milestone crossed earlier this week.An advisory committee of experts appointed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will meet on Friday to evaluate the findings and grant emergency use authorisation.According to papers submitted by Johnson & Johnson to the FDA seeking emergency use go-ahead, the vaccine has demonstrated an overall efficacy level of 66% - 72% in the United States and 57% in South Africa, a country that is dealing with a highly contagious strain of the coronavirus.The vaccination was more effective, at 86%, against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, and 82% against severe disease in South Africa, reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death among those inoculated.Unlike Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s jabs, Johnson & Johnson’s one is a one-shot vaccine. It’s also known to be easier to store - it can be kept in refrigeration for three months - and transport. The vaccine does not require extremely cold conditions, which the Pfizer vaccine needs.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tried out on more than 44,000 people, aged 18 and older, in multiple countries. The company applied for emergency use authorisation on February 4.The pharma giant expects to roll out millions of doses of its vaccine the next week, pending authorisation, but it is likely to fall short of the expected 10 million by February end.“We will have 20 million doses of the vaccine to be made available by the end of March and we’re prepared to ship, immediately upon emergency use authorisation, nearly 4 million doses of our vaccine, Richard Nettles, the company subsidiary Janssen’s vice-president of medical affairs, said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jjs-covid-19-vaccine-closes-in-on-fda-s-nod-101614218442041.html

25-02-2021||World||Fencing, tightened security at Capitol staying in place for now||The razor wire-topped fences and National Guard patrols in place around the US Capitol grounds since the Jan. 6 mob attack will remain for the time being despite agitation among many lawmakers for the complex to be reopened to the public.Capitol officials who briefed senators on security Wednesday provided no timetable for when the extra security measures, including National Guard troops, would be eased, lawmakers said.“I am very interested in a plan to move as quickly as possible to have the Capitol again be a place where the public is welcome,” said Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat. “I just think it sends kind of a bad message about our country to have our Capitol surrounded by razor wire.”He and other senators said they didn’t hear in the private briefing call any general plan for easing restrictions, which also include street closures in the area.The Capitol has been closed to the public since last spring because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Following the Jan. 6 riot, in which a mob of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters overwhelmed police and rampaged through the building, security was tightened significantly with fencing and National Guard patrols as law enforcement officials look into continuing threats against Congress from extremists.Also read| Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant childrenThe chief of the Capitol Police force and two other top congressional officials resigned in the wake of the breach, and multiple congressional inquiries into security failings on Jan. 6 are under way. In prepared testimony for a House hearing Thursday, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman says that intelligence reports on the threat to Congress before the insurrection were “muddled or contradictory.”Members of both parties said they were anxious for things to return to normal and for the National Guard to be sent home.“I don’t think the poor handling of Jan. 6 should lead us to punish the public,” Kaine said.“I said there’s got to be an end to this thing,” said Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. “And I haven’t heard anything in the presentation that leads me to believe there’s going to be an end, or that there’s really justification.”Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, was even more emphatic, though he said he was unable to join the briefing call because of nomination hearings.Also read| Congress weighs reforms to troubled US Postal Service over finance woes“There’s nothing they could have said at that security briefing that would justify having fences and barbed wire,” Burr said. “That is a bunch of malarkey.

Hirono also said that domestic terrorists and White supremacists feel “emboldened” to carry out violent attacks.”“I think most of us would like to see a day when the fencing and especially the fencing with barbed wire comes down, but there’s still a threat out there and as I say they feel quite emboldened now to plot, plan and go dark in communicating with each other,” Hirono added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fencing-tightened-security-at-capitol-staying-in-place-for-now-101614214301111.html
25-02-2021||World||FAA met to discuss more frequent engine inspections days before Denver incident||Only days before a dramatic engine failure on a United Airlines flight, federal regulators had met about requiring more frequent inspections of the same type of engine, CNN reported citing the source.On Saturday (local time), United Airlines Flight 328 made an emergency landing in Denver when its right Pratt and Whitney PW4000 series engine failed with a loud bang only minutes after takeoff."Last week we were already in the process of undertaking activity and analysis to reduce the inspection interval," CNN quoted Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Steve Dickson as saying.The FAA review was prompted after a December failure of a PW4000 series engine on another Boeing 777-200 in Japan.CNN further reported that federal regulators had required thermal inspections of engine fan blades for wear and tear every 6,500 times the PW4000 series engine is turned on, a measure officially known as cycles. Cracks and damage can be so small or hidden that they are not visible to the naked eye.Also read| FAA orders high-tech inspections of jet engines on Boeing 777sAccording to the source, the PW4000 series engine that failed Saturday was "far short" of the 6,500 cycles that would prompt the next inspection.However, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said it will review maintenance records; it has not specified the number of cycles on the engine since the last inspection.The incidents have engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney recommending significantly more frequent inspections, CNN reported citing a company service bulletin.The bulletin, issued two days after the Denver incident, recommended each engine's 22 fan blades be inspected every 1,000 cycles, but it's unclear what the FAA will ultimately require.United Airlines Flight 328 rained a mile-long trail of debris over suburban Denver before a successful emergency landing. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Monday (local time) that he believed one fan blade had broken off the engine due to metal fatigue and that it had struck and broken the adjacent blade.Also read| UK temporarily bans some Boeing 777s from its airspace after Denver incidentHowever, investigators said one blade had been found inside the engine and the other was found in a soccer field. NTSB said it had recovered the fan blade that failed and shipped it to a Pratt and Whitney lab for analysis.The FAA announced Tuesday (local time) that it would require seven versions of Pratt and Whitney 4000 engines to be inspected before flying again."Until we know more about this particular event, we felt that was the safest course of action," Dickson said adding "There's also the possibility that there will be other types of inspections that could be performed going forward using different technologies."Dickson said the FAA does not see a pattern of engine failures that should concern travelers and that he would feel comfortable flying on the Boeing 777."The safest form of travel in human history is commercial jet travel in the United States, or on a US carrier," Dickson said."And the actions that we are taking at the agency are designed to make sure that it stays that way," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faa-met-to-discuss-more-frequent-engine-inspections-days-before-denver-incident-101614213724836.html

The next two days will be critical in resolving financial obligations, he said during a board meeting Wednesday.The revelations come as Texas continues to recover from blackouts that left more than 4 million in the dark for days during a deep winter freeze. In the wake of the crisis, six members of Ercot’s board have resigned, including the chair and vice chair, after Governor Greg Abbott criticized the grid operator’s handling of the event.Also read| Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant childrenSeveral retail electricity providers “are currently in payment breach” under Ercot protocols, but the grid operator “has not yet taken action to revoke their rights” or terminate their agreements, according to a statement late Wednesday.If Ercot is unable to collect the revenues necessary to cover defaults, those costs would flow to other market participants, who could then pass those charges onto consumers, Chief Financial Officer Sean Taylor said during the meeting.Ercot paused collateral collection on Monday but resumed it again a day later due to concerns about downstream financial impacts. Another pause is still under consideration, Ögelman said. However, disrupting the collection process “has a lot of liquidity risk” and could have “chilling consequences,” he said.The grid operator doesn’t anticipate any issues handling the financial transactions, said Taylor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-companies-face-liquidity-crisis-as-bills-mount-board-leaders-resign-101614213168925.html

25-02-2021||World||Biden's trade nominee Katherine Tai calls China 'both a rival and a partner'||President Joe Biden’s nominee for trade chief is pledging to work with allies to take on China while also embarking on a pragmatic approach to the Asian nation, saying it’s both a rival and partner whose cooperation the U.S. needs to address global challenges.Without going into specifics of how she would address tariffs, export bans and other key issues, Katherine Tai, the pick for U.S. trade representative, said she knows the “opportunities and limitations in our existing toolbox.”“We must recommit to working relentlessly with others to promote and defend our shared values of freedom, democracy, truth, and opportunity in a just society,” Tai said in the text of remarks seen by Bloomberg ahead of her confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee.The comments illustrate how Tai will pursue a hard line in U.S.-China negotiations while also indicating a more methodical and practical style to distance the Biden administration from the chaos that defined the Trump team’s trade agenda. Tai, whose nomination requires Senate approval, is expected to play a key role in setting and implementing Biden’s trade policy, which they both have promised to focus on workers and the middle class.While Tai has a reputation as a progressive Democrat, she’s respected by members of both parties, who have praised her ability to find common ground on thorny matters such as those involving both business and labor.Tai, in the prepared remarks, touted her own experience as the chief counsel for China enforcement for three years at USTR, saying that she knows firsthand the importance of holding the nation accountable for its unfair trade practices, but also the dexterity required in U.S. policy.Echoing Biden’s call to “Build Back Better” from the pandemic, Tai said that the U.S. needs to prioritize making investments at home in people and infrastructure to boost competitiveness and at the same time enforce the rules of global commerce vigorously.“We must remember how to walk, chew gum and play chess at the same time,” she said.Tai spent the past four years as the chief counsel for Democrats on the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee responsible for trade. She was a key figure in negotiations with the Trump administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement, which passed both the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan majorities and was signed by Trump last year.Among the trade challenges facing the Biden administration is deciding what to do with the so-called phase one deal that President Donald Trump struck with China in early 2020 and the more than $350 billion in tariffs that remain in place. Biden has pledged to work with allies to confront China rather than face the nation alone as Trump did, a theme echoed by Tai.She’s likely to face questions from senators on Biden’s approach to the tariffs on Chinese goods, which his administration has indicated it won’t change before a review of trade policy is complete. Other topics could include trade with the European Union, policy toward the World Trade Organization and the Trump administration’s ban on American firms exporting to Chinese companies including telecommunications-equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-trade-nominee-katherine-tai-calls-china-both-a-rival-and-a-partner-101614212569808.html
25-02-2021||World||Republicans introduce resolution opposing any move to lift sanctions on Iran||Senator Tom Cotton and more than 40 other Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution Wednesday opposing any move to lift sanctions on Iran, underscoring the resistance the Biden administration will face in trying to get back into the 2015 nuclear accord.The resolution “rejects and opposes the reapplication of sanctions relief for Iran” and expresses disapproval of any move to reverse a ban that keeps Iran from accessing the U.S. financial system, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg News.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has vowed not to ease sanctions on Iran until it returns to compliance with the multinational accord that former President Donald Trump abandoned. But the U.S. has offered to meet with Iran under the auspices of the five other nations that joined in crafting the nuclear agreement. So far, Iran has spurned the offer.“The U.S. must maintain sanctions on the Iranian regime until it abandons its nuclear ambitions and ends its support for violence and terror around the region,” the resolution’s House and Senate sponsors say in a statement. “Iran took advantage of weak policies during the Obama administration, and President Biden must not repeat those same mistakes.”The resolution is largely symbolic and stands little chance of passage given that Democrats control both chambers of Congress. Nonetheless, it’s a warning to both the Biden administration and Iran that circumventing Congress would only jeopardize any future agreement.In that respect, it echoes a letter Cotton, Arkansas’s junior senator, initiated before the accord was completed under President Barack Obama in 2015, warning Iran that the next American president could revoke it -- as Trump did. Cotton has remained one of the nuclear deal’s most persistent critics.Like the original Iran accord, any renewed agreement would be unlikely to be offered as a treaty that would require a two-thirds vote of approval in the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-introduce-resolution-opposing-any-move-to-lift-sanctions-on-iran-101614211985048.html

25-02-2021||World||Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant children||With its long-term facilities for immigrant children nearly full, the Biden administration is working to expedite the release of children to their relatives in the U.S.U.S. Health and Human Services on Wednesday authorized operators of long-term facilities to pay for some of the children’s flights and transportation to the homes of their sponsors. Under the agency's current guidelines, sponsors can be charged for those flights and required to pay before the government will release children, even if the sponsors have been vetted by the government.Those costs can sometimes exceed $1,000 per child.An internal memo sent Wednesday and obtained by The Associated Press authorizes facility operators to use government funding for transport fees “in the event that a sponsor is not able to pay fees associated with commercial airfare, and a child’s physical release would be otherwise delayed.” HHS declined to say how many flights would be funded.HHS has drastically cut its capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly all of the department’s 7,100 beds for immigrant children are full. Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents are apprehending an average of more than 200 children crossing the border without a parent per day. Most Border Patrol facilities aren't equipped for long-term detention, with children forced to sleep on mats in cells where the lights stay on around the clock.To take children from the Border Patrol, HHS reopened a surge facility at Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can hold up to 700 teenagers, and may soon reopen another site at Homestead, Florida. While they have beds, classrooms and dining areas, surge facilities cost an estimated $775 per child per day and are not subject to the same licensing requirements as regular facilities.Democrats sharply criticized them during the administration of former President Donald Trump, and news of Carrizo Springs’ reopening has drawn criticism from some Democrats as well as Republicans who argue Trump was unfairly blamed. Some have accused Biden of moving to detain children in “cages." No children are detained in cells or behind chain-link fencing at Carrizo Springs, which has long trailers that serve as dormitories and a large tent as a dining hall.“We had to expand and open additional facilities because there was not enough space in the existing facilities if we were to abide by Covid protocols," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Psaki noted that Biden halted a Trump-era practice of expelling unaccompanied immigrant children under public health law, though the U.S. still expels immigrant families and single adults who cross the border without permission.“Our objective is to move these kids quickly from there to vetted, sponsored families and to places where they can safely be," she said.But experts on the detention of immigrant children say HHS needs to change how it works to relieve pressure on the overall system.Leecia Welch, senior director of child welfare at the nonprofit National Center for Youth Law, said HHS could have made several policy changes months ago that would alleviate what she called “a government-created crisis.” She applauded the move to pay for flights and called on U.S. officials to explore other ways to release children from HHS faster, including by raising the capacity of regular facilities while ensuring that protocols are followed to stop the spread of the virus.“While we recognize the Biden administration’s efforts to process unaccompanied children in a responsible way that addresses public health needs and prioritizes children’s safety, it is critical that it not repeat the mistakes of the Trump administration," Naureen Shah, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.One longstanding requirement that has delayed some releases is forcing sponsors to pay for airfares.“Facilities have told families that they will not release a child unless they specifically go to a specific travel agency and purchase tickets,” said Dr. Amy Cohen, executive director of the advocacy group Every Last One.In one case this week, Cohen said, staff at a facility told a woman that she would have to bring a certified check to the airport in order to collect her child, who has been in an HHS facility for three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-surge-us-tries-to-expedite-release-of-migrant-children-101614201995532.html
25-02-2021||World||Germany urges Iran to accept diplomacy in nuclear dispute||Germany's foreign minister on Wednesday urged Iran to accept diplomatic overtures coming from the West in order to preserve the 2015 nuclear accord.Heiko Maas accused Tehran of further undermining the transparency it is required to show under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, after Iran began restricting international inspections of its nuclear facilities Tuesday.Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had added 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 20% to its stockpile as of Feb. 16 — far past the 3.67% purity allowed under the JCPOA."In the end, Iran needs to understand that what’s important is to de-escalate and accept the offer of diplomacy that’s on the table, including from the United States,” Maas said.Iran’s violations of the JCPOA pose a significant problem for U.S. President Joe Biden, who is seeking to reverse the Trump administration’s decision to pull the U.S. unilaterally out of the deal three years ago, triggering the re-imposition of crippling economic sanctions on Iran.Iran this week effectively set a deadline to lift those sanctions within three months, after which it said it would erase surveillance footage of its nuclear facilitiesMaas said the transparency required of Iran under the JCPOA wouldn't be fulfilled during that period."But we still want to use these three months, together with other partners in the nuclear agreement, to discuss step by step how the U.S. can return to this accord,” Maas said. “And in particular (the discussion) will be about the sequence of measures. That is, who needs to take which step so that a general agreement can be achieved at the end of which the U.S. are part of this agreement again.”Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear late Tuesday that his country doesn't have confidence in the accord with Tehran.“We have already seen the quality of agreements with extremist regimes such as yours, in the past century and in this one, with the government of North Korea,” he said. "With or without agreements – we will do everything so that you will not arm yourselves with nuclear weapons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-urges-iran-to-accept-diplomacy-in-nuclear-dispute-101614191956250.html
