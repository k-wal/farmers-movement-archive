The 6,000 replies were an extension of the battle between those calling for India to be left alone and those supporting more attention for the protesting farmers.“Should be talking about this!” wrote Kyle Kuzma of the LA Lakers, on Twitter, with a link to a CNN report on the protests. He has 1 million followers on the social media platform. LA Lakers won the 2020 National Basketball Association championship, the team’s 17th title, tying Boston Celtics for the all-time best.Kuzma also hashtagged the post #FarmersProtest, which was being used by celebs around the world, including the Swedish environmentalist Great Thunberg and pop star Rihanna.As did Baron Davies, a former player of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, “Are we going to address what’s happening in India ? Let my good people free !! Unfair to those who struggle, the farmers provide a way of living and they need to have a right to a way of life. Join me and let’s bring awareness. We all in this together!” Davies has 1 million followers.These stars join a growing number of celebrities worldwide weighing in with their support of the protesting farmers, including Meena Harris, a lawyer and niece of the Indian-origin US vice-president Kamla Harris. She has tweeted and retweeted posts supportive of the farmers.John Cusack, a Hollywood star, and Hasan Minhaj, a comedian of Indian descent, have also joined in. Cusack began tweeting in support of the farmers much before Rihanna and Thunberg turned it into an international trend. The star of films like Being John Malkovich and Runaway Jury knows author Arundhati Roy well, and along with her met Edward Snowden, the fugitive American whistleblower, in Moscow in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-us-celebs-back-farmers-protest-in-india-101612460410791.html
04-02-2021||World||President Biden to end US support for Saudi-led offensive in Yemen||President Joe Biden will announce an end Thursday to U.S. support for a grinding five-year Saudi-led military offensive in Yemen that has deepened humanitarian suffering in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.The move would fulfill a campaign pledge by Biden, whose administration plans to pursue diplomacy to end the overall conflict in Yemen.Biden also is announcing the choice of Timothy Lenderking as special envoy to Yemen as soon as Thursday afternoon, when the president is due to speak at the State Department. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the selection, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. The Gulf-based newspaper The National first reported the pick.Lenderking has been a deputy assistant secretary of state in the agency’s Middle East section. A career foreign service member, he has served in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries inside and out of the Middle East.Saudi Arabia began the offensive in 2015 to counter a Yemeni Houthi faction that had seized territory in Yemen and was launching cross-border missiles at Saudi Arabia.A Saudi-led air campaign since then has killed numerous civilians, and survivors display fragments showing the bombs to be American-made. The conflict has deepened hunger and poverty in Yemen, and international rights experts say both the Gulf countries and Houthis have committed severe rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-to-end-us-support-for-saudi-led-offensive-in-yemen-101612458679985.html
04-02-2021||World||Biden expected to name veteran diplomat as special envoy for Yemen: Report||US President Joe Biden was expected to announce on Thursday the appointment of a veteran U.S diplomat as his special envoy for Yemen, a person familiar with the issue said, indicating a more active US role in efforts to end that country's civil war.Biden was expected to name Timothy Lenderking for the new post in a foreign policy speech, said the source on condition of anonymity. Lenderking's expected appointment was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Lenderking has extensive experience dealing with Yemen and the Gulf. He has been the deputy assistant secretary of State for Gulf affairs and served in the US Embassy in Riyadh.Yemen's civil war pits the internationally recognized government against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, including large numbers of civilians, and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.A Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 on the side of the government and enjoyed the backing of the former Trump administration, with the war increasingly seen as a proxy conflict between the United States and Iran.But the mounting civilian death toll and growing humanitarian calamity - the United Nations estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's 24 million people are in need - fueled bipartisan demands for an end to US support for Riyadh.Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign that he would curtail US support for Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen.The United Nations has been struggling to broker peace talks between the government and the Houthis, an effort that Lenderking likely would be tasked to boost.Biden's decision to name a special envoy comes as the State Department reviews a Trump administration designation last month of the Iran-aligned Houthi group as a foreign terrorist organization.The United States last week approved all transactions involving Yemen's Houthi movement for the next month as it carries out the review. But the United Nations is still hearing concerns that companies are planning to cancel or suspend business with Yemen despite the move.The United Nations and aid groups have called the designation to be reversed, warning it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-expected-to-name-veteran-diplomat-as-special-envoy-for-yemen-report-101612457855616.html
04-02-2021||World||Biden to visit State department as US reengages with its allies||President Joe Biden is sending a message to his messengers.Two weeks into the presidency, Biden on Thursday is visiting the State Department, the most senior of the Cabinet agencies, to underscore his promise to restore a multilateral approach to U.S. foreign policy and mark his administration's reengagement with the international community.White House press secretary Jen Psaki, formerly the State Department’s top spokesperson, said Biden’s visit “is largely focused on his desire to thank the men and women who are Foreign Service officers, civil servants, who are the heart and soul of that institution and, frankly, our government.”Psaki added that Biden would “talk broadly about foreign policy,” but said it wasn’t intended to be his first major foreign policy address as president.Still, the trip is set to come in conjunction with a number of policy announcements meant to restore the nation's place on the global stage.During Thursday's visit, officials said, Biden planned to announce that he will increase the cap on the number of refugees allowed into the United States to more than eight times the level at which President Donald Trump's administration left it.Trump drastically reduced the refugee admissions cap to only 15,000 before he left office. Biden’s plan would raise that number to 125,000, surpassing the ceiling set by President Barack Obama before he left office by 15,000.The timing of Biden's visit so early in his term is deliberate, as much symbolic as it is a nod to his interest in foreign policy and his years as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he represented Delaware.Trump had waited more than a year to visit the department, making his first appearance only for the swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, and repeatedly assailed it as part of a “deep state” out to undermine his administration. Trump denigrated and dismissed its employees and unsuccessfully tried over multiple years to slash its budget by up to 35%.Biden, by contrast, chose longtime confidant Antony Blinken to be his secretary of state, aiming to reinvigorate an American diplomatic corps that had been depleted and demoralized under four years of the Trump administration.He will be greeted by employees eager to hear that diplomacy has returned to the top of the presidential agenda and that the expertise of long-serving foreign service officers will be valued. Although Biden’s first nominations and appointments to senior positions at State have trended heavily toward political appointees, the president and Blinken have pledged to promote career staffers.To that end, the Biden administration is set to name a longtime U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Tim Lenderking, as its special envoy in Yemen. The move comes as Biden is searching for a diplomatic end to the Saudi Arabia-led military campaign that has deepened humanitarian suffering in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the selection, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.Lenderking, a career foreign service member, has served in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries inside and out of the Middle East.The State Department visit comes after Biden moved on Wednesday to extend the last remaining treaty limiting Russian and American stockpiles of nuclear weapons, acting just two days before the pact was set to expire. It also follows days after a coup in Myanmar that has emerged as an early proving ground of Biden's approach to multilateralism.On another major foreign policy issue, Biden is weighing whether to cut off U.S. support that flourished under Trump for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. U.S. aid has been condemned by the international community and has helped contribute to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.At the State Department, Biden may also address asylum claims for residents of Hong Kong, according to one official. He indicated during his campaign that he was interested in providing protection to people persecuted by the Chinese government.Officials said Biden would not necessarily override the record low refugee cap of 15,000 that Trump set for the current budget year. Instead, the 125,000 figure would be proposed for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. The president is required by law to first consult Congress on his plans before making a determination.Advocates had said that the backlog of tens of thousands of refugees left by the Trump administration had made it unlikely Biden’s target of resettling 125,000 refugees could be reached this year. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline. More than one-third of U.S. resettlement offices were forced to close over the past four years with the drop in refugee arrivals and hundreds of workers were let go.Another issue that may be addressed Thursday is a review of vetting procedures for refugees, according to the officials and others. The Trump administration had put in place extreme background checks that had brought the program to a standstill, advocates say.The Trump administration also narrowed eligibility this year, restricting which refugees are selected for resettlement to certain categories, including people persecuted because of religion and Iraqis whose assistance to the U.S. put them in danger.Biden is expected to do away with those categories at some point and have the program return to using the long-standing referral system by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees that makes selections based on a person’s need to be resettled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-state-department-as-us-reengages-with-its-allies-101612457351019.html
04-02-2021||World||US Treasury Secretary Yellen convenes US market regulators to discuss GameStop||US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold a meeting Thursday with top financial market regulators to discuss recent trading volatility that saw shares like GameStop soar last week.Yellen said officials will be "looking carefully at these events," although she did not commit to taking any action.The volatility was created after a social-media-fueled buying frenzy for stocks that were shorted by hedge funds, including of video game store GameStop, which surged over 400 percent before falling sharply.Yellen this week called for the meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to review the volatility."We really need to make sure that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected," she said in her first television interview on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Thursday."We're going to discuss these recent events and discuss whether or not the recent events warrant further action."The events under review erupted when a group of small-time investors on Reddit joined forces to try to thwart hedge funds that made massive bets that the shares would fall.Instead of declining, the wave of buying boosted the share prices of struggling companies, including GameStop and movie theater brand AMC Entertainment.But the share prices fell sharply when the frenzy subsided.- Need for action? -The events led to some retail investor apps such as Robinhood -- which says its goal is to "democratize finance for all" -- to limit trading in some of the most volatile stocks last week, drawing the ire of critics.Progressive US senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren called for action against what they said were Wall Street abuses by hedge funds."We need an SEC investigation," Warren told CNN Sunday. "It's a rigged game, and it's been a set of players who come in and manipulate the market."But Yellen said "we need to understand deeply what happened before we go to action."Yellen's role, however, is limited to convening and consulting, since Treasury does not have jurisdiction over stock market activity, which is the purview of the SEC and CFTC.But she has long experience with the issues as a former chair of the Federal Reserve and member of the board for many years, as the central bank monitors all financial market activity for potential risks to the economy.Treasury also chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which monitors financial risks to coordinate better policy actionThe FSOC brings together the SEC, CFTC and other banking and housing regulators, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).Yellen had to receive a waiver from ethics lawyers at Treasury to hold the discussion about market activity, as she had received at least $700,000 in speaking fees from hedge fund Citadel, a key player in the GameStop saga, according to US media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-secretary-yellen-convenes-us-market-regulators-to-discuss-gamestop-101612456375923.html
04-02-2021||World||Britain explores mixed Covid vaccine shots as variants threaten||British researchers are to explore mixing doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines in a world first trial aimed at finding new ways to swiftly reduce coronavirus infections as new mutated variants emerge.While thousands of individual changes have arisen as the virus mutates on replication and evolves into new variants, only a tiny minority are likely to be important or change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.Among coronavirus variants currently most concerning for scientists and public health experts are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants, which appear to spread more swiftly than others.British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said current Covid-19 vaccines would probably still protect people against infection with the new variants, but this would need to be closely monitored."Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won't be effective on the variants ... especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalisation," Zahawi told Sky News."All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant - there are about 4,000 variants around the world of Covid now."Ravi Gupta, a professor of microbiology at Cambridge University, said Zahawi had misspoken and was referring to individual mutations, not variants."The number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously," Gupta said. "Scientists are using ‘variants’ to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population – there aren’t 4,000 of those."The so-called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01 or B.1.1.7., has mutations including a change in the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor - meaning that it is probably easier to catch."We have about 50% of the world's genome sequencing industry, and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond - whether in the autumn or beyond - to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine," Zahawi said.VACCINE RACEThe Covid-19 pandemic has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to a Reuters tally.Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.The trial will examine the responses to an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.The trial will be the first of its kind to combine a mRNA shot - the one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech - and a adenovirus viral vector vaccine of the type developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca's shot is separately being trialled in combination with another viral vector vaccine, Russia's Sputnik V.The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccine could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility, and might even increase immunity.Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said mixing different shots had proven effective in Ebola vaccine schedules, and though the new trial mixed vaccine technologies, it could also work."Ultimately, it all comes down to the same target - cells making the spike protein - just using different platforms," he told reporters."For that reason we do anticipate that we'll generate a good immune response with these combinations."Public Health England's head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said there was a lot of precedent for such work, as vaccines against Hepatitis A and B were interchangeable from two different manufacturers, and similar work has been undertaken for human papillomavirus (HPV).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-explores-mixed-covid-vaccine-shots-as-variants-threaten-101612453557798.html

But now people above 60 years would have to wait for some other vaccine to get protection against the coronavirus.China has said that it is currently conducting field trials for 16 vaccines, while it has so far granted conditional approval to Sinopharm, even as it began supplying the shot to a number of countries, including Pakistan.Pakistan has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for use -- China's Sinopharm vaccine, Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca.Planning Minister Asad Umar said last week that the global COVAX initiative would provide 17 million doses of the Oxford-Astra­Zeneca vaccine to Pakistan in the first half of 2021. Officials said it would be used for elderly people.COVAX, formally known as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, is a global initiative, which aims at ensuring that middle and lower-income countries get timely access to coronavirus vaccines.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan on Thursday reached 550,540 after 1,508 new cases emerged in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Another 31 people died in this period, taking the COVID-19 toll to 11,833 while 1,971 patients were in critical condition.The ministry said that 505,818 people have recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-china-s-sinopharm-vaccine-not-effective-for-people-over-60-years-101612451470795.html
04-02-2021||World||Iran receives its first batch of foreign coronavirus vaccine||Iran on Thursday received its first batch of foreign-made coronavirus vaccines as the country struggles to stem the worst outbreak of the pandemic in the Middle East.The shipment consists of 500,000 doses of Russian-made Sputnik V vaccines which arrived at Tehran’s Imam Khomeieni International Airport from Moscow, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.Also Iranian state TV quoted Tehran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, as saying that Iran has ordered 5 million doses from Russia. The next batches are to arrive on Feb. 18 and Feb. 28, said Jalali.Last month, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned Iran from importing the American Pfizer-BioNTech and Britain’s Astrazeneca vaccines, a reflection of mistrust toward the West.The coronavirus has so far infected over 1.4 million people in Iran and killed more than 58,000.In December, Iran began testing an Iranian-made vaccine in humans and said it expects to distribute it in spring, an extremely aggressive timeline. Before this year’s fast-tracked development of coronavirus vaccines, the usual methods of testing a vaccine for safety and efficacy with mass trials could take up to a decade.The country has also began working on a joint vaccine with Cuba. It is also planning to import some 17 million doses of vaccine from COVAX and millions from other countries. But Iran is struggling to transfer some $220 million held in South Korean banks to pay for the Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX, an international program designed to distribute coronavirus vaccines to participating countries.The government in Tehran has touted Iran’s domestic vaccine research, repeatedly alleging that tough American sanctions undermine its efforts to purchase foreign-made vaccines and launch mass inoculation campaigns like those underway in the U.S. and Europe. While U.S. sanctions do have specific carve-outs for medicine and humanitarian aid to Iran, international banks and financial institutions hesitate in dealing with Iranian transactions for fear of being fined or locked out of the American market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-receives-its-first-batch-of-foreign-coronavirus-vaccine-101612449631673.html
04-02-2021||World||Jobless claims in US decrease for third consecutive week||Applications for US state unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since the end of November, a sign that job cuts are starting to slow as Covid-19 infections ebb.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs decreased by 33,000 to 779,000 in the week ended Jan. 30, the third straight decline, Labor Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, applications dropped to 816,247.Continuing claims -- an approximation of the number of Americans filing for multiple weeks of state benefits -- decreased to 4.59 million in the week ended Jan. 23. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast 830,000 initial claims and 4.7 million continuing claims.The figures, while still elevated, indicate that layoffs related to the pandemic are starting to ebb after jobless claims picked up in December and early January. In the coming months, as more Americans get inoculated and virus cases fall, economic activity is poised to resume and job cuts may decline further.Stock futures ticked higher and bonds extended their recent slide as economic data and corporate earnings continued to roll in.Policy makers are starting to lift some of the most stringent business restrictions, which should also help to stabilize the labor market. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said indoor dining can reopen in New York City on Feb. 14, and California Governor Gavin Newsom lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on Jan. 25.Jobs ReportThe jobless claims data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report, which is forecast to show the labor market added about 100,000 jobs in January after a 140,000 decline in December. Data from ADP Research Institute Wednesday showed company payrolls increased by 174,000 in January.On Tuesday, Senate Democrats put President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on a fast track to passage, increasing the likelihood it eventually passes on a party-line vote. The bill text has not been drafted yet, but Biden’s proposal includes an extension of expiring federal unemployment programs through September and an increase of supplemental benefits from $300 to $400 per week.Separate data Thursday showed productivity -- or output per hour -- fell in the final three months of 2020 by the most since 1981. The decline was a result of a larger jump in hours worked than in output, as more Americans headed back to work.Other Details||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jobless-claims-in-us-decrease-for-third-consecutive-week-101612446845739.html
04-02-2021||World||Russia revives draft law to grant police access to citizens' geolocation data||Russia has revived a draft proposal allowing law enforcement to access citizens' mobile location data without a court order, according to a document seen by Reuters, a move that comes amid nationwide protests in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.Thousands of protesters have been held during recent weekend rallies and more than 1,000 people were detained in Moscow on Tuesday after a court sentenced Navalny to three and a half years for parole violations he said were trumped up to sideline him.The law, first put before parliament in 2019 and now updated by the digital development ministry, makes it easier to search for missing people, according to the draft.The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment as to whether the return of the bill was in any way linked to the protests, and the bill itself makes no mention of them.The new draft of the law clarifies that a citizen's consent or a court order would be needed for authorities to access the content of messages or conversations but not for geolocation data, which would only be provided by the telecom operators' own equipment. The ministry said the proposal breached no privacy rules."The bill complies with legislation on personal data because geolocation coordinates are not personal data," Oleg Ivanov, deputy digital development minister, told Reuters.The ministry is yet to hear back from other domestic state institutions, a required step before the draft can be resubmitted to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.Should the law be passed, law enforcement agencies would easily be able to trace who a particular person was with, at what time and for how long, said Artem Kozlyuk, head of Roskomsvoboda, a website monitoring internet freedom Russia."It also creates the risk of people's data being leaked on the black market," he added.

04-02-2021||World||UK regulator revokes Chinese TV licence, Beijing complains about BBC 'fake news'||Britain's media regulator on Thursday revoked a Chinese TV licence after it concluded that the Chinese Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel while Beijing lodged an official complaint over the BBC's Covid-19 coverage.Britain and China have been exchanging barbs for months over Beijing's crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, concerns over the security of Huawei technology and the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China’s remote Xinjiang region.After an investigation, the British regulator Ofcom concluded that China Global Television Network's (CGTN), an English language international Chinese channel, was ultimately controlled by the Communist Party."Our investigation showed that the licence for China Global Television Network is held by an entity which has no editorial control over its programmes," Ofcom said."We are unable to approve the application to transfer the licence to China Global Television Network Corporation because it is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is not permitted under UK broadcasting law."Within minutes of the Ofcom statement, China said it had lodged "stern representations" to the British Broadcasting Corp over what it said was "fake news" coverage of Covid-19, and urged the broadcaster to publicly apologise.China's foreign ministry complained about coverage broadcast on Jan. 29 about the coronavirus, saying that the BBC had recently "linked the pandemic to politics" and "rehashed theories about covering up by China".It said the publicly funded BBC used a clip to say the Chinese virus prevention department had used violence to enforce the law, when it was actually a clip about an anti-terrorism exercise."China urges the BBC Beijing bureau to take China’s position seriously," the ministry said. The BBC, it said, should "stop harbouring ideological bias, stop smearing China, uphold professional ethics, and do objective, fair reporting on China."The BBC said it stood by its "accurate and fair reporting of events in China and totally rejects these unfounded accusations of fake news or ideological bias"."The BBC is the world's most trusted international broadcaster, reporting to a global audience of more than 400m people weekly without fear or favour," its statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-revokes-chinese-tv-licence-beijing-complains-about-bbc-fake-news-101612449584500.html
04-02-2021||World||Hunter Biden's announces memoir 'Beautiful Things', out in April||Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden and an ongoing target for conservatives, has a memoir coming out April 6.The book is called “Beautiful Things” and will center on the younger Biden's well publicized struggles with substance abuse, according to Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. Acquired in the fall of 2019, “Beautiful Things” was kept under wraps even as Biden's business dealings became a fixation of then-President Donald Trump and others during the election and his finances a matter of investigation by the Justice Department.“Beautiful Things” was circulated among several authors and includes advance praise from Stephen King, Dave Eggers and Anne Lamott.“In his harrowing and compulsively readable memoir, Hunter Biden proves again that anybody — even the son of a United States President — can take a ride on the pink horse down nightmare alley," King writes in his blurb. "Biden remembers it all and tells it all with a bravery that is both heartbreaking and quite gorgeous. He starts with a question: Where’s Hunter? The answer is he’s in this book, the good, the bad, and the beautiful.”In a snippet released by Gallery, Biden writes in his book, “I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by a remarkable, unbreakable love."During one of last fall's presidential debates, Joe Biden defended his son from attacks by Trump.“My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem," the Democratic candidate said. "He’s overtaken it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it, and I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.”Hunter Biden, who turned 51 Thursday, is the oldest surviving child of the president, who lost his first wife and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a 1972 car accident, and son Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015. The title of Hunter's book refers to an expression he and his brother would use with each other after Beau's diagnosis, meant to emphasize what was important in life.Hunter Biden is a lawyer and former lobbyist whose work helped lead to the first impeachment of Trump. Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then U.S. vice president, was helping conduct the Obama administration’s foreign policy in that region. Trump and others have insisted that Biden was exploiting his father's name, and they raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption. The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump in 2019 after learning that he had pressured Ukraine's president to announce it was investigating the Bidens. Trump was acquitted by the Senate.Last December, Hunter Biden confirmed that the Justice Department was looking into his tax affairs, and The Associated Press subsequently reported that he had received a subpoena asking about his interaction with numerous business entities. Though Trump made clear publicly that he wanted a special counsel to handle the investigation, then-Attorney General William Barr did not appoint one. Biden has denied any wrongdoing.Financial terms for “Beautiful Things," which was written in collaboration with the author and journalist Drew Jubera, were not disclosed. Biden and his publisher likely will face criticism from Republicans for his memoir, although books by presidential family members are nothing new. During Trump's presidency, son Donald Trump Jr. released two books, “Triggered” and “Liberal Privilege.”New York publishers often take on authors with a wide range of political viewpoints, and Simon & Schuster has released books by Trump and Sean Hannity, along with such anti-Trump bestsellers as former National Security Advisor John Bolton's “The Room Where It Happened” and presidential niece Mary Trump's “Too Much and Never Enough.”The publisher signed up a book last fall by a leading Trump supporter in Washington, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, but dropped it in the wake of Hawley's support for the Jan. 6 protest that led to the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who wrongly believed that the president had been reelected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-s-announces-memoir-beautiful-things-out-in-april-101612446993572.html

China has so far approved one domestically made coronavirus vaccine for commercial use. At least four more are undergoing late-stage trials, though the vaccination drive carried out since July has been sanctioned under an emergency rule.CoronaVac has made progress in phase three clinical trials overseas, showing a good level of safety after inoculation, official news agency, Xinhua reported, quoting a company statement.“Fourteen days after the inoculation of two doses of CoronaVac, the effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting against diseases caused by Covid-19 has met the relevant technical standards laid out by the World Health Organisation and the requirements of (China’s) National Medical Products Administration,” the statement added.The NHC said on Thursday that the mainland reported 30 new Covid-19 cases for February 3, up by five cases from a day earlier.The health authorities said that 17 of the new cases were locally transmitted infections while the remaining were imported cases. Both local and national governments are advising citizens not to travel during the upcoming holidays – the most important ones in the Chinese calendar – beginning February 11.Lockdowns, restrictions on travel and mass testing appear to have prevented the latest wave of the disease from spreading throughout China, even as the country endured its worst period of Covid-19 infections since March 2020.The total number of confirmed mainland Covid-19 cases now stands at 89649; the death toll remained unchanged at 4636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gives-31-2mn-covid-shots-as-second-firm-applies-for-license-101612446968480.html

He did not elaborate but said there was no evidence to suggest it emerged from a lab.The origin of the coronavirus has become highly politicised following accusations, especially by the United States, that China was not transparent in its early handling of the outbreak. Beijing has pushed the idea that the virus originated elsewhere.Daszak was involved in research into the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, tracing its roots to bats living in a cave in southwest Yunnan province."Similar research needs to be done if we are going to find the true wildlife origin" of Covid-19, said Daszak, president of the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance."That sort of work to find the likely bat source is important because if you can find the sources of these lethal viruses you can reduce the contact with those animals," he told Reuters in an interview.It is unclear whether China is currently sampling its many bat caves, but viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 had previously been found in the southwest province of Yunnan.He said the team in Wuhan had been receiving new information about how the virus led to a pandemic, but did not elaborate."I'm seeing a picture coming through of some of the scenarios looking more plausible than before," he said.One scenario being scrutinised more closely by the team is the possibility that the virus could have been circulating long before it was first identified in Wuhan."That's something our group is looking at very intensely to see what level of community transmission could have been happening earlier," Daszak said."The real work we are doing here is to trace back from the first cases back to an animal reservoir, and that's a much more convoluted path, and may have happened over a number of months or even years."The investigators have visited hospitals, research facilities and the seafood market where the first outbreak was identified, although their contacts in Wuhan are limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts.Daszak said Chinese authorities had not refused any of the team's requests to visit facilities or meet with key figures."It is of course impossible to know what you are not being told, but what I am seeing in China, and what this group is seeing in China, is that what we asked for, we are being allowed to do," Daszak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bat-caves-need-exploring-in-search-for-covid-origins-who-team-member-says-101612436121204.html

04-02-2021||World||Fears raised over facial recognition use at Moscow protests||Russian authorities are deploying facial recognition cameras to identify protesters during rallies in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in Moscow, human rights groups said, warning that the technology is being used to stifle peaceful dissent.With more than 105,000 cameras, Moscow boasts one of the world's most comprehensive surveillance systems - which authorities say has helped cut crime and enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions.Yet, since the system became fully operational last year, rights activists have noted that cameras have been used to monitor political demonstrations, with a lack of clear rules allowing for abuse of the system.Those concerns were renewed this week, after two straight weekends of nationwide protests.Alexander Karavaev, a lawyer with Moscow-based human rights group Agora, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that several of his clients were brought in for questioning on Jan. 31 after being picked out by cameras in Moscow.Among them was Mikhail Shulman, the husband of renowned political scientist Yekaterina Shulman, who was stopped at a metro station after he and his wife approached officers to inquire about transportation closures, said the lawyer."They (police) explained that the 'face control' system installed on the subway cameras had worked," he said, adding police told him the system was normally used to identify people who have committed a crime."To my arguments that the Shulmans were definitely not criminals, they could not answer anything, saying that they were just (doing their job)," the lawyer said.Authorities have said that the police's heavy-handed response to the demonstrations, which saw thousands of arrests across the country, was justified because the protests were illegal and unauthorised.Anastasiia Zlobina of Human Rights Watch, said that "while the authorities continue to deem peaceful unsanctioned protests illegal, the evolving technology at their disposal will keep facilitating the crackdown against such protests.""Using such technology to prosecute peaceful protesters at the opposition rallies violates the freedom of assembly and amounts to a discrimination based on political views," said the coordinator for Europe and Central Asia.Moscow's Department of Technology, which manages the surveillance system, said in an emailed statement it operates in strict accordance with Russian laws and referred questions on the use of cameras to law enforcement agencies.Moscow's police did not reply to a request for comment.Shulman was held for three hours and questioned about the rallies as a witness, before being released with no charges brought against him, Karavaev said.The case was not isolated, said the lawyer, adding he also represented a 21-year-old woman who was detained after being spotted by cameras at a metro station.Similar accounts have been shared on social media.Photojournalist Georgy Malets wrote on Facebook last month that he was held at another metro station after receiving a call from police warning him that he had been registered as a "political figure" for taking part in an earlier rally he attended for work.Earlier this week, TASS news agency quoted a law enforcement source saying facial recognition had been used to detect participants at a rally on Jan. 31 and detain people who took part in earlier unauthorized demonstrations ahead of the event.Privacy concernsDigital rights activists say that current regulations do not clearly define how and when police can access the cameras nor do they establish mechanisms for judicial or public oversight."Opaque" rules opened the door for possible rights violations, said Karavaev, adding that the Shulman case suggested cameras were used for purposes that went beyond tackling crime.Last year, a Moscow court ruled that the city's facial recognition system does not violate the privacy of its citizens, dismissing a lawsuit brought by activists seeking to ban the technology's use at mass events and protests.The case is now with the European Court of Human Rights."Collection and storage of protesters' unique biometric data in itself raises serious privacy concerns," said Zlobina.Navalny, 44, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.On Tuesday, a Moscow court sentenced Navalny to three and a half years in jail for parole violations he said were trumped up to sideline him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-raised-over-facial-recognition-use-at-moscow-protests-101612443180772.html
04-02-2021||World||Red Cross to help 500 million get Covid shots||The Red Cross launched a plan Thursday to help vaccinate 500 million people against Covid-19 in over 100 countries, warning that leaving out the world's poorest could seriously backfire.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it would throw its weight into the distribution and acceptance of vaccines among some of the hardest-to-reach communities.The Geneva-based IFRC said it would spend 100 million Swiss francs ($111 million, 92.5 million euros) on the push and was already working with governments in more than 60 countries to see where its help could be the most effective."The current lack of equity in the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is alarming and could backfire to deadly and devastating effect," IFRC secretary general Jagan Chapagain told reporters.He said nearly 70 percent of vaccine doses administered so far had been in the world's 50 richest countries while only 0.1 percent had been deployed in the poorest 50."It could prolong or even worsen this terrible pandemic," Chapagain said, noting that if the virus continued to circulate and mutate in large areas of the globe, even those who have been vaccinated in wealthier countries would not be safe.He called for richer countries to share vaccines once they had immunised their most vulnerable populations.Otherwise, "the emergence of variants in far-away low-income countries will shatter the illusion of safety in wealthier countries," said Chapagain.Also read| Canada: Hong Kong graduates can apply for work permits, slams China on rightsThe IFRC, which calls itself the world's largest humanitarian network, said it will bolster national vaccination efforts, including supporting logistics and countering misinformation about vaccine efficacy.IFRC health director Emanuele Capobianco it was already supporting vaccination campaigns in Austria, Brazil, Morocco and Kuwait, among other countries.It is also aiming to reach refugees and undocumented migrants.On Wednesday, the Covax programme to ensure equitable worldwide access to Covid-19 vaccines published its first distribution list.Some 145 countries are set to receive an initial 337.2 million doses -- enough to immunise 3.3 percent of their collective population by mid-2021, with first deliveries expected in late February.For many poorer countries, the scheme will be their only way of accessing vaccines."The equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines between and within countries is more than a moral imperative: it is the only way to solve the most pressing public health emergency of our time," said Chapagain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-cross-to-help-500-million-get-covid-shots-101612441230757.html

About 300,000 Canadian passport holders live in the city.Under the new visa rules, unveiled last November, any Hong Kong resident who has graduated from a Canadian university in the past five years can apply to work for up to three years. Those with equivalent foreign credentials are also eligible.Visa recipients will also be offered a way to transition more easily to permanent residency."Canada continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Hong Kong, and is deeply concerned about the new National Security Law and the deteriorating human rights situation there," the government said in a statement.Also read| Myanmar's military coup: What led to Aung San Suu Kyi’s detention?After China imposed the law, Ottawa moved quickly to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and banned the export of sensitive military items.Hong Kong residents currently in Canada temporarily, including visitors, students and workers, can apply online for the visas. Eligible spouses or common-law partners, as well as dependent children, can also apply for a study or work permit.The measures apply to residents who hold a Hong Kong special administrative region or a British National Overseas passport, created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong.

04-02-2021||World||WHO: Discussions open, meetings frank in Wuhan||World Health Organization investigators looking for clues into the origin of the coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said that the Chinese side has provided a high level of cooperation, but cautioned against expecting immediate results from the visit.“I keep saying that we need to be realistic, a short mission like this one will not have all the answers but it helps advance the understanding of the #virusorigin #wuhan," Hung Nguyen-Viet, co-leader of the Animal and Human Health Program of the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, said in a tweet Thursday.In an earlier tweet, zoologist and team member Peter Daszak praised Wednesday’s meetings with staff at the key Wuhan Institute of Virology, including with Deputy Director is Shi Zhengli, a virologist who worked with Daszak to track down the origins of SARS that originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak.“Extremely important meeting today with staff at WIV including Dr Shi Zhengli. Frank, open discussion. Key questions asked & answered.,” Daszak tweeted.The team on Thursday spent around two hours meetings with managers and residents at the Jiangxinyuan community administrative center in Wuhan's Hanyang District. No details were given.Official statistics shows that there were at least 16 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the community last year among nearly 10,000 people living there when the virus broke out.Also read| USS Nimitz to be back in Indo-Pacific, holds a message for China on TaiwanEarlier, Daszak tweeted images of media outside the virology institute, saying: “Thanking the press for their patience and interest in getting this news out to the world. The work is moving ahead & we look forward to being able to talk about the results as soon as possible."The Wuhan Institute of Virology has collected extensive virus samples, leading to unproven allegations that it may have caused the original outbreak by leaking the virus into the surrounding community. China has strongly denied that possibility and has promoted unproven theories that the virus may have originated elsewhere.Along with the institute, the WHO team that includes experts from 10 nations has visited hospitals, research institutes, a traditional market tied to the outbreak and other sites.Members of the team have met with institute researchers and management, experts, vendors, residents and media representatives, the spokesperson for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, told reporters at a briefing Thursday.It is likely to take years and multiple investigations in many parts of the globe to confirm the origins of the virus because of the exhaustive research, including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies required to pin down an outbreak’s animal reservoir. One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan but that has yet to be proven.The first clusters of Covid-19 were detected in Wuhan in late 2019, prompting the government to put the city of 11 million under a strict 76-day lockdown. China has since reported more than 89,000 cases and 4,600 deaths — the bulk of them in Wuhan — with new cases largely concentrated in its northeast and local lockdowns and travel restrictions being imposed to contain the outbreaks.New cases of local transmission fell to just 17 on Thursday as Chinese heed government calls to skip family visits and stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday later this month.China has also pushed ahead with a plan to vaccinate 50 million people for Covid-19 by the middle of this month. As of Wednesday, more than 31 million doses had been administered, Mi told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-discussions-open-meetings-frank-in-wuhan-101612433913576.html

04-02-2021||World||World food price index rises in January, at highest level since July 2014: FAO||World food prices rose for an eighth consecutive month in January, hitting their highest level since July 2014, led by jumps in cereals, sugar and vegetable oils, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 113.3 points last month versus an upwardly revised 108.6 in December.The December figure was previously given as 107.5.The Rome-based FAO also said in a statement that worldwide cereal harvests remained on course to hit an annual record in 2020, but warned of a sharp fall in stocks and signalled unexpectedly large import demands from China.FAO's cereal price index climbed 7.1% month-on-month in January, led higher by international maize prices, which soared 11.2%, some 42.3% above their level a year ago, buoyed in part by purchases by China and lower-than-expected U.S. production.Wheat prices increased 6.8%, driven by strong global demand and expectations of reduced sales by Russia when its wheat export duty doubles in March 2021, FAO said.Sugar prices jumped 8.1%, with worries about worsening crop prospects in the European Union, Russia and Thailand, and dry weather conditions in South America, pushing up import demand.The vegetable oil price index increased 5.8% to reach its highest level since May 2012, pushed up in part by lower-than-expected palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia due in part to heavy rainfall. A rise in soyoil prices was fuelled by reduced export opportunities and prolonged strikes in Argentina.Dairy prices rose 1.6%, underpinned by heavy Chinese purchases ahead of the upcoming New Year holiday.The meat index posted a 1.0% gain, led by brisk imports of poultry, especially from Brazil, amid avian influenza outbreaks that have hampered exports from several European countries.FAO revised up its forecast for the 2020 cereal season to 2.744 billion tonnes from a previous estimate of 2.742 billion tonnes made in December, with both wheat and rice yields seen rising. The forecast for coarse grains production was trimmed because of reduced prospects for the United States and Ukraine."Looking ahead to 2021 cereal output, early production prospects for winter wheat crops in the northern hemisphere indicate a modest increase this year," FAO said.The U.N. agency said China was importing unexpectedly large quantities of maize this season, which was having a significant knock-on impact on estimates for world utilisation and stocks.The forecast for world cereal utilisation in 2020/21 was put at 2.761 billion tonnes against a previous estimate of 2.744 billion, while the forecast for world cereal stocks was pegged at 802 million tonnes down from a previous 866.4 million tonnes."At this level, the world stocks-to-use ratio of cereals would decline from 29.7 percent in 2019/20 to 28.3 percent in 2020/21, marking a seven-year low," FAO said.It said the contraction stemmed largely from "a massive downward adjustment" to maize inventories in China.The FAO forecast for world cereal trade in 2020/21 was hiked by 10.6 million tonnes to 465.2 million tonnes -- a projected 5.7% rise on the previous season's record high. Trade in all major cereals was expected to climb, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-price-index-rises-in-january-at-highest-level-since-july-2014-fao-101612431285082.html

The U.S. has previously accused China of committing genocide.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has already been invited to visit Xinjiang “and the two sides have been in contact with each other.” China says it’s fighting separatism and religious extremism among Uighurs, and denies wrongdoing.“We welcome the foreign nationals with an unbiased view to visit Xinjiang to see with their own eyes a real Xinjiang,” he added. “In the meantime, we oppose the interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and oppose the presumption of guilt or any investigation based on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-asks-for-un-probe-into-new-china-uighur-abuse-claims-101612432018044.html

This is another great step forward for British science, expertise and innovation, backed by government funding -- and I look forward to seeing what it produces,” he said.The 13-month study will monitor the impact of the different dosing regimens on patients’ immune responses, which have the potential to be higher or lower than from the same dose regimen. Initial findings are expected to be released later in the year.“Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against Covid-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme, if needed and if approved by the medicines regulator,” said Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for the study.Also read| Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers claim it reduces Covid-19 transmission“It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer; unless this is evaluated in a clinical trial we just won’t know. This study will give us greater insight into how we can use vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease,” he said.The study has received ethics approval from the Research Ethics Committee, as well as approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Over 800 patients are expected to take part in the study, referred to as the Covid-19 Heterologous Prime Boost study or ‘Com-Cov’, across eight different sites across England -- including in London, Birmingham and Liverpool.“If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery, and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains,” said Chief Investigator Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford.Should the study show promising results, then the UK government says it could consider reviewing the vaccine regimen approach if needed, once proven to be safe and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)."We need people from all backgrounds to take part in this trial, so that we can ensure we have vaccine options suitable for all. Signing up to volunteer for vaccine studies is quick and easy via the NHS Vaccine Research Registry,” said Professor Andrew Ustianowski, National Clinical Lead for the NIHR Covid Vaccine Research Programme.Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said a same-dose regimen is currently implemented for the UK-wide Covid-19 vaccination programme, and there are no current plans for this to change.Anyone who has received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination as part of the UK-wide delivery plan will not be affected by this study. They will receive their second dose from the same source and over the same 12-week interval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-world-first-alternate-dosing-covid-19-vaccine-trial-101612431145947.html

04-02-2021||World||After India, Turkey rejects global criticism in domestic matters||Turkey on Thursday rejected international criticism of its crackdown on protests by students opposing the appointment of a government loyalist to head Istanbul’s top university, warning countries to stay out of its domestic issues.For weeks, students and faculty members of Bogazici University have been protesting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Jan. 1 appointment of Melih Bulu, an academic who once ran for parliament as a candidate for Erdogan’s party. They are calling for Bulu’s resignation as the university’s rector and for the university to be allowed to elect its own president.Some of the protests have erupted into clashes between police and demonstrators and hundreds of people have been detained, some taken away following raids of their homes, even as Erdogan has promised reforms to strengthen democratic standards.Officials from the United States, the United Nations and the European Union have criticized Turkey’s handling of the protests as well as a series of anti-LGBT comments that were made by Erdogan and other officials while denouncing the demonstrations.On Thursday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement defending the Turkish security forces’ actions, saying there were attempts by terrorist organizations to infiltrate and provoke the protests.Also read| Michigan Republican Peter Meijer defends impeachment vote to upset voters“We recommend that those who ... attempt to give our country lessons in democracy and law, turn the mirror on themselves,” the ministry said. “No one has the right to attempt to intervene in Turkey’s affairs.”Tensions flared this week after a group of students were arrested over a poster, which was displayed at Bogazici University, that depicted Islam’s most sacred site with LGBT rights flags. The students were arrested over the weekend on charges of inciting hatred and insulting religious values.“We are concerned by detentions of students and other demonstrators and strongly condemn the anti-LGBTQI rhetoric surrounding the demonstrations,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday.The U.N. Human Rights office urged Turkey on Twitter to stop the use of excessive force on the protesters and condemned “homophobic and transphobic comments by officials, inciting hatred and discrimination against LGBT people.”European Parliament legislator Nacho Sanchez Amor also expressed concerns over the police violence and mass detentions and asked: “does this reflect the new positive agenda and the will of reforms?”The Interior Ministry announced Thursday that police detained a total of 528 people over the protests, of whom 498 have since been released. Of those in custody, at least 22 people have links to terrorist organizations, said ministry spokesman Ismail Catakli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-india-turkey-rejects-global-criticism-in-domestic-matters-101612429564564.html

04-02-2021||World||US mulls using law designed to prosecute Mafia against Capitol rioters||The US Justice Department is considering whether to charge members of far-right groups involved in the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol under a federal law usually used against organized crime, according to two law enforcement sources.The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, enables prosecutors to combat certain ongoing racketeering crimes such as murder, kidnapping, bribery and money laundering. The 1970 statute provides for hefty criminal penalties including up to 20 years in prison and seizure of assets obtained illegally through a criminal enterprise.The sources, a current law enforcement official and a former official who recently left the federal government, said using the RICO statute to charge people involved in the Capitol violence is being debated within the Justice Department, with no final decision made. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.The siege by supporters of former President Donald Trump left five dead including a police officer. It is not yet clear if cases arising from it meet "statutory elements" necessary for a RICO charge, the former federal official said."This is something that is being mulled over in the halls of DOJ," the official added, using the department's initials.President Joe Biden's administration has warned that domestic extremism is a growing threat following the Capitol rampage, a sharp departure from the way Trump regarded extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. In a September pre-election debate with Biden, Trump told the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by."Justice Department spokeswoman Kristina Mastropasqua declined to comment about the potential use of the RICO statute beyond pointing to prior statements by the senior federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, that he would charge people based on what the evidence showed.Sherwin has said a wide range of criminal charges are being contemplated, including trespassing, assault and seditious conspiracy.The RICO law was crafted to help prosecutors convict top Mafia leaders who ordered others to commit crimes. RICO cases are complex, often take years to develop, and require approval from Justice Department leadership."RICO was designed to address the Godfather - the person who doesn't get their hands bloody," said Jeffrey Grell, an attorney who specializes in RICO law. "You would really only use RICO to go after the kingpins or the leaders."Prosecutors have used it against other violent groups, such as one led by Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the "Blind Sheikh," who was convicted of plotting to bomb the United Nations and George Washington Bridge in New York.More than 170 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack that interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory over Trump and sent lawmakers into hiding for their own safety.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, tapped to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is advocating possible RICO charges. A Durbin spokesperson said, "There are multiple statutes currently available for federal prosecutors to use to hold the perpetrators behind the Jan. 6 attack accountable, including RICO, and prosecutors should appropriately evaluate potential charges."'Racketeering activity'Obstructing an official government proceeding, the charge some Oath Keepers and Proud Boy members are currently facing, is considered a "racketeering activity."Prosecutors in a RICO case would need to show that the far-right groups qualify as a "criminal enterprise" and that members of the enterprise engaged in a pattern of two or more related crimes beyond the Capitol riots.That could mean looking at whether these groups engaged in similar actions at other events, such as the violent 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, or other violent activities such as storming state capitols."Whatever theory they're pursuing requires looking at the group and kind of zooming out so they can capture a pattern of racketeering activity more than just what happened on that day," said Kamal Ghali, an Atlanta attorney and former federal prosecutor.In a RICO case, prosecutors must show a pattern of related racketeering crimes and a threat of continuing criminal conduct.A Washington grand jury last month indicted three Oath Keepers members on charges that they conspired to forcibly storm the Capitol. Two Proud Boys members were indicted on charges they conspired with others to obstruct law enforcement from protecting the Capitol.In a sworn statement, an FBI agent said Thomas Caldwell, a defendant in the Oath Keepers indictment, sent messages after the attack urging others to keep fighting."We need to do this at the local level," Caldwell was quoted by the FBI as saying. "Lets storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!"Federal prosecutors in Ohio convinced a judge to detain Caldwell's co-defendant Donovan Crowl by citing recent writings by the group's leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes. After the riots, Rhodes urged members to begin organizing in "friendly red" counties - jurisdictions that lean Republican - saying the Biden administration represents an "illegitimate regime."The three Oath Keepers have not yet entered pleas, though Caldwell has previously said in court that "every single charge is false." Rhodes did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mulls-using-law-designed-to-prosecute-mafia-against-capitol-rioters-101612428944773.html
04-02-2021||World||Super-rich and punctual Switzerland is also behind on Covid-19 vaccines||Being famously wealthy, a model for efficiency and punctuality and having a big pharmaceuticals industry is no guarantee of success when it comes to the coronavirus vaccination drive.The European Union’s procurement saga has dominated headlines, but neighbouring Switzerland is facing a similar predicament. With shops, theaters and restaurants closed and a public desperate for respite, authorities in the capital of Bern weren’t offering Covid-19 immunization appointments at the weekend. There simply wasn’t enough vaccine.The Swiss often refer to their country as a “Musterschüler,” or “model student” because of its ability to get things done in time. On Wednesday, the government announced it had ordered more batches, including from two new suppliers. Yet like the EU, a bloc it never joined in order to maintain in control over all its affairs, Switzerland is suffering from acting too late. About 3.7% of the population has been inoculated, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. That’s marginally more than the average for the 27-member EU, though a fraction of the U.K. on 15%. It’s also less than continental frontrunner Serbia, a country beyond the EU with a gross domestic product per capita that’s less than 10% of Switzerland’s.Also read| UN climate chief urges world 'in a tough spot' to keep fighting warming“The government’s vaccination plan has failed,” said Marco Chiesa, head of the Swiss People’s Party, the nationalist group that has the most seats in parliament’s lower house. “We’re not used to such unreliability.”Officials say delivery shortfalls are due to be recouped in March. Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose department oversees vaccine procurement, said on Feb. 1 the country may miss its target of inoculating over 75s by the end of the month. All adults, though, would be vaccinated by the end of June, he said.Frustration with the slow rollout escalated when ministers were secretly immunized while senior citizens have to wait. “The government is putting its credibility on the line,” newspaper Tages-Anzeiger wrote on Jan. 15. Government advisers reckon delays to vaccines cost as much as 110 million francs ($122 million) for each day the economy can’t operate normally. The issue might simply be that Switzerland isn’t set up for the swift decision-making that the vaccine procurement needed. It also eschews state involvement in commercial business. Business lobby Economiessuisse on Wednesday called for a national crisis response group that reports directly to the government and is able to act quickly.Despite healthcare spending second only to the U.S. and having two of Europe’s biggest drugmakers, the country that hosts the World Health Organization didn’t provide funds for vaccine development.“The EU supported the financing of production facilities and we didn’t do that,” said Andreas Faller, a former health ministry official who now works as a consultant. “And in relation to the size of our population, we are the biggest Pharma producer in the world.”Also read| Covid-19: When lawmakers turned lawbreakersThe Health Ministry’s initial purchases from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc. covered only 75% of the population, though it since has more than doubled the Moderna order and announced deals with CureVac N.V. and Novavax Inc. this week.The Moderna contract was announced in August, but the Swiss didn’t agree to take Astra’s shot until mid-October, in a deal that piggy backed on the EU agreement that’s caused so much controversy in recent weeks. Switzerland also is now requiring more data before it can follow the UK and EU in approving the vaccine for use.Pfizer’s delivery delays, meanwhile, have forced officials in the cantons of Zurich and Zug to postpone appointments, and the campaign has additionally been marred by faulty statistics on how many vaccines had been administered and a tussle between federal and local officials over allocation.Anne Levy, director-general of the Federal Office of Public Health, said on Feb. 2 that Switzerland just faces the same problems as the rest of the world. “We were very successful in the choosing and procurement of vaccines,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/superrich-and-punctual-switzerland-is-also-behind-on-covid-19-vaccines-101612418493745.html
04-02-2021||World||Michigan Republican Peter Meijer defends impeachment vote to upset voters||Michigan Rep. Peter Meijer, one of just 10 Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump over the deadly attack on the Capitol, defended his decision while taking pointed criticism from voters Wednesday night.“What we witnessed at the Capitol — the attempted insurrection, the involvement of a sitting American president propagating the falsehoods that led up to that — required a significant response,” he said during his first town hall, a virtual event that 400-plus people watched on Zoom or Facebook. The freshman lawmaker spoke from his office in Washington, D.C.Two constituents who asked questions said they were deeply disappointed with Meijer, a 33-year-old Iraq War veteran who represents the 3rd District in western Michigan.“Why aren't you doing what your constituents wanted you to do?” said Cindy Witke. “I went against people who said not to vote for you because I believed in you. I've lost that belief.”Nancy Eardley accused Meijer, the only first-term legislator to back impeachment on Jan. 13, of betraying the district within two weeks of taking office.“I don't know that there's really much you can say that will ever change my mind and not work toward primarying you out after two years,” she said, claiming no court looked at evidence of election fraud.There was not widespread fraud, as was confirmed by a range of voting officials and by former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee.Meijer said Trump told “two fundamental lies” after losing to Democrat Joe Biden — falsely stating that the election had been stolen and that Jan. 6, the day Congress counted electoral votes, was a chance to “stop the steal.” Trump, who had exhorted his supporters to “fight like hell” shortly before they swarmed the Capitol, took close to 2 1/2 hours to issue a video urging them to go home despite the riot having turned deadly, Meijer said.“This was a moment when we needed leadership and the president, in my view, did not show that,” he said.One participant, Kim Reeder, thanked Meijer for his vote.“I didn't vote for you, but right now I'm sure glad you're my representative," she said.Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice. His Senate trial will start next week.Impeachment took up half of the hourlong forum. Other questioners asked about the next federal COVID-19 relief plan, student debt forgiveness, gun rights and the role of pharmacy benefit managers in drug costs.At least one Republican has already vowed to challenge Meijer in the 2022 primary: Tom Norton, who finished third to Meijer in a five-way primary last year.Meijer in November won the open, longtime GOP-held seat by nearly 6 percentage points over a Democrat, a larger margin than Trump’s 3-point victory there.Meijer acknowledged that a majority of Republicans in his district, "maybe a strong majority," are upset with his impeachment decision.“That weighed on me. That was one of the reasons why I felt ultimately sickened by having to take this vote,” he said. “How do I balance that immediate feeling with what we need to do as a country, what I feel my party needs to do and where I hope we can go?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-republican-peter-meijer-defends-impeachment-vote-to-upset-voters-101612428316843.html
04-02-2021||World||Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers claim it reduces Covid-19 transmission||As per a report by developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine on Sunday, claimed that it can reduce the transmission of Covid-19 virus, reported The Washington Post.In a preprint of an article under review at the Lancet medical journal, the Oxford University vaccine developers report that was based on follow-up studies of their clinical trials found the vaccine safe and effective, there is also "the potential for the vaccine to reduce transmission of the virus".Many vaccines developed against the virus have produced evidence that they are effective at reducing the number of people who experience symptoms or suffer severe illness or die, but much less is known about whether any of the available vaccines can prevent asymptomatic infections that can pass from one person to another.The study of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers found that after people received two doses of the vaccine, they were 54% less likely to have an infection confirmed by a nasal swab, regardless of whether they had symptoms, reported The Washington Post.In addition, the researchers also said that a single dose of the vaccine was 76% effective against symptomatic virus infection, for up to three months - reducing the need for social distancing and allowing a return to a more normal life.Independent scientists who were not involved in the Oxford study called the data intriguing but incomplete. They warned that results were preliminary, that the sample size was too small to make bold claims, and that there could be alternative explanations for the findings, such as that the group receiving a single dose included more women, younger people and health workers, reported The Washington Post.Meanwhile, British officials on Wednesday hailed the report on the homegrown vaccine. They promoted the findings as a vindication for their controversial decision to delay second doses -- from four weeks to 12 weeks -- while trying to get first shots to as many people as possible.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the research results were "absolutely superb."Pfizer-BioNTech scientists have warned that they do not have evidence to support the British dosing strategy for their vaccine, also in wide use in Britain.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the report by the Oxford researchers seemed to support the idea that the efficacy of the vaccine was improved by having a long stretch between first and second doses."Taking all this evidence together, the 12-week gap between first and second dose is clearly the better strategy, as more people can be protected more quickly and the ultimate protective effect is greater," Hunter said.Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results support the British government's decision to give one dose followed by a second booster shot 12 weeks later. Pollard called it "an optimal approach" that "reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine."Natalie Dean, a biostatistics expert at the University of Florida, said "If you think about the way that vaccines work, they can work in two major ways: one is by preventing infection entirely and the other by taking someone who is infected and preventing them from getting symptoms."Oxford is eager to further establish the credibility of its vaccine, after inconsistent dosing in its clinical trials muddied assessments of its effectiveness and a lack of data on the efficacy in people 65 and older have given some public health officials pause, reported The Washington Post.Britain has one of the highest per capita coronavirus death tolls in the world. More than 108,000 people have died after being diagnosed with the virus, with a more contagious variant propelling the latest wave, reported The Washington Post.The vaccine manufacturers have said that their formulas are effective against the variant.The European Union's regulator of medicines has authorized the vaccine for use in all adults, but officials in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and Belgium have cautioned against using it in older populations. Switzerland on Wednesday rejected the vaccine, saying it wanted to see more data. The United States, too, is waiting for more clinical trial data before an authorization decision, reported The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxfordastrazeneca-vaccine-developers-claim-it-reduces-covid-19-transmission-101612427160683.html

McCain (DDG 56) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Feb 4 (local time) in accordance with international law,” Lt Joe Keiley, the 7th Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement.“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” Keiley said.The warship is forward-deployed to the US 7th Fleet area of operations in support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, the US Navy said.Taiwan’s defence ministry confirmed the passage without identifying the vessel.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China was “closely monitoring” the situation. Wang said China would “…continue to be on high alert at all times, respond to all threats and provocations at any moment, and will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.It is hoped that the United States will play a constructive role for regional peace and stability, not the other way around, he added.Beijing views any ships passing through the strait, off its southern coast, as a breach of its sovereignty; the US and many other nations view the route as international waters open to all.The development happened a day after the Pentagon announced that the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was “…departing the Central Command area of responsibility and moving into the US Indo-Pacific region”.“It is now in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility and can be called upon for operations, training, or humanitarian exercises there,” the Pentagon added.Taiwan has been a major point of dispute between the two countries.China claims the democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly expressed anger as Washington stepped-up support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait.On December 31, two US warships including the same guided missile destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, drawing protest from Beijing.It was the second such mission in the last month of 2020 and came almost two weeks after a Chinese aircraft carrier group used the same waterway.China’s defence ministry had criticised the trip as “provocation” and “a show of force”, adding Chinese ships and aircraft trailed the US ships.The latest passage of the US warship comes two days after China’s top diplomat called for Beijing and Washington to put relations back on a predictable and constructive path, saying the US should stop meddling in China’s internal affairs, like Hong Kong and Tibet.“The United States should stop interfering in Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang and other issues regarding China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Reuters news agency quoted Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China, as saying.Yang was the highest-ranking Chinese leader to speak on China-US relations since President Joe Biden took office.Yang added China never meddles with US internal affairs, including its elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warship-sails-by-sensitive-taiwan-strait-as-us-navy-deploys-carrier-to-indopacific-101612426622649.html

Around a quarter of the population inside Syria is displaced, many in camps.The GAVI alliance, the group that co-leads COVAX with the WHO, said last week it aimed to deliver 2.3 billion vaccines worldwide by the end of 2021, including 1.8 billion free doses to lower-income countries."I am really hopeful it will (begin) in April but it might take even longer depending on so many factors," Magtymova told Reuters in a phone interview from Damascus, of the plan to roll out the vaccine programme in Syria."We have to juggle with so many unknowns."Also read| Why Israel can't celebrate its vaccine success yetLike other countries that are awaiting vaccines through COVAX, Syria can also obtain supplies directly from companies. But so far it has yet to announce any such bilateral agreements. Health officials say Damascus has been engaged in talks with Russia and China over vaccine supplies.Apart from the logistics of arranging vaccinations across combat frontlines, Syria faces the additional hurdle of international financial sanctions.Medicines are generally exempt from sanctions, but UN sources said the sanctions have left Damascus without much financial clout to negotiate deliveries, and have slowed the process by creating additional legal risks.Magtymova said any supplies of safe and effective vaccines Syria could obtain would help make vaccines more available. The WHO has no role in such bilateral deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-preparing-to-deliver-vaccines-across-syria-from-april-despite-conflict-101612423357147.html

More than 20 remained in a hospital, complaining of breathing difficulties, eye and skin irritation and other illnesses.Hundreds of residents near the ice plant fled to safety after smelling the pungent fumes Wednesday but started to return when the leak eased hours later, officials said.Tiangco said investigators were trying to determine if ammonia leaked from a pipe or was set off after a half-filled tank exploded. He apologized to the victims, saying the company, which is partly owned by his mother, would shoulder all medical and burial expenses.The plant has been ordered closed and won't reopen until it puts in place additional safeguards. Safety checks in other ice plants and cold storage warehouses in Navotas, one of Asia’s largest fish ports, will be taken to avoid a repeat of the accident, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippine-ice-plant-ammonia-leak-leaves-2-dead-90-sickened-101612424595763.html
04-02-2021||World||Crime, conflict, chaos crushing Afghan hopes for tomorrow||Every morning when Khan Wali Kamran left for work, he was afraid his children might be killed in Kabul’s streets before he got home in the evening. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore, and a month ago he sent his four children to live with his parents in his home village.He’s not the only one afraid. Afghanistan is supposed to be moving toward peace after decades of war, but to the people of the capital Kabul, turmoil only seems to be getting worse.Frequent bombings have everyone on edge. It’s not just dramatic attacks like one that killed dozens at a university last year. There’s also been a string of targeted killings, like the bomb planted on the car of a prominent cleric that detonated Tuesday in the middle of busy morning traffic, killing him and his driver — one of four such bombings that day.The tensions are increased because it's not clear who is behind the attacks. Some are claimed by the Islamic State group or the Taliban. But many go unclaimed, raising suspicions that militias run by prominent warlords both allied with and opposed to the government are creating chaos.Also read| Taliban on diplomatic blitz after Afghan peace talks stallThen there’s the surge in crime. Armed robbers brazenly rob shops or even mug people in broad daylight in public parks crowded with people, stripping them of money and phones at gunpoint. Cars stuck in traffic can be ransacked by thieves.In one case, organized thieves robbed three branches of the same supermarket in different parts of the capital at almost the same time on the same day. Kidnappers are known to snatch children and adult men from the streets, demanding ransoms from their families, anywhere from $50 to $5,000. Residents of Kabul have stopped going out after dark.“We are afraid when we get in our car, go to the office, when we are near our home, in the mosque,” Kamran said. “Life has become hell.”Fear so dominates Kamran’s world that he asked that The Associated Press not identify the village where he sent his four children, including his youngest, a 2-year-old son. Others who spoke to AP asked to be identified only by one name, afraid of drawing the attention of criminals or armed factions.Last year, hope was high that a peace deal reached by the Taliban and US government would lead to an end to more than four decades of relentless war and finally bring peace to Afghanistan. But subsequent talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government have been excruciatingly slow.Also read| US, NATO allies slam Taliban for destroying vital infrastructure in AfghanistanMany Afghans fear that the deteriorating security is a sign that, rather than peace, what is coming is yet another phase in the war, reminiscent of the chaos of the 1990s when warlords’ armed factions battled for power. That fighting came after the Soviets withdrew and before the Taliban took power. Now the Americans, who helped oust the Taliban nearly 20 years ago, are pulling out, their numbers down to 2,500 troops after former President Donald Trump accelerated the withdrawal.Analysts say there are participants on both sides of the conflict who have more to gain from war than peace.“The war is about power, not even about religion,” said Torek Farhadi, a former Afghan government adviser. “Some of the killings are by the Taliban, some by circles in Kabul who stand to lose wealth, power and status should peace come to Afghanistan.”Ferdaws Faramarz, Kabul police spokesman, accused the Taliban of carrying out attacks in order to “create a gap between the people and government.”Afghans say the deep corruption that permeates the government and security agencies has crippled their capacity and made them incapable of keeping Afghans safe.Despite the billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan since the 2001 ouster of the Taliban, more than 72% of the country’s 32 million people live below the poverty level, which is a daily wage of less than $1.90.Also read| US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogueLawlessness has accelerated in the past few years as gangs and militias grow bolder and poverty worsens. Local TV reported recently that in the past 100 days, more than 177 people in Kabul were killed and 360 wounded in suicide attacks, bomb blasts and crimes, a figure police officials confirmed to the AP was accurate.Malik, 22, runs a small barbershop in Kabul’s posh Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood, where diplomats and powerful government officials live. He used to stay open until 10 p.m., but now he shuts down by 7 most nights, ever since he was robbed last year.The thieves were heavily armed and showed no fear. While two waited outside, two others entered his shop, demanded the cash and walked out with 30,000 Afghanis, the equivalent of $380, as well as two mobile phones.“We were in shock,” Malik said, asking to be identified by just one name. He waited for months for police to do something, but no one was arrested and the stolen goods never recovered.“They just told us we should be careful,” Malik said.Amir, another Kabul resident, said that when he goes to the mosque for prayers, he leaves his money and phone at home. “I know there are robbers everywhere when I step outside my door.”Also read| US, Australia discuss China and Myanmar in first leaders call, White House saysBut Amir, a Shiite, is particularly afraid of the Islamic State group, which has targeted the minority community in brutal bombings. Some attacks have been particularly horrific, including one on educational center that killed at least 25, many of them students waiting to take university entrance exams, and another at a maternity hospital last May that killed 24.IS claimed it carried out 82 attacks in Afghanistan in 2020, killing or wounding 821 people, including 21 assassinations. Most of the victims in its attacks were either security personnel or Shiite Muslims.But the perpetrators of many of the targeted killings are unknown. Often carried out by sticky bombs planted on the victim’s car, assassinations have struck young intellectuals and professionals, including journalists, activists, lawyers, judges.The violence is taking its toll on Afghans’ mental health, said psychologist Sharafuddin Azimi, who estimated tens of thousands of Afghans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.His practice has increased each year, and he said many of his clients are in deep depression, without hope for tomorrow and fearful of death at any time.“Many of our loved ones, the youth, women, men and children are terrified,” he said.“All the time they expect there can be an explosion ... or they feel somebody is following them and they might get stabbed or shot by a thief and get killed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crime-conflict-chaos-crushing-afghan-hopes-for-tomorrow-101612419525138.html
04-02-2021||World||Recovered Covid patients may need only one shot of mRNA vaccines: Report||People who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection may need only one shot as opposed to the recommended two jabs if they are taking the Moderna or Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines, according to a study which suggests ways to minimise doses when supplies are limited.The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, posted in the preprint repository medRxiv, assessed the antibody responses in 109 individuals with and without documented pre-existing immunity to the novel coronavirus.According to the researchers, including Florian Krammer from the Icahn School of Medicine in the US, a single dose of mRNA vaccine elicits very rapid immune responses in individuals already possessing antibodies against the coronavirus from previous exposure to it."For individuals with pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 the first vaccine dose likely immunologically resembles the booster dose in naive individuals," the scientists wrote in the study.In the research, the scientists analysed mRNA vaccines which use segments of the viral genetic material to enable human cells to make the coronavirus spike proteins.These proteins train the immune system of vaccine recipients to fight the actual infectious coronavirus when their body encounters the pathogen.Also read| Got vaccinated against Covid? Here’s a list of countries you can travelThe scientists said the post-vaccine antibody levels in recovered Covid-19 patients are comparable to, or exceed levels, found in those without prior exposure to the virus who received two vaccinations.Another yet-to-be peer-reviewed study in medRxiv also studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers who had previously recovered from the infection.It found that their antibody levels started peaking at seven days since immunisation, and achieved higher titers and neutralisation in 14 days compared to volunteers exposed to the vaccine for the first time."Although we did not have peak titers for these individuals after natural infection, the titers developed after single vaccination was higher than peak titers in inpatients and outpatients with Covid-19, similar to what has been described in primary vaccination after two doses of the spike-based mRNA vaccines," the researchers wrote in the study.According to the scientists from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the US, the secondary response occurs through activation of the immune system's memory B cells.Based on the findings, the researchers recommend a strategy of single dose vaccination for patients who have already had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.They said those who have recovered from the disease can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.Also read| Pandemic pulverizes Spain's tourism as arrivals plunge 77%Commenting on the two studies, Eleanor Riley, Professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said the findings are "very reassuring", adding that the vaccines are "very effectively boosting the immunity induced by infection."While the two studies suggest that people who have had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection may only require one dose of the vaccine, Riley, who was unrelated to the studies, said incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex.He believes it may be safer to ensure that everyone gets two doses.The preprint platfrom, medRxiv, also cautions that the posted reports are preliminary in nature and have not been certified by peer review."They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior," it adds.Lawrence Young, Virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology, University of Warwick in the UK, believes this question can be resolved with further studies."...we should be doing further studies which look at giving previously infected individuals one dose of an mRNA vaccine," said Young, who was also unrelated to the two studies."If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of individuals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply," he added in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recovered-covid-patients-may-need-only-one-shot-of-mrna-vaccines-report-101612418945327.html
04-02-2021||World||Why Israel can't celebrate its vaccine success yet||Israel should be celebrating. More than 20% of its population has been fully vaccinated. Another 15% have been given the first of two jabs and will be protected by mid-February. The government plans to have vaccinated 5 million citizens -- well over half the adult population -- by mid-March, just before Israel’s next election will take place on March 23rd.Never has a candidate had better talking points on the key issue of the day. Last week the Maccabi health maintenance organization – one of the four HMOs under which Israeli health care, and the vaccine, is administered -- announced that of 163,000 patients who received the full two-shot protocol, 92% were Covid-free after 10 days (and the remaining 8% showed only mild symptoms). Members of a control group of unvaccinated Israelis were found to be 11 times more highly infected.And yet while Israel has been an undisputed vaccine leader, it is still struggling to contain the virus. This isn’t because the vaccine isn’t working, but because many Israelis still refuse to follow restrictions imposed to limit infections.Israel began its vaccination program by inoculating the oldest members of the population and those with serious underlying conditions. In cities with high levels of vaccination, there is a 50% drop in confirmed cases, a 40% decrease in hospitalisations and there are 15% fewer serious patients. Also read| Gulf nations impose more restrictions to fight virus spread'The vaccine's effect is profound,' says Professor Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute. The virus’ basic reproduction rate is under the magic number of one, meaning infection rates should continue to decline.Even so, January has been a cruel month in which Covid-19 claimed 1,400 victims, about a third of total deaths since the start of the pandemic. Most of these were elderly patients for whom the vaccine did not arrive in time. If Israel is bending the curve, it isn’t doing it as fast as it could be.Why so many new infections? One big factor is Haredim and Arab Israelis who often flout the social-distancing guidelines and become infected at mass communal events like weddings and funerals. Coronavirus wards of Israel’s hospitals have been filling up with unvaccinated younger patients. Experts here believe that Israel cannot achieve full herd immunity until there is a vaccine that can also be given to children.For the past three weeks, Israel has, in theory, been under an internal lockdown, scheduled to end this weekend, though that is a matter of political negotiation between the warring coalition partners. In any case, compliance with current measures is poor.Also read| Why are Covid-19 cases falling? Are vaccines the main driver? Experts answerEven the proponents of the lockdown concede that it isn’t doing much to slow the spread of the virus (the vaccine has presumably had the bigger impact on infection rates). But it has played a part in poisoning the atmosphere. This is primarily the fault of a refusal by large segments of the ultra-Orthodox Haredi community to accept government restrictions unless they are approved by senior rabbis.Recently Netanyahu was reduced to calling Chaim Kanievsky, a 93-year-old Haredi rabbi with influence over a vast network of ultra-Orthodox schools, to ask for his compliance with the nationwide school shutdown. The Prime Minister was informed by Kanievsky’s grandson, that the rabbi would consider it. The classrooms, after a very brief pause, are still open.On Sunday morning, another nonagenarian rabbi was buried in Jerusalem. Despite strict rules against large gathering, upwards of 10,000 Haredi men and boys accompanied the casket through the capital. Police spokesmen said the police were powerless to resist. For ordinary citizens watching on television, it was a chilling spectacle.The resurgence of infections is partly blamed on the new British and South African variants. To protect against new variants found abroad, Israel has completely sealed itself off. The Ben Gurion airport is closed to all but emergency travelers and cargo, and will likely remain shut for several weeks. Land entry from Egypt and Jordan (from which Israeli tourists from Dubai had been returning home) are now blocked.Also read| US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogue“North Korea and Israel are the only two countries whose citizens can’t get in,” has become a common lament by frustrated Israelis stuck abroad. Netanyahu remains focused on the threat from outside, telling the World Economic Forum that “statistically, it’s just a question of time before there is a strain that the current vaccines do not work with.”It is the challenge within Israel that is the bigger problem for now. Being a vaccination leader is great. But a country that can’t enforce its own most basic public health measures will take longer to defeat the virus. It also bodes poorly for the future. It may well eventually have to face challenges that can’t be met with a needle.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Zev Chafets is a journalist and author of 14 books.

04-02-2021||World||China conducts most sophisticated repression abroad: Report||The Chinese government conducts the most sophisticated and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression, targeting religious minorities like the Uighurs, political dissidents and former Communist party members who have fled abroad, a new report said on Thursday.Applying tactics ranging from co-opting foreign governments to detain them to digital threats and coercion by proxy, the Chinese government’s transnational repression is “unparalleled”, the Freedom House report said.“Freedom House’s conservative catalogue of direct, physical attacks since 2014 covers 214 cases originating from China, far more than any other country,” the report titled Out of Sight, Not out of Reach, said.Freedom House is a US government-funded and Washington-based advocacy group for democracy and human rights.“Members of ethnic and religious minorities, former insiders of the Chinese Communist Party, human rights defenders, and increasingly, people from Hong Kong—all have been subjected to serious forms of transnational repression, including assassination attempts and renditions,” the report said.The group pointed out that the Chinese authorities’ 2015 kidnapping of Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen who was later forced to renounce his citizenship while in Chinese custody, was a striking example of Beijing’s “…disregard for nationality, sovereignty, and human rights”.The Chinese foreign ministry is yet to react to the report but it has earlier dismissed the group’s findings, saying the US NGO looks at China through “coloured glasses”.Freedom House was among US NGOs sanctioned by China in December, 2019, over what Beijing said were efforts to interfere in its internal affairs.China, however, continues to be a major focus in Freedom House’s global reports on democratic, human and media rights.“These egregious and high-profile cases are only the tip of the iceberg of a much broader system of surveillance, harassment, and intimidation that leaves many overseas Chinese and exile minorities feeling that the CCP is watching them and constraining their ability to exercise basic rights even when living in a foreign democracy,” the report said.The new report also focused on China’s global “anti-corruption” campaign.The campaign has escalated since 2014, when the CCP announced a global anti-corruption drive under the banner of “Fox Hunt”, and later, 2015, under “Operation Skynet.”“Despite its cultivation of an image of legality and careful references to international law, at its core the CCP’s anti-corruption campaign reflects its domestic context, in which the preferences of the party-state stand above all other considerations.”The other key findings of the report said: “At least 31 origin states on every inhabited continent have carried out such acts against victims in 79 host countries, for a total of 160 unique pairings between origin and host countries. The latter include the United States, the United Kingdom, and other established democracies.”An estimated 3.5 million people have been affected by either direct attacks or secondary tactics of intimidation and coercion that ripple through communities around the world.The report added Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Iran have also carried out transnational repression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducts-most-sophisticated-repression-abroad-report-101612421822472.html

04-02-2021||World||Australian PM Morrison says had 'constructive' meeting with Google chief Pichai||The Australian prime minister said he had a “constructive” meeting on Thursday with the head of Google after the tech giant threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over plans to make digital platforms pay for news.Prime Minister Scott Morrison also welcomed the support of Google rival Microsoft, which has touted Australia’s proposed laws that would make Google and Facebook pay as an example for the rest of the world.Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google, initiated the online meeting with Morrison to discuss the draft laws that were introduced to Parliament in December.“I thought it was a constructive meeting,” Morrison said. “I think I’ve been able to send them the best possible signals that should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process."Google regional director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing last month that the company would likely make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the so-called News Media Bargaining Code forced Google and Facebook to pay for Australian news.Google has not explained how Australians would be excluded or from what services.A Senate committee will report to the government on its review of the draft legislation on Feb. 12.Morrison said he was clear with Pichai that “Australia sets the rules for how these things operate.”“We discussed some of the specifics of elements of the code and they raised those matters, I think, very respectfully,” Morrison said. “But I think we’ve been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia."Google declined to comment on the meeting.While Google and Facebook have condemned the legislation as unworkable, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his business would be willing to pay for news if its search engine increased Australian market share.The law would initially only apply to Google and Facebook, but the government could add other platforms in the future if Google abandoned Australia.Although Bing is Australia’s second most popular search engine, it has only a 3.6% market share. Google says it has 95%.Smith said Microsoft would invest in Bing in Australia to improve its quality so that it would be on par with Google as it was in North America and Britain.“This is an opportunity, whether people use Bing or not, to put a stake in the ground to support the importance of news and publishing and rectify what is ... a real imbalance, say, between search and technology and traditional news,” Smith told Australian Broadcasting Corp.“We applaud the government for taking this kind of step. I think it’s needed, not just in Australia but in other places too,” he added.Technology was having two “adverse effects on the health of democracy” -- spreading disinformation and sapping the economic foundation of news media, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-says-had-constructive-meeting-with-google-chief-pichai-101612420149653.html
04-02-2021||World||Indo-Canadian groups ask Canada PM to condemn farmer protest violence on Jan 26||An umbrella group of several Indo-Canadian organisation has called upon Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “denounce” violence perpetrated by elements among those protesting farm laws in New Delhi on Republic Day just as he did with rioters in Washington DC a few days earlier in January.In a letter to Trudeau, Azad Kaushik, president of the National Alliance of Indo-Canadians said he was writing to the PM to “reflect” the sentiments of the Indo-Canadian community which was “concerned” over previous comments he had made with regard to the farmer protests in India during a virtual event to celebrate Gurpurab.Referring to Trudeau’s description of the attack on Capitol Hill in January as “an assault on democracy by rioters”, he pointed out that “similar violence and assault on Indian democracy happened on its Republic Day, by “extremist elements in the guise of farmers” but Canada “did not denounce it.”Calling upon Trudeau to make such a statement of denunciation, he noted, “This would help avoid perception in the Indo-Canadian community and Canada at large of tacit support to extremist elements in the guise of farmers.”An executive in the PMO acknowledged receipt of the letter and said, “Please be assured that your comments have been carefully reviewed.” The PMO official also said the missive had been forwarded to Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau for “information and consideration.”Trudeau made the contentious remarks regarding the protests unprompted while joining a virtual celebration of Gurpurab, the 551st birth anniversary of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. He had commented: “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the n ews coming out of India about the protests by farmers. The situation is concerning.” He added, “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” Those comments drew a sharp reaction from India and had an adverse impact on bilateral relations.Meanwhile, in an open letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, former premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia Ujjal Dosanjh has urged him to take suo moto cognisance of the events on Republic Day in New Delhi and “order the investigation of the same by a Special Investigation Team monitored by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.”In the letter, Dosanjh said, “It is quite evident from the publicly available information that the disturbance at the Red Fort was caused by rogue elements illegitimately claiming to represent the peaceful and disciplined” protesting farmers and their organisations.He also asked the chief justice to take into account “the probability of the criminal conspiracy including the probable involvement of high officials of the government in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-groups-ask-canada-pm-to-condemn-farmer-protest-violence-on-jan-26-101612420020853.html
04-02-2021||World||Why are Covid-19 cases falling? Are vaccines the main driver? Experts answer||After being ravaged by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for over a year, the world is now witnessing a fall in the number of cases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed this development, calling it encouraging news."For the third week in a row, the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported globally fell last week," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on Monday."There are still many countries with increasing numbers of cases, but at the global level, this is encouraging news," he added.The WHO chief also warned against showing complacency, saying "we have been here before."Leading the drop in cases is United States, the worst affected country. According to Johns Hopkins University, 110,679 new cases of the disease were recorded in the US on Wednesday, down from 215,805 three weeks ago.Europe's new cases have declined from about 250,00 to 180,000 a day, according to reports from various health ministries as quoted by other publications. The UK, which is under lockdown, saw its daily tally plummet to 23,355 from nearly 60,000 on January 9.So what is the reason for this drop in number of cases? Many say that the pro-active approach adopted by various governments in vaccinating their populations has led to this day. But experts say vaccination alone can't be credited for this.Dr Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said inoculation programmes can't alone be responsible for this positive milestone. He said that there is a combination of vaccines, the development of antibodies and weather which is leading the decline.In the US, more people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine than have tested positive for the virus. As of Monday afternoon, 26.5 million Americans had received one or both doses of the current vaccines, according to Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.The US has been administering shots at a faster daily rate than any country in the world, giving about 1.34 million doses a day. Still, only 7.8 per cent of Americans have gotten one or more doses, and 1.8 per cent are fully vaccinated.More than 26.3 million people have tested positive for the disease, and 443,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In the UK, more than 10 million people have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the government. A further 498,962 have had a second dose.The UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Wednesday that the country has passed the peak of its latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set a target of vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February.India too has been witnessing a decline in the number of cases. On Thursday, 12,899 new cases were recorded. There are 155,025 active cases, which accounts for 1.49 per cent of the total caseload.India started the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme on January 16. So far, 44,49,552 health and frontline workers have been vaccinated in the world's largest immunisation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-covid-19-cases-falling-are-vaccines-the-main-driver-experts-answer-101612418485139.html

04-02-2021||World||Canada designates Hizbul Mujahideen a terrorist group||Canada has designated the Pakistan-based, Kashmir-focused Hizbul Mujahideen as a terrorist group.HM was among 13 new groups added to the list, including several neo-Nazi organisations like Proud Boys, which was also alleged to have taken part in the violence at the Capitol in Washington DC last month.Public Safety Canada said HM was formed in 1989 as a militant group as violence escalated in the Kashmir valley and its “primary goal is to unite the Indian and Pakistan administered parts of Kashmir, which would then join with Pakistan.”“HM has launched attacks on Indian security forces, politicians, military targets and critical infrastructure within the newly formed territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. HM’s tactics include using assassinations and armed assault. The group has also abducted and killed police officers and informants.”The list of terrorist groups on the Canadian register has now grown to 73 and includes several that are engaged against India including the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Also listed are Khalistani outfits Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation, as well as Indian Mujahideen.Canada’s Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said, “Violent acts of terrorism have no place in Canadian society or abroad. Today’s additions to the Criminal Code list of terrorist entities are an important step in our effort to combat violent extremism in all forms.” “Canadians expect their Government to keep them safe and to keep pace with evolving threats and global trends, such as the growing threat of ideologically motivated violent extremism. The government of Canada will continue to take appropriate actions to counter terrorist threats to Canada, its citizens and its interests around the world,” he said in a statement.Once an entity is formally listed, banks and financial institutions freeze its assets and it becomes a crime to deal with the assets of such a proscribed group. In its release, Public Safety Canada noted that such listings “also help obstruct assistance from sympathisers and supporters in Canada by criminalising certain support activities, including those related to terrorist travel, training and recruitment.”Neo-fascist, white supremacist groups are recent entries into the list, with the latest additions including Proud Boys, Atomwaffen Division and the Base.

And although gently proposed, it marked a definitive departure from the hands-off “internal matter” approach favoured by the Trump administration to previous flashpoints, the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 altering the constitutional status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which fast-tracked Indian citizenship for Hindus fleeing persecution in neighbouring South Asian countries.“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” a state department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment from US media on Wednesday, an abridged copy of which was provided to Hindustan Times.The spokesperson added, “We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue.”The brief three para comment — four paras in versions to US media — was likely worded carefully to prevent any impression the US was seeking to intervene in an internal disagreement, in the light of the strong pushback from the Modi government and its allies and supporters following comments from pop star Rihanna, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg and US vice-president Kamala Harris’s niece Meena Harris.Harris, to be sure, has kept at it. “If this is what it means to be pro-democracy and pro-human rights, then let’s go,” she wrote in a tweet on Wednesday, responding to a twitter post pitting her and Rihanna against the external affairs ministry spokesperson’s statement denouncing outside comment on an internal matter.The state department seemed supportive, however, of the reforms introduced by the Modi government that the farmers have been protesting for weeks now. “In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment.”Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at Carnegie, tweeted approvingly of the above comment, saying it “suggests support for the farm reforms”. He added, “Pretty balanced overall.”Farmer are protesting new laws that allow the sale of agricultural produce in open market at market-determined rates. They fear they could lose the support thereby of a government procurement programme that guarantees them a basic return on their investment undiminished by market reverses.In the longer version of the comment, the state department spokesperson added a fourth para, which was said to be in response to a specific question: “We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy.”This was a reference in all likelihood to the temporary suspension — 12 hours or so — of dozens of accounts on Monday by Twitter as demanded by the government on grounds that they were being used to incite violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wants-india-to-resolve-farm-protest-through-dialogue-101612417501082.html
04-02-2021||World||UK’s major companies falling short on climate risk disclosure: Report||Most of the largest UK companies are getting away with “woefully inadequate” disclosure of the risks they face from climate change, according to an analysis of annual and audit reports by environmental charity ClientEarth.Just 40% of FTSE 250 companies clearly referred to climate change when discussing key risks and uncertainties in their most recent annual reports as of June 2020 said the group, which is headquartered in London. “There are very general statements being made, but very little in the way of accountability,” said Daniel Wiseman, a lawyer at ClientEarth who co-authored the report. “Currently, the financial regulators aren’t adequately doing their job in ensuring financial markets have the climate-change information they need.”Investors are increasingly demanding more transparency to help them evaluate companies’ strategies for dealing with threats from climate change on business areas such as supply chains and hard assets. In November, the UK became the first major economy to commit to introducing mandatory reporting aligned to guidelines by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. While these rules aren't yet in force for all listed companies, UK law has long required that they identify significant risks to the value of significant assets or their underlying business model.Just 4% of the company financial accounts and audit reports ClientEarth examined clearly referred to climate change. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audited 73 of the 250 companies examined in the report, but clearly referred to climate change in just one of its audit reports, the analysis said.“Ensuring accurate information is provided to investors on climate-related risks is a critical issue and is something we're raising with the organizations we audit,” said Hemione Hudson, head of audit at PwC UK. “We expect to see increased reporting from the organizations we audit and in our audit opinions in the future.”ClientEarth’s report also highlighted discrepancies in reporting standards. Some rules, such as reporting greenhouse-gas emissions, don’t apply to companies which are listed in Britain but registered abroad. The UK’s Financial Reporting Council, which regulates corporate governance, hasn’t sanctioned any auditors for failures to ensure adequate reporting on climate issues by the companies they audit, it said in an emailed statement. The body “is paying particular attention” to auditors’ work on climate change going forward after an internal review found auditors’ assessments to be inadequate, it added.The Financial Conduct Authority, an independent regulatory group that oversees financial services and markets, also says it hasn’t taken any enforcement actions against companies for failing to disclose climate risk. “If we suspect serious misconduct in relation to a listed company’s failure to ensure adequate risk reporting related to climate change, we will investigate, and take enforcement action if appropriate,” a representative said, adding that it will work closely with FRC to enforce the new reporting rules.The ClientEarth report contained several recommendations, including that investors exercise stronger accountability, and that action be taken by FRC and FCA when companies and auditors omit material climate-related information. It also advocated that the UK explicitly require firms to disclose their strategies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would put them in line with the national goal to reach net zero by the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-major-companies-falling-short-on-climate-risk-disclosure-report-101612415812584.html
04-02-2021||World||Moon, Biden agree to boost US-South Korean alliance||South Korea's leader said Thursday he and President Joe Biden have agreed to further bolster their countries' alliance and work together to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.After his first phone talks with Biden since the U.S. president's Jan. 20 inauguration, President Moon Jae-in tweeted that “I just had a great conversation with President @JoeBiden @POTUS” and that he welcomed “America's return” in the midst of global challenges such as COVID-19, climate change and economic polarization.Moon said he and Biden “pledged to further upgrade the ROK-US alliance, an alliance that is anchored in shared values.” ROK refers to Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name.“We will always stand together as we work for peace on the Korean Peninsula and tackle global challenges,” Moon said.Moon, who took office in 2017, was once a driving force behind now-dormant diplomacy between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former President Donald Trump. The Kim-Trump talks collapsed in early 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korea's calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for limited denuclearization steps.Moon, who still wants to resume the nuclear diplomacy, said last month that Biden could learn from Trump's successes and failures in dealing with North Korea though he acknowledged Biden was likely to try a different approach.Biden has called Kim a “thug” and criticised Trump for seeking made-for-TV summits with Kim. Experts say Biden won't likely sit down for one-on-one talks with Kim unless working-level officials sort out details and confirm North Korea's sincerity in denuclearisation. Last month, Kim said at a major political conference that the fate of his country's relations with the US depends on whether Washington abandons what he calls its hostile policy on the North. He disclosed an array of high-tech nuclear weapons systems under development in an apparent effort to apply pressure on the United States. The US, which stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea, regularly stages military drills with South Korea. North Korea views such training as an invasion rehearsal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-biden-agree-to-boost-us-south-korean-alliance-101612415994807.html
04-02-2021||World||Got vaccinated against Covid? Here’s a list of countries you can travel||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has been prevailing for more than a year has affected several business sectors severely. The tourism industry- whose basic requirement is the movement of people from one place to another- has also been badly hit due to lockdown restrictions, cancellation of flights for domestic and international travel, closure of resorts and other tourist attractions etc.However, with the commencement of administering Covid-19 vaccine doses to people globally, countries are allowing or are in the process of allowing inoculated travellers to visit them. As long as people have been administered two doses of their country’s respective vaccine and can produce documentary evidence to prove that they have been inoculated, they are allowed to travel.Here are some of the countries that are allowing travel for all vaccinated passengers:Seychelles:According to an official statement on January 17, the government opened Seychelles for tourism for those people who have been administered vaccine doses and also have a negative report from the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test 72 hours before the journey.Earlier, the government had announced that it was opening the country in a two step-approach. Under the first step- passengers are allowed to enter the country 14 days after taking both doses of the vaccine along with a negative report from a test done 72 hours before the journey. While under the second step which will be in force from mid-March, the government expects to vaccinate a significant section of its population -- when non-vaccinated people would be able to enter the country with just a negative report from a test done 72 hours before the journey.Also Read| Global coronavirus vaccine trust rising, but France, Japan, others scepticalPhuket, Thailand:The country’s resort island of Phuket is formulating a plan to fully reopen to vaccinated visitors by October this year with the view to revive the tourism industry which has been hard hit by the pandemic. The plan which will need permits from the government also seeks to waive a mandatory 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers.“This will allow thousands of vaccinated Europeans who usually spend their winter months in Phuket to visit,” Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, president of the Phuket tourist association told news agency Bloomberg. The island is also working towards providing private Covid-19 vaccinations for 250,000 residents.Georgia:Georgia, which is situated at the intersection of eastern Europe and West Asia, is the first country to remove entry restrictions for all vaccinated passengers, according to a report by the Independent. This means that there is no quarantine , no testing on arrival or pre-departure.The report by Independent also added that since February 1, all international tourists have been allowed to enter the country as long as they have been administered both doses of their respective coronavirus vaccines and can also present requisite proof.Also Watch| Covid update: China competes with India on vaccine; IMA vs govt on doctor deaths﻿Iceland:Iceland issued its first Covid-19 vaccination certificates on January 26 to ease travel for all those people who have been inoculated against the disease. The health ministry said that this step was taken with an aim to facilitate movement of people between countries and individuals who could produce vaccination certificates would be exempt from border restrictions. The ministry however pointed out that the certificates are yet to be recognised internationally.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/got-vaccinated-against-covid-here-s-a-list-of-countries-you-can-travel-101612413796136.html
04-02-2021||World||Marine Le Pen staging comeback against Macron in French election||Far-right leader Marine Le Pen is currently standing out as the only serious rival to Emmanuel Macron in the upcoming presidential election.The National Rally party chief is neck-and-neck with Macron for the first round of the 2022 ballot with up to 26.5%, and would lose by 12 percentage points in the second round, according to an Ipsos poll commissioned by L’Obs and Franceinfo published on Wednesday.Le Pen lost to Macron in the 2017 presidential election by a margin of 32 percentage points, in what was her second failed attempt to make it to the Elysee palace. Now, with the French leader’s handling of the Covid crisis facing criticism and the country’s traditional two-party system in tatters, she’s trying her luck again.The daughter of party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen is tapping into anger over economic inequality and the dominance of Paris over the regions, key drivers of the Yellow Vest protests that spread across the country in 2018. She’s lashed out at Macron for not having closed borders early enough to prevent the arrival of dangerous Covid-19 variants, as well as for the slow start to France’s vaccination campaign.“Why didn’t the government take advantage of the last lockdown, which required a lot of sacrifices from the French people, to test massively and get ahead of the epidemic,” Le Pen said in a recent interview on Franceinfo television. “The government is on top of nothing.”Back in 2017, Le Pen lost to Macron with 34% of the votes in the second round, compared to 66% -- after a disastrous performance during a live television debate in which she made factual errors and focused on attacking Macron rather than explaining her plan for the country.While Le Pen’s electoral base is very different to Macron’s -- her message resonates especially with the unemployed and rural populations while he attracts more highly educated and wealthier pro-Europe voters -- she’s been working to widen her appeal. She reversed from her aim of exiting the euro, condemned anti-antisemitism and moved to ban racism within her party.Shaky FinancesEven so, among big cities in last year’s municipal elections, Le Pen only secured Perpignan in the south. And her National Rally has actually been losing ground, according to an IFOP-Fiducial poll for Sud Radio. A third of the French said they considered the party the main opposition to Macron in the most recent IFOP poll, down from about half in July 2019. Latest available data also show Le Pen party’s finance as shaky.Ipsos surveyed 1,000 people on the electoral role online January 27 and 28. It reviewed seven scenarios based on potential runners in the first round and didn’t give a margin of error. The poll comes after a Harris survey that showed Le Pen leading Macron in the first round by up to 4 points, and Macron leading Le Pen in the second round by the same margin.There are already seven declared candidates, including Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. Neither Macron nor Paris Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, described by government officials privately as another threat to the president, have publicly said they’d run -- though their teams are working on their platforms.Meanwhile Macron, broadly a centrist, is also trying to widen his appeal. He’s concentrated on reaching out to right-wing voters who might choose him over Le Pen, pushing through legislation to protect “Republican values” and fight Islamism and terrorism. He’s also pledged to spend “whatever it costs” to save the economy, and workers, from the pandemic, seizing a key platform of the left.Yet in trying to win support from both sides, Macron’s making himself vulnerable -- the results of the vaccination campaign will be a key barometer of voter sentiment, as well as the outcome of regional elections scheduled for June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marine-le-pen-staging-comeback-against-macron-in-french-election-101612413809926.html
04-02-2021||World||Britain to test combining Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in two-shot regimen||Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are combined in a two-shot schedule.The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of coronavirus vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of 4 and 12 weeks.Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine.It is expected more vaccines will be added to the trial when they are approved and rolled out.Recruitment for the study starts on Thursday, with over 800 participants expected to take part, the researchers said. That makes it much smaller than the clinical trials that have been used to determine efficacy of the vaccines individually.The trial will not assess the overall efficacy of the shot combinations, but researchers will measure antibody and T-cell responses, as well as monitor for any unexpected side effects.Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year."We will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population," he told reporters.The trial is looking to recruit people over the age of 50 who may be at higher risk than younger people and have not been vaccinated already.AstraZeneca's shot is also being tested in combination with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, and British drugmaker's research chief has said more studies on combining vaccines should be done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-test-combining-pfizer-and-astrazeneca-vaccines-in-two-shot-regimen-101612411624501.html
04-02-2021||World||Health workers start anti-coup protests in coronavirus-hit Myanmar||Medical workers across Myanmar began a civil disobedience protest against Monday's coup, wearing red ribbons and declaring they won't work for the new military government.The army takeover that ousted the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi over allegations of fraud in November's elections could not have come at a worse time for a country battling a steady rise in COVID-19 cases with a dangerously inadequate health system.“We want to show the world we are totally against military dictatorship and we want our elected government and leader back,” said Dr. Zun Ei Phyu, who lives in Yangon, the biggest city and commercial capital. “We want to show them we will follow only our elected government. Not the military.”Health workers in government hospitals and facilities issued a statement Wednesday opposing the coup. Photos were shared on social media showing workers with red ribbons pinned to their clothes or holding printed photos of red ribbons. Others used a three-finger salute that has become a symbol of pro-democracy protests in neighboring Thailand, where a former general has led the government since a 2014 coup.Some medical staff went on strike while others who continued work in government-run clinics made public their opposition to the new military rulers.Some of those on strike have begun to volunteer at charity health clinics, many of which were shut down as a precaution against a surge in COVID-19 cases. The clinics that have remained reopen are extending their working hours so people can still receive care during the protest, Zun Ei Phyu said.“We give free treatment and medicine to anyone who is in need," she said, adding the clinics often operate with donations from charities and local communities.Myanmar's early response to the pandemic mirrored that of many countries: borders were nearly completely closed, lengthy quarantines were imposed on travelers, and daily life slowed with stay-at-home orders.It seemed to work until early September, when cases exploded from less than 1,000 to some 14,300 a month later. Now with more than 140,600 confirmed cases and 3,100 deaths, Myanmar's fragile health system faces the perfect storm of the pandemic and the coup.“You could expect the military to take full advantage of COVID-19 as a political opportunity, not as a health care responsibility to the people of Myanmar,” said Ronan Lee, a visiting scholar at Queen Mary University of London’s International State Crime Initiative.History shows those concerns are not without merit.In 2000, decades after the former military junta took control, the World Health Organization ranked Myanmar's health system as one of the worst. According to the World Bank, Myanmar's health expenditure was around 1.87% of GDP in 2010, the year before democratic reforms began.In March 2020, Myanmar reported just 0.71 intensive care unit beds and 0.46 ventilators per 100,000 population, which was insufficient to deal with even a moderate outbreak, according to data from the World Bank and WHO.Donations of medical equipment have since arrived and the government has increased bed capacity with new quarantine centers, clinics and hospitals. But experts cite a lack of medical staff as a continuing problem.Myanmar's small health care force had just 6.7 physicians per 10,000 people in 2018, significantly lower than the global average of 15.6 in 2017.The coup comes just days after Myanmar launched its vaccination campaign with some 1.5 million doses of a two-shot vaccine donated from India. Last week, Suu Kyi observed vaccinations at a hospital in the capital, Naypyitaw, and told reporters that the process must proceed carefully because the government does not have all the supplies it needs.The military has its own medical corps and medical facilities across the country. But Sharon Bell, a researcher who previously studied the health system in Myanmar, said she doesn't anticipate the military will have the ability to control outbreaks or conduct sufficient vaccination programs.The military released a statement saying “prevention of the current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will be efficiently carried out with momentum.”According to Lee, when the military talks about getting the virus under control, it means “locking down the community and preventing opportunities for public expressions of opposition to their rule.”“I expect they’ll use the pandemic as a shield to defend them from scrutiny,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-workers-start-anti-coup-protests-in-coronavirus-hit-myanmar-101612406532715.html
04-02-2021||World||UK Parliament to consider debate on farmers issue as e-petition attracts thousands of signatures||British Parliament's Petitions Committee will consider a Westminster Hall debate in the House of Commons complex on the issue of farmers protests and press freedom in India after an online petition attracted over 106,000 signatures.While the list of signatories for the e-petition also reflects a signature of Boris Johnson, in his capacity as a west London Conservative Party member of Parliament, Downing Street on Wednesday categorically denied that the UK Prime Minister had signed the petition.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and organisations on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi issued a statement on Wednesday to highlight that the Parliament of India had passed "reformist legislation" for the agricultural sector, which "a very small section of farmers" have some reservations about and therefore the laws have been kept on hold while talks are held.Emphasising that the protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, the MEA in its statement said some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken."The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible," the MEA statement said following some high-profile celebrities tweeting over the agitation by farmers.In London, a UK government spokesperson said, "Media freedom is vital for the protection of human rights and journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.""Free press plays a crucial role in our democracies and the government are putting their full weight behind this including through our membership of the Media Freedom Coalition," the spokesperson said.The petition on the official Parliament petitions website, entitled ‘Urge the Indian Government to ensure safety of protesters & press freedom’, calls on the British government to make a public statement on the "#kissanprotests & press freedoms".All e-petitions on the Parliament website that cross the 10,000 signatures mark require the UK government to make an official statement and any petitions that cross 100,000 signatures must be considered for a debate. The House of Commons said the government's response to the petition is expected later this month and the debate is under consideration."Petitions that receive 100,000 signatures will be considered for a debate in Parliament. Debates in Westminster Hall – where petitions debates take place – are currently suspended, but Committee will make an announcement on scheduling this debate as soon as possible," a House of Commons spokesperson said.Some of the signatories of the petition reflect names of cross-party parliamentarians including Indian-origin Opposition Labour Party MPs Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi and Preet Kaur Gill, who have been particularly vocal over the issue on social media and most recently raised concerns over the blockage of "water, electricity and internet" to protesting crowds.Meanwhile, the Indian Journalists’ Association (IJA) in the UK joined other international media organisations to express concern over the arrest of journalists covering the farmers’ protests and urged the Indian government to ensure the safety of journalists in the country."The freedom of press is an important pillar of any democracy and authorities must ensure that journalists are able to do their jobs – reporting accurately and without bias – however challenging the circumstances,” it said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November last year, demanding the government to repeal the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Defending the three contentious agri laws, the MEA said,"these reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-to-consider-debate-on-farmers-issue-101612406593544.html

The state department said the US first wanted to be "in lockstep" with allies and partners before engaging with China."The secretary (Secretary of Defense Lloyd J Austin III) was mindful of the larger geostrategic picture when he approved the movement of the carrier strike group from the Central Command area of responsibility to the Indo PACOM area of responsibility," Pentagon Press Secretary John F Kirby said.Kirby declined to reveal details about USS Nimitz’s next deployment in the US Indo-Pacific region.China watchers in New Delhi said the Biden administration’s decision indicates that the US could increase its presence around the South China Sea to shore up the confidence of the 36 countries in the Asia Pacific region, many of whom have boundary disputes with Beijing.The Biden administration has already reaffirmed its “rock-solid” commitment to Taipei, signalling that it will continue with Trump’s policy of engagement with Taiwan that is under intense pressure from President Xi Jinping’s China to accept that it is part of “One China.”Another aircraft carrier group USS Theodore Roosevelt reached the South China Sea last month to promote "freedom of the seas". The entry of the supercarrier into the South China Sea through the Bashi Strait, sailing between Taiwan and the Philippines, coincided with China flying more than a dozen military aircraft including strategic bombers into the Taiwan Strait.During this incursion into Taiwan’s air defence zone on January 23, according to the Financial TimesChinese military aircraft simulated missile attacks on the US aircraft carrier. The bombers and some of the fighter aircraft involved were conducting an exercise that used the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group as a mock target.Some analysts had interpreted China’s incursion as an attempt by President Xi’s China to ascertain how the new administration will respond to such Chinese behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uss-nimitz-to-be-back-in-indo-pacific-holds-a-message-for-china-on-taiwan-101612405862334.html

I did not participate in this decision," Matze said in a memo sent to Parler staff."Over the past few months, I've met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed."He told Reuters that Parler now has an "executive committee" consisting of Matthew Richardson and Mark Meckler.Mercer, Richardson, Meckler and Parler did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Parler remains largely offline after being dropped by Seattle-based Amazon's cloud-hosting division and the app stores of Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google following the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol.The companies cited Parler's record of policing violent content, after far-right groups spread violent rhetoric on the platform ahead of the unrest in Washington.Parler, which was founded in 2018 and has claimed it has over 12 million users, has styled itself as a "free speech-driven" space.The app has largely attracted U.S. conservatives who disagree with rules around content on social media sites like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc.Matze told Reuters on Jan. 13 that Parler may be offline for good, but later pledged it would return stronger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-101612405071563.html

04-02-2021||World||US nominates Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement for Nobel Peace Prize||Washington [US], February 4 (ANI): A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has nominated Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, to honour the demonstrators' struggle against the Beijing imposed draconian national security law.This move by the lawmakers would surely anger Beijing, which has repeatedly received condemnation from the West for its imposition and undermining the region's sovereignity."We are nominating a movement that has peacefully advocated for and maintained human rights and democracy in Hong Kong since 1997 and continues to fight against the erosion of these rights," Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, Representative James McGovern, a Democrat, and seven other lawmakers, wrote to Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee as quoted by South China Morning Post."A number of democracy advocates are already in jail, some in exile, and many more awaiting trials where they are expected to be convicted and sentenced in the coming months for the sole reason of peacefully expressing their political views through speech, publication, elections, or assembly," the signatories, all members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote in the letter dated Sunday and made public on Wednesday.Dimitar Gueorguiev, an assistant professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University said that with five Democrats and four Republicans backing the nomination, the effort "underscores that US pressure on China is not letting up"."It is important to remember that this development follows on recent Chinese sanctions against US officials, who had criticised China's human rights record, announced during the twilight moments of the Trump administration... Optimists in Beijing might have thought that a new administration would offer an opportunity for some sort of reset. That seems increasingly unlikely," Gueorguiev said.Millions of Hongkongers demonstrated peacefully against the extradition bill in June 2019, but over weeks and months, some subsequent protests became more violent as the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to acknowledge the demands of the opposition."In response to public opposition and protests, the Chinese government issued the National Security Law, which was passed and implemented without any input or participation from Hong Kong residents," the nomination letter said as quoted by South China Morning Post. "This law is being used to actively suppress voices for human rights and democracy," it added.The media outlet further reported that the lawmakers behind the Nobel Peace Prize nomination have since sponsored or co-sponsored other anti-China bills.The draconian security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong that criminalises any act of secession (breaking away from China), subversion (undermining the power or authority of the central government), terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison. It came into effect from July 1, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nominates-hong-kong-s-pro-democracy-movement-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612404180404.html

It could take months to confirm the total and the new record, though.The snowfall report came from a trained weather observer, and officials note there's no reason to doubt its veracity. If confirmed, it would top the record of 34 inches that fell during a blizzard Feb 11-Feb 14 in Cape May County in southern New Jersey in 1899.Mount Arlington, in Morris County, is about 43 miles (69 kilometers) west of New York City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/122yearold-snow-record-may-be-broken-just-short-of-3-feet-101612401422980.html

Reuters reported that Myanmar’s Ministry of Communications and Information posted a letter saying access to Facebook and its services will be unavailable until Feb. 7 in order to maintain “stability” in the country.“We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information,” the Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.The move comes after residents in Yangon on Wednesday night protested for a second straight evening, singing songs, banging on pots and honking car horns in protest of the military coup. Earlier yesterday, authorities filed criminal charges against former leader Aung San Suu Kyi for possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies, an apparent violation of an import-export law. She faces as many as three years in prison if convicted.Suu Kyi has called on supporters to resist Myanmar’s generals, who seized power on Monday after claiming without presenting evidence that her landslide victory in November’s election was tainted with fraud. The military has pledged to hold elections after a yearlong state of emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-orders-facebook-blocked-as-protests-emerge-after-coup-101612401066993.html
04-02-2021||World||House GOP grapples with Greene, Cheney as it defines itself||House Democrats planned a showdown vote for Thursday over stripping Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for her endorsement of racist and conspiratorial views, as the chamber's top Republican signaled he would not bow to bipartisan demands to punish her.The decision by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., came Wednesday as Republicans also grappled over what to do about Rep. Liz Cheney, their No. 3 leader, after she backed Donald Trump's impeachment. The decisions over how to handle the two Republican lawmakers subjected the GOP to a politically agonizing test of its direction as it moves beyond Donald Trump’s presidency.Democrats increased the pressure by planning a House vote on removing Greene from her committees for her embrace of calls to violence against Democrats and bizarre fictions about faked school shootings.But shortly after the Democratic-led House Rules Committee cleared the way for Thursday's vote, McCarthy released a statement saying Democrats were “choosing to raise the temperature" by attempting a “partisan power grab."He condemned Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term Georgia congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet “a higher standard" as a lawmaker.“I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward," McCarthy said.Separately, House Republicans were meeting privately Wednesday about an effort by Trump loyalists to push Cheney out of her leadership post. That move was sparked after Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a fixture of the party establishment, became one of just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump last month.“I won't apologize for the vote,” Cheney told her colleagues, according to a person familiar with the session who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.During a break in that closed-door session, McCarthy told reporters he'd defended Cheney inside.“People can have differences of opinion. That’s what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience," said McCarthy, who'd previously given no clear signal about whether he'd support his lieutenant.At the earlier Rules Committee meeting, Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said lawmakers would send “an awful message” if they took no action on Greene. “If this is not the bottom, I don’t know what the hell is,” McGovern said.McCarthy tried to push blame onto Democrats, criticizing them for taking no action against their own lawmakers whom he didn't name, including one he said “spread anti-Semitic tropes.” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., made comments critical of Israel in 2019 and apologized.The closed-door GOP meeting was likely to discuss the political fates of both Cheney and Greene, and touch on McCarthy's performance. He is having to guide the House GOP through one of its most contentious periods, but his favored approach of avoiding ruffling feathers has been criticized by some Republicans who think he needs to be more decisive.That meeting was also expected to become an emotional debate over whether the GOP should follow Trump's norm-busting divisiveness or embrace the party's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.The internal GOP fight over how to handle Greene and Cheney underscored the hold Trump and his voters still have on much of the party. But it's not uniform.Around two-thirds of House Republicans voted to back Trump's effort to overturn his November election loss — just hours after his supporters' deadly storming of the Capitol that led to his impeachment for inciting insurrection. Yet Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have lambasted Greene, reflecting worries that her wing of the party cannot win statewide Senate races.House Republicans have faced bipartisan pressure to punish Greene, including from McConnell. A House vote was expected to be a political ordeal for many Republicans, forcing them to go on record defending or punishing the unapologetic, social media-savvy Greene.She burst onto the national political scene after just a month in office and with enthusiastic support from Trump. Even during the effort to punish her, she has lashed out at Democrats and raised money on the controversy.Republicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.McCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead.It's unusual for party leaders to strip lawmakers of committee assignments, which can help them address their districts’ needs and raise campaign contributions.In 2019, House GOP leaders removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who had a history of racist comments, from the Agriculture and Judiciary panels after wondering aloud in a New York Times story about when the term “white supremacist” became offensive. He lost the Republican primary for his seat in 2020 and is out of Congress after serving nine terms.In online videos and through supportive “likes” on social media, Greene has voiced support for racist beliefs, calls for violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, and other false theories. She’s also endorsed fictional QAnon claims that Trump was trying to unearth secret child trafficking rings run by Democrats.The handling of Greene and Cheney presented a tricky balancing act for McCarthy. The eight-term lawmaker is hoping to become speaker should Republicans capture the House majority in the 2022 elections, and he has little interest in antagonizing any GOP colleagues.Penalizing Cheney for what she called her “vote of conscience” on impeachment would be awkward without also punishing Greene. Action against either risked angering the GOP’s numerous Trump supporters or its more traditional conservative backers.Cheney foes have said they have enough votes to force her removal from leadership. But it was unclear whether GOP lawmakers would vote on that during Wednesday's meeting or if McCarthy would somehow delay that showdown.The Senate plans to begin its impeachment trial of Trump next week. In a procedural vote last week, all but five GOP senators voted to scuttle the proceedings, indicating that his conviction is unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-gop-grapples-with-greene-cheney-as-it-defines-itself-101612400077284.html
04-02-2021||World||Canada designates Proud Boys as a terrorist entity||The Canadian government designated the Proud Boys group as a terrorist entity on Wednesday, noting they played a pivotal role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.The Proud Boys have faced increased scrutiny after seizing on the former Trump administration’s policies and the group was a major agitator during earlier protests and the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. The Proud Boys is a far-right, male chauvinist extremist group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies. Canada is the first country to designate them as a terrorist entity.During a September presidential debate, Donald Trump had urged the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” when asked to condemn them by a moderator.Senior officials speaking on a technical briefing said authorities had been monitoring and collecting evidence about the Proud Boys before the Capitol Hill insurrection, but confirmed that the event provided information that helped with the decision to list the organization.Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said they revealed themselves.“Their intent and their escalation toward violence became quite clear," Blair said.Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of Proud Boys, called the terrorist designation “ridiculous.”"There is no basis for it. It's infringement of free speech rights. All the Canadian Proud Boys have ever done is go to rallies,” Tarrio said in a phone interview.“They used what happened at the Capitol to push for this."Tarrio said the Canadian chapters are very quiet compared to their American counterparts. He estimated there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Proud Boys in Canada.Tarrio was arrested in Washington shortly before the Capitol riot. He was accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church during an earlier protest in the nation’s capital.U.S. Federal authorities, meanwhile, arrested Wednesday a man who describes himself as the “Sergeant of Arms” of the Seattle chapter of the Proud Boys after he was charged in connection with the riot at the U.S. Capitol. He is at least the eighth defendant linked to the Proud Boys facing federal charges after thousands of pro-Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden’s presidential winAsked whether the U.S. will follow Canada and designate Proud Boys as a terrorist entity, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. has a domestic extremism review underway. “We will wait for that review to conclude before we make any determinations,” Psaki said.The terrorist designation in Canada means the group may have assets seized and face harsher terrorism-related criminal penalties. A government official said just because they are a member doesn't mean they will be charged with a crime, but if they do engage in violent acts they could be charged with terrorist crimes.Sending money to the organization or buying Proud Boys paraphernalia would also be a crime.“The group and its members have openly encouraged, planned, and conducted violent activities against those they perceive to be opposed to their ideology and political beliefs,” the Canadian government said in briefing materials.“The group regularly attends Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests as counter-protesters, often engaging in violence targeting BLM supporters. On January 6, 2021, the Proud Boys played a pivotal role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”The government calls the Proud Boys a neo-fascist organization with semiautonomous chapters located in the United States, Canada, and internationally. It said it engages in political violence and that members espouse misogynistic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and white supremacist ideologies.“Since 2018 we have seen an escalation towards violence for this group,” Blair said.Blair said four right-wing groups including a white supremacist group called The Base that espoused using violence to accelerate overthrowing the U.S. government and Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division were also designated as terrorist entities. They are a part of 13 additions to the list which also include three groups linked to al-Qaida, four associated with the Islamic State group and one Kashmiri organization.The Proud Boys were formed in 2016 by Canadian Gavin McInnes, who co-founded Vice Media. Tarrio said McInnes is no longer a member.Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Trudeau's Liberal government is trying to attach their star to the anti-Trump sentiment prevalent in Canada.“Since the Proud Boys are identified with Trump, they are an easy target. Had Trump won the election, I’m confident the Liberals would not have gone after the Proud Boys,” Wiseman said.“There is right-wing extremism in Canada but much, much less than in the U.S."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-designates-proud-boys-as-a-terrorist-entity-101612399179934.html

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian riot police were justified in using harsh methods to break up protests against the sentence, saying illegal protest activity needed to be stamped out.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the ruling was “far from any rule of law”.France’s President Emmanuel Macron called it “unacceptable”, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ruling was “pure cowardice and fails to meet the most basic standards of justice”.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov rejected Western demands as “arrogant and improper”, asserting that Moscow will not be moved by the West’s “hysterics”. He argued that the Russian police response to the protests was milder than in Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-shrugs-off-fury-over-navalny-s-prison-sentence-101612398863441.html

This most recent survey ran from Jan. 4-24.It found that most people trust vaccines, with two-thirds expressing strong or moderate confidence and only 12% reporting no trust at all. It also found that two-thirds of people believe getting vaccinated is important for their health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-vaccine-trust-rising-but-france-japan-others-sceptical-101612398652603.html

The four organisations are Greenpeace France, Oxfam France, the Nicolas Hulot Foundation and Notre Affaire a Tous (Our Shared Responsibility).In its ruling, the Paris administrative court recognised ecological “deficiencies” linked to the climate crisis and held the French state responsible for failing to fully meet its goals in reducing greenhouse gases.The government said in a statement that it “took note” of the decision, and provided a list of actions in the pipeline to “allow France to respect in the future the objectives it set”.“The government remains fully engaged to take up the climate challenge and leave no one on the side of the road in this indispensable transition,” added the statement, which was signed by Barbara Pompili, the minister for ecological transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-government-held-liable-for-inaction-on-climate-crisis-in-landmark-case-101612398310221.html
04-02-2021||World||Quarantine worker at Melbourne hotel tests positive for Covid-19||After enjoying 28 straight days of no locally-acquired Covid-19 case, Melbourne has again gone back to harsher restrictions following a quarantine worker of Grand Hyatt, one of the hotels used by Australian Open, testing positive for the viral disease.The 26-year-old man, who was serving as a resident support officer as part of the Australian Open quarantine programme, has tested positive for the coronavirus.At a late night press briefing, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the worker had attended a social function in his capacity as a volunteer firefighter.He said authorities were "assuming the worst" and acting as though the man had the highly infectious UK strain of the virus.Genomic sequencing to identify the strain will be completed in the coming days."We have to assume that this person has in fact infected others," Andrews said."We are confident that people will get the information they need as quickly as possible," he added.Victoria's Covid-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar said contact-tracing work was on throughout Wednesday night.The Grand Hyatt is one of the three hotels used by the Australian Open to quarantine more than 1,000 players and support staff ahead of the tournament.Andrews said there would be an impact on some of the Grand Slam's players and staff."There is a number of about 500, 600 people who are players and officials and others who are casual contacts," he said, adding, "They will be isolating until they get a negative test."Tennis Australia has cancelled all matches at the Melbourne Park on Thursday in the Australian Open lead-up events while players are tested.Andrews said tennis was not the most important issue."I must say that is important to us but the issues are much broader and that is about public health and public safety," he said.The announcement affects the ATP Cup, two other men's events and three WTA tournaments with more than 600 players and officials now considered casual contacts."Health authorities have advised us that a hotel quarantine worker has tested positive for COVID-19," a Tennis Australia statement read."Those associated with the Australian Open who quarantined at the hotel now need to be tested and isolated until they receive a negative test result," it said.Almost 1,200 players, coaching staff and officials arrived in Australia since last month for the competition and took the mandatory 14-day isolation.As of Thursday, Victoria has reintroduced mandatory mask rules, reduced the cap on visitors in homes and paused an increase on the number of people allowed in offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quarantine-worker-at-melbourne-hotel-tests-positive-for-covid19-101612398219936.html

"This time around, just lay low and cool it."Major US parties are an annual habit around the Super Bowl, with friends and families gathering to socialize and watch the telecast for unique advertisements as well as who wins the NFL championship."Every time we have something like this, there's always a spike, be it a holiday, Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving," Fauci said on NBC."Super Bowl is a big deal in the United States. Enjoy the game. Watch it on television. But do it with the immediate members of your family, the people in your household."A crowd of about 25,000 at the Super Bowl will include 7,500 vaccinated health care workers, but Fauci doesn't see the NFL championship showdown at Raymond James Stadium as a super-spreader event."I believe that they are trying to keep people separated enough in the stands, wearing masks, so they don't have that proximity," Fauci said on ABC's Good Morning America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-warns-americans-to-skip-super-bowl-parties-this-year-101612397928434.html
04-02-2021||World||Democrats set up showdown on Greene as GOP signals no action||House Democrats moved to oust controversial Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from two committees as GOP leader Kevin McCarthy condemned her past statements but indicated he’ll take no action to punish her.The Rules Committee of the Democratic-controlled House on Wednesday sent a resolution revoking Greene’s committee assignments to a floor vote on Thursday. No Republican sought a roll call to put their opposition on record and it was approved by the panel on a voice vote.The move was initiated by Democrats to pressure Republicans to take action against Greene, but McCarthy said they instead were creating a distraction that risked raising political tension.McCarthy said he offered to reassign Greene, who represents a district in northwest Georgia, to the Small Business Committee rather than the Education and Labor Committee, but that Democrats rejected it.In an earlier statement, McCarthy said that Greene’s past remarks “on school shootings, political violence, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference.”He said he had told Greene that members of Congress have to hold themselves to a higher standard of conduct and that her past comments carry greater meaning.“Marjorie recognized this in our conversation,” McCarthy said. “I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward.”Greene’s fate and another festering controversy involving Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 GOP leader in the House, reflects the struggle within the Republican Party over its future direction and how much influence former President Donald Trump will continue to have.Greene, 46, has closely aligned herself with Trump and touted his support as she’s come under scrutiny. At the same time, some Trump loyalists are seeking to remove Cheney from her leadership post because she was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.Both were discussed by House Republicans Wednesday during their previously scheduled conference meeting.McCarthy said he defended Cheney during the meeting, but gave no details. “People can have differences of opinion that the we can have a discussions about,” he added. “Liz has the right to vote her conscience.”Several Republicans said they were unsure of whether there would be a vote on keeping Cheney in leadership.“My sense was that she wasn’t shying away from a vote,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas.Brady and Representative Jim Banks of Indiana said they hoped the House GOP would emerge more unified.Banks called some of the things Greene has said or tweeted “despicable.”“At the same time,” he added, “we had several Democrat members of Congress who’ve said despicable anti-Semitic things since they’ve been members of Congress, without making any attempt at apologize or scrub their comments from the public record.”Greene has come under harsh criticism from some fellow Republicans, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who said “loony lies and conspiracy theories” are a “cancer” for the party and the country.Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said Tuesday that Greene “doesn’t represent the party.”“I don’t want her as the face of our party. I think it’s a great time for us to really talk about what we want to see in the upcoming years and continue to build,” Ernst told reporters. “We don’t need people that are promoting violence or anything like that.”Greene has promoted QAnon conspiracies. She’s also questioned whether a plane actually hit the Pentagon in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and whether some mass shootings in the U.S. were staged or carried out for political purposes.Greene has been using the criticism she’s facing to raise money.“I need all the support I can get so I can defend myself in the public sphere. And I won’t get any help from the Establishment wing of the Republican party,” one fundraising email said.Some Republicans have threatened to retaliate against Democrats. Republican Brian Babin of Texas has been pushing a revised version of the Democratic resolution to remove Greene from her committee seats, replacing her name with that of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar and calling for her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee for past comments that have used anti-Semitic tropes.“If the Democratic majority wants to go down this road, they should start by dealing with their own members who have been at this before and AFTER their election to Congress. And there is no worse offender than Ilhan Omar,” Babin said in a statement.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had addressed Omar’s remarks with her at the time and she has not said anything similar since.“There’s no such analogy to be made, there’s no comparison to be made, there’s no parallel situation,” he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-set-up-showdown-on-greene-as-gop-signals-no-action-101612397299229.html
04-02-2021||World||Joe Biden flexible on who gets aid, tells lawmakers to 'go big'||President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers Wednesday to “act fast” on his $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan but also signaled he's open to changes, including limiting the proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which could draw Republican support.Biden told lawmakers in private comments he's "not married" to an absolute number for the overall package but wants them to “go big" on pandemic relief and “restore the soul of the country.”“Look, we got a lot of people hurting in our country today,” Biden said on a private call with House Democrats. “We need to act. We need to act fast.”On the direct payments, Biden said he doesn’t want to budge from the $1,400 promised to Americans. But he said he is willing to “target” the aid, which would mean lowering the income threshold to qualify.“I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to the American people," he said.Biden spoke with House Democrats and followed with a meeting of top Senate Democrats at the White House, deepening his public engagement with lawmakers on his American Rescue Plan. Together the virus and economic aid is his first legislative priority and a test of the administration’s ability to work with Congress to deliver.Biden’s remarks to the Democratic House caucus were relayed by two people who requested anonymity to discuss the private conference call.While Biden is trying to build bipartisan support from Republicans, he is also prepared to rely on the Democratic majority in Congress to push the package into law. Democrats moved ahead with preliminary steps, including a House budget vote Wednesday largely along party lines, to approve it on their own, over Republicans objections. A group of 10 Republican senators offered a $618 billion alternative with slimmer $1,000 direct payments and zero aid for states and cities, but Biden panned it as insufficient, though private talks with the Republicans continue.At the start of his meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and 10 top Senate Democratic committee chairmen in the Oval Office, Biden sounded confident he could still win over GOP support.“I think we’ll get some Republicans,” Biden said.With a rising virus death toll and strained economy, the goal is to have COVID-19 relief approved by March, when extra unemployment assistance and other pandemic aid measures expire. Money for vaccine distributions, direct payments to households, school reopenings and business aid are at stake.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president fully recognizes the final package may look different than the one he initially proposed.She said further targeting the $1,400 payments “means not the size of the check, it means the income level of the people who receive the check." That’s under discussion, she said.As lawmakers in Congress begin drafting the details, Biden is taking care to politically back up his allies while also ensuring that the final product fulfills his promise for bold relief to a battered nation.House Democrats were told on the call with the president that they could be flexible on some numbers and programs, but should not back down on the size or scope of the aid.“We have to go big, not small,” Biden told the Democrats. “I’ve got your back, and you’ve got mine."As the White House reaches for a bipartisan bill, House and Senate Democrats have launched a lengthy budget process for approving Biden’s bill with or without Republican support.“We want to do it bipartisan, but we must be strong,” Schumer said after the 90-minute session at the White House. Democrats are “working with our Republican friends, when we can.”The swift action follows Tuesday's outreach as Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined the Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting, both declaring the Republicans' $618 billion offer was too small.Both Biden and Yellen recalled the lessons of the government response to the 2009 financial crisis, which some have since said was inadequate as conditions worsened.Earlier in the week, Biden met with 10 Republican senators who were pitching their $618 billion alternative, and told them he won't delay aid in hopes of winning GOP support even as talks continue.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Democrats for pressing ahead largely on their own as the GOP senators try to provide bipartisan alternatives.“They’ve chosen a totally partisan path,” McConnell said. “That’s unfortunate.”The two sides are far apart. The cornerstone of the GOP plan is $160 billion for the health care response — vaccine distribution, a “massive expansion” of testing, protective gear and money for rural hospitals, similar to what Biden has proposed for aid specific to the pandemic.But from there, the two plans drastically diverge. Biden proposes $170 billion for schools, compared with $20 billion in the Republican plan. Republicans also would give nothing to states, money that Democrats argue is just as important, with $350 billion in Biden’s plan to keep police, fire and other workers on the job.The GOP's $1,000 direct payments would go to fewer people — those earning up to $40,000 a year, or $80,000 for couples. Biden's bigger $1,400 payments would extend to higher income levels, up to $300,000 for some families.The Republicans offer $40 billion for Paycheck Protection Program business aid. But gone are Democratic priorities such as a gradual lifting of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.The Delaware senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons, both Democrats from Biden's state, were at the White House earlier Wednesday and discussed with the president the need for state and local aid and the possibility of narrowing who qualifies for another round of direct payments.Coons said he's in conversations with Republicans “about on what terms are they willing to increase the amount significantly for some state and local aid.” Without that, he said, it's a “nonstarter.”Winning the support of 10 Republicans would be significant, potentially giving Biden the votes needed in the 50-50 Senate to reach the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaker.But Democrats pushed ahead with votes on a budget resolution that provides groundwork for eventual approval under the reconciliation process. That would allow the bill to pass with a 51-vote Senate majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-flexible-on-who-gets-aid-tells-lawmakers-to-go-big-101612396960761.html
04-02-2021||World||UK is past peak of Covid-19 surge, with 10 million people vaccinated||The UK has passed the peak of its latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said, as the country reached the milestone of vaccinating 10 million people, about 15% of the population.“We are on a downward slope of cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said at a televised press conference on Wednesday. “This peak, at least, we are past.”But Whitty, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said infections are still widespread and the state-run National Health Service would be “back in trouble extraordinarily fast” if social restrictions are lifted.Britain’s immunization program -- the most successful so far in Europe -- puts the country on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk from the disease by Feb. 15. Johnson said it will only be possible to begin easing the lockdown three weeks after that date, once those vaccinated have received the benefits of the immunization.Johnson, who will publish a plan for relaxing the curbs on Feb. 22, said there are “signs of hope” but warned the number of people with the disease is still “alarmingly high.” A further 1,322 deaths were reported on Wednesday.InfectionsJohnson is under mounting pressure to ease restrictions from lockdown skeptics in his own party who fear shutting up businesses and schools will inflict lasting scars on the economy and society. News that vaccines are effective at cutting transmission of the disease has fueled their argument.“With better and better news by the day on the vaccination roll out and its effectiveness, the government has got to start addressing its mind to the harms caused by the measures we’re putting in place,” said Mark Harper, chairman of the so-called Covid Recovery Group of Conservative members of Parliament. “Lockdowns and restrictions cause immense damage to people’s health and livelihoods and we need to lift them as soon as it is safe to do so.”Johnson has promised to review the pandemic response after the priority groups have been given vaccines. Schools will be the first facilities to reopen in England, starting no earlier than March 8 under the government’s plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-is-past-peak-of-covid-19-surge-with-10-million-people-vaccinated-101612379086247.html
04-02-2021||World||WHO probe team visits high-security virus lab in Wuhan||A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) visited China’s most advanced virus research lab in Wuhan on Wednesday as part of their ongoing probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, reports from the central Chinese city said.Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) research on some of the deadliest pathogens found in the world including the bat-hosted coronavirus.One theory – so far unproven and consistently rejected by China – says that the initial outbreak in Wuhan may have been triggered by an accidental virus leak from the bio-safety lab.Questions also remain about a possible spillover – or a zoonotic event – where the virus could have jumped from an animal host to humans.“I am looking forward to a very productive day, meeting the key people here and asking all the important questions that need to be asked,” team member Peter Daszak, who is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance, said from his car as it drove into the institute, a Reuters report from Wuhan said.Also read: China’s Covid comeback is bad news for climate as emissions risePeter Ben Embarek, a scientist leading the WHO team, told the tabloid Global Times that the international experts will meet Shi Zhengli, a leading Chinese virologist.Shi has been dubbed as China’s “bat woman” because of her intensive research on bats and the viruses they host.In a social media post on Tuesday, Daszak said the WHO experts met “with key staff in charge of livestock surveillance in Hubei Province”, and toured lab facilities and held in-depth discussions on Tuesday when the team visited an animal health facility.On Sunday, the WHO team went to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which was linked to the first cases of Covid-19 in late 2019, described by Daszak in a tweet as a “critical” stop.Meanwhile, China on Wednesday reported the fewest number of new Covid-19 cases for a single day in more than a month, the national health commission (NHC) said.A total of 25 cases were reported in the mainland on February 2, the NHC said, of which 15 were locally transmitted infections.The total number of Covid-19 cases reported in mainland China now stands at 89,619, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,636.Single dose of Oxford jab good for 12 weeks: StudyBritain’s health chief said on Wednesday that a new study suggesting that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine provides a high level of protection for 12 weeks supports the government’s strategy of delaying the second shot so more people can quickly be protected by the first dose.Britain’s decision was criticised as risky by other European countries, but health secretary Matt Hancock said the study “backs the strategy we’ve taken and it shows the world that the Oxford vaccine works”.UK says 10mn people have been vaccinatedTen million people in the UK have been given the coronavirus vaccine, as the government’s programme to immunise the most vulnerable groups makes rapid progress. The UK is on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk by February 15.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-probe-team-visits-high-security-virus-lab-in-wuhan-101612328149549.html
