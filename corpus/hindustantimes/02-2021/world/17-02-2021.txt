This was a clear signal to anti-Trump elements to fall in line or face his base’s ire, a career-threatening prospect for many Republicans.“Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again,” Trump said in a statement, adding, “Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First.”Trump’s outburst came after days of escalating attacks from McConnell who started by slamming Trump in a speech from the floor of the Senate after voting to acquit him in his second impeachment trial last week. McConnell said Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for the January 6 insurrection, and that the former president could still face legal jeopardy. “He didn’t get away with anything yet,” said McConnell.McConnell, who is the minority leader in the senate, carried on in this vein in a widely seen, cited and discussed Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, indicating he was not backing down.The Republican Party is struggling to deal with Trump, a former president who will not go away as they normally do. Ten of them voted to impeach him in the House and 7 held him guilty in the senate trial. Nikki Haley, who is expected to run in 2024, is among leading Republicans who have broken with Trump, saying he “let us down”.Many others have either recanted their initial criticism of the former president — Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, and Senator Lindsey Graham, for instance — or held their tongue, fearing his continued popularity with the party’s base. Nearly 6 out of 10 registered Republicans said Trump should play a dominant role in the party, in a Morning Consult/Politico poll released on Tuesday. And only a slightly lower number of the — 54% — said they will back him in the 2024 primary, a whopping 42 points ahead of former vice-president Mike Pence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-mcconnell-as-gop-divide-deepens-postimpeachment-101613585162501.html

17-02-2021||World||UN nuclear chief to visit Tehran; Germany's Angela Merkel presses Rouhani||The head of the UN nuclear watchdog will travel to Iran this weekend in an effort to find a “mutually agreeable solution” that allows it to continue its inspections in the country, the organization said Wednesday.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed Iran's president for “positive signals” that would help resolve a diplomatic standoff over the future of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, her office said.The International Atomic Energy Agency said that Director General Rafael Grossi will visit Tehran on Saturday for discussions with senior Iranian officials, whom it did not identify.It said the aim is “to find a mutually agreeable solution for the IAEA to continue essential verification activities in the country."Grossi's trip comes amid diplomatic efforts to keep alive the nuclear agreement, which has been unraveling since the U.S. under then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from in 2018.Tehran has been using its violations of the deal to put pressure on the remaining signatories — France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions re-imposed after the U.S. pullout.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it does not want to do.President Joe Biden has said he will seek to revive the deal, but insisted that Iran must first reverse its nuclear steps, creating a contest of wills. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier this month that the U.S. must lift all sanctions if it wants Iran to live up to commitments.In a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “high interest” of Germany and the other remaining signatories in preserving the deal, her office said in a statement.She voiced concern that Iran isn't fulfilling its commitments and told Rouhani that “it is now time for positive signals that create trust and raise the chances of a diplomatic solution,” the statement added.Iran has said it will stop part of the inspection of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA next week if the West doesn't implement its own commitments.On Monday, Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, said he had sent a letter to the agency detailing restrictions on inspectors to take effect on Feb. 23.He said Iran would cease to adhere to the so-called Additional Protocol, an arrangement that provides the IAEA broad access and information regarding Iran’s nuclear program, including both declared and undeclared facilities.Following the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist last fall, Iran’s parliament passed a law that vowed to restrict access of U.N. watchdog inspectors if the sanctions imposed on its oil and banking sectors are not lifted.Grossi last week offered to travel to Iran in view of the proposed changes, which the agency said “would have a serious impact on the IAEA’s verification and monitoring activities in the country.”On Thursday, the French, German and British foreign ministers plan to discuss Iran at a meeting in Paris and hold a videoconference with new U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-nuclear-chief-to-visit-tehran-germany-s-angela-merkel-presses-rouhani-101613581618209.html

Several days later, an Emirati man called authorities to say a stray camel had wandered onto his farm some 3 kilometers (almost 2 miles) away.When interrogated, the man’s story fell apart, according to police in Dubai. He soon admitted to trespassing on his neighbor’s farm to steal a rare breed of camel for his girlfriend, the report said, settling for the newborn after failing to wrangle an adult. The man reported the stray beast when he grew worried about being caught, the paper said.The police returned the camel to its owners and arrested the suspect and his girlfriend on charges of theft and making a false statement, the National said.The days are long gone when camels were an essential part of life in Dubai, now a futuristic skyscraper-studded city on the Persian Gulf. But some continue to raise camels for food and milk. Camel racing remains a cherished pastime in the federation of seven desert sheikhdoms and the occasional camel beauty pageant even draws traders willing to pay millions of dollars for the most prized breeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emirati-man-arrested-for-stealing-camel-to-gift-girlfriend-on-birthday-101613581141108.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden's $15 wage proposal: Job killer or a boon for workers?||President Joe Biden's effort to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour could provide a welcome opportunity for someone like Cristian Cardona, a 21-year-old fast food worker. Cardona would love to earn enough to afford to move out of his parents' house in Orlando, Florida, and maybe scrape together money for college.More than 1,000 miles away in Detroit, Nya Marshall worries that a $15 minimum wage would drive up her labor costs and perhaps force her to close her 2-year-old restaurant, already under strain from the viral pandemic.Between Cardona's hope and Marshall's fear lies a roiling public debate, one with enormous consequences for American workers and businesses. Will the Biden administration succeed in enacting a much higher federal minimum wage — and should it? Economists have argued the merits of minimum wage hikes for years.“The mother of all economic debates" is how economists Michael Feroli and Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase describe it.The administration has cast its campaign to raise the minimum as a way to lift up millions of the working poor, reduce America's vast financial inequality and help boost the economy.“No American should work full time and live in poverty,” said Rosemary Boeglin, a White House spokeswoman. “Research has shown that raising the minimum wage reduces poverty and has positive economic benefits for workers, their families, their communities, and local businesses where they spend those additional dollars."Yet just this month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that while raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would increase pay for 17 million people and pull 900,000 out of poverty, it would also end 1.4 million jobs. The reasoning is that employers would cut jobs to make up for their higher labor costs.The fate of Biden’s minimum wage proposal remains hazy. Facing resistance in Congress, the president has acknowledged that he will likely have to omit the measure from the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 financial relief package he is proposing and re-introduce it later as a separate bill.For years, there was almost no debate at all about a minimum wage. Classical economists had standard advice on imposing or raising minimum wages: Don’t. Piling higher labor costs on employers, the thinking went, would force them to cut jobs and end up hurting the very low-wage workers the minimum wage was intended to help.But groundbreaking research in the 1990s suggested that the Econ 101 version was simplistic at best. Now there is growing confidence among economists — though far from a consensus — that lawmakers can mandate sharp increases in the minimum wage without killing large numbers of jobs.Assessing Biden’s $15 plan, for instance, economists at Morgan Stanley have concluded that “the impact to employment, positive or negative, would be minimal, while the social benefits to lifting real wages of lower-income earners and millions out of poverty are substantial.’’Raising the minimum wage, they said, would also help narrow the chronic economic gap between white Americans on the one hand and Black and Hispanic Americans on the other.The federal government introduced a minimum wage to a Depression-scarred country in 1938. Though Congress has raised the minimum over time, it hasn't done so for more than 11 years — the longest gap between increases. Twenty-nine states and Washington, DC, have already adopted minimum wages above the federal $7.25.The United States lags behind other developed countries in the size of its minimum wage. In 2018, the US minimum amounted to 33% of the nation’s median earnings — dead-last among 31 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, Canada's minimum wage came to 51% of median income, France's 62%Biden’s plan would shake things up entirely. He proposes gradually raising the wage to $15 an hour by 2025, starting with a jump to $9.50 this year. Thereafter, it would be indexed to grow at the same rate as the US median wage — the point at which half earn more and half earn less.Advocates say that raising wages at the bottom of the pay scale would help relieve income inequality, including racial disparities in earnings. The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates that 31% of African Americans and 26% of Latinos would receive a raise if the federal minimum wage were elevated to $15 an hour.Two economists at the University of California Berkeley, Ellora Derenoncourt and Claire Montialoux, reported last year that the expansion of the minimum wage in the 1960s and 1970s “played a critical role’’ in temporarily narrowing the income gap between white and Black workers. They concluded that “minimum wage policy can play a critical role in reducing racial economic disparities.’’Expert thinking on the minimum wage began to change with the publication in 1993 of a paper by economists David Card and Alan Krueger, then both at Princeton University. Before then, economists had worried that their theoretical models did not account for the complexity of the job market.So when New Jersey raised its minimum wage in 1992 — and neighboring Pennsylvania did not — Card and Krueger saw a real-world experiment in the making. Would New Jersey lose low wage jobs, as classical economics had taught?The two economists surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in both states. Their surprising discovery: The restaurants in New Jersey, despite the burden of a higher minimum wage, actually added more jobs than those in Pennsylvania did.“What they found was very shocking: Wages rose quite a bit, but there was no evidence of reduced employment,” said Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a leading minimum wage researcher. “This sent shockwaves through the discipline.’’Dube, who himself worked a minimum wage job at McDonald’s as a teenager in Seattle, cites two reasons why he thinks higher minimum wages don’t generally kill jobs. First, many companies can raise prices to pass along their higher labor costs.“A burger may cost 50 cents more,” Dube said. “What that means is that middle- and higher-income consumers are, in fact, subsidizing low-wage workers. That’s a feature, not a bug.’’Second, he said, the higher a wage, the less likely it is that employees will quit. So a higher federal minimum could reduce high turnover at, say, fast-food outlets and make them more productive. Employers wouldn’t have to constantly scramble to find and train new employees — a task that consumes time, money and resources.Speaking with analysts last month, in fact, McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the fast-food giant would “do just fine’’ as long as the wage increase applied to everybody.Yet by more than doubling the federal minimum wage over a few years, Biden’s plan would enter uncharted territory. Feroli and Silver of JPMorgan note that most minimum wage increases amount to 5% to 15%. A doubling of the minimum, as Biden proposes, could potentially exert a more harmful effect on jobs than research has suggested.Dube concedes that Biden runs the risk of raising the minimum wage too high, too fast. Yet he argues that the gradual phase-in would allow policymakers to monitor how the job market is reacting — and to delay further scheduled wage increases if employers responded to their higher costs by cutting jobs.At a town hall Tuesday night in Milwaukee, Biden seemed to signal a willingness to settle for a more modest increase in the federal minimum wage.“I do support a $15 minimum wage,” the president said, while adding, “but that’s a debatable issue.”He suggested that an increase to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than to $15, would mean “the impact on business would be absolutely diminished.'' And he agreed that “it’s not illegitimate” for small businesses to fear a sharply higher wage.Indeed, critics argue that now isn't the time for a hefty wage increase. Many of the businesses most likely to pay the minimum — restaurants, hotels, movie theaters — have been hardest hit by the pandemic and the lockdowns and other steps meant to contain it.Consider Marshall's Detroit restaurant, Ivy Kitchen + Cocktails, already devastated by the coronavirus. Revenue is down 85%. She fears that higher labor costs could deliver the final blow.“We’re not making money; 2020 was a complete loss,” Marshall said. “To impose such a wage increase on us right now would not be a good idea, and a lot of us would just shut down .. Our doors are barely open.’’Then again, the pandemic has also exposed how difficult life is at the bottom of the income ladder. In Orlando, Cardona makes $11 an hour as a manager at a McDonald’s. Unable to afford a place of his own, he lives with his parents, chipping in for groceries and help on the electric bill. His plans to save for college are on hold — indefinitely.A bump up to $15 an hour “would definitely be a very nice boost; $11 is still not a living wage,’’ Cardona said. “A lot of people who make this wage, they live paycheck to paycheck.’’Many of his co-workers, he notes, aren’t teenagers making a few bucks after school. They’re single mothers or elderly adults, struggling to pay rent, afford utility bills, buy groceries.As for Biden’s minimum wage proposal, it is up against the Senate’s “budget reconciliation” rules, which will likely govern the president's rescue aid package. The reconciliation rules allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote, not a filibuster-proof majority of 60 senators. But they are supposed to be limited to budgetary matters and likely don’t apply to a minimum wage increase.Should the federal government remain at an impasse, states and localities, which can go beyond the federal minimum, won't necessarily wait around. Twenty-one states increased their minimum wages last year, Morgan Stanley notes.Cities are getting into the act, too. In a study out this month, Dube and Attila Lindner of University College London found that 42 cities have set minimum wages above the federal mandate. And 22 of them, including Seattle, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, are already at $15 or more — up from just three in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-15-wage-proposal-job-killer-or-a-boon-for-workers-101613580599994.html
17-02-2021||World||Taliban tweet threatens Malala Yousafzai; Twitter removes account||A Pakistani Taliban militant who nine years ago is alleged to have shot and badly wounded Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai has threatened a second attempt on her life, tweeting that next time, “there would be no mistake.” Twitter on Wednesday permanently suspend the account with the menacing post.The threat prompted Yousafzai to tweet herself, asking both the Pakistan military and Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain how her alleged shooter, Ehsanullah Ehsan, had escaped from government custody.Ehsan was arrested in 2017, but escaped in January 2020 from a so-called safe house where he was being held by Pakistan’s intelligence agency. The circumstances of both his arrest and escape have been shrouded in mystery and controversy.Since his escape, Ehsan has been interviewed and has communicated with Pakistani journalists via the same Twitter account that carried the Urdu-language threat. He has had more than one Twitter account, all of which have been suspended.The government is investigating the threat and had immediately asked Twitter to shut down the account, said Raoof Hasan, an adviser to the prime minister.Ehsan, a longtime member of the Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan as they are known, urged Yousafzai to “come back home because we have a score to settle with you and your father." The tweet added that “this time there will be no mistake."Yousafzai, who has setup a fund that promotes education for girls worldwide and even financed a girls' school in her home in the Swat Valley, called out the government and the military over Ehsan's tweet.“This is the ex-spokesperson of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan who claims the attack on me and many innocent people. He is now threatening people on social media," she tweeted. “How did he escape?”Associated Press queries to the military were unanswered.The charges against Ehsan include a horrific 2014 attack on a Pakistani army's public school that killed 134 — mostly children, some as young as five years old.He also claimed responsibility for the 2012 shooting of Yousafzai in Swat Valley. In the attack, the gunman walked up to Yousafzai on a school bus in which she was travelling, asked for her by name and then fired three bullets. She was just 15 years old at the time and had enraged the Taliban with her campaign for girls education.Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, a teacher, ran a school in Swat Valley for boys and girls. In 2007 when the Pakistani Taliban took control of the area, they forced girls out of schools and ruled with a brutal hand until 2009, when they were driven out by the Pakistani military.During his years in military custody, Ehsan was never charged. Authorities also later never explained how he left the country and traveled to Turkey, where he is believed to be living today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-tweet-threatens-malala-yousafzai-twitter-removes-account-101613579055496.html

17-02-2021||World||Texas blackouts fuel false claims about renewable energy||With millions of Texas residents still without power amid frigid temperatures, conservative commentators presented a false narrative that wind turbines and solar energy were primarily to blame.“We should never build another wind turbine in Texas,” read a Tuesday Facebook post from Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. “The experiment failed big time.”“This is a perfect example of the need for reliable energy sources like natural gas & coal,” tweeted US Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, on Tuesday.In reality, failures in natural gas, coal and nuclear energy systems were responsible for nearly twice as many outages as frozen wind turbines and solar panels, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s power grid, said in a press conference Tuesday.Still a variety of misleading claims spread on social media around renewable energy, with wind turbines and the Green New Deal getting much of the attention.A viral photo of a helicopter de-icing a wind turbine was shared with claims it showed a “chemical” solution being applied to one of the massive wind generators in Texas. The only problem? The photo was taken in Sweden years ago, not in the US in 2021. The helicopter sprayed hot water onto the wind turbine, not chemicals.Other social media users, including Republican US Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, puzzlingly labeled the Green New Deal as the culprit. Boebert tweeted on Monday that the proposal was “proven unsustainable as renewables are clearly unreliable.”But the Green New Deal is irrelevant, as no version of it exists in Texas or nationwide, said Mark Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere/Energy Program and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.“It’s really natural gas and coal and nuclear that are providing the bulk of the electricity and that’s the bulk of the cause of the blackouts,” Jacobson told The Associated Press.ERCOT said Tuesday that of the 45,000 total megawatts of power that were offline statewide, about 30,000 consisted of thermal sources — gas, coal and nuclear plants — and 16,000 came from renewable sources.On top of that, while Texas has ramped up wind energy in recent years, the state still relies on wind power for only about 25% of its total electricity, according to ERCOT data.“It’s not like we were relying on it to ride us through this event,” Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, told the AP. “Nor would it have been able to save us even if it were operating at 100% capacity right now. We just don’t have enough of it.”The agency confirmed that wellhead freeze-offs and other issues curtailing supply in natural gas systems were primarily to blame for new outages on Tuesday, after severe winter weather caused failures across multiple fuel types in recent days.Renewable energy is a popular scapegoat for new problems as more frequent extreme weather events strain infrastructure, according to Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.“It’s easy to focus on the thing that you can see changing as the source of why an outcome is changing,” Grubert told the AP. “The reality is that managing our systems is becoming more difficult. And that’s something that is easy to blame on the reaction to it, but it’s not actually the root cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-blackouts-fuel-false-claims-about-renewable-energy-101613572215071.html
17-02-2021||World||Uber hires prominent critic to focus on treatment of drivers||Alex Rosenblat, an author and labor researcher, wrote for years about how Uber Technologies Inc. obscures pay structures, surveils drivers and creates systems that facilitate discrimination against those workers. Now she works for Uber.The ride-hailing company hired Rosenblat last month as head of marketplace policy, fairness and research. Her appointment, which hasn’t been previously reported, is part of an effort to reform Uber’s treatment of, and relationship with, its drivers.Rosenblat is best known for her 2018 book, “Uberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work,” for which she interviewed hundreds of drivers about their working conditions. The book highlights driver stories of pay disparities, pervasive surveillance and the lopsided power dynamics in algorithm-mediated work.As an Uber employee, Rosenblat said her responsibility is to “get the company to take into consideration the experiences and point of view of drivers, especially at the product level” and that her work will be informed by past research.In an emailed statement, Uber said it hired Rosenblat because the company wants “people at Uber who care about driver issues and who aren’t afraid to challenge our thinking on any given issue.”Before joining Uber, Rosenblat was a senior researcher at Data and Society, a nonprofit institute that seeks to “challenge the power and purpose of technology in society.” Founded in 2014, the organization publishes research on artificial intelligence, the impact of technology on labor and health and online disinformation. The MacArthur Foundation and a philanthropic organization overseen by EBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar are among the 20 financial supporters named on the group’s most recent annual report.Uber has long had an adversarial relationship with many academics, who have criticized the company for restricting data access to select researchers. More than 70 gig economy academics wrote in an open letter after the publication of a 2020 study by Cornell University’s Institute for Workplace Studies commissioned by Uber and Lyft Inc., calling its findings suspect.Alexandrea Ravenelle was among those who signed the letter. In an interview, she expressed admiration for Rosenblat but a continued distrust of the company. Ravenelle, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she’s concerned Uber will ignore Rosenblat’s internal critiques and said the poor state of driver conditions has been public knowledge for years.“When you interview the workers, the situation never seems to be improving for them,” Ravenelle said. “If anyone can help them to make a difference, it will be Alex, but I think she’s got a uphill battle ahead of her.”This isn’t the first time Rosenblat considered trying to change things from the inside. In 2017, after three years of researching the company, Uber attempted to hire her. She pondered the offer but ultimately declined.“This moment says a lot about what happens to experts: Once they know enough to be a threat, the companies they study will try to absorb them,” Rosenblat wrote about the attempted recruitment in “Uberland.”That same year, Rosenblat co-authored a paper describing how Uber’s use of customer reviews to evaluate performance could amount to workplace discrimination due to consumer biases. She is now working to apply these findings to service and policy design, as part of her goal to “encourage the company to assess product impact on drivers as individuals, rather than as part of an abstract group.”Rosenblat recently appeared at a speaker series about the ethics of algorithmic governance and co-authored a post about the disappearance of secure employment during recessions. She said she changed her mind about joining Uber because there are now many others conducting the kind of research she has championed and can carry her mantle.“There are new ways I can use my expertise now, inside the company,” Rosenblat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-hires-prominent-critic-to-focus-on-treatment-of-drivers-101613570402757.html

All major categories showed sharp advances.Ahead of the report, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.1% monthly gain in retail sales.A surge in Covid-19 cases curbed spending at year-end, but since then, virus cases have ebbed and states have started to ease some restrictions on businesses and activity. The ability to shop and eat out, paired with the latest round of $600 stimulus payments, helped drive spending in the month across a variety of categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-retail-sales-surges-5-3-in-january-records-seven-month-high-101613569318629.html
17-02-2021||World||Putin says Russia's elections need protection from 'external interference'||Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia needed to ensure that its parliamentary vote scheduled for September is free of foreign meddling following mass protests calling for the release of one of his fiercest critics.Tens of thousands of people took to the streets last month to urge Russia to free Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny ahead of the September election. The 44-year-old opposition politician was detained and later jailed for alleged parole violations upon his return to Russia. He had been treated in Germany for a nerve agent poisoning he sustained in Siberia last August.The Kremlin has suggested that Navalny is a CIA asset who is being used by Western intelligence services to destabilise Russia, and Moscow has repeatedly told the European Union to keep out of its domestic affairs.Russia has itself been accused of meddling in several elections abroad, including in the 2016 US presidential vote."The citizens of Russia will make their choice (at the parliamentary elections), and we must defend this choice from any attempts of external interference," Putin said at a televised meeting with the leaders of the political parties represented in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament."We cannot allow any blows against Russia's sovereignty, against the right of our people to be the master on their our land," he said, without detailing which countries he was referring to.Navalny said last year he thought Russia's intelligence services had poisoned him with a nerve agent because authorities saw him as a threat ahead of the parliamentary elections.The Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that Putin or authorities had anything to do with Navalny's poisoning.Some European countries have called for sanctions against Moscow over the Navalny case, including halting the construction of the undersea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, designed to export gas from Russia to Germany by bypassing Ukraine.Putin accused the countries that have called for sanctions against the project of trying to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool to punish Russia."Why is everyone circling around Nord Steam 2?" Putin said."They (Western countries) want to force Russia to pay for their geopolitical project in Ukraine," he added, referring to the conflict that erupted in the country's east after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-russia-s-elections-need-protection-from-external-interference-101613568879226.html
17-02-2021||World||UK’s Boris Johnson hints hospitality faces long wait to reopen||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested pubs and restaurants will be among the last venues to reopen as the government lifts pandemic restrictions.Johnson is preparing to publish on Monday a “road map” to ending the national lockdown that has been in place since early January, shuttering non-essential shops and closing restaurants except for take-away service.The curbs on socializing and commercial activity will be eased “in stages” and in a “cautious” way over the months ahead, Johnson said on Wednesday.“You perhaps remember from last year that we opened up hospitality fully as one of the last things that we did” after the first lockdown, the prime minister told broadcasters during a trip to Wales. There’s “obviously an extra risk of transmission” of coronavirus when people gather to drink alcohol and eat meals in pubs and restaurants, he said.The government has prioritized reopening schools when restrictions start to ease, and the premier is aiming to allow face-to-face teaching to begin again from March 8. No decision has been announced on whether all schools in England will go back at once, or if there will be a phased return to the classroom for different age groups.Beyond schools, officials are looking at relaxing rules on outdoor socializing and exercise, and then allowing non-essential stores to reopen, followed by hospitality venues. Ministers have said they will base their decisions on the state of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the vaccination program.Members of Johnson’s Conservative Party are pushing him to reopen the economy faster, fearing the damage to jobs and businesses. Against that, the premier is seeking to balance the need to keep control over a pandemic he has been criticized for mishandling. He has said he wants the current third national lockdown to be the last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-boris-johnson-hints-hospitality-faces-long-wait-to-reopen-101613566307942.html
17-02-2021||World||Lanka cancels Imran Khan address to Parliament, didn’t want him raising Kashmir||Sri Lanka has cancelled a planned address to its Parliament by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan next week, apparently because of concerns that he could rake up the Kashmir issue.Officials cited Covid-19-related restrictions as the reason for the move, though people familiar with developments in Colombo said on condition of anonymity that the Sri Lankan government had done a re-think following discussions on the implications of Khan raising the Kashmir issue in his speech.Sri Lanka’s Speaker Mahinda Abeywardena had told leaders of political parties during a meeting last week that Khan would address the Parliament during his two-day visit beginning on February 22. The address was scheduled for February 24, and Khan is scheduled to meet President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena during the visit.“The planned address to Parliament doesn’t appear to have been well thought through. There were considerable discussions within the government at which the possibility of Prime Minister Khan referring to the Kashmir issue came up,” said one of the people cited above.Realising the ramifications of such a development, the Sri Lankan side considered it more prudent to call off the address to Parliament, the people said.It is the Pakistan government’s stated policy to raise the Kashmir issue at international forums, especially since the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019. Pakistan even raised the Kashmir issue during a virtual meeting of SAARC leaders convened by India last year to discuss ways to counter the Covid-19 pandemic.The sergeant-at-arms of Sri Lanka Parliament, Narendra Fernando, was quoted by the Colombo Gazette as saying that foreign minister Gunawardena had informed officials that Khan’s proposed visit to the Parliament complex “will not take place”. Fernando also said Gunawardena had informed Parliament that Khan’s visit would go ahead as scheduled.Reports in the Sri Lankan media also quoted foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage as saying that the Speaker had informed the government that he would be unable to ensure full attendance in Parliament because of the pandemic.The Pakistan government had made a request for Khan to address the Parliament. The last foreign leader to address Sri Lanka’s Parliament was Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015.Khan will be the first head of state to visit Sri Lanka since the Covid-19 outbreak last year. His visit is being seen in Sri Lanka as crucial to gain the support of Pakistan and other Muslim countries ahead of a hearing on the island country’s human rights record, especially during the war with the LTTE, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on February 24.Last week, Khan had welcomed Sri Lanka’s assurance regarding allowing the burial of Muslim coronavirus victims instead of the forcible cremation of their bodies.The visit also comes at a time when ties between India and Sri Lanka have been affected by Colombo’s unilateral decision to develop the East Container Terminalat Colombo port through a state-run body instead of under a trilateral agreement signed with India and Japan.Both India and Japan have protested against the decision. Reports have suggested Sri Lanka has instead offered to allow India and Japan to develop the West Container Terminal at Colombo port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/week-ahead-of-visit-sri-lanka-cancels-imran-khan-s-address-to-its-parliament-101613567465979.html

The local Babur school, closed for a long period of time due to security reasons, has now reopened to students.The Taliban controls around three-thirds of Afghan territory, including all districts around the capital.Despite the claims of general support in the controlled lands, the Taliban continue to oppose all attempts at holding democratic elections in the country. The peace efforts also appeared to be undermined by the Joe Biden administration's ongoing revision of the Taliban-US deal, signed by Donald Trump administration in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-security-forces-kill-11-taliban-terrorists-in-kandahar-101613562176765.html
17-02-2021||World||NATO chief urges joint spending as budget debate rolls on||Donald Trump is no longer around as president to berate US allies in Europe and Canada for failing to spend enough on their defense budgets. But the debate about military spending appears likely to continue to rage at NATO, even under President Joe Biden.So, in an effort to improve “burden sharing” — the way the 30 member countries contribute cash, military hardwar eand troops to operations run by the world’s biggest security organization — Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is proposing that allies jointly fund more of NATO’s work.Stoltenberg said he will urge defense ministers, at a two-day videoconference starting Wednesday, “to increase NATO’s funding for our core deterrence and defense activities.” It’s new US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s first NATO meeting.The plan would mean jointly funding battlegroups of troops on standby in member countries bordering Russia, aerial policing operations, the deployment of warships on permanent maritime duties or military exercises. It would not be used for active military operations outside NATO territory.At the moment, Stoltenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting, “the country that provides the capabilities also provides the funding. So, if you send some troops to the NATO battlegroup in Lithuania, as Norway does, then Norway pays for that. I think that we should change that.”The former Norwegian prime minister believes that by spending more together, members would also be demonstrating their commitment to defend each other if one comes under attack, which is the common defense clause enshrined in Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty.Early in his presidency, standing outside NATO headquarters near a monument to the 9/11 attacks when the allies rallied to the defense of the United States, Trump suggested that the US might not come to the rescue of partners who fail to spend 2% of GDP on defense. That threat damaged trust at NATO.“Spending more together would demonstrate the strength of our commitment to Article 5, our promise to defend each other. And it would contribute to fairer burden-sharing,” said Stoltenberg.Still, his plan has surprised a few members of the 30-nation alliance.Some NATO diplomats have given it a cautious welcome. Questions remain over where the money would come from. NATO has a relatively small in-house budget of around $2 billion, but most of this is taken up with administrative and infrastructure costs, like running the Brussels headquarters.NATO already has a number of trust funds and few countries want to create more. Justifying greater military spending when budgets have already been ravaged by restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus is also hard to sell to weary publics.There is also concern that certain countries might see it as a bailout when they should just be spending more, or that NATO’s ability to act might be slowed by more arguments over money. Some think it’s an ill-conceived plan, proposed without proper consultation and meant to mollify the United States.The funding would favor countries that do more within NATO, and the US leads a battlegroup in Poland so its costs would be covered under such a budget.NATO members began to cut defense spending after the Cold War but were spurred back into action after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Since then, European allies and Canada have together spent an extra $190 billion on their national military budgets, according to Stoltenberg.Nine of the 30 countries are likely to spend the guideline figure of 2% of GDP this year — the US, Greece, Britain, Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania — up from three in 2014. US spending has in fact declined since 2014, but the country still spends more than all its allies combined.Even with this increased spending and the departure of Trump, America’s partners at NATO expect Biden to be just as demanding about military spending. The tone may have changed, but not the substance of a complaint that has been made by US presidents for well over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-urges-joint-spending-as-budget-debate-rolls-on-101613563296940.html
17-02-2021||World||Impeachment over, Congress shifts focus to security failures||In the still shaken and heavily guarded US Capitol, thousands of National Guard troops still wander the halls. Glass windows remain broken. Doors swing without handles. And in the grand marble hallways, which amplified the shouts of insurrectionists just over a month ago, there is an uncomfortable silence.The end of Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial is only the beginning of Congress' reckoning with the Jan. 6 attack, a violent ransacking of the Capitol that resulted in five deaths. While the Senate has spoken on Trump's role in the violence, acquitting him of insurrection after a wrenching five days of impeachment testimony, lawmakers who fled the violent mob are still demanding answers. How, they ask, could security could have failed so catastrophically? And how can they ensure it doesn't happen again?“This is not a moment where we pivot and move on,” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Saturday, just after the acquittal vote in the impeachment trial. “You cannot view today as the last page of the book. What we were talking about today was the accountability for the leader of the mob. But we still have to protect against future mobs, we still have to go after members of the mob.”The coming weeks — and likely the coming months and years — will force lawmakers to work through the many unanswered questions about the attack. It's a complex task that will test whether lawmakers can set aside partisanship, which flared anew during the impeachment process, and turn the harrowing violence that threatened their lives into a restorative moment for their institution.Since Saturday’s vote, Democratic leaders have said they will take steps to form an independent investigative commission modeled after one that studied security failures before the Sept. 11 attacks. Two Senate committees have summoned top security officials to testify, the beginning of a comprehensive look at what went wrong. Separately, retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré is leading an ongoing review of the Capitol’s security process, commissioned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And several other panels are looking into different aspects of the insurrection, including intelligence lapses and whether it was coordinated.“Security is the order of the day,” Pelosi said in a letter to her House colleagues on Monday. “The security of our country, the security of our Capitol which is the temple of our democracy, and the security of our members.”Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump, said Sunday that there should be a “complete investigation” into what happened. “What was known, who knew it and when they knew, all that, because that builds the basis so this never happens again,” he said.Legislation to set up the commission could be introduced in the House as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the process and granted anonymity to discuss the planning. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to support the commission, and a spokesman said Tuesday that he “looks forward to it being approved by both chambers with overwhelming bipartisan support.”At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden supports it as well. Biden “backs efforts to shed additional light on the facts to ensure something like that never happens again,” she said.In her letter to Democratic colleagues, Pelosi said the House will also put forth supplemental spending to boost security at the Capitol.The first congressional hearings will come next week, with two Senate panels calling in the former chief of Capitol Police and the former heads of security for the House and Senate, all three of whom resigned immediately after the attack.The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee announced Tuesday that they had invited former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving to the hearing, along with Robert Contee, the chief of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. The hearing will begin a broad examination of the security failures that led to the breach.In addition to the Feb. 23 hearing, the two committees are pressing for information from almost two dozen agencies and departments about the response.The security breakdown on Jan. 6, as the House and Senate met for a joint session to count electoral votes, was severe. The Capitol Police had planned for a free speech demonstration, not a violent insurrection by Trump supporters to overturn the election. With the diminished security presence, the rioters not only breached the Capitol but entered the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled. The rioters also tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside. Outside, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with an outnumbered, ill-prepared Capitol Police force, which was eventually assisted by D.C. police.The acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda Pittman, has acknowledged the department knew before Jan. 6 that extremists and white supremacists could be in the crowd outside the Capitol. But she and other leaders are still pointing fingers about who was responsible for not bolstering security.The hearings and investigations — which will be conducted in both the House and Senate by several committees — are expected to help inform decisions about the wide perimeter around the building that has been in place since Jan. 6. The show of force has also angered D.C. residents who have to navigate blocked-off roads, and it has frustrated some lawmakers in both parties who believe the building should be open to the public.Outside of Congress, federal law enforcement has arrested more than 200 people who broke into the Capitol, and others have suggested that Trump himself could be criminally liable for his efforts to persuade officials to change election results and encourage his supporters to overturn his defeat.In a blistering speech that came immediately after his vote to acquit Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned responsibility for the riots on Trump and said he didn’t “yet” get away with anything. “We have a criminal justice system in this country, we have civil litigation,” McConnell said.Still, inside the building, people are still dealing with the aftermath.Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent who voted to convict the Republican former president, said he’s most worried about presidents who come after Trump, and what lessons they will take from the Senate’s decision to acquit. "I do feel sad,” he said. “This gave us an opportunity for closure which we missed.”Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski reflected on the sights and sounds she heard on Jan. 6 as she walked out of the chamber after the vote. Like Cassidy, she was one of the seven Republicans who voted to convict.“It hits me,” Murkowski said in an interview with Politico, remembering the trash that scattered the same floors she was walking on as she spoke. “I hear the sound of the of the Capitol Police officer who was retching in the bathroom because he had just gotten sprayed with pepper spray and was trying to wash it out. … We’re all witnesses to this. And you have to bear witness to it, I guess.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-over-congress-shifts-focus-to-security-failures-101613562371045.html
17-02-2021||World||Italy's Draghi urges unity, sacrifice in fighting the virus||Italian Premier Mario Draghi urged Italy’s polarized politicians to unite behind his new government to confront the coronavirus pandemic and the economic devastation it has wrought, saying Italy has a once-in-a-lifetime chance to create a more sustainable, equitable and healthy world for future generations.Draghi vowed an environmentally conscious and digitally reformed government program in a 50-minute speech Wednesday before the Senate, which came ahead of a mandatory confidence vote later in the day. Draghi is expected to win votes in both the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies after securing broad-based support for his government.“Today unity isn’t a emotion, it’s a duty,“ Draghi said to applause as he concluded his speech. “A duty guided by what unites us all: love of Italy.”Draghi, the former European central bank chief who is widely credited with having saved the euro, vowed a similar all-out effort to do whatever it takes to emerge from the pandemic, which first erupted in Italy this time last year. He said the principle aim of his administration was to confront the pandemic and safeguard Italians “with all means," and urged politicians to put aside their political interests in a spirit of sacrifice for future generations.Draghi’s government was sworn in over the weekend, capping a remarkable few weeks that saw the widely popular Premier Giuseppe Conte resign after a key ally yanked his support. After efforts to forge a third Conte government failed, President Sergio Mattarella asked Draghi, 73, to form a high-profile, non-political government.Draghi’s 23-member cabinet includes politicians in most ministries but puts technical experts in key roles, especially those responsible for ensuring that the more than 200 billion euros ($240 billion) in European Union pandemic recovery funds that Italy expects to receive are spent according to EU criteria, such as for ecological and digital transformations.Draghi said his government would be “convincingly” pro-EU and pro-U.S., saying he envisaged in particular reinforcing bilateral relations with France and Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-draghi-urges-unity-sacrifice-in-fighting-the-virus-101613561755967.html
17-02-2021||World||After delay, Israel allows vaccines into Hamas-run Gaza||The Palestinian Authority sent the first shipment of coronavirus vaccines to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Wednesday, two days after accusing Israel of preventing it from dispatching the doses amid objections from some Israeli lawmakers.Palestinian Health Minister Mai Alkaila said in a statement that the PA sent 2,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, which would go to front-line medical workers. An Associated Press photographer in Gaza saw the shipment arrive midday at the Kerem Shalom crossing.An Israeli defense official had earlier said that authorities approved the delivery, adding that it's “not in Israel's interest to have a Gaza health crisis.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Israeli lawmakers had debated whether to allow the delivery of vaccines into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas, an Islamic militant group, seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank and coordinates with Israel on security and other matters.Some lawmakers have said the delivery should be linked to progress on the release of two Israeli captives held by Hamas and the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in a 2014 war. They have also expressed concern that the first batch of vaccines will go to Hamas members rather than medics.Gaza is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, many of whom live in close confines, and has yet to receive any vaccines. Authorities there have reported more than 53,000 cases and at least 538 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Israel has launched one of the world’s most successful vaccination programs, inoculating more than a third of its population of 9.3 million since December.Rights groups say it has an obligation as an occupying power to share its vaccines with the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation and says its priority is its own citizens. The Palestinian Authority has not publicly requested vaccines from Israel and says it has secured its own supply through the World Health Organization and agreements with drug makers.Still, Israel provided 2,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to the PA earlier this month, allowing it to begin vaccinating medical workers, and the PA says it independently acquired another 10,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. It would need Israel’s permission to transfer them to Gaza.Hamas is believed to be holding two captives, an Israeli of Ethiopian descent who entered Gaza shortly after the 2014 war and an Arab Bedouin citizen of Israel. In exchange, Hamas is likely to demand the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including individuals implicated in deadly attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-delay-israel-allows-vaccines-into-hamas-run-gaza-101613561205405.html
17-02-2021||World||Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested again while in jail: Report||Jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been arrested again, on suspicion of assisting one of 12 fugitives China captured at sea last year, his Apple Daily tabloid and Oriental Daily said on Wednesday, without citing a source.Lai, detained while awaiting a bail hearing on Thursday, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces under a sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last year.The fugitives could face potential charges in Hong Kong over mass anti-government protests in 2019, with Andy Li, whom the papers identified as the person Lai was suspected of helping, being investigated for suspected national security crimes.Neither newspaper gave further details. It was unclear if the national security legislation extends to the assistance Lai is suspected to have given Li.Police did not immediately respond to a request to comment.The Chinese coast guard captured the 12 fugitives in August as they tried to flee Hong Kong in a boat believed to be bound for Taiwan. All were held virtually incommunicado in a mainland China prison until a trial late in December.Ten were jailed for terms ranging from seven months to three years for illegally crossing the border or organising the crossing, while two minors were sent back to Hong Kong.Lai was already the most high-profile person to be charged under the new security law, for statements made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which prosecutors say he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.He was arrested in an August raid by about 200 police officers on the newsroom of his Apple Daily, known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.Beijing imposed the new law on the former British colony last June, after months of pro-democracy protests, to target anything China that considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.Punishment under the law can range up to life in prison.Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous financial hub. Supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-again-while-in-jail-report-101613560749324.html
17-02-2021||World||West Africa guards against Ebola as cases rise in Guinea||Guinea’s West African neighbors are taking measures to prevent the Ebola hemorrhagic fever from entering their countries, as cases rise in the world’s top bauxite exporter.Five people have died from the highly contagious disease, its National Health Security Agency said in an emailed statement Tuesday. Three people have tested positive and ten other suspected cases are awaiting laboratory results, it said.Authorities are also monitoring 125 people who were in contact with cases. Most of them are in the southeastern Nzerekore region, where an outbreak has been declared, and the remaining ten are in the capital, Conakry, it said.No cases or contacts have been reported beyond Guinea so far, Georges Ki-Zerbo, who heads the World Health Organization’s (WH country office, said by phone from the capital Tuesday. The WHO, which expects more cases to be confirmed locally in the coming days, has warned neighbors to “act immediately” to prevent a spread, Ki-Zerbo said.Guinea was at the epicenter of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, which spread mainly to Liberia and Sierra Leone, infecting more than 45,000 people in West Africa, and killing more than 11,000. The latest outbreak couldn’t have come at a worst time as countries grapple with the health and economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The worst-affected countries are still reeling from the last Ebola outbreak, Gyude Moore, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C. and former Liberian cabinet minister, said in an emailed response to questions. The resurgence is “happening at a time when governments have less resources, slowing economies and a global system that is preoccupied with a pandemic,” he said.Guinea was the first sub-Saharan African country to administer Covid vaccines but has only vaccinated 55 people. It’s now working to secure Ebola vaccines, approved for use in 2019, within the next three days, authorities said, fueling hope that the new outbreak will be contained.Ivory Coast, which shares a western border with the affected Guinean region, has taken “heightened” protective measures, it said in a statement Monday. It has also reactivated its Ebola surveillance centers and tightened checks at land, sea and air borders.“The government insists on personal and collective responsibility in the fight against the two diseases,” Ivorian Health Minister Aka Ouele said in the statement.Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who led the country during the last epidemic, echoed the sentiment in a tweet Monday, after the incumbent, George Weah, ordered health authorities to increase surveillance.Authorities in Sierra Leone and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country that quashed the 2014 outbreak before it could take root, are also tightening checks, according to government statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-africa-guards-against-ebola-as-cases-rise-in-guinea-101613559972247.html

The staff confirmed a student was shot dead during the kidnap operation," the official said.The school has around 1,000 students and it was not immediately clear how many were taken.The security source confirmed the details of the attack and said a headcount was under way.Troops with aerial support were tracking the bandits for possible rescue, the security source said.The Niger kidnapping came two months after hundreds of schoolboys were abducted in northwestern Katsina state then released days later following negotiations with the government.The gangs who are driven by financial motives have no ideological leanings but security officials fear they are being infiltrated by jihadists from Nigeria's northeast where the army is battling a decade-long Islamist insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kidnap-hundreds-of-schoolboys-in-nigeria-report-101613558813747.html
17-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup protesters mass again, reject army's claim it has public support||Hundreds of thousands of people marched in Myanmar on Wednesday, rejecting the army's assertion that the public supported its overthrow of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and vowing they would not be cowed in their bid to end military rule.Opponents of the February 1 military coup are deeply sceptical of junta assurances, given at a news conference on Tuesday, that there would be a fair election and it would hand over power, even as police filed an additional charge against Suu Kyi.The Nobel Peace laureate, detained since the coup, now faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as charges of illegally importing six walkie talkie radios. Her next hearing is set for March 1."We love democracy and hate the junta," Sithu Maung, an elected member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) told tens of thousands of people at the Sule Pagoda, a central protest site in the main city of Yangon."We must be the last generation to experience a coup."Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the ruling council, told the Tuesday news conference that 40 million of the 53 million population supported the military's action.Sithu Maung poked fun at that saying: "We're showing here that we're not in that 40 million."Suu Kyi's party swept a November 8 election as widely expected, but the army alleges there was fraud. It said its seizure of power was in line with the constitution and it remained committed to democracy.A protester who gave her name as Khin was scornful."They said there was vote fraud but look at the people here," said Khin.The coup that cut short the Southeast Asian country's unsteady transition towards democracy has prompted daily demonstrations since February 6.The takeover has also drawn strong Western criticism, with renewed anger from Washington and London over the additional charge for Suu Kyi.Although China has taken a softer line, its ambassador in Myanmar on Tuesday dismissed accusations it supported the coup.Despite that, protesters also gathered outside the Chinese embassy.Tens of thousands took to the streets of the city of Mandalay, where some people also blocked its main rail link, and crowds gathered in several other places.Photographs from the small central town of Khin U showed a sea of people in straw hats and coronavirus masks listening to speeches. Thousands marched in the capital, Naypyitaw, and hundreds in the southern town of Mawlamyine, witnesses said. Both places saw clashes last week.There were no reports of serious trouble on Wednesday.Earlier, UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said he feared the possibility of violence against the protesters and made an urgent call on any country with influence over the generals, and businesses, to press them to avoid it.In Yangon and elsewhere, motorists responded to a "broken-down car campaign" spread on social media, stopping their supposedly stalled cars, with bonnets raised, on streets and bridges to block them to police and military trucks.Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners group said more than 450 arrests had been made since the coup. Those arrested include much of the NLD's senior leadership.The suspension of the internet at night has added to a sense of fear.'DISTURBED'Zaw Min Tun told the news conference, the junta's first since the coup, that the military was giving a guarantee that an election would be held and power handed to the winner. He gave no time frame, but said the army would not be in power for long.The last stretch of army rule lasted nearly half a century before democratic reforms began in 2011.Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to bring democracy.The United States was "disturbed" by reports of the additional criminal charge against Suu Kyi, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Washington imposed new sanctions last week on the military. No additional measures were announced on Tuesday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also decried the new criminal charge, saying the military "fabricated" it.The unrest has revived memories of bloody suppression of protests under previous juntas.Police have opened fire several times, mostly with rubber bullets, to disperse protesters. A protester who was shot in the head in Naypyitaw last week is not expected to survive.A policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest in Mandalay on Monday, the military said.As well as the demonstrations in towns across the ethnically diverse country, a civil disobedience movement has brought strikes that are crippling many functions of government.Actor Pyay Ti Oo said opposition could not be quelled."They say we're like a brush fire and will stop after a while but will we? No. Won't stop until we succeed,” he told the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-protesters-mass-again-reject-army-s-claim-it-has-public-support-101613557721406.html

"Currently, that is not our judgement, but clearly we are not planning to wait until it is too late," she added.Sweden, with a population of around 10 million, has registered more than 615,000 Covid-19 cases and over 12,400 deaths, a rate per capita many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-government-seeks-wider-powers-to-shut-businesses-if-third-wave-hits-101613555518592.html

The US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment."It was a reciprocal step," RIA state news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.Russia and the United States have cooperated closely in space exploration for decades, jointly flying the International Space Station, despite deteriorating relations in other areas.Ryabkov said NASA was not responsible for creating obstacles that thwarted interaction with Moscow, but that this was not the case for other US government bodies."Ideally we would eliminate" restrictions on diplomatic visas between the two countries, he said. "We will propose this to the administration in Washington."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-denies-visa-to-us-official-for-nasa-post-calls-it-a-reciprocal-step-101613555730338.html

She was educated at the Dubai English Speaking School, followed by the International School Choueifat and one year at the Latifa School for Girls.She is said to be an excellent and experienced skydiver, trained by former world champion Stefania Martinengo.Latifa had attempted a daring escape from the middle-easterm country on February 24, 2018 when she and her Finnish friend Tiina Jauhiainen left Dubai in a car and crossed into Oman. They took jet-skis from there and met former French intelligence officer Herve Jaubert and his crew on the yacht Nostromo.She alerted British human rights lawyer David Haigh of Detained International of her departure two days later. Jaubert made contact with an Indian journalist on March 3, 2018, in preparation for their arrival, but the yacht was intercepted by Indian authorities as they were approaching Goa.The attempted sea escape and its aftermath threw the carefully controlled family image of Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed into public life.On December 24, 2018, the UAE authorities released three low resolution images of Latifa meeting with former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. The meeting was scheduled by Princess Haya, one of the UAE Prime Minister's wives, as per Robinson.Robinson described Latifa as a 'troubled young woman' on BBC Radio 4.However, Robinson's comments were criticised by rights groups and Detained in Dubai's head, Radha Stirling, for repeating the Dubai's official version of the story almost word to word. Latifa's representatives also questioned the nature of Robinson's visit and called for an independent investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princess-under-house-arrest-who-is-uae-s-sheikha-latifa-101613550387278.html

The contract includes a firm order for 200 million shots, with an option to request an additional 100 million, which could double the EU’s overall supply from the companies.As many as 75 million doses from the order will be shipped in the second quarter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when the deal was first announced in January.EU countries are far behind the US and UK in the race to vaccinate as many people as possible, even as faster-spreading variants of the virus gain a stronger foothold on the continent.The commission is also seeking to boost its stock of vaccines from Moderna Inc., which, like Pfizer-BioNTech, has a shot based on messenger RNA technology. Unlike more conventional vaccines, the mRNA shots can be modified within weeks if necessary to protect against mutant versions of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-finalizes-deal-with-pfizer-biontech-for-200-million-more-covid-19-vaccines-101613554508480.html

Shanghai Fosun secured rights in March to develop and market the Pfizer Inc./BioNTech vaccine across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageTaiwan has been one of the standout successes in combating the spread of the coronavirus, registering nine deaths and fewer than 1,000 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. But securing vaccinations for its 23.5 million people has proved to be more challenging. The deal’s collapse is a significant setback for Taiwan’s inoculation efforts, and the concerns of interference by Beijing are likely to further strain relations with China.China’s government claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never ruled it. Under leader Xi Jinping, China is increasing its military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, while also threatening to invade.Dealing with a Chinese company to access the vaccine had been a source of anxiety for Taiwan’s government, Chen said. “At the time we were worried there would be political pressure,” he said.Taiwan’s government is still talking with BioNTech, according to Presidential Office spokeswoman Kolas Yotaka. Taiwan has not started offering vaccines to the public yet, but Chen said efforts to procure them from overseas continue, with the first vaccinations likely to begin in the middle of the year.The government plans to purchase 20 million doses, approximately 5 million of which will likely be provided by the Covax program, co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.Beijing has blocked Taiwan’s participation as an observer in the WHO’s World Health Assembly for the past several years, since President Tsai Ing-wen came into office.Speaking during a commercial break on the radio broadcast, Chen said of the failure to secure the German vaccines: “It’s just like our [attempts to] participate in the WHA,” according to a YouTube video of the interview.“This should not surprise anyone, but we are prepared,” spokeswoman Kolas said via text message Wednesday. “Our policy has not changed - we are developing our own high-quality vaccine and at the same time securing short-term access by purchasing from other companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-alleges-political-pressure-from-china-may-have-blocked-vaccine-deal-101613554222363.html

Longfield will call for a “year of opportunity” to be launched once the virus is suppressed, with schools, sports halls and swimming pools opened at evenings and weekends to help children “catch up with confidence.”Also read| SA, Brazil variants of Covid virus in India: All we know about the two mutationsShe will also urge Johnson to extend the 20-pound ($27.80) weekly uplift in Universal Credit benefits payments when it comes to an end in April, warning that failing to do so would push 800,000 children into “devastating poverty.” Johnson’s “promise to ‘level up’ is just a slogan unless it focuses on children,” she will add.A government spokesperson said: “Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the pandemic, driven by our commitment to level up opportunities and outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urged-to-focus-post-covid-plans-on-vulnerable-children-101613543015387.html
17-02-2021||World||Prez Joe Biden describes life at the White House: 'A gilded cage'||Four weeks into his presidency, Joe Biden says he’s still getting used to the trappings of the office.Biden offered a frank description of what it’s like to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. during his CNN town hall Tuesday night, referencing past presidents who have spoken of the building as “a little like a gilded cage.”“I get up in the morning and look at Jill and say, ‘Where the hell are we?’” Biden joked, adding that he wasn't used to household staff waiting on him.“I find myself extremely self-conscious,” Biden added, saying he was unaccustomed to someone “handing me my suitcoat.”Biden’s working-class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, has long been a central part of his political brand. He most recently lived in a large house in the Wilmington, Delaware, suburbs.The White House features a spacious lawn that has an unimpeded view of the Washington and Lincoln Monuments, but is otherwise surrounded by high fencing and a small army of guards. Biden said it’s “totally different” from the vice president’s residence, set on 80 acres and offering ample room to swim, explore and exercise in greater privacy.The former vice president said he’d been in the Oval Office 100 times or more over the years, but had never been to the residential areas of the White House.Even if the residence still feels new, Biden suggested he's already settled deeply into the work of the presidency.“Sometimes, because things are moving so fast, not because of the burden, it feels like four years,” Biden said. “It’s not because of the burden, it’s because there’s so much happening, that you’re focused on, you’re constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity.”Biden confirmed he had picked up the phone to talk with one or more of his predecessors but declined to say who.He added: “By the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and called me as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-joe-biden-describes-life-at-the-white-house-a-gilded-cage-101613553127183.html
17-02-2021||World||French Assembly passes bill aiming to curb 'a rise in Islamism'||France's National Assembly on Tuesday approved legislation designed mainly to counter a rise in Islamism in towns and cities which the government says threatens national unity.The legislation did not single out any particular religion, but it cracked down on practices such as forced marriage and virginity tests.It included tough measures against online apologists for acts of violence, stricter surveillance of religious associations, and tighter restrictions on educating children outside mainstream schools.France's Muslim population is estimated to number about five million people, many whose family origins lie in Algeria or other parts of its former empire.The country has suffered a wave of Islamist militant attacks in recent years, and tackling religious extremism, French identity and domestic security will be big issues in next year's presidential election.Presented to parliament on the 115th anniversary of the law that enshrined the separation of state and religion in France, the bill has been branded by some on the left as an attack on Islam and as too weak by the far-right and some conservatives.The legislation represented a "powerful offensive" by the secular state, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. "It's a tough text...but necessary for the Republic," Darmanin told RTL radio ahead of the vote.The bill passed by 347 votes to 151 in parliament's lower house, where President Emmanuel Macron's centrist ruling party and its allies hold a majority. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where the centre-right opposition dominates.The debate around the law became more charged after the Oct. 16 beheading of a schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, by a teenage Islamist who said he wanted to punish him for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on free speech.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has accused Darmanin of not tackling radical Islam head on."You are restricting everyone's freedom to try to modify the freedoms of a few Islamists," she told Darmanin in a debate last week, referring to the curbs on home-schooling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-assembly-passes-bill-aiming-to-curb-a-rise-in-islamism-101613551642344.html

He pointed to global worries around the prospects for asset bubbles and the possibility of a sudden uptick in inflation, as well as interest rates that currently are “ultra-low.”When he was managing director at MAS, Heng warned as early as April 2007 about the under-pricing of risks for securities, including the type of collateralized debt obligations at the heart of the U.S. housing crisis.Here are other comments Heng made in the interview:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-minister-warns-full-pandemic-brunt-not-yet-felt-101613541856994.html
17-02-2021||World||Freeze could keep Texans in the dark for days: energy update||The deep freeze that has forced the shutdown of US refineries, oil wells and meat plants, disrupted shipments of soybeans and corn, and is still leaving more than 3 million customers without electricity could continue to keep parts of Texas in the dark for several days.To prevent the collapse of their networks, suppliers from North Dakota to Texas implemented rolling power cuts for a second consecutive day, with outages spreading to more states Tuesday night including Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The operator of the Texas electric grid no longer expects all service to be restored in the state by Tuesday night, saying it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running. Utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. also warned residents blackouts may last for several more daysIn the Permian Basin, major producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. told customers it would be forced to curtail oil deliveries, while Chevron Corp. shut in some wells in the region. Fracking in the top U.S. shale plays has gone dark. US oil production has plunged by a third.Meanwhile, gasoline futures in New York jumped almost 5% on Tuesday as more than 20 refineries were disrupted by the polar blast. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said its Corpus Christ refinery in Texas won’t be able to deliver fuels. Wheat futures also surged as the freeze snarled grain shipments.Amazon.com Inc. closed facilities in Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Kentucky.Authorities warned Houston-area residents to stay off the roads and highways after sunset on Tuesday amid expectations that plunging temperatures and an approaching ice storm would make driving dangerous. Long lines formed at grocery stores in scenes reminiscent of the early days of Covid-19 as residents stocked up on necessities. Hotels in the area suspended some meal service because of delayed deliveries, and vacancy rates were near zero.At least 20 deaths have been reported across the U.S. in connection with severe winter weather that has left millions without power, according to the Associated Press.Three people were found dead after a tornado in North Carolina, and four others died in a Houston-area house fire after lighting a blaze in the fireplace to stay warm. Other causes of death included car crashes on icy roads and carbon monoxide poisoning.The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. lowered its emergency level to a level that no longer requires rolling blackouts.The grid had earlier asked all utilities in its southern region -- most of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Southeast Texas -- to implement periodic power outages after frigid weather forced generator shut-downs at the same time demand was rising.Texas Warns Fuel Shortages Developing in Western Half of State (9:30 p.m.)Motor fuels are running low in some parts of Texas as winter storms and frigid weather cripple power generation, natural gas output and the oil refineries that rely on them.The shortages have been detected along a stretch of Interstate 10 between San Antonio and El Paso, the Texas Department of Transportation said in a tweet late Tuesday.“Parts of Texas have fuel shortages,” the tweet said. “If you must drive, top off before you hit the road.”Houston Suburbs Tell People to Boil Water Before Drinking (8:50 p.m.)Officials in several Houston suburbs issued so-called boil orders warning residents to purify water supplies amid deepening weather and energy crises.Water-pressure levels in some municipal systems west and south of the fourth-largest U.S. city have fallen so low that the water is no longer safe for human consumption, according to warnings from multiple districts late Tuesday.The boil orders came just hours after office towers in the downtown business district warned tenants that low pressure meant the water was no longer potable. Power supplies across the state have been crippled by a combination of record cold temperatures and disruptions in fuel deliveries. Water utilities in Texas rely on electric pumps to operate distribution networks.The Freeport liquefied natural gas export plant in Texas has delayed and canceled planned loading of several shipments over the next few weeks as the facility curbs output in response to the deep freeze. Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the three-train plant to dial back operations in keeping with the state’s disaster declaration.Power disruptions at export facilities, closed ship channels and a reduction in the flow of natural gas have held back LNG tankers off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Crews are working to restore power to the Sempra Energy-owned Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc., the top U.S. LNG exporter, also curbed production at Sabine Pass LNG in Louisiana and Corpus Christi LNG in Texas.Gas flows to U.S. LNG export facilities have dropped to the lowest level since early-September, according to data from BloombergNEF.The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., which runs the largest power grid in the U.S. Midwest, called for rolling blackouts across its entire southern region amid generation outages and high demand. The order is scheduled until 1 a.m. on Feb. 17.MISO operates a system that stretches along the Mississippi River region from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, taking in 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.Houston Power Outages Could Last Several Days, CenterPoint Says (6:05 p.m.)Rolling blackouts that have paralyzed Houston and the rest of Texas may last for several more days, utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. warned residents.With too little electricity being generated to supply all demand in the fourth-largest U.S. city, CenterPoint said in a tweet that it has no way to predict when supplies will be restored.Canadian Gas Commands Rare Premium Over U.S. Fuel Amid Freeze (5:49 p.m.)A deep freeze that’s sent Texas power prices surging and curtailed millions of barrels of oil production is serving as a short-term boon for Canada, which is fetching a rare premium for its natural gas.The country’s benchmark AECO gas price traded at a 27% premium to its U.S. equivalent on Tuesday, just days after touching a 7-year high of $5.28 per million British thermal units, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Canadian gas usually sells at a discount to American supplies because of its distance from major population and manufacturing centers, among other reasons.U.S. Oil Output Plunges by a Third as Freeze Slams Permian (5:32 p.m.)Total U.S. oil production has plunged by nearly a third as an unprecedented cold blast freezes well operations across the central U.S., according to traders and industry executives with direct knowledge of the operations.Crude output has now fallen by about 3.5 million barrels a day or more nationwide, they said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Before the cold snap, the U.S. was pumping about 11 million barrels a day, according to last government data. Production in the Texas’s Permian Basin alone -- America’s biggest oil field -- has plummeted by as much as 65%.Operations in Texas have stumbled because temperatures are low enough to freeze oil and gas liquids at the well head and in pipelines that are laid on the ground, as opposed to under the surface as practiced in more northerly oil regions. The big question now is how quickly temperatures return to normal.It Could Take Several Days to Restore Power in Texas (5:20 p.m.)The operator of the Texas electric grid no longer expects all service to be restored in the state by Tuesday night, saying it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running.One of the chief hurdles is that there isn’t enough natural gas flowing to fuel plants, Bill Magness, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said in a briefing. He expects “significant progress” in the next several days but warned more power plants could still trip offline.“We are seeing progress on restoration of the system,” Magness said. “There could be setbacks”Earlier Tuesday, grid officials said they expected all power to be restored by the evening.Deep Freeze Upends U.S. Agriculture Markets From Grains to Beef (5:17 p.m.)The deep is snarling shipments of goods from corn to soybeans, shutting meat plants and curbing ethanol production.Traders say it’s increasingly hard to move grain to ports in the Pacific Northwest, and ice warnings are restricting navigation on the Illinois River. Energy costs soared, prompting some ethanol and soybean processing plants to slow down, said the traders, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Cargill Inc. is curbing energy use while Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. slowed production at several locations due to gas shortages. Tyson Foods Inc. was among meat producers forced to shut plants in Texas.Houston-Area Motorists Urged to Stay Home (4:50 p.m.)Authorities in Harris County, Texas, the nation’s third-largest county and home to Houston, warned residents to stay off the roads and highways after sunset on Tuesday amid expectations that plunging temperatures and an approaching ice storm will make driving dangerous.Meanwhile, long lines formed at grocery stores in scenes reminiscent of the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic as residents stocked up on necessities ahead of another round of punishing weather. Hotels in the Houston area suspended some meal service because of delayed food deliveries and vacancy rates were near zero as state-mandated power outages entered a third day.Chevron Shuts in Some Permian Wells Due to Freeze (4:09 p.m.)Chevron shut in compression and production at wells in Culberson County in West Texas due to cold weather, according to a state regulatory filing.Compression was shut down first, then production shut wells in, causing flaring. Emissions began on Sunday.Chemical Makers Shutting Coastal Facilities (4:08 p.m.)Olin Corp., Indorama Ventures and other chemical producers are shuttering plants along a 150-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast as gas shortages and icy temperatures hinder operations.Such shutdowns are not without danger -- Olin’s Blue Cube plant in Freeport, Texas, suffered a leak from a valve as crews were winding down operations, resulting in ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride emissions into the atmosphere, according to a state regulatory filing. Indorama alerted authorities and neighbors that it would be burning off excess gases frequently while it worked to suspend operations at its complex in Port Neches, Texas.Citgo Declares Force Majeure After Freeze Shuts Texas Refinery (3:44 p.m.)Venezuela-backed Citgo Petroleum Corp. has told its suppliers and customers that its Corpus Christ, Texas, refinery won’t be able to receive or deliver crude and refined products after a historic cold snap caused major disruptions to operations.The company is in the process of assessing damage and evaluating a restart time for the 167,000 barrel-a-day refinery, according to a force majeure notice seen by Bloomberg. Part of the refinery experienced operating issues and unplanned unit shutdowns due to freezing weather and third-party supplier outages, according to the latest regulatory filing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/freeze-could-keep-texans-in-the-dark-for-days-energy-update-101613541895962.html
17-02-2021||World||Civil rights groups want EU to ban biometric surveillance ahead of new AI laws||Civil and digital rights groups on Wednesday launched a petition seeking the support of one million Europeans to help pressure the European Union to ban biometric mass surveillance ahead of laws on artificial intelligence (AI) due this year.Surveillance tools such as facial recognition systems have triggered concerns about risks to privacy and fundamental rights and that they could be exploited by repressive regimes to commit human rights violations.The EU executive plans to announce a legislative proposal on AI in the first quarter of the year, which is expected to cover high-risk sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport and parts of the public sector.The group, made up of the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, Reclaim Your Face, European Digital Rights, Privacy International and about 26 other organisations, warned of the dangers of biometric data captured via CCTV cameras and facial recognition technology.The coalition, which aims to gather one million signatures so it can take part directly in the legislative process, said it has already collected evidence of vast and systemic abuses of people's biometric data across Europe."This is about everyone's control over their own future," Orsolya Reich, senior advocacy officer at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, said in a statement."We can already see this happening with the way AI is used to make decisions about us. Biometric mass surveillance will just feed more data from more people into these systems and make these practices even more widespread and harmful," she said.The EU's rights watchdog, the Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, last year sounded the alarm on the risks of using AI in predictive policing, medical diagnoses and targeted advertising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/civil-rights-groups-want-eu-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-ahead-of-new-ai-laws-101613545561261.html
17-02-2021||World||New Zealand ends lockdown after deciding outbreak contained||A lockdown in the New Zealand city of Auckland will end at midnight, the government announced Wednesday after concluding a coronavirus outbreak had been contained.“This is good news,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.The nation's largest city was put into lockdown on Sunday after three unexplained cases were found in the community. It was the first lockdown in six months in a nation which so far has managed to successfully stamp out the spread of the disease.The move to end the lockdown came as health authorities said the outbreak had grown by three cases to six in total. But Ardern said the additional cases were to be expected because they involved close contacts.Ramped-up testing indicates the outbreak hasn't spread far. Laboratories processed more than 17,000 individual tests on Tuesday, authorities said, and they also tested wastewater samples, which came back negative.“What this tells us is that we don't have a widespread outbreak, but rather a small chain of transmission which is manageable by our normal contact-tracing and testing procedures,” Ardern said.The initial cases were a mother, a father, and their 13-year-old daughter, who attends a local high school. Health authorities said the three new cases were a high school classmate, who was a close contact of the daughter, and two family members of the classmate.Senior lawmakers in the Cabinet who met Wednesday afternoon decided most Aucklanders could go back to work and school from Thursday, but they would still leave some restrictions in place until at least Monday.Genome testing has shown the family caught a more contagious variant first found in Britain.The mother who caught the disease works at a catering company that does laundry for airlines. Officials have been investigating whether there is any link to infected passengers, but so far haven't been able to find a direct connection or explain how the outbreak might have begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-ends-lockdown-after-deciding-outbreak-contained-101613545223625.html
17-02-2021||World||Israel's election sprint resembles US presidential brawl||In Israel, the sprint to the March 23 election is striking a notable resemblance to the American presidential brawl in 2020.Candidates are holding virtual events or limited in-person gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some have signed up star US advisers who faced off against each other during the contest between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and the Democrat who defeated him, President Joe Biden.As in the United States, the Israeli race is a referendum on the divisive personality at the top and his stewardship of a nation brutalized by Covid-19.Many Americans saw the choice as Trump — or almost anyone else. In Israel, the field is divided between those who are for or against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Where Trump had, “Make America Great Again,” Netanyahu implores people to, “Come back to life."The question of moral authority, too, is a common theme. As president, Trump stood accused of a multitude of wrongdoing, including sexual misconduct against more than a dozen women (he denies all of them), questions about his taxes and serial problems telling the truth. Netanyahu last week pleaded not guilty to charges of breach of trust, fraud and accepting bribes.Both men have cast themselves as victims.“It's almost verbatim,” said Alon Pinkas, Israel's former consul general in New York. "They're both victims of a 'witch hunt,' both running an entire campaign about how ‘They’re out to get me. And if they're out to get me, they're out to get you.'"But there is a key difference. While Trump suffered a solid defeat in November, Netanyahu remains Israel's most popular politician and has a strong chance of continuing his 12-year reign.That stems in part from the two countries' vastly different populations and government systems. The US is home to nearly 330 million people; Israel has just over 9 million. America is a democratic republic, where voters choose both the president and members of Congress on Election Day. Israel holds national elections where an array of political parties compete for proportionally awarded seats in the 120-member parliament, or Knesset.Since no individual party has ever won a 61-seat majority on its own, that generates relentless coalition-building to form a government.Netanyahu's Likud party is projected in all opinion polls to emerge as the largest party in the March election. But his hopes of cobbling together a government have been complicated by his legal woes, with a growing number of parties refusing to serve under a prime minister accused of serious crimes. In December, a delicate governing coalition between Netanyahu and his arch-rival collapsed after just seven months, sending the country to its fourth vote in two years.Netanyahu — unlike his close ally Trump — has taken the virus seriously and made Israel's vaccination campaign the centerpiece of his reelection bid.Late last year, he personally negotiated what has become the world's speediest coronavirus vaccination drive. As of Tuesday, nearly half of the population had received a first dose of vaccine. Nearly one-third have been inoculated twice and the level of severe infections and deaths has begun to decline.But other parts of Netanyahu's management of the pandemic have come under heavy criticism. Like Trump's key allies, a bloc of Netanyahu's core supporters, the ultra-Orthodox, are flouting safety guidelines and attending mass events in defiance of the virus threat. Public anger is pronounced, with thousands of protesters gathering outside his residence each week or toting black flags on bridges and overpasses. They want Netanyahu to step down over his legal woes and the deep economic damage caused by a series of lockdowns over the past year.In a break from Israeli tradition, Netanyahu's toughest opponents are not retired generals but former journalists. Three party leaders are former TV commentators and a fourth opponent, Gideon Saar, is married to one of the country's most famous news anchors.These media-savvy personalities, backed in some cases by American strategists, have waged impressive pandemic politicking.Lesson No. 1: Learn effective virtual campaigning, cross-post those events on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and weave them with relentless social media campaigns.Netanyahu, educated in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and deeply familiar with American politics, last month named Philadelphia native Aaron Klein his campaign manager. Klein, 40, is a former U.S radio show host and ex-Jerusalem bureau chief for Breitbart News. He was appointed by the site’s executive chairman at the time, Steven Bannon, who would later become a key strategist to Trump.The prime minister also has brought back longtime American adviser John McLaughlin, whose banner photo atop his Twitter feed features him shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump. Netanyahu used similar images in recent campaigns. But with Biden in office, he has played down the Trump connection this time around.Saar, a onetime ally of Netanyahu, is challenging the prime minister now from the right. Last month, he hired several founders of the Lincoln Project — perhaps the best-known anti-Trump group of the 2020 election — that drew Republican voters away from the president by attacking his moral authority. The group is now grappling with allegations over how it handled charges of sexual misconduct of one founder, John Weaver, who has resigned. On Tuesday, Saar's campaign said it was re-evaluating its ties with the group.The moral questions raised against Trump are similar to Saar’s message as head of the New Hope, the party he founded when he broke away from Netanyahu's Likud.Saar shares the prime minister's hard-line nationalist ideology — he's a strong proponent of West Bank settlements and favors their eventual annexation. But he's trying to create a contrast with Netanyahu, who he said has turned Likud into a “cult of personality," familiar rhetoric to anyone listening to Trump's various opponents.Saar also is making civility and decency a centerpiece of his campaign, reminiscent of Biden's approach against Trump. In an AP interview, Saar said he was “in a better position" than Netanyahu to have a positive relationship with Biden.Another Netanyahu challenger, Yair Lapid, is partnering with prominent Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. The Times of Israel reported that Lapid flew to the U.S. last month to meet personally with his longtime ally.“The situation here in Israel is crazy,” Lapid, a former anchorman, said several times during a virtual town hall February 9. “We can have a prime minister with integrity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-election-sprint-resembles-us-presidential-brawl-101613544126889.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden warns China of repercussions over human rights abuses||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned China of “repercussions” for human rights violations in Hong Kong and against minority Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.China has drawn criticism for its human rights violations such as its Hong Kong crackdown, the internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in Asia, including towards Taiwan, which China claims as its own. “We must stand up for human rights”, Biden said addressing his first town hall meeting since taking office. It was hosted by CNN in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a swing state Biden won narrowly. “What I’m doing is, making clear that, we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the UN and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.”“There will be repercussions for China and (President Xi Jinping) knows that,” Biden added, when pressed if there will be consequences for violation of human rights by China.Biden said he brought up Hong Kong and the condition of Uighurs in his recent — and first — call with the Chinese president. They spoke for two hours. “President Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan,” A White House readout of the call had said.The president did not elaborate on what the “repercussions” entail. Secretary of state Antony Blinken was more forthcoming in separate remarks in a radio interview. He indicated curbs on import of products made with use of forced labour in China and export of products to China that could be used to oppress people.The American president and his officials have faced unrelenting scrutiny of their remarks and pronouncements regarding China and the expectations are for the new administration to continue the hardline positions of the Trump administration, if not to make them tougher.“I think that president Trump was right to take a tougher line on some of the egregious things that China has done and is doing that are counter to our interests and counter to our values,” Blinken acknowledged in an interview to NPR when asked about Trump’s “hard line” on China.He added: “But I think the way that we went about doing it did not produce results.”Secretary Blinken, who has called the repression of Uighurs a “genocide”, was asked if he would support the boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in China, as has been demanded by some activists. “There are things that we can and should be doing, for example, to make sure that any products or technologies that we make are not being used to repress people, including in Xinjiang,” he said, adding, “Similarly, we ought to be able to make sure that we’re not importing things that are made with forced labour, including in Xinjiang.”The Trump administration had announced restrictions on the import of apparels, hair products and certain technologies from China which it said were made using forced labour in Xinjiang. The Biden administration could go further and ban cotton and tomato imports from Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-china-of-repercussions-over-human-rights-abuses-101613544300788.html
17-02-2021||World||US President Joe Biden suggests more police funding, no jail for drug offenders||President Joe Biden outlined changes he hopes to make to criminal justice and policing in the United States during a town hall Tuesday night, highlighting issues that his administration may tackle after Covid-19 relief.Asked how United States law enforcement could protect citizens in high crime neighborhoods while training officers to police compassionately, Biden answered "By number one, not defunding the police."Some Democrats pushed for reviews of local police budgets after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer last summer and diversion of funding to social and mental health services.Biden told the televised town hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that he would put more money into local policing."We have to put more money for this to work so we have legitimate community policing, and we are in a situation where we can change the legislation," he added.On the campaign trail, Biden promised to invest $300 million in a program that gives grants to hire more diverse officers and trains them to develop less adversarial relationships with communities.He also reiterated another campaign promise Tuesday, ending jail sentences for drug use alone."No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug, they should go to drug rehabilitation," he said."Every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night," Biden added. "Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and about to knock somebody off."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-suggests-more-police-funding-no-jail-for-drug-offenders-101613542105181.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden says China will face repercussions on human rights issues||China will pay a price for its human rights abuses, US President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday, responding to queries at a televised event on the Asian nation's handling of Muslim minorities in its far western region of Xinjiang.Chinese President Xi Jinping has drawn global criticism for holding the minority Uighurs in internment camps and other human rights abuses."Well, there will be repercussions for China and he knows that," Biden said of Xi, when pressed on the issue at the town hall event televised on broadcaster CNN.The United States will reassert its global role in speaking up for human rights, Biden said, adding that he would work with the international community to get China to protect them."China is trying very hard to become a world leader and to get that moniker and be able to do that they have to gain the confidence of other countries," Biden said on his first official trip since taking office as president in January."As long as they are engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it is going to be hard for them to do that," he added.In a two hour phone call with Xi this month, Biden emphasized the US priority of preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where the United States and China are major strategic rivals.He also voiced concern about Beijing’s "coercive and unfair" trade practices and rights issues, such as its Hong Kong crackdown, the Xinjiang internments, and increasingly assertive actions in Asia, including toward Taiwan, which China claims as its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-china-will-face-repercussions-on-human-rights-issues-101613534622206.html
17-02-2021||World||Epstein's ex-girlfriend Maxwell alleges physical abuse by guard in federal jail||Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend claimed through her lawyer Tuesday that a guard physically abused her at a federal lockup in Brooklyn, and then she was punished for complaining about it.Attorney Bobbi Sternheim wrote in a letter to a Manhattan federal judge that the abuse occurred recently at the Metropolitan Detention Center as Ghislaine Maxwell was undergoing a pat down search in her isolation cell.The lawyer said the British socialite asked that a camera be used to capture what was occurring, but a guard “replied no.'”“When Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she was threatened with disciplinary action,” Sternheim said.Days later, Maxwell was retaliated against for reporting the abuse when a guard ordered her into a shower to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom, the lawyer said. She added that Maxwell was denied a request that the encounter with the guard in the tight space be recorded.A spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment. A message seeking comment was sent to the federal Bureau of Prisons.Maxwell, 59, is awaiting a July trial on charges that she recruited three teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s and committed perjury during 2016 depositions in a civil case. She has pleaded not guilty.She has remained incarcerated without bail since July, when she was arrested almost exactly a year after Epstein was arrested to face sex trafficking charges. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail a month after his arrest.In late December, a judge rejected a USD 28.5 million bail proposal for Maxwell, saying she was a risk to flee and was not forthcoming with authorities about her finances after her arrest.As part of the bail proposal, lawyers said Maxwell had about USD 22.5 million in assets with her husband and had set aside over USD 7 million for her defense.In Tuesday's letter, Sternheim repeated assertions made before that Maxwell is being subjected to onerous conditions that include repeated searches and being awakened every 15 minutes by a light flashed into her cell when she sleeps. The lawyer said the prison is reacting to Epstein's suicide.Sternheim said Maxwell has been physically searched approximately 1,400 times in the last seven months and no contraband has ever been found despite hundreds of physical searches of the cell where she lives alone as well as her locker, legal papers, and personal effects.She said her client is under 24-hour surveillance by two-to-six guards and approximately 18 cameras, not including a hand-held camera trained on her when she is moved outside the cell.Meanwhile, harsh treatment that includes food so poorly prepared that it sometimes cannot be eaten has taken a toll, the lawyer said.“She is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight, losing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate,” Sternheim wrote. “In addition to the many difficulties impacting her review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her stamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epsteins-ex-girlfriend-maxwell-alleges-physical-abuse-by-guard-in-federal-jail-101613532760620.html
17-02-2021||World||More women at meetings, but only if they don't talk: Japan's ruling party||After a sexism row sparked by Tokyo Olympics chief's saying women talked too much at meetings, Japan's ruling party wants women at key meetings - but only if they don't talk.The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed a new plan that allows five female lawmakers to join the party's key meetings as observers.Toshihiro Nikai, the party's secretary general, said on Tuesday that he heard criticism that the party's board is male-dominated, but added that the board members are elected.But it is important for the party's female members to "look" at the party's decisionmaking process, he said."It is important to fully understand what kind of discussions are happening. Take a look, is what it is about," Nikai said at a news conference late on Tuesday.Those female observers can't speak during the meetings, but can submit opinions separately to the secretariat office, the daily newspaper Nikkei reported.Yoshiro Mori, the head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic organising committee, resigned last week after derogatory comments about women speaking too much at meetings and making them too long triggered backlash at home and abroad.The 83-year-old former prime minister's remarks are one of the examples that show how deep rooted sexism is in Japanese society.Japan is ranked 121st out of 153 countries on the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Index - the worst ranking gap among advanced countries - scoring poorly on women’s economic participation and political empowerment.This week, a group of female lawmakers at the Liberal Democratic Party asked Nikai to increase the ratio of women in key posts at the party.But requiring female observers at meetings to remain quiet has drawn criticism on social media that the party is out of touch.Twitter users say the party's male-centric view has not changed since the Mori controversy."People will just put women on them as a kind of PR exercise," Belinda Wheaton, a cultural sociologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, told Reuters."I think it’s probably time to be asking questions as to why it is that we feel that men in their 70s or 80s are able to fulfil these roles better versus a man in their 40s or 50s, or a woman," Wheaton said.Also making the rounds on social media were comments by a senior official speaking to a business lobby group who said Japan's glass ceiling was "partly women's fault".(Reporting by Ju-min Park and Chang-ran Kim; additional reporting by Mari Saito; Editing by Gerry Doyle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-women-at-meetings-but-only-if-they-don-t-talk-japan-s-ruling-party-101613529598137.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden pushes for pandemic relief in first official trip as president||President Joe Biden vowed during a prime-time televised town hall on Tuesday to accelerate the country's vaccination program and said teachers should be moved closer to the front of the line for inoculations to allow more schools to reopen.In his first official trip since taking office in January, Biden travelled to Wisconsin, a battleground state that helped propel his electoral victory over President Donald Trump, to address Americans' concerns directly and build public support for his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill."I think that we should be vaccinating teachers - we should move them up in the hierarchy," Biden said during a CNN broadcast in Milwaukee, after a parent and a teacher asked what he planned to do to permit schools to operate safely. The president noted that states, not the federal government, have the authority to decide how to prioritize vaccinations.Biden said he expected that everyone who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by July, when his administration will have secured enough shots to inoculate all Americans.With the U.S. Senate having acquitted Trump in his second impeachment trial on Saturday, the White House is eager to press ahead with Biden's agenda on the economy, fighting COVID-19, curbing climate change and addressing racial inequality.Biden wants Congress to pass his relief bill in the coming weeks in order to get $1,400 stimulus checks out to Americans and bolster unemployment payments.Tuesday's visit, as well as a trip scheduled for Thursday that will take Biden to Michigan to tour a vaccine manufacturing site, offered the president an opportunity to tout the bill's importance even as Republicans remain largely opposed to its massive price tag.Congressional Democrats have barreled ahead with the legislation, arguing that going "big" will help boost the economy and bring the pandemic under control in a country where more than 485,000 people have died from COVID-19.The number of deaths, new cases and hospitalizations has dropped in recent weeks across the country, and the pace of vaccination is slowly increasing. But thousands of Americans are still dying every day from the disease, and the economy remains fragile.Tuesday's event took place at the Pabst Theater, a landmark concert venue, where attendees were masked and spaced apart.Wisconsin had supported Democratic presidential candidates since 1988 before backing Trump in 2016, one of a handful of states that flipped Republican and helped him defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Biden narrowly carried the state in November.Biden has traveled to his home state of Delaware and to the Camp David presidential retreat since taking office on Jan. 20, but the trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city, was his first on official business since becoming president.Tuesday's travel also included Biden's first flight on the larger version of Air Force One, the presidential plane. When traveling back to Delaware, he flew on a smaller model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pushes-for-pandemic-relief-in-first-official-trip-as-president-101613532078501.html
17-02-2021||World||'Worse than my ex': Myanmar's very online youth take on the junta, coup||Their signs say it all: Myanmar's ruling junta is worse than an ex-boyfriend, fouler than fish curry, rejected by millions and more painful than a period.As they flood streets across the country in opposition to last week's military coup, a younger generation of Myanmar protesters are cracking jokes at the military's expense and winning fans on social media with their colourful, witty and often explicit signage.The situation is so bad, "even the introverts are here", as one demonstrator's poster put it."My ex is bad, but Myanmar military is worse," said another.Scorn has particularly been heaped on army chief Min Aung Hlaing, now in charge after the coup deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi."Our dreams are higher than MAL's height," read a handwritten cardboard sign -- a reference to the commander-in-chief's diminutive stature."Min Aung Hlaing I hate you more than my periods," said another held out a car window.Photos of the relatable, sly remarks have been shared thousands of times on social media, with retweets and comments from users in Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere.This social media savvy campaign "is a new, creative type of protesting for Myanmar," said Htaike Htaike Aung, executive director of Myanmar ICT for Development, a Yangon-based digital rights group."The younger generation... are on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Discord mobilizing other young people," she told AFP.Unlike previous generations largely cut off from the world during the 49 years of military rule, these younger Myanmar protesters came of age plugged into the internet zeitgeist.And they are very online.In one widely shared sign, a woman reinterpreted "WAP" -- Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's sexually-explicit summer hit -- to mean "We Are Protesting Peacefully".Many of the signs are in English, highlighting the desire to appeal to an international audience.Social media has not only spread their message, but also connected Myanmar protesters to Hong Kong and Thai users who have swapped tips on how to stay safe during demonstrations.Hard hats -- essential gear during Hong Kong's unrest -- are also becoming a signature of this movement.- Coming online -None of this would have been possible a decade ago.Before Myanmar began its democratic transition in 2011, cyber cafes dotted major cities, but Skype, Gmail and Facebook were restricted under the military-imposed isolation.Despite smartphone usage exploding around the world, only North Korea had fewer mobile phones than Myanmar, where SIM cards cost thousands of dollars.That changed in 2013, when the government ended the state monopoly on telecommunications and SIM prices plummeted while cheap, Chinese smartphones -- with Facebook preloaded -- became widely available.Eager to connect after years in the dark, the country came online virtually overnight and was soon inundated with ride hailing apps, food delivery services and money transfer platforms in an internet gold rush.Pulling the plug on all this connectivity will be hard, if not impossible, said Htaike Htaike Aung, the digital rights campaigner.The military has already tried to put a chokehold on the country's internet, but users circumvented a nationwide blackout as well as social media restrictions with VPNs, foreign SIM cards and other measures before access was restored.As one of the tongue-in-cheek signs proliferating across the country put it, the military "has messed with the wrong generation".lb/dhc/ohoFACEBOOK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-than-my-ex-myanmar-s-very-online-youth-take-on-the-junta-coup-101613528205984.html

Half will participate in a 7-week health survey.Inoculations of 3.7 million more health workers will begin in March, followed by about 36 million people aged 65 and older starting in April.

Little is publicly known about the trio.North Korea has not confirmed any Covid-19 cases, but the NIS has said an outbreak could not be ruled out as the country had active exchanges with China, where the virus first emerged, before closing the border early last year.Ri and Kim smiled as they watched the concert at Mansudae Art Theatre in the capital of Pyongyang. Unlike several previous events, nobody in the photographs published by Rodong Sinmun were wearing masks or maintaining social distancing measures.The newspaper also reported that Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, to lay wreaths for the anniversary, called the Day of the Shining Star.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-wife-makes-1st-public-appearance-in-a-year-slams-pregnancy-rumour-101613526017328.html
17-02-2021||World||Indians in UAE can now renew International Driving Permit at Indian Embassy: Report||Indian expats in the UAE can locally renew their International Driving Permit (IDP) issued in India starting Tuesday.According to Gulf News, the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi on Monday announced that it would facilitate the re-issuance of IDP to Indian nationals, which were originally issued by the relevant authorities in India with effect from February 15.The move is part of the Indian government's decision to allow Indian Embassies abroad to provide the service in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MoRTH).In an advisory related to the launch of the service posted on social media, the Embassy -- as quoted by Gulf News -- said: "Those who intend to avail of this consular service may please visit the Embassy during working hours (between 08:30 am to 12:30 pm on all working days from Sunday to Thursday) with their valid passport and expired IDP/ IDP number as well as their Indian driving license."After physical verification of the documents, it said, the applicants will be asked to submit duly filled-in Miscellaneous Consular Service Form (EAP-II), Gulf News reported further.On the subject of whether the same would be applicable for Indians living in Dubai and Notehrn Emerates or not, the Indian Consulate in Dubai confirmed to Gulf News that the same service can be done through an outsourced agency providing attestation services for Indians in Dubai and the northern emirates.A consulate spokesperson said the process, documentation and fees will remain the same for Indians living in Dubai and the northern emirates as well."However, instead of visiting the consulate, they need to visit the IVS office for document submission," he said to Gulf News.On the subject of the cost applicable, the mission said that they also have to provide Dh40 as consular service fee and Dh8 as Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) charge.The applicant would need to upload all the relevant documents along with the receipt issued by the mission in the Parivahan portal of the ministry and pay the requisite IDP fees online on the same portal.The mission explained further that on receipt of the application through the portal, the licensing authority (MoRTH), upon verification of the document shall courier the IDP, directly to the residential address of the applicant."It may be noted that the role of the embassy in this consular service is limited to the extent of facilitating submission of IDP renewal application form only. Any further correspondence pertaining to the subject, including status of the application would need to be verified directly from the authority concerned (MoRTH) in India," it added.The government of India had last year announced the plan to facilitate the renewal of IDP for citizens whose permit expired while abroad through Indian missions as there was no such mechanism earlier.The Ministry of External Affairs on Friday announced that a new consular service has been launched by Indian Missions/Posts abroad, in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for the facilitation of the issuance of International Driving Permit (IDP) to Indian nationals.According to a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, the Consular Service will be provided by Missions/Posts abroad in countries, which are signatory of the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-in-uae-can-now-renew-international-driving-permit-at-indian-embassy-101613523753357.html
17-02-2021||World||India says UN peacekeeping missions not tools for pushing political interests||The UN peacekeeping missions should not operate in perpetuity and there is urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure they do not become instruments for "furthering political interests", India, one of the largest troop-contributing countries, has said.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said the current peacekeeping operations are multi-dimensional and are called upon to not only maintain peace and security but also to facilitate the political processes, protect civilians, disarm combatants, support elections, protect and promote human rights and restore the rule of law.“Peacekeeping missions are meant to be transitional measures and not operate in perpetuity. There is an urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure that peacekeeping missions do not become instruments for furthering political interests,” he said at the General Debate on Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on Monday.Highlighting India’s perspective on priority issues in UN peacekeeping, he said performance of peacekeeping operations should be measured in relation to political and operational realities, priorities set for implementing mandate, and adequacy and appropriateness of resources.Tirumurti said India has always voiced its support for the adoption of “No National Caveats Policy” at UN peacekeeping deployments.“India believes that a caveat, whether declared or undeclared, places additional burden on those who do not have any caveats besides having an impact on performance of peacekeepers in fulfilling their mandate and safety and security,” he said.India has always called for matching mandates with adequate resources, Tirumurti said, underlining that “an under-resourced, under-equipped mission, will not only result in underperformance in mandate implementation, but will impact the credibility of UN peacekeeping as a whole”.President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said the COVID-19 pandemic has put additional challenges to the already complex peacekeeping operations. Peace operations are also supporting government-led efforts to both prevent and prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks at the country level.“Amidst these daunting challenges, it is essential that we provide peacekeeping operations with clearly defined mandates and realisable objectives, adequate resources based on a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground, as well as secure financing,” he said.Bozkir said it was crucial that the UN’s approach keeps pace with, and responds to, evolving challenges and new threats and opportunities.In this ever more complex and interconnected world, UN peace operations require constant refinement, drawing on analytical and operational capabilities, while leveraging new technology to increase their impact, he said.Tirumurti said that in the context of COVID-19, India was happy to respond to the request of UN Secretary-General and swiftly dispatch two medical teams and upgrade India’s peacekeeping hospitals in MONUSCO in Goma, DRC and in UNMISS in Juba, South Sudan.“We are working closely with our partners on the vaccine front also and make available our facilities for all humanity,” he said.India stressed that honest assessment and feedback for peacekeeping performance was essential to have an effective accountability system.“Assessing performance without determining accountability will leave us open to repeating errors,” Tirumurti said, adding that India supports the effective implementation of Integrated Performance Policy Framework, which covers all stakeholders and all phases of peacekeeping operations, and not just those on the ground.India strongly supports the SG’s Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative, which requires sustained and effective follow-up and implementation and appreciates the Secretary-General’s attention to improving safety and security of UN peacekeeping personnel.“With rising incidents of attacks, including from terrorists, and rising casualties, we need to do more to ‘protect the protectors’,” he said.India, however, voiced concern over the non-payment of cost of service rendered by the Troop and Police Contributing Countries to the “closed” peacekeeping missions, saying this “unresolved” issue requires resolution and considered attention.According to a UN statement, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the current session sends a powerful message in support of peacekeeping personnel facing complex challenges in the field amid the pandemic.Tirumurti asserted that India will push for the presence of more women in peacekeeping.With more than one million men and women having served under the UN flag in more than 70 peacekeeping operations over the past seven decades, Tirumurti recalled the “pioneering” efforts of India, especially the first all-women UN police peacekeeping contingent in Liberia – in the backdrop of “our own history of forming the first all-women Rani of Jhansi regiment of the Indian National Army of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during India’s fight for independence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-says-un-peacekeeping-missions-not-tools-for-pushing-political-interests-101613522285186.html
17-02-2021||World||Missing Dubai princess Sheikha Latifa says she is a hostage: Report||A daughter of Dubai's powerful ruler who tried to flee the country in 2018 only to be detained by commandos in a boat off India has re-emerged in new videos published Tuesday, saying she doesn't know if she's “going to survive this situation.”The videos released by the BBC show Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum at a “jail villa,” apparently located in the skyscraper-studded city-state in the United Arab Emirates. Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also serves as the prime minister and vice president in the hereditarily ruled UAE.“I'm a hostage,” the sheikha says in one video. "This villa has been converted into jail.“I can't even go outside to get any fresh air,” she also said.The government's Dubai Media Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.In 2018, the AP reported how a friend and an ex-French spy helped Sheikha Latifa escape by boat, only to be captured off India.The BBC said Sheikha Latifa recorded the videos in a bathroom at the villa over months on a phone she secretly received about a year after her capture.“I don't know when I'll be released and what the conditions will be like when I'm released,” she says in a video. “Every day I am worried about my safety and my life.”The videos, part of an episode of BBC's “Panorama” investigative series being broadcast Tuesday, also include an interview with Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Robinson appeared in photos with Latifa published by Emirati officials after the sheikha's return to Dubai in 2018.Robinson told the BBC that she had been misled by Emirati authorities who told her Latifa was a troubled young woman safe in the care of her family.“I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public,” Robinson told the BBC. "That was a total surprise.... I was absolutely stunned.”The dramatic would-be sea escape and its aftermath intruded into the carefully controlled image maintained by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, who is believed to have several dozen children from multiple wives. Some of his sons and daughters figure prominently in local media and online, but others are rarely seen. Sheikha Latifa was widely known for her love of skydiving prior to 2018.Sheikh Mohammed's family life again became a public matter in 2020. Then, a British judge ruled the sheikh had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, one of them Sheikha Latifa. The ruling came in a custody battle between Sheikh Mohammed and estranged wife Princess Haya, daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan.Sheikh Mohammed is the founder of the successful Godolphin horse-racing stable and on friendly terms with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. In 2019, he received a trophy from the queen after one of his horses won a race at Royal Ascot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-dubai-princess-sheikha-latifa-says-she-is-a-hostage-report-101613521623124.html
17-02-2021||World||Death of 14th Dalai Lama could spark religious crisis in Asia||As only a few years are left for Dalai Lama to turn 90-year-old, there are fears among the international community that his death could spark a religious crisis in Asia.The Buddhist figure, who is currently 85-year-old, had earlier announced that upon turning 90 he will decide whether he should be reincarnated.According to CNN, while the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is reportedly still in good health, questions over his succession are growing, along with fears that his death could lead to a religious crisis in Asia.The Chinese government occupied Tibet in 1950 and has ever since tried to control the region.The Dalai Lama, whom China views as overseer of an "evil clique" that seeks to split Tibet from China, escaped to India in 1959 and the 10th Panchen Lama (Lobsang Trinley Lhundrup Choekyi Gyaltsen) stayed behind in Tibet. He spoke against Chinese rule many times and wrote a report chronicling Tibet's famines in the 1960s.In recent years, China has intensified its efforts to eradicate the Dalai Lama from the religious lives of Tibetans to crush their identity. During a meeting, Mao Zedong had told the 14th Dalai Lama, that "religion is poison."According to CNN, over the years, the Dalai Lama has floated a number of options for his reincarnation, including picking a new successor himself in India, rather than in Tibet -- and has even toyed with the idea of a woman taking on the role.Meanwhile, the experts have opined that there are probabilities of choosing two separate Dalai Lamas -- one in China and another in India.The Chinese government's State Religious Affairs Bureau had published a document in 2007 laying out "management measures" for the reincarnation of living Tibetan Buddhas.According to the document, the reincarnations of Tibetan religious figures must be approved by Chinese government authorities, and those with "particularly great impact" must be approved by the State Council, China's top civil administration body currently led by Premier Li Keqiang, CNN noted.However, the Dalai Lama has stated that if he chooses to reincarnate, the responsibility for finding the 15th Dalai Lama will be on the Gaden Phodrang Trust, an India-based group he had founded after going into exile.Tenzin Tseten, a research fellow at the Dharamsala-based Tibet Policy Institute, was quoted as saying that the Dalai Lama is of great significance to the Tibetans and a symbol of their "nationalism and identity.""The Tibetan people will never accept a CCP-appointed the Dalai Lama," Tenzin emphasised.While China continues with its policies to eradicate the Dalai Lama from the lives of Tibetans by bringing the religious institution under its control, the US has threatened to sanction the Chinese government officials who chose a reincarnation of the Dalai Lama over the wishes of the Tibetan people.

17-02-2021||World||Hospitals still ration medical N95 masks as stockpiles swell: Report||One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of medical-grade N95 face masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage, yet doctors and nurses say there still aren’t enough to keep them safe.An Associated Press investigation found a logistical breakdown at the heart of the perceived mask shortage, rooted in federal failures to coordinate supply chains and provide hospitals with clear rules about how to manage their medical equipment.Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, federal regulators, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses and others risking exposure to COVID-19 of first-rate protection.In Fort Worth, Texas, medical-grade mask manufacturer Prestige Ameritech’s warehouse is piled high with cases of N95s. It can churn out 1 million every four days. But there aren’t orders for nearly that many, so Prestige recently got government approval to export them.“I’m drowning in these respirators,” owner Mike Bowen said.Meanwhile, Mary Turner, a COVID-19 intensive care nurse at a hospital outside Minneapolis, strapped on the one disposable N-95 respirator allotted for her entire shift.Before the coronavirus pandemic, Turner threw out her mask after each patient to prevent the spread of disease. Now she wears one mask from each infected person to the next because N95s — which filter out 95% of infectious particles — have supposedly been in short supply since last March.Turner’s employer, North Memorial Health, said in a statement that supplies have stabilized, but the company is still limiting use because “we must remain mindful of that supply” to ensure everyone’s safety.Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability.Before the pandemic, medical providers followed guidelines that called for N95s to be discarded after each use. As the masks ran short, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modified guidelines to allow for extended use and reuse if supplies are “depleted,” a term left undefined.Hospitals have responded in a variety of ways, the AP has found. Some are back to pre-COVID-19, one-use-per-patient N95 protocols, but most are doling out one mask a day or fewer to each employee. Many hospital procurement officers say they are following guidelines for depleted supplies, even if their own stockpiles are robust.Chester “Trey” Moeller, a political appointee who served as the CDC’s deputy chief of staff until President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month, said efforts to increase US mask production succeeded, but the government has failed to connect new suppliers with customers.“We are forcing our health care industry to reuse sanitized N95s or even worse, wear one N95 all day long,” he said.Before the pandemic, the US demand for N95s was 1.7 billion per year, with 20% for medical use, trade groups say. In 2021, demand for medical use is estimated by industry sources to be 5.7 billion.Manufacturers like Bowen stepped in to fill the need.Still, many hospitals are restricting masks for workers while building their stockpiles over fears of a future COVID-19 surge.The AP spoke with a dozen procurement officers who buy supplies for more than 300 hospitals, and all said they have enough N95s now, between two and 12 months worth, sitting in storage.Even so, all but two are limiting workers to one mask per day, or even one per week.To boost domestic supply, the federal agency that oversees N95 manufacturers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has approved 94 new brands, including 19 domestic manufacturers, according to the internal government emails.But in December, Moeller, an appointee of President Donald Trump, grew frustrated.“(NIOSH) had approved almost 20 US manufacturers to make N95 masks, but had not published any guidance or notice of what is ultimately more than 100 million N95 mask-making capacity a month going unsold,” Moeller told the AP.The Food and Drug Administration was monitoring N95 supply chains, and received $80 million in emergency pandemic funds “to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus.” Of that amount, about $38 million was for efforts related to tracking medical product shortages.But the agency has still not solved the problem. “There have been a good number of new NIOSH (mask) approvals that have been granted,” said Suzanne Schwartz, director of the FDA’s Office of Strategic Partnerships & Technology Innovation. “Yet the access to those new manufacturers, there seems to be a hurdle there. FDA ... is trying to identify that blockage.”The internal emails show that Moeller in December alerted NIOSH head Dr. John Howard about the unused US N95s.In a Dec. 22 email, Howard acknowledged he was still hearing of shortages: “Apparently, there is a significant domestic production capacity going unused for the lack of orders and we have tried to address this supplier/purchaser disconnect.”NIOSH was not actively promoting the new mask producers, Howard wrote, saying that “to avoid the perception of inequitable treatment and because of the dynamic production landscape, we have not posted information on our website regarding respirator availability.”Howard, through an agency spokesperson, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, NIOSH also acknowledged “a supply and demand disconnect” exists and said it is working to better connect purchasers with US-made masks.Meanwhile, the US finds itself in a paradox. The more N95s are rationed to alleviate a perceived shortage, the fewer masks are actually reaching the front lines.Dr. Robert Hancock, an emergency room doctor and president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said hospitals are taking risks by rationing N95s, even when they have enough. He said some doctors tell him they get one N95 mask every five to seven days.“All the N95s currently out there were designed to be worn once. They were never designed to be reused,” Hancock said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitals-still-ration-medical-n95-masks-as-stockpiles-swell-report-101613519988965.html
17-02-2021||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi faces new charge as crackdown intensifies||Police in Myanmar filed a new charge against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her lawyer said Tuesday, in a move that may allow her to be held indefinitely without trial as part of an intensifying crackdown by authorities who seized power in a coup.Suu Kyi, who was deposed and detained in the military takeover on Feb. 1, already faced a charge of illegally possessing walkie-talkies — an apparent attempt to provide a legal veneer for her house arrest. Under the new charge, she is accused of breaking a law that has been used to prosecute people who have violated coronavirus restrictions, lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after meeting with a judge in a court in the capital, Naypyitaw.It carries a maximum punishment of three years in prison. But, perhaps more worryingly, because of changes to the Penal Code instituted by the junta last week, it could allow her to be detained indefinitely, even without a court's permission. Suu Kyi’s lawyer told reporters he has not seen her since her arrest — and only arrived after an unexpected videoconference the judge said had been held with her.The legal maneuver comes two weeks after the military seized power in a coup that shocked many in the international community who had been hopeful that Myanmar was taking steps toward democracy. Since then, the junta has ratcheted up the pressure on protesters resisting the takeover, including violently breaking up some demonstrations and blocking internet access.“We have called for charges against her to be dropped, for her to be released," United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.He stressed that adding a new charge against Suu Kyi doesn't change that demand and “our firm denunciation" of the military overturning the “democratic will of the people" and arresting political leaders, activists and peaceful protesters.On Monday, security forces pointed guns at a group of 1,000 demonstrators and attacked them with slingshots and sticks in the city of Mandalay. Local media reported that police also fired rubber bullets into a crowd and that a few people were injured.Protests continued Tuesday in Yangon, the country's largest city, and elsewhere. In Yangon, police blocked off the street in front of the Central Bank, which protesters have targeted amid speculation online that the military is seeking to seize money from it. Buddhist monks demonstrated outside the U.N.'s local office in the city.Around 3,000 demonstrators — mainly students — returned to the streets of Mandalay, carrying posters of Suu Kyi and shouting for the return of democracy.The protests are taking place in defiance of an order banning gatherings of five or more people. But the security presence was low-key around the march after Monday's confrontations.State media have been acknowledging the protest movement only indirectly. The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported about a meeting of the State Administration Council, the new top governing body, and quoted its chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, saying the authorities “are handling the ongoing problems with care.”It said the council discussed taking legal action against protesters and providing “true information” to the media. On Sunday and Monday nights, the military ordered an internet blackout — almost entirely blocking online access. Once before in recent weeks it imposed a similar blackout and has also tried less successfully to block social media platforms. It has also prepared a draft law that would criminalize many online activities.While the military did not say why the internet was blocked, there is widespread speculation that the government is installing a firewall system to allow it to monitor or block most or all online activity.The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper also reported that council members discussed acting against a “parallel government" established by some elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, who were prevented from taking their seats when the military stopped Parliament from opening its session Feb. 1.In the days following the takeover, members of Suu Kyi's party formed a committee, declaring themselves the true representatives of Myanmar's people and asking for international recognition. No such recognition has come, even as the United States and other governments have condemned the coup and urged the military to return power to the elected government and release Suu Kyi and other detainees.Neighboring China, meanwhile, has so far not condemned the takeover. Some protesters have accused Beijing — which has long been Myanmar’s main arms supplier and has major investments in the country — of propping up the junta.China's ambassador to the Southeast Asian country responded to those accusations, noting that Beijing has friendly relations with both Suu Kyi’s party and the military, according to the text of an interview posted on the embassy's Facebook page Tuesday. Chen Hai said he wished the two sides could solve their differences through dialogue.In the interview, Chen also addressed what he said were rumors that China was helping Myanmar to control its internet traffic and others that Chinese soldiers were showing up on the Myanmar's streets.“For the record, these are completely nonsense and even ridiculous accusations,” Chen said.The military contends there was fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide, and says it will hold power for a year before holding new elections. The state election commission found no evidence to support the claims of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-faces-new-charge-as-crackdown-intensifies-101613518493099.html
17-02-2021||World||Texas power plants shut by cold; left pipes exposed to elements||Texas blackouts triggered by frozen power infrastructure have left many wondering why the state’s electricity generators weren’t prepared for the cold.The short answer: They aren’t required to cold-proof their assets. While generators in chillier regions are typically compelled by federal or state rules to protect their plants from the elements, Texas plants can leave their pipes, valves and pressure gauges exposed. It’s cheaper that way.“The power plants in the Northeast, we put exterior closures around it,” said Michael Webber, the chief science and technology officer at Engie, and an energy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They wrap a building around the plant.”While Texas’s grid operator has called for generators to winterize their facilities after a 2011 cold snap also led to blackouts, it can’t force the companies to do so, said Adrian Shelley, Texas office director of the advocacy group Public Citizen.“From a generator perspective, the only incentive is to bring energy to market as cheaply as possible,” Shelley said. “Those sorts of investments aren’t recouped in any other way but by selling energy.”More than 45 gigawatts of Texas electricity capacity has been shut this week, in many cases because the instrumentation froze over, according to the state’s grid operator. Natural gas, coal, wind and even nuclear facilities have gone dark because of the cold and wind turbines have stopped because of ice on the blades.In West Texas, wellheads have frozen, curbing natural gas supplies bound for power plants. While fieldworkers in frigid North Dakota are used to cold-proofing -- for example, using winterized chemicals for fracking, setting up heaters to keep equipment warm and installing chains on all trucks -- Texans aren’t accustomed to it.“Some of it too is just the cost of capital,” said Joseph Triepke, founder of the industry research firm Infill Thinking. “We’re all trying to run so lean, and this kind of weather is a once-every-several-years or more kind of thing. You’re just not going to invest in having that winterization infrastructure on hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-plants-shut-by-cold-left-pipes-exposed-to-elements-101613518507054.html
17-02-2021||World||UK identifies 1.7 million more people at high Covid risk||The UK government identified an extra 1.7 million people in England at serious risk of coronavirus after using a new computer model that takes into account age, ethnicity and body mass index as well as medical conditions.Of the new cohort, those over 70 have already been invited for vaccination and 820,000 adults will now be prioritized for the shot “as soon as possible,” the Department of Health said Tuesday in a statement.The findings expand to almost 4 million the number of people asked to “shield” from the virus by staying at home, as the government strives to protect Britons from a pandemic that’s already cost more than 117,000 lives. All those shielding have been asked to do so until the end of March.More than 15.5 million people in the UK have had their first dose of the vaccine, and it is now being rolled out to people under 70 and those with certain clinical conditions.Road mapPrime Minister Boris Johnson hopes the vaccine roll out will help unlock national lockdown restrictions that have been in place since early January. Speculation is growing in Westminster over which sectors will see curbs eased and when, ahead of his statement on a “road map” on Feb. 22.The government’s new “predictive risk” model was developed following research at Oxford University that looked at the factors involved with Covid-19 deaths in the first wave.It will help the National Health Service to identify “further individuals who may be at high risk from Covid-19 due to a combination of personal and health factors,” Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, said in the statement.Positive impactOfficials reported evidence Tuesday that the vaccination program is having an impact. A report from the Office for National Statistics showed people over 80 years old -- one of the highest priority groups -- were the most likely to test positive for Covid antibodies in England.The analysis estimated that 40.9% of people aged 80 or older had antibodies during the four-week period leading to Feb. 1, “most likely due to the high vaccination rate in this group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-identifies-1-7-million-more-people-at-high-covid-risk-101613518596631.html
17-02-2021||World||TikTok accused of failing to protect children from 'inappropriate' content||The European Consumer Organisation BEUC has filed complaints on Tuesday (local time) against Chinese-owned short video app TikTok over breaching European Union (EU) consumer rights and failing to protect children from hidden advertising and inappropriate content.According to an official statement issued by the European Consumer Organisation BEUC, a complaint has been filed with the EU and the network of consumer protection authorities against TikTok.Meanwhile, consumer organisations in as many as 15 countries have demanded their authorities to investigate TikTok's conduct.The European Consumer Organisation has said that the social media app has failed to protect children and teenagers from hidden advertising and potentially harmful content on its platform."TikTok's marketing offers to companies who want to advertise on the app contributes to the proliferation of hidden marketing. Users are for instance triggered to participate in branded hashtag challenges where they are encouraged to create the content of specific products. As popular influencers are often the starting point of such challenges the commercial intent is usually masked for users. TikTok is also potentially failing to conduct due diligence when it comes to protecting children from inappropriate content such as videos showing suggestive content which are just a few scrolls away," the statement said.It termed TikTok's practices for the processing of users' personal data as "misleading" as the app "does not inform its users, especially in a way comprehensible to children and teenagers, about what personal data is collected, for what purpose and for what legal reason".It stated that one of TikTok's features is that the users can purchase coins that they can use for virtual gifts for TikTok celebrities whose performance they like."TikTok's 'Virtual Item Policy' which manages this feature contains "unfair terms and misleading practices". TikTok claims, for instance, an absolute right to modify the exchange rate between the coins and the gifts, potentially skewing the financial transaction in its own favour," the statement added.In recent months, TikTok has come under flare for its policies.Earlier, US lawmakers had raised concerns over potential risks to data collection. Donald Trump, then President, had even sought to overhaul how TikTok operated in the US, but the deal was left unfinished before he left office, The Hill stated.Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said, "Broadly speaking, we are comprehensively evaluating ... risks to US data including from TikTok and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion."However, unlike the US, Europe has stricter regulations on data privacy.According to The Hill, under the General Data Protection Regulation law, which was implemented in 2018, companies are required to state what data is collected and for what purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-accused-of-failing-to-protect-children-from-inappropriate-content-101613516960567.html

Mitch McConnell at its helm," Trump said in a statement."Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again."His comments come after McConnell said on Saturday that even though he had voted to acquit Trump at his impeachment trial, the former president was nevertheless "practically and morally responsible" for the January 6 storming of the US Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-urges-republicans-to-dump-senate-leader-mcconnell-101613513675003.html
17-02-2021||World||Twitter star to vaccine tsar: Japan's Taro Kono's moment in the spotlight||Japan's recently appointed vaccine tsar, Taro Kono, is having a breakout moment.Twitter-savvy and educated at Georgetown University in Washington, Kono has seen his popularity surge even as the government of his boss, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, has been battered by criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.Two recent opinion polls have favoured Kono, who is also the minister for administrative reform, to be the next prime minister. As Japan launches its much awaited Covid-19 vaccination campaign, his role as the logistics head of the programme has thrust him even more firmly into the spotlight.Part of Kono's attraction, in a nation known for wooden, script-following leaders, is his ability to engage directly with voters through social media, a sharp contrast to Suga, who has been criticised for seeming stiff and aloof from voters.In recent weeks, Kono, 58, has used Twitter to publish videos on vaccine safety, repost memes and address media reports. He frequently responds directly to followers - 2.2 million on his Japanese account and 50,000 for his English one.Last week he posted about conferences with governors over the coronavirus, and a black mask embroidered with a dinosaur skull he had worn the previous day.But for all his appeal to voters and a resume that includes foreign and defence minister, some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which he would lead as premier, are wary."He speaks English, he's smart, he's got a media presence, and he uses social media, so that's kind of appealing," said Scott Seaman, Asia director at the Eurasia Group in Washington. "But he would still have to run the LDP. And that's a skill."Given the LDP's majority in parliament, its leader is virtually guaranteed the premiership. Only two LDP presidents have failed to be premier during brief spells when the party was out of power - including Kono's father, Yohei.Some say his father's being denied the top job may have helped feed the son's ambition for the post.Kono declined a direct answer on Tuesday about whether he could work with the party if he became premier, with his current job a possible step towards that end."My job is the health of the Japanese people, let's not politicise this job," he told a news conference. "It's too important to politicise."Some in the LDP feel he is too young, given the average age since 2000 for premiers to take office is roughly 62. But their concerns also include his lone-wolf character in a land that runs on consensus, as well as an outspoken streak and occasional divergence from the standard line.Last month Kono told Reuters that "anything is possible" regarding the Tokyo Olympics, breaking with government vows that the Games, already postponed once, will open as planned in July.Last year, as defence minister, he suddenly cancelled deployment of the U.S.-made Aegis Ashore missile defence system without consulting others beforehand, a move that an LDP official said may have angered key ally the United States."I wonder if he can build a good relationship with the U.S. as a result," said the official, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.The faction-ridden LDP could prove difficult to run. Its tolerance of mavericks such as the wildly popular Junichiro Koizumi, premier from 2001 to 2006, has diminished in recent years, said political commentator Atsuo Ito."His bluntness will likely go over well with voters, but I'm not sure how well it'd work running a big organisation," added Ito.Kono's popularity, though, may prove hard for the LDP to resist and was likely part of Suga's calculus in putting him in charge of the vaccine rollout, to gain some support himself, political analysts said, although they wondered if Suga was also trying to neutralise a political rival.With a general election looming by October and the LDP chief's term expiring in September, putting Kono in the top job could bring big benefits for LDP candidates. But pitfalls remain, including Japan's rollout of the coronavirus vaccine."This is a gamble," the LDP official said. "If the vaccine doesn't go as planned, it's the end for both Suga and Kono."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-star-to-vaccine-tsar-japan-s-taro-kono-s-moment-in-the-spotlight-101613513689946.html
17-02-2021||World||'The path to diplomacy is open right now' with Iran, says US' Blinken||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday "the path to diplomacy is open right now" with Iran over its 2015 nuclear deal but would not address whether the Biden administration has had any direct engagement with Iranian officials."The path to diplomacy is open right now. Iran is still a ways away from being in compliance (with the deal). So we'll have to see what it does," Blinken told National Public Radio according to a transcript provided by the broadcaster.Asked if there was any move under way to resume direct diplomacy, Blinken pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden's public stance that if Iran resumes compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal the United States would do so too."The president's been very clear publicly, repeatedly, about where we stand. And we'll see what, if any, reaction Iran has to that," he said.The interviewer noted Blinken had not directly answered the question and asked: "but you're not ruling out that direct diplomacy might be somewhere in the future here?"Blinken responded: "Well, at some point, presumably, if there's going to be any engagement on this, that would have to require diplomacy. That's what we're in the business of."In 2018, former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal, which limited Iran's uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms - an ambition Iran has long denied having - in return for the easing of U.S. and other sanctions.When Trump left the deal, which Iran struck with six major powers, he reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy.In response, Tehran has breached the deal's key limits, enriching uranium to 20% - above a 3.67% cap but below the 90% needed for weapons - expanding its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and using advanced centrifuges for enrichment.Iran has told the U.N. nuclear watchdog it will scale back cooperation with it in a week, ratcheting up protests against U.S. sanctions still choking its economy.
