President Emmanuel Macron's office were among the callers who wished her well.Born on Feb. 11, 1904, Sister Andre has witnessed two global pandemics. She was a young teenager when the Spanish flu struck, infecting an estimated one third of the world's population between 1918 and 1920.Her brother died, one of at least 50 million lives lost during that pandemic, but she escaped infection.Sister Andre tested positive for coronavirus on Jan. 16 but displayed no symptoms."No, I wasn’t scared because I wasn’t scared to die ... I’m happy to be with you, but I would wish to be somewhere else – join my big brother and my grandfather and my grandmother," she told BFM TV earlier this week.Sister Andre is the world's second-oldest living person according to the Gerontology Research Group. The oldest is Japan's Kane Tanaka, who is 118.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europes-oldest-person-celebrates-117th-birthday-after-beating-covid19-101613066687422.html
11-02-2021||World||Democrats seek to show Trump was indifferent to Capitol assault||House prosecutors are completing their case in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial by focusing on what they say is the former president’s lack of remorse over the Jan. 6 storming of the US Capitol and his lack of concern for Vice President Mike Pence and others put at risk.Democrats began their presentation during the third day of the trial focusing on the words of the insurrectionists, which House managers said show they were following the marching orders of Trump.“Their own statements before, during and after the attack make clear the attack was done for Donald Trump, at his instructions and to fulfill his wishes,” said Representative Diana DeGette, one of the nine House managers. “They truly believed that the whole intrusion was at the president’s orders.”Also Read | Biden says phone call with Xi Jinping lasted two hoursThe House managers intend to follow Wednesday’s stunning video footage of the Capitol’s ransacking by applying that and other evidence to the legal issues that apply in a constitutional impeachment, according to aides who briefed reporters. Trump’s defense will offer their arguments on Friday and may only need one day, which could lead to the trial finishing on Saturday.In remarks to Politico on Wednesday night, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville recounted that a previously reported call he received that day from Trump occurred as rioters were moving toward the Senate, and he told Trump that Pence had just been evacuated. Trump was tweeting criticism of Pence for refusing to illegally reject Electoral College votes being counted before the riot.President Joe Biden, who has avoided comment on the impeachment proceedings, said in brief comments to reporters Thursday that “some minds may have been changed” by the vivid case presented by House impeachment managers.“I, like other Americans, watched the news. I didn’t watch any of the hearing live,” Biden said. “The Senate has a very important job to complete and I think -- my guess is -- some minds may have been changed but I don’t know.”Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, suggested the prosecution was futile, with most of his Republican colleagues already decided against conviction. He said he had assured the former president “the case is over” and “it’s just a matter of getting the final verdict.”House managers used the second day of Trump’s impeachment trial Wednesday to detail a months-long campaign by the former president to stoke hatred and encourage violence over the election results that they said culminated in the mob attack on the US Capitol that he then did little to stop.Using previously unreleased videos and audio, the Democratic lawmakers vividly showed senators how close the rioters came to reaching them, as well as Pence. Senators in the chamber listened in rapt silence as the recordings played.The impeachment managers depicted the assault as not only foreseeable but the intended result of a multitude of actions calculated to incite Trump’s followers. The strategy appeared designed to rebut defense efforts to cast his fiery speech before the assault as normal political hyperbole and to persuade the public that his actions were premeditated and cynical.The step-by-step timeline House impeachment managers offered set the Jan. 6 violence in the context of months of Trump tweets inflaming tensions even before the election. It was, they said, a “big lie” of baseless claims of election fraud, armed intimidation of state and local election officials, and violence at demonstrations in Washington in December. They stressed Trump’s role in promoting the rally on the day of the electoral count, the timing of his speech just ahead of the congressional session and his remarks pointing the crowd toward the Capitol.Also Read | Chilling video clips of Capitol siege aired at Trump impeachment trial“This was never about one speech,” Representative Eric Swalwell of California, one of the nine House impeachment managers, said. “He built this mob over many months with repeated messaging until they believed that they’d been robbed of their vote and they would do anything to stop the certification.”Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, another impeachment manager, said the people who laid siege to the Capitol “did it because Donald Trump sent them on this mission” to stop the peaceful transfer of power.Democrats portrayed Trump as indifferent to the harrowing ordeal his own vice president, lawmakers and police were undergoing, even as the violence and mayhem was broadcast live on television, and did nothing to protect lawmakers and others at the Capitol for hours, failing to call in the National Guard. They highlighted news reports quoting associates saying that the former president was initially “delighted” by the attack.“Senators, you’ve seen all the evidence so far, and this is clear: on Jan. 6, President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead,” Texas Representative Joaquin Castro said.The dramatic presentation may have more impact on public opinion than the eventual verdict in the trial. The odds still are against 17 Republicans joining with Democrats and independents to form the two-thirds majority of the Senate necessary to convict Trump. Only six Republicans voted with Democrats on Tuesday to proceed with the trial.Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who was among the GOP lawmakers who voted to block certification of electoral votes from two states on the day of the attack, called the footage shown in the trial “horrific.” But he said the House impeachment managers didn’t connect the violence to Trump.“They spent a great deal of time focusing on the horrific acts of violence that were played out by the criminals, but the language from the president doesn’t come close to meeting the legal standard for incitement,” Cruz told reporters.Still, several Republicans acknowledged the power of the House Democrats’ arguments.“They had a strong presentation put together in a way that I think makes it very compelling,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 GOP leader, said. He didn’t rule out voting for conviction, saying he would listen to both sides “and draw conclusions when it’s all done.”Trump lawyer Bruce Castor told reporters as he left the Capitol Wednesday night that ”we didn’t learn anything today that we didn’t already know.”“Yesterday, we said we didn’t dispute that the breach of the Capitol is a terrible thing, and that mob violence is something that President Trump abhors,” he said, adding, “I wonder why we sat through eight hours of videos that aren’t under dispute.”Trump’s team intends to rely heavily on his use of the words “peacefully and patriotically” at one point in the Jan. 6 speech as part of his defense against the impeachment charge of incitement, according to people familiar with the effort. They also plan to show videos of prominent Democrats using similar rhetoric about fighting to argue Trump is being subjected to a double standard.Representative Madeleine Dean, another impeachment manager, anticipating the argument, said that Trump only used the word “peacefully” once in the 11,000-word speech, while urging on followers with the words “fight” or “fighting” 20 times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-seek-to-show-trump-was-indifferent-to-capitol-assault-101613066068895.html
11-02-2021||World||Chilling video clips of Capitol siege aired at Trump impeachment trial||New video footage presented on Wednesday by the House impeachment managers showed in chilling detail how close the January 6 pro-Trump rioters had come to lawmakers inside the US Capitol.Video and audio clips also showed police officers had begged for help, overwhelmed by the surging and violent rioters.The rioters were seen roaming the hallways of the Capitol building looking for top officials. They called out for former vice-president Mike Pence — to “hang” him — and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — “Nancy? Where are you, Nancy?”“You were just 58 steps away” from that mob, Representative Eric Swalwell, one of the nine House impeachment managers, told the senators on Day 2 of the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.Majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, was seen being led up a ramp by his security detail in one clip from January 6, which in the next instant, showed them hurrying back the same way, surprised perhaps by the incoming mob.In another video clip, Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican, and an aide were seen being redirected by a Capitol police officer. They were, in fact, headed in the direction of the incoming mob. “I was very fortunate indeed that Officer (Eugene) Goodman was there to get me in the right direction,” Romney told reporters later.Another video showed former vice-president Pence and his family, who had accompanied him to the US Capitol that day, being led to safety down a stairwell.House managers used a mix of footage from old videos and those from US Capitol’s security cameras that had not been seen before. They played without sound, slogans and profanities that have come to make up the soundtrack for all other videos seen thus far.On day two of Trump’s trial, the House managers made their case meticulously, showing how the former president had incited his supporters in the weeks leading up to the insurrection, urged them to march to the Capitol, riled them up against Pence and then refused to stop them.“Senators, you’ve seen all the evidence so far,” Representative Joaquin Castro, one of the impeachment managers, said towards the end of the eight-hour long presentation. “And this is clear: On January 6th, President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead.”Though chilling and detailed, it wasn’t clear if the House managers’ presentation had persuaded enough Republicans to convict Trump. They will try again, on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chilling-video-clips-of-capitol-siege-aired-at-trump-impeachment-trial-101613065398629.html

Police set up a reunification center for family members at a community center.Farther south, in Austin, more than two dozen vehicles were involved in a pileup on an icy road, and one person was injured, emergency officials said.Elsewhere, ice storm warnings were in effect from Arkansas to Kentucky, while another winter storm was predicted to bring snow to Mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said.More than 125,000 homes and businesses were without electricity Thursday morning, largely in Kentucky and West Virginia, according to the website poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.Meanwhile, officials in central Kentucky were urging people to stay home due to icy conditions.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said state offices would be closed due to the weather. He declared a state of emergency, which he said would free up funding and help agencies coordinate as they respond to reports of slick roads and downed power lines.Crews were responding to numerous calls of downed icy tree limbs and power lines, Lexington police said in a tweet that urged people not to travel “unless absolutely necessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-5-killed-in-massive-crash-on-icy-texas-interstate-101613062221058.html

11-02-2021||World||Iran’s last atomic gambit could make crafting a bomb harder||Iran’s decision to cast its stockpile of 20% enriched uranium into metal for a research reactor reduces the risk that the Islamic Republic will move swiftly to build an atomic bomb, according to Robert Kelley, a US nuclear-weapons engineer and former senior inspections official.The International Atomic Energy Agency reported late Wednesday that Iran took another step to bring the country further out of compliance with its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers. The country produced 3.6 grams of natural uranium metal -- about the size of an eraser on a pencil -- at its fuel plate fabrication facility on Feb. 6, according to a restricted two-page document seen by Bloomberg.The move witnessed by IAEA inspectors is the first toward fuel production at a facility in Esfahan. Iran outlined last month how it will turn its stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium into metal plates for its research reactor, which in turn produces isotopes used for medicine and industry.“They are taking material out of the pipeline,” said Kelley, the former manager of the US Department of Energy’s centrifuge and plutonium metallurgy programs at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “It takes the uranium out of the weapons-usable inventory.”Iran Outlines Bid for Stockpile of 20% Enriched UraniumIran has been ratcheting up pressure since early December, when its parliament passed a law ordering engineers to begin enriching uranium at higher levels and then cast the metal into fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor.But the activities don’t just make reviving the moribund nuclear agreement harder for the Biden administration, which is open to doing so once Iran returns to compliance. They also could make it tougher for Iran -- which wants the US to first lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration -- to sprint toward weaponization, according to Kelley.Most of Iran’s current enriched-uranium stockpile is held in gaseous form, where it can be run through cascades of centrifuges at short notice. Those machines, which spin at supersonic speeds, separate the uranium-235 isotope required to set off the chain reactions in power plants and bombs. Most nuclear weapons use uranium enriched to 90% purity. Iran’s stockpile is between 3% and 20% enriched.Iran told IAEA inspectors that they intend to mix their uranium metal with silicon in order to produce uranium silicide fuel, a source of energy used in atomic energy for decades that typically takes the form of small pellets.“This is hardly an enabling step for a weapon,” Kelley said. “A uranium-silicon compound is very unsuitable for further enrichment in a centrifuge.”The assessment could give the Biden administration space to engage with Iran as the clock ticks toward the next deadline on Feb. 21 -- the day when IAEA inspectors have been told they’ll have some monitoring powers curtailed unless US sanctions are lifted.“Until that day, Iran continues to be subject to full IAEA monitoring, which allows good insight into Iran’s fuel-cycle activities,” said Andreas Persbo, a nuclear nonproliferation analyst who is research director at the European Leadership Network. Even though casting uranium into metal could complicate a sprint toward a weapon, the message Iran is sending is still troubling.“The Iranians are masters of operating in the gray zone,” Persbo said. “They are hewing to the letter of their safeguards agreement, but it’s clear this isn’t the kind of behavior that is desirable or expected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-last-atomic-gambit-could-make-crafting-a-bomb-harder-101613060803903.html
11-02-2021||World||Democrats to focus on 'terrible toll' of Capitol riot in Trump impeachment trial||Democrats making the case that Donald Trump should be convicted of inciting the deadly siege at the US Capitol will focus on Thursday on the damage wrought in the rampage and the former president's role in inflaming the rioters.The House of Representatives has charged Trump, a Republican, with inciting an insurrection by exhorting thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, the day Congress gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election win.The House managers who are prosecuting the case in the US Senate spent much of Wednesday recounting the events that led to the riot and highlighting the threat to Mike Pence, Trump's vice president.On Thursday, they planned to illustrate the "terrible toll" of the riot and Trump's "role in assembling, inciting and inflaming the insurrectionists," a House aide said.There also will be a focus on Trump's "lack of remorse" during and following the siege, "which is an element in the impeachment calculus," the aide said.Read | QAnon followers believe Trump will return to power on March 4. Here’s whyWhile some Republican senators have said that the House Democrats are presenting their arguments against Trump well, many remained unconvinced Trump should be convicted.Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Fox News that while the Jan. 6 attack was "horrifying," impeachment was not appropriate given that Trump was no longer in office.A senior Senate Republican aide said "the cake is baked," with most of the party's 50 senators opposing conviction.Senators on Wednesday were shown searing security footage of the pro-Trump mob stalking the Capitol hallways chanting "Hang Mike Pence!" and searching for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Previously unseen videos showed the view from inside the Capitol as rioters smashed windows and fought with police, coming within 100 feet (30 m) of the room where Pence was sheltering with his family. The mob had set up a gallows outside.The footage, which also included body-camera views of brutal attacks on Capitol police, showed Pence and lawmakers being hustled to safety steps ahead of an advancing mob. The attack on the Capitol resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer.Trump had repeatedly said Pence had the power to stop the certification of the election results, even though he did not."The mob was looking for Vice President Pence," Representative Stacey Plaskett said, narrating footage that showed the crowd threatening Pence and searching for Pelosi."President Trump put a target on their backs and then his mob broke into the Capitol to hunt them down," she said.Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro pointed out that during the rampage, Trump tweeted that Pence "didn't have the courage to do what should have been done." A video showed rioters spreading word of Trump's tweet to one another on bullhorns.Read | Graphic riot videos not enough to convict Trump, some Republican senators sayPlanted the seedsHouse managers said Trump had planted the seeds for the riot by encouraging violence and making false claims the election was stolen long before Jan. 6. They also said he did little to put an end to the violence as it spiraled out of control, despite pleas from many Republicans to ask his supporters to stop.Democrats face a difficult task in securing a Senate conviction and barring Trump from ever again seeking public office. A two-thirds majority in the Senate must vote to convict, which means at least 17 Republicans would have to defy Trump and his continued popularity among Republican voters.On Tuesday, the Senate voted largely along party lines that the impeachment trial could move ahead even though Trump's term ended on Jan. 20. Six of 50 Republican senators broke with their caucus to side with Democrats."I am holding out hope that the forcefulness of this argument will still sway some. I believe there are more Republicans that are open to conviction than is publicly clear at this point," said Democratic Senator Chris Coons.Trump's lawyers, who will have 16 hours to deliver their defense, said the video and other evidence presented by Democrats had not made the case for his culpability."We know a mob breached the Capitol and wreaked havoc in the building. I’m waiting for them to connect that up to President Trump and so far that hasn't happened," said Trump lawyer Bruce Castor.The Senate trial could conclude as early as Saturday or Sunday, according to a senior Senate aide.Trump is the first US president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. His first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-to-focus-on-terrible-toll-of-capitol-riot-in-trump-impeachment-trial-101613060087072.html

He was originally sentenced to six years in jail in August, but he appealed that conviction.Authorities said Rogers struck at least two people after driving over a median near a Confederate monument and then through a group of protestors in a roadway. Nobody was seriously injured, though officials said he ran over a man’s toe and twice hit a woman who stepped in front of the truck.Defense attorney George Townsend argued that the protesters who were struck put themselves into the vehicle’s way. Townsend had previously said Rogers was a member of the KKK.Before he was arrested, Rogers boasted about the incident on social media.“This Chevrolet 2500 went up on the curb and through the protest,” he said on a Facebook live video played in court. “They started scattering like (expletive) cockroaches ... It’s kind of funny if you ask me.”He told the court on Tuesday that he was sorry for his actions, and he said he “didn’t make the right decisions that day,” news outlets reported.The incident came last year amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and law enforcement treatment of minorities after the police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kkk-member-sentenced-for-driving-into-crowd-of-black-lives-matter-protesters-101613055535154.html

11-02-2021||World||Digital siege: Internet cuts become favored tool of regimes||When army generals in Myanmar staged a coup last week, they briefly cut internet access in an apparent attempt to stymie protests. In Uganda, residents couldn't use Facebook, Twitter and other social media for weeks after a recent election. And in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, the internet has been down for months amid a wider conflict.Around the world, shutting down the internet has become an increasingly popular tactic of repressive and authoritarian regimes and some illiberal democracies. Digital rights groups say governments use them to stifle dissent, silence opposition voices or cover up human rights abuses, raising concerns about restricting freedom of speech.Regimes often cut online access in response to protests or civil unrest, particularly around elections, as they try to keep their grip on power by restricting the flow of information, researchers say. It's the digital equivalent of seizing control of the local TV and radio station that was part of the pre-internet playbook for despots.“Internet shutdowns have been massively underreported or misreported over the years,” said Alp Toker, founder of internet monitoring organization Netblocks. The world is “starting to realize what’s happening," as documenting efforts like his expand, he said.Last year there were 93 major internet shutdowns in 21 countries, according to a report by Top10VPN, a UK-based digital privacy and security research group. The list doesn't include places like China and North Korea, where the government tightly controls or restricts the internet. Shutdowns can range from all-encompassing internet blackouts to blocking social media platforms or severely throttling internet speeds, the report said.Internet cuts have political, economic, and humanitarian costs, experts warned. The effects are exacerbated by Covid-19 lockdowns that are forcing activities like school classes online.The shutdowns play into a wider battle over control of the internet. In the West, efforts to rein in social media platforms have raised competing concerns about restricting free speech and limiting harmful information, the latter sometimes used by authoritarian regimes to justify clampdowns.In Myanmar, internet access was cut for about 24 hours last weekend, in an apparent bid to head off protests against the army's seizing of power and the detention of leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her allies. By Sunday afternoon, internet users reported data access on their mobile phones was suddenly restored.Norway's Telenor ASA, which runs one of Myanmar's main wireless carriers, said the communications ministry cited “circulation of fake news, stability of the nation and interest of the public” in ordering operators to temporarily shut down networks.Telenor said it had to comply with local laws. “We deeply regret the impact the shutdown has on the people in Myanmar,” it said.It's a familiar move by Myanmar's government, which carried out one of the world's longest internet shutdowns in Rakhine and Chin states aimed at disrupting operations of an armed ethnic group. The cutoff began in June 2019 and was only lifted on Feb. 3.Another long-running internet shutdown is in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, which has been choked off since fighting started in early November -- the latest in a series of outages with no sign of service returning anytime soon. That’s made it challenging to know how many civilians have been killed, to what extent fighting continues or whether people are starting to die of starvation, as some have warned.In Uganda, restrictions on social media sites including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube took effect ahead of a Jan. 14 presidential election, along with a total internet blackout on the eve of polling. Authorities said it was to prevent opposition supporters from organizing potentially dangerous street protests.The social media curbs were lifted Wednesday, except for Facebook. Longtime leader Yoweri Museveni, who was facing his biggest challenge to power yet from popular singer-turned-lawmaker Bobi Wine, had been angered by the social network's removal before the vote of what it said were fake accounts linked to his party.In Belarus, the internet went down for 61 hours after the Aug. 9 presidential election, marking Europe's first internet blackout. Service was cut after election results handed victory to authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko but the vote was widely seen as rigged and sparked enormous protests. Access remained unstable for months, particularly around weekend protests, when mobile internet service repeatedly went down.The risk is that regular shutdowns become normalized, said Toker.“You get a kind of Pavlovian response where both the public in the country and the wider international community will become desensitized to these shutdowns,” he said, calling it the “greatest risk to our collective freedom in the digital age.”Internet shutdowns are also common in democratic India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has increasingly used them to target his political opposition. His Hindu nationalist government has ordered hundreds of regional shutdowns, according to a tracking site.Most have been in disputed Kashmir, which endured an 18-month blockade of high-speed mobile service that ended last week. But they've also been deployed elsewhere for anti-government demonstrations, including massive farmers’ protests that have rattled Modi's administration."It used to be authoritarian governments who did this, but we are seeing the practice become more common in democracies such as India," said Darrell West, a vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution who has studied internet shutdowns.“The risk is that once one democracy does it, others will be tempted to do the same thing. It may start at the local level to deal with unrest, but then spread more broadly."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/digital-siege-internet-cuts-become-favored-tool-of-regimes-101613053726992.html

Germany’s interior ministry wasn’t immediately available to comment.Germany is on high alert for fast-spreading strains as it seeks to gradually reopen Europe’s largest economy. Chancellor Angela Merkel warned earlier Thursday that aggressive mutations will gain the upper hand in the country sooner or later, threatening to destroy progress made in containing the pandemic.Under pressure from state leaders, the German leader agreed late Wednesday to loosen some virus restrictions and open a pathway to a return to some semblance of normality after months of stringent curbs.Germany restricts travel from countries with high rates of virus mutations. The list currently includes the UK, Ireland, Brazil and South Africa, according to the RKI public-health institute. If Austria and Czech Republic are added, people coming to Germany would need a negative test before traveling.“You can only enter with a negative test,” said Soeder. “There will be no exceptions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-restrict-travel-with-neighbours-over-virus-mutations-101613052893712.html

11-02-2021||World||Pakistan Supreme Court bars execution of inmates with mental illness||Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday barred the execution of inmates suffering from mental disorder, observing that carrying out the death sentence does not "meet the ends of justice" if a convict was unable to comprehend the rationale behind the punishment.A five-member bench headed by Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik passed the order on the appeals of mentally ill death-row prisoners- Kanizan Bibi, Imdad Ali and Ghulam Abbas- who have respectively served 30, 18 and 14 years on the death row.The petitioners, who showed symptoms of mental illness, demanded that their sentence be commuted.The court commuted the death sentences of Kanizan Bibi and Imdad Ali to life imprisonment and directed that a fresh mercy petition be filed to the Pakistan President on behalf of Ghulam Abbas.The court observed that carrying out the death sentence does not "meet the ends of justice" if a convict was unable to comprehend the rationale behind the punishment due to a mental illness.It also ordered the Punjab government to shift the accused from prison to the Punjab Institute of Mental Health, Lahore, for treatment and rehabilitation.However, the bench in the judgment clarified that not every mental illness shall automatically qualify for an exemption from carrying out the death sentence."This exemption will be applicable only in that case where a medical board, consisting of mental health professionals, certifies after a thorough examination and evaluation that the condemned prisoner no longer has higher mental functions to appreciate the rationale behind the sentence of death awarded to them," the judgment read.The court also directed the authorities to set up high security forensic mental health facilities at teaching and training mental health institutions. It also asked to change laws to properly define mental illness so that it should not be confused with generic terms like "unsound mind", "lunatic" and "insane".Reacting to the judgement, Justice Project Pakistan, a rights group campaigning for the release of mentally ill inmates, in a statement said, “this is a historic judgment that validates our decade-long struggle to get the courts to recognise mental illness as a mitigating circumstance against the imposition of the death penalty."We are grateful to all the honourable judges on the bench for affirming the rights of the most vulnerable prisoners through explicit recognition of domestic safeguards and international human rights principles,” said Sarah Belal, Executive Director of Justice Project Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-execution-of-inmates-with-mental-illness-101613047493324.html

Here’s why||The Trump International Hotel near the White House has reportedly boosted its tariff for March 4, the date followers of far-right conspiracy theory propagators QAnon believe that former US president Donald Trump will return to power. While the Senate is holding a historic second impeachment trial to convict the former president of “Incitement of Insurrection”, some QAnon believers are busy floating a convoluted conspiracy theory that claims Trump will be inaugurated as the next US president on March 4.The theory finds its roots in ‘sovereign citizen’ movement under which a group of people believe that they are not subject to any government rules or proceedings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has described sovereign citizen movement as "domestic terrorism" in the US. According to the federal agency, sovereign citizens are anti-government extremists who believe that they don’t have to answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities, motor vehicle departments, or law enforcement.“This causes all kinds of problems - and crimes. For example, many sovereign citizens don’t pay their taxes. They hold illegal courts that issue warrants for judges and police officers. They clog up the court system with frivolous lawsuits and liens against public officials to harass them,” says the FBI.Read | Democrats use unreleased videos, Trump’s own words in blaming him for riotWhy are QAnon followers waiting for Trump’s inauguration on March 4?Many members of the so-called sovereign citizens believe that the United States turned into a corporation after a law was enacted in 1871 and the 18th president of the US, Ulysses S Grant, was the last legal commander-in-chief of the country. Some QAnon followers share the unfounded belief that any amendments after the 16th Amendment were invalid because, according to them, there has been no country known as the United States since it turned into a corporation.Prior to 1937, US presidents were inaugurated on March 4 but was changed to January 20 by the 20th amendment. The date has gained significance among “sovereign citizens” and QAnon, a fringe group that has often claimed a threat of a “deep state” against Donald Trump. Michele Anne Tittler, one of the most prominent voices of QAnon, had recently laid out a detailed plan in a TikTok video. Tittler claimed that Trump will be sworn in as the 19th president of the United States on March 4 “under the restored Republic.”"If Biden, Harris, Pence, Pelosi ... are arrested for their crimes before January 20, there will be no one to assume the presidency... If there is no president on January 20, the corporation known as the United States of America will be dissolved. The military will then become the guardians of a nation during the transition. People will then have irrefutable proof that the election was stolen by foreign entities and that Trump was chosen by a landslide," Tittler said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qanon-followers-believe-trump-will-return-to-power-on-march-4-here-s-why-101613043296299.html
11-02-2021||World||In Israel's largest Arab city, a Nazarene defends Netanyahu||Few Arab politicians in Israel's history have openly flirted with the country's right wing, let alone endorsed its main candidate for prime minister.But Ali Salam, the mayor of Nazareth, says that he sees "no better choice" for Israel's 21% Arab minority than veteran conservative Benjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu.In the build-up to a fourth election in two years, Salam has hosted Netanyahu in Israel's largest Arab city, disparaged protests against him and actively cheered a split in Israel's main Arab coalition, the Joint List."Bibi, if you ask me, is the best one to continue for another five years," Salam, 69, told Reuters in Nazareth, the city where Jesus grew up, according to Christian tradition.For Netanyahu, the embrace of Salam and divisions among hitherto united Arab parties might help divide the opposition and nudge Israel's complex coalition arithmetic a fraction in his direction, ahead of a March 23 election that polls indicate will be a tight race.The mayor's rhetoric contrasts with other Arab leaders, who have long accused Netanyahu of demonising Arabs.On election day in 2015, Netanyahu urged his voters to turn out, warning that Arabs were flocking to the polls "in droves".In 2019 his party sent monitors equipped with body cameras to polling stations in Arab towns, prompting allegations of voter intimidation.And many Arabs were infuriated by a 2018 law that asserted Israel was the historic homeland of the Jewish people "and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it."But as a city leader with no national political ambitions, Salam says his job is to deliver the best for his 110,000 residents.And he lambasts the Arab political establishment which, he says, has failed to bring government investment to Arab communities."Speaking honestly and clearly: Bibi's tenure has brought the strongest improvement of the economic situation in Arab society, ever," Salam said.Salam said he planned to vote for the United Arab List, an Islamist party that split away from the Joint List last week after its leader also advocated, unsuccessfully, that it work with Netanyahu.Unpopular ViewIsrael's Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's 1948 creation.Ahmad Tibi, a Joint List lawmaker, said Arab leaders embracing Netanyahu were "a joke"."Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome, to have empathy with that person who kidnapped you, or oppressed you," Tibi said. He believes that Netanyahu "will not (get) a lot of votes, even if he is smiling and laughing more."The debate over whether to work with Netanyahu reflects deep frustration with existing Arab parties, said Asad Ghanem, a professor of political science at Haifa University."The fact that the head of the biggest Arab town in Israel supports Netanyahu, without being afraid to say it, reflects an Arab society in political crisis without an agenda to solve its challenges, (principally) crime and violence," Ghanem said.Netanyahu has also tried to woo Arab voters by pledging 100 million shekels ($30.7 million) to combat violence in Arab towns, and promising to include an Arab minister in his next government.Only 25% of Arabs believe they should cooperate with Netanyahu, according to one poll. But few see a realistic alternative, according to Arik Rudnitzky, of the Israel Democracy Institute."Are you ready to cooperate with any government to achieve your needs, or would you like to wait all your life in the opposition?" Rudnitzky said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-israel-s-largest-arab-city-a-nazarene-defends-netanyahu-101613044622110.html

11-02-2021||World||Graphic riot videos not enough to convict Trump, some Republican senators say||Multiple Republican senators found graphic videos of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol upsetting but suggested they would not lead them to convict former President Donald Trump of inciting insurrection.The House of Representatives' Democrats prosecuting Trump in his second impeachment trial on Wednesday leaned heavily on the threat posed to Republicans, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, by hundreds of Trump supporters attempting to stop Congress from certifying his election defeat."Today's presentation was powerful and emotional, reliving a terrorist attack on our nation's capital, but there was very little said about how specific conduct of the president satisfies a legal standard," said Republican Senator Ted Cruz.Convicting Trump would require the votes of two-thirds of the 100 members of the Senate, meaning that at least 17 Republicans would have to join all 48 Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them.The Senate on Tuesday in a 56-44 vote rejected an attempt to declare the trial unconstitutional because Trump left office when his term ended on Jan. 20. That margin suggested Democrats face an uphill climb in trying to convict the man who still remains popular with Republican voters.Oklahoma Senator James Lankford on Wednesday appeared emotional at his desk after Eric Swalwell, one of the House impeachment managers, finished his presentation. Another senator, Steve Daines, put his hand on Lankford's arm in what appeared to be a gesture of comfort.But speaking to reporters later, Lankford struggled to connect the visceral images to any culpability for Trump, who in a fiery speech before the attack on the Capitol urged his supporters to "fight" his election defeat."He's had 100 rallies and we've never seen that before. So that's the tough one to be able to link together," Lankford said.Separately, Florida Senator Rick Scott said he was "disgusted" by the behavior of the rioters.But asked whether Trump bore responsibility, he said, "You know, I've watched what he said. He's never said that somebody should break in. He actually said that people should do this peacefully ... Look, this is a complete waste of time."Kansas Senator Jerry Moran called the videos "heart-wrenching." But asked if he saw a link between the footage and Trump's words, he said: "I'll wait 'til the conclusion of the trial."Indiana Senator Mike Braun called the footage "riveting.""But I don't know that that's going to make a difference for any one senator just having it on a loop again," he said.Trump's lawyer, Bruce Castor, agreed the House impeachment managers' footage was emotional, but he seemed unworried about his client's chances."I believe it would have an emotional impact on any jury but ... and we haven't played ours," said Castor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/graphic-riot-videos-not-enough-to-convict-trump-some-republican-senators-say-101613043872316.html

"Last year, we just stayed at home without doing anything or slept at home every day. This year, though we still need to wear masks, is much better."Some shopkeepers were also upbeat.Also read| Asian businesses suffer Lunar New Year blues over travel curbs"When the city was put under lockdown, there was no one on the street," said Li Hong Gang, a lantern vendor.

It uses a photograph uploaded by a user to edit their face onto celebrities, creating 'deep fakes' videos that make the users look like actors.The app was developed by Shenzhen Xinguodu Intelligence Co, also known as Nexgo, which create hardware and software for processing electronic payments, including biometric services.After conducting an investigation of the app, a national security official said it poses "grave security threat," especially as it requires facial recognition and e-mail verification to use, Taipei Times reported on Monday.To sign up for the app, users are required to verify their e-mails address and upload a clear photograph of their face without wearing glasses or anything else that could obstruct the camera view of the user's facial features.The firm could sell the data it collects through Quyan for use with payment software, allowing payments to be made through facial recognition, they said.By requiring e-mail confirmation, the app is able to obtain other personal information that could be used in conjunction with biometric data to make payments or obtain financial information, they added.They also did not rule out that the data are being sent to Chinese law enforcement to create files on users, according to Taipei Times.The official advised people interested in using the app to exercise caution, especially if they link accounts to their e-mail, browse Chinese websites or express political opinions online.China has been accused of stealing data by several countries, including the US and Canada.Recently, Canada's intelligence chief David Vigneault warned Canadians that they are being "aggressively" targeted by hostile foreign governments seeking political, economic and military advantage.Vigneault singled out Russia and China, saying that Beijing was engaged in "activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty."Meanwhile, Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuo Kuo-wen called for a ban on Chinese apps that carry a security risk.Public agencies are already banned from using Chinese-made apps, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Li Meng-yen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-face-swapping-app-poses-grave-security-threat-taiwan-s-official-101613036327935.html

Benchmarks in Paris, Frankfurt and Hong Kong, rose, while London was flat. U.S. futures edged higher.With much of Asia celebrating the traditional start of the Year of the Ox, there is little in the way of fresh market driving news likely for the rest of the week from the region.In their phone conversation, Biden and Xi appeared to have struck a conciliatory tone, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.U.S. officials have signaled Washington will keep in place export restrictions on technology and tariffs imposed by the previous administration of President Donald Trump.But investors and businesses in the region are hoping a more even-keeled approach to relations between the two biggest economies by the Biden administration might help minimize future shocks to trade and investment.“The new normal remains mostly intact, although financial markets long-ago took it in their stride," Halley said. “The initial contact appears to have been civilized though, and for that, the rest of the world can be grateful."Germany's DAX edged 0.1% higher to 13,949.43 while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.3% to 5,688.80. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat at 6,527.11. The future for the S&P 500 gained 0.2% to 3,909.10 while the contract for the Dow industrials also gained 0.2%, to 31,302.00.Markets have been lifted by surprisingly good company earnings reports, indications that a recent surge in new coronavirus cases is easing, progress in the distribution of vaccines and signs that lawmakers in Washington are moving toward delivering another financial boost for the economy.A U.S. government report released Wednesday showed that inflation remained tame last month, reassuring investors that the economy can absorb more stimulus without overheating.Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5% to 30,173.57 and the Sensex in India edged 0.2% higher to 51,382.86.

Nearly 60% of the companies in the benchmark index rose, though a slide in technology stocks and companies that provide consumer services and products kept those gains in check.The Dow rose 0.2% to 31,437.80. The Nasdaq lost 0.3% to 13,972.53. The Russell 2000 index of small companies fell 0.7%, to 2,282.44.The Labor Department said Wednesday that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.3% in January, led by a surge in energy. It was the biggest monthly increase since July, but inflation over the past year has remained a modest 1.4%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is also up 1.4%, with core prices unchanged in January.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.15%. It was as a high as 1.20% earlier this week.Investors are watching inflation metrics more closely as Democrats in Congress prepare to inject $1.9 trillion of stimulus into the economy.

11-02-2021||World||Explained: How are experts tracking variants of the coronavirus?||Scientists are scanning virus samples taken from infected people to look for mutations, through a process called genome sequencing. It’s the same method researchers have been using for years to study bacteria, plants, animals and humans.Around the world, researchers have sequenced more than 500,000 genomes of the Covid-19 virus to date.Viruses can mutate as they make copies of themselves after infecting a person. By sequencing virus samples over time, scientists can look for recurring changes in the genome.“If we don’t know these things, we’re running blind,” said Sara Vetter, assistant lab director for the Minnesota Department of Health.Most mutations are meaningless, but others can make a virus more contagious, deadly or resistant to vaccines and treatment. Health experts are primarily concerned about three variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. They seem to spread more easily and research is underway to see if they cause more serious disease.Evidence suggests that current vaccines still work against the variants though perhaps not as well against a mutated version that first appeared in South Africa.Countries vary in their genomic surveillance. Britain, for example, sequences about 10% of specimens positive for the coronavirus, compared to less than 1% in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-are-experts-tracking-variants-of-the-coronavirus-101613034904016.html
11-02-2021||World||Democrats use unreleased videos, Trump’s own words in blaming him for riot||House prosecutors used the second day of Donald Trump’s impeachment trial to detail a months-long campaign by the former president to stoke hatred and encourage violence over the election results that they said culminated in the mob attack on the US Capitol that he then did little to stop.Using previously unreleased videos and audio, the Democratic lawmakers vividly showed senators how close the rioters who ransacked the Capitol came to reaching them, as well as then-Vice President Mike Pence. Senators in the chamber listened in rapt silence as the recordings played.The impeachment managers, who will wrap up their case on Thursday, depicted the assault as not only foreseeable but the intended result of a multitude of actions calculated to incite Trump’s followers. The strategy appeared designed to rebut defense efforts to cast his fiery speech before the assault as normal political hyperbole, and persuade the public that his actions were premeditated and cynical.Trump’s defense team will present their opening arguments on Friday, and the proceedings could finish with a verdict by the weekend.The step-by-step timeline House impeachment managers offered set the Jan. 6 violence in the context of months of Trump tweets inflaming tensions even before the election. It was, they said, a “big lie” of baseless claims of election fraud, armed intimidation of state and local election officials, and violence at demonstrations in Washington in December. They stressed Trump’s role in promoting the rally on the day of the electoral count, the timing of his speech just ahead of the congressional session and his remarks pointing the crowd toward the Capitol.“This was never about one speech,” Representative Eric Swalwell of California, one of the nine House impeachment managers, said. “He built this mob over many months with repeated messaging until they believed that they’d been robbed of their vote and they would do anything to stop the certification.”Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, another impeachment manager, said the people who laid siege to the Capitol “did it because Donald Trump sent them on this mission” to stop the peaceful transfer of power as Congress was certifying the Electoral College votes that ratified President Joe Biden’s victory.Democrats portrayed Trump as indifferent to the harrowing ordeal his own vice president, lawmakers and police were undergoing, even as the violence and mayhem was broadcast live on television, and did nothing to protect lawmakers and others at the Capitol for hours, failing to call in the National Guard. They highlighted news reports quoting associates saying that the former president was initially “delighted” by the attack.Even as the Capitol was being breached, Trump sent out incendiary tweets, including one disparaging Pence for not having “the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” The videos presented showed the crowd stalking Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In one, an unidentified member of the crowd says: “Pence lied to us, he’s a total treasonous pig.”“Senators, you’ve seen all the evidence so far, and this is clear: on Jan. 6, President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead,” Texas Representative Joaquin Castro said.The dramatic presentation may have more impact on public opinion than the eventual verdict in the trial. The odds still are against 17 Republicans joining with Democrats and independents to form the two-thirds majority of the Senate necessary to convict Trump. Only six Republicans voted with Democrats on Tuesday to proceed with the trial.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, suggested the prosecution was futile, with most of his Republican colleagues already decided against conviction. He said he had assured the former president “the case is over” and “it’s just a matter of getting the final verdict.”Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who was among the GOP lawmakers who voted to block certification of electoral votes from two states on the day of the attack, called the footage shown in the trial “horrific.” But he said the House impeachment managers didn’t connect the violence to Trump.“They spent a great deal of time focusing on the horrific acts of violence that were played out by the criminals, but the language from the president doesn’t come close to meeting the legal standard for incitement,” Cruz told reporters.Still, several Republicans acknowledged the power of the House Democrats’ arguments.“They had a strong presentation put together in a way that I think makes it very compelling,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 GOP leader, said. He didn’t rule out voting for conviction, saying he would listen to both sides “and draw conclusions when it’s all done.”Trump lawyer Bruce Castor told reporters as he left the Capitol Wednesday night that ”we didn’t learn anything today that we didn’t already know.”“Yesterday, we said we didn’t dispute that the breach of the Capitol is a terrible thing, and that mob violence is something that President Trump abhors,” he said, adding, “I wonder why we sat through eight hours of videos that aren’t under dispute.”Trump’s team intends to rely heavily on his use of the words “peacefully and patriotically” at one point in the Jan. 6 speech as part of his defense against the impeachment charge of incitement, according to people familiar with the effort. They also plan to show videos of prominent Democrats using similar rhetoric about fighting to argue Trump is being subjected to a double standard.Representative Madeleine Dean, another impeachment manager, anticipating the argument, said that Trump only used the word “peacefully” once in the 11,000-word speech, while urging on followers with the words “fight” or “fighting” 20 times.House managers took turns outlining the ways Trump perpetuated “the big lie” that the election was stolen and tried to get elected Republicans to overturn the results -- and when that failed, how he encouraged supporters to rally on Jan. 6 to “stop the steal” as Biden’s victory was being ratified.Swalwell said Trump spent $50 million from his legal defense fund on video ads, online advertising and targeted text messages to amplify his “stop the steal” message that stopped on Jan. 5.Plaskett pointed to several incidents in the months leading up to Jan. 6 when Trump encouraged groups of violent supporters, including one that tried to run a Biden campaign bus off the road in Texas and the Proud Boys, a far right movement, who engaged in violence in downtown Washington, at a pro-Trump rally on Dec. 12.The House managers contention that the mob was acting on the direction of Trump was bolstered in a federal court in Washington in the case of a member of the Proud Boys arrested in connection with the riot. The attorney for Dominic Pezzola said in a court filing that Pezzola was responding to “the entreaties of the then commander in chief, President Trump.” It claimed that Pezzola was “misled by the president’s deception.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-use-unreleased-videos-trump-s-own-words-in-blaming-him-for-riot-101613034180872.html
11-02-2021||World||Kim Jong Un moves to save pandemic-ravaged economy, warns of 'powerful measures'||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered tougher legal supervision to support his development plans and eradicate various economy-related unlawful acts, state media said Thursday, as he works to salvage an economy battered by the pandemic and other challenges.Kim spoke Wednesday during a Workers’ Party meeting convened to follow up on decisions made at the ruling party’s congress in January, where he admitted previous economic plans had failed and announced a new five-year development plan.Kim “stressed the importance to strengthen legal supervision and control over the establishment and executive process of the national economic plan,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.He said prosecutors and other law enforcement organizations must do more to ensure the economic plan is correctly executed and “stage a strong legal struggle for checking all kinds of illegal practices revealed in economic activities.” Kim added that “all sectors and units should obey them unconditionally,” KCNA said.North Korea’s top prosecutor U Sang Chol told the party meeting that he will firmly implement Kim's order. He said he'll “offensively” keep legal watch over agencies violating the socialist economic management order and take “powerful measures” against any acts hampering efforts to strengthen industries, according to KCNA.Kim faces what appears to be the toughest crisis of his nine-year rule as the already-troubled economy is hit by pandemic-related border closings that have sharply reduced the North’s external trade, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent US-led sanctions. During the party congress, Kim described the difficulties as the “worst-ever.”The new five-year plan centers on building a stronger self-supporting economy, reducing reliance on imports, making more investments in the metal and chemical industries and increasing production of consumer goods. But some analysts say the new plan still lacks substance, noting that North Korea’s difficulties result from decades of mismanagement, self-imposed isolation and the sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program.North Korea’s push to boost legal control over the economic plan shows Kim is “desperate to report progress over the new five-year plan to secure a stability of the Kim Jong Un government,” said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies.He said punishment for those embroiled in alleged corruption, negligence and incompetence will likely be harsh.Kim's Wednesday speech on the third day of the plenary session of the party's Central Committee followed earlier secessions where he criticized government agencies for “passive and self-protecting tendencies.”Kim also set forth unspecified future action to be taken by agencies responsible for external and South Korean affairs. State media dispatches carrying Kim's remarks have not mentioned the United States and deadlocked nuclear diplomacy.During January's congress, Kim disclosed an array of sophisticated weapons under development and vowed to enlarge his nuclear arsenal to cope with what he called intensifying U.S. hostility. He said the fate of relations between North Korea and the U.S. depends on Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-moves-to-save-pandemic-ravaged-economy-warns-of-powerful-measures-101613033449760.html
11-02-2021||World||'Overwhelm the problem': Inside Joe Biden's war on Covid-19||The meetings begin each day not long after dawn. Dozens of aides report in, coffee in hand, joining by Zoom from agency headquarters, their homes or even adjacent offices.The sessions start with the latest sobering statistics meant to focus the work and offer a reminder of what's at stake: new coronavirus cases, people in hospitals, deaths. But they also include the latest signs of progress: Covid-19 tests administered, vaccine doses shipped, shots injected.Where the last administration addressed the pandemic with the vernacular of a natural disaster — using the Federal Emergency Management Agency's mantra of a “federally supported, state managed and locally executed” response — Biden's team is borrowing from the Pentagon and the doctrine of overwhelming force.“We're at war with this virus,” Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said in an interview with The Associated Press between Sunday morning meetings on the response. “We're taking every resource and tool the federal government has to battle on every front.”It's a strategy facing urgent tests after Biden inherited an inconsistent vaccine distribution plan and with the emerging threats from new virus variants.The goal, Biden aides say, is as simple as it is ambitious: After a year of being on defense they want to take the fight to the virus — to “overwhelm the problem,” a kind of mantra for the team.Also read| Trump’s environmental policies killed thousands of people, scientists sayThe campaign is being waged in schools and sterile pharmaceutical plants, on the vast blacktop of stadium parking lots and along the sidewalks outside Americans' homes. To defeat the virus, Biden's team must oversee a herculean logistical effort to put shots into hundreds of millions of arms, but also overcome vaccine hesitance, politically charged science skepticism and fatigue across all corners of society after nearly a year of hardship.For Biden, beating back the pandemic is a defining challenge of his presidency, testing his central promise to the American people that he can better manage the outbreak than his predecessor. His team seemingly day by day rolls out an almost dizzying array of new efforts and appeals large and small — everything from building a surgical glove factory in the US by year's end to asking Americans to wear masks while walking their dogs.The central question for Biden and his team, one that can't be answered yet: Will it all add up to enough?“They're taking exactly the right approach,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner. “The federal government is taking responsibility, instead of leaving everything to state and local governments and blaming others when things go wrong.”For all of the activity, though, Biden knows that there are more grim statistics to come before Americans can return to any semblance of the “before days."Also read| Dozens of former Republican officials in talks to form anti-Trump third partyMore Americans have died from Covid-19 in the last year than during all of World War II and some projections show the death toll could top that of the Civil War by the beginning of summer.Since he took office three weeks ago, Biden's team has attacked the problem on multiple fronts. They have unleashed billions of federal dollars to boost vaccinations and testing and developed a model to deploy more than 10,000 active-duty troops to join even more members of the National Guard to put shots into arms.Mass vaccination sites, supported by federal troops, are set to open in California, Texas and New York in coming weeks.As concerns grow about potentially dangerous mutations in the virus, Biden aides view the vaccines less as a silver bullet and more as part of a complementary series of moves that taken together offer the prospect of real progress.And for the US to fully contain the problem, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has warned that the pace of vaccinations must increase globally to curtail the mutants.“We're not going to sugarcoat in any way how hard this is, but we're going to demonstrate clear evidence of progress and action,” Zients said.Biden is already well on pace to exceed his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. It's an assuredly achievable goal that some consider inadequate but also a break from the off-base predictions of the Trump administration that undercut public confidence. According to the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention, at least 26 million doses have been administered in Biden's first three weeks in office.Much of the improvement in vaccination deliveries so far has been due to long-planned manufacturing ramp-ups, not the actions of the Biden team, aides acknowledge. But with the prospect of a third vaccine receiving approval in coming weeks, they are trying to anticipate and eliminate the next set of bottlenecks, when capacity to deliver injections and demand for vaccines become limiting factors.Wen urged the Biden administration to set more aggressive targets — a moon shot — to increase the pace of vaccinations to 3 million per day. “I think they just need to be a lot more ambitious when they talk to the public,” she said.Beyond the focus on sheer numbers of shots delivered, there is question of whose arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overwhelm-the-problem-inside-joe-biden-s-war-on-covid19-101613032735020.html

11-02-2021||World||Biden seeks more foreign workers while skirting H-1B visa uproar||Joe Biden’s immigration overhaul seeks to allow more skilled foreign workers into the US without stirring widespread protest from labor groups, whose opposition would all but ruin prospects for what is already one of the president’s most precarious priorities.The sweeping proposal Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office drew quick Republican opposition over its centerpiece: a faster path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Another provision would allow more foreign students and workers to enter the US by increasing the number of employment-based green cards.Business groups view the proposal as a way to increase the supply of coders and other skilled tech workers for US companies without raising caps on programs such as the H-1B visa for high-skilled workers.Companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. have for years pressed to increase the number of tech workers allowed into the US, saying they need engineers from countries like India because there aren’t enough skilled Americans. But efforts to expand the workforce through H-1B visas have drawn a backlash from unions and immigration opponents, who argue that the companies overlook US talent to hire foreigners at lower salaries.The Biden proposal seeks to sidestep a conflict with organized labor by leaving the annual H-1B quota untouched. The measure instead clears a path for more foreign workers to eventually enter the country by eliminating a decades-long backlog of people waiting for employment-based green cards, which grant permanent legal residence and are capped at 140,000 per year under current law.“This bill, signed into law, would be a tremendous improvement for legal immigration in this country,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group founded by tech industry leaders.Business group leaders have discussed an immigration overhaul with Democratic and Republican staff in the House and Senate, according to industry officials working on the issue. The talks have focused on finding areas of bipartisan consensus that can help advance an overall package, including keeping science-technology-engineering-math graduates in the US; providing legal status for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children; and streamlining the employment-based visa system.So far, labor groups are supporting Biden’s approach.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka praised Biden’s framework as “bold” and said its path to citizenship “will help to raise standards for all workers.” The labor group declined to comment on the proposed changes to the employment-based visa system.Service Employees International Union, which represents mostly lower-wage workers, as well as United Farm Workers, joined a multimillion-dollar advertising and public relations campaign in support of Biden’s immigration plan.Nandini Nair, an immigration lawyer at Greenspoon Marder LLP, said Biden’s approach goes “a long way” toward satisfying unions’ concerns.“You’re dealing with the individuals who are already here in the US versus this narrative that foreign workers are coming to the US and taking jobs,” Nair said.‘Real’ TensionsEven so, unions’ views on the measure could change dramatically as lawmakers hash out details of the legislation.Biden’s proposes to recapture unused visas from prior years and eliminate per-country caps for employment-based green cards, which could benefit Indian information technology professionals who sometimes wait decades to gain permanent US residence. The plan would also exempt spouses and children of green-card holders from the annual quota, which some advocates estimate could double the number of employment-based cards.“There are tensions there that are real,” said Ediberto Roman, a law professor at Florida International University who focuses on immigration. “In terms of skilled labor, I could see some potential impact there.”There’s debate over whether tech companies in the US need to import workers. Engineers and IT personnel are among the hardest positions to fill, according to the Manpower Group, and businesses say that as a consequence, they’re forced to look for foreign workers. But immigration opponents say the US labor pool is sufficient, pointing to the number of Americans who receive degrees in computer science or related fields.The Biden administration is “espousing the tired talking points of the US Chamber of Commerce and others who benefit from a wellspring of inexpensive sources of labor,” said Kevin Lynn, executive director of the group US Tech Workers, which supports lower levels of US immigration and opposes outsourcing jobs.Lynn said that the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating effect on the US job market is even more reason to hold off on proposals to open the door to more foreign workers.“I’m befuddled why they would push expansionist immigration policies at a time of so much job insecurity,” Lynn said.Biden’s immigration proposal stands little chance of passage in its current form because of a longstanding partisan divide over granting undocumented migrants access to citizenship -- a policy derided as “amnesty” by many Republicans. But the president’s plan likely will be an outline for Democrats in Congress as they write a comprehensive immigration bill.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday she wouldn’t comment on the measure’s prospects because it hasn’t been formally introduced in Congress.The White House will have to pull off a balancing act to unite forces on the left -- labor groups and immigrant-rights advocates -- if it hopes to pass the overhaul into law and fulfill one of Biden’s core campaign promises. Key Republican senators have already denounced Biden’s plan meaning that Biden will need strong support from Democrats.And a path to citizenship -- not increasing the number of foreign workers -- remains the dominant issue for immigrant-rights advocates, said Lorella Praeli, co-president of Community Change, one of the groups leading the campaign to promote Biden’s plan.“We have to continue to build momentum toward winning freedom for all 11 million and reforming and transforming our whole system,” Praeli said.STEM GraduatesBiden’s proposal attempts to keep overseas students who earn advanced science and technology degrees in the US by giving them a faster track to permanent residence. It would help guest workers who already hold H-1B visas by making work authorization for their dependents permanent, and preventing their children from aging out of the system.Biden’s plan also acknowledges concerns of labor groups. It grants the Department of Homeland Security the power to raise or lower the number of green cards available based on economic conditions and enact rules to encourage “higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American worker.”Companies that employ foreign workers are anxious to see changes to the legal immigration system, especially after Biden’s early slate of executive actions stopped short of immediately repealing former President Donald Trump’s pandemic-related visa curbs. Biden’s orders directed a review of many Trump migration policies with the aim of eventually rolling them back.Business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and FWD.us, have sought to build support for a broad immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship -- especially for Dreamers.Allowing more skilled foreign workers into the US once enjoyed strong support in the Republican Party, but it may be a less powerful enticement for GOP lawmakers following Trump’s presidency. He sought to restrict both legal and illegal migration to the country, hardening the party’s stance, and routinely demonized immigrants as threats to both US security and American jobs.Senator Marco Rubio, who co-sponsored a bipartisan immigration overhaul in 2013 that included a citizenship path for undocumented migrants, denounced Biden’s bill as a “non-starter” that will give “blanket amnesty” to people living in the country without authorization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-seeks-more-foreign-workers-while-skirting-h-1b-visa-uproar-101613033075683.html

11-02-2021||World||In UK, roving teams bring coronavirus vaccine shots to homeless||In a pandemic, homeless people face being more forgotten than they already are. But not by doctors like Dr. Anil Mehta, who is on a mission to bring the coronavirus vaccine to those hardest to reach and often most at risk of getting sick in east London.Mehta, a general practitioner, and his small team of doctors and nurses have been showing up at homeless centers in his local area, a Covid-19 hotspot, offering a free jab to dozens who might otherwise get left behind in Britain’s mass vaccination drive.“They will get missed if we don’t find them proactively,” Mehta said. “They really don’t have anything going for them, in terms of medical care. Finding them is absolutely essential to what we need to achieve in our boroughs.”The homeless are not listed among the British government’s highest priority groups for the vaccine rollout — which currently include people over 70, nursing home residents, front-line medical staff and social care workers, as well as the clinically vulnerable.Because those sleeping outside and people in shelters have no address that doctors can contact them at, some local authorities across Britain have begun sending out roving vaccination teams to identify the clinically vulnerable among them so they can have access to the jab.The charity Homeless Link said the U.K. government last month appealed to local officials to accommodate as many so-called “rough sleepers” as possible and help them register with a doctor as temperatures plummet and as a more contagious virus variant drove a huge surge in U.K. infection rates. But the charity said there has been no clear strategy to ensure that the homeless get inoculated, and that means officials in different areas have been left to take different tacks.“We believe that a targeted approach to vaccination is needed to protect people with no home,” said Rick Henderson, the charity’s chief executive.“Homeless people are substantially more likely to report having chronic diseases such as asthma, heart problems and stroke, and are old before their time. Furthermore, their use of communal accommodation such as homeless hostels increases their risk of contracting Covid-19,” he added.In the outer reaches of northeast London, which has seen some of England’s worst infection rates, Mehta and his mobile vaccination team have been busy working outside of their clinic. They gave a vaccine jab to over 200 homeless people and social care workers at two community centers last week, and plan to reach another 70 next week.Mehta is happy with the progress so far.“These are very hard-to-reach groups — they could be in different places, here today and going to central London the next day,” he said. “We are effectively chasing them.”Earlier this week, Britain’s government also urged anyone living in the UK unlawfully to register with a doctor and receive a vaccine, promising that they would not have their immigration status checked or risk deportation. It wasn’t clear how many people the policy affects — the last official estimate, in 2005, suggested there were about 430,000 people in the country with no legal right to remain.More than 12 million people in Britain have now had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Officials say they are on track to offer first doses to 15 million in the top priority groups by Monday, and have set a target of vaccinating every adult in the country by the fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-uk-roving-teams-bring-coronavirus-vaccine-shots-to-homeless-101613033001690.html

Data relating to the pandemic is also improving, with cases of the virus, hospitalizations and deaths all falling, Vallance said.However, any re-opening of the economy will have to happen carefully so the government can measure the effects of any relaxation of the rules, he said.“The virus isn’t going to be particularly interested in dates,” Vallance said. “Caution is very important as we go into opening things up.”Johnson is scheduled to set out a road map for easing restrictions on Feb. 22. He is under pressure from members of his own Conservative Party to start lifting curbs as soon as possible to help the UK rebound from its worst downturn for 300 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-targets-vaccines-for-everyone-over-50-by-april-101613027077600.html

11-02-2021||World||Trump’s environmental policies killed thousands of people, scientists say||The Trump administration deliberately harnessed racism and class animosity to push policies that caused hundreds of thousands of US deaths, according to a scathing new report in the British medical journal The Lancet.After undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the health and environment impacts of Donald Trump’s presidency, the 33 scientists who co-authored the article estimated that rollbacks of environmental and workplace protections led to 22,000 excess deaths in 2019 alone. They also found that 40% of U.S. deaths during 2020 from Covid-19 would have been avoided if the country’s death rate had been closer to that of its G7 peers, and blamed Trump for eschewing the advice of public health agencies and politicizing common sense responses to the pandemic such as mask-wearing.The findings rely on comparisons with previous U.S. norms and those in other countries to make statistical assumptions about what mortality rates might have been if Trump hadn’t swerved away from the global scientific consensus. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College who was one of the report’s co-authors, argued that it was fair to make the linkage.“Basically, the Trump administration stopped enforcing Clean Air Act,” Landrigan said, referring to the landmark legislation signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970 and used by President Barack Obama to regulate carbon emissions. Under the aegis of ending the “war on coal,” Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency reversed the Obama administration’s emissions rule and stopped trying to control fine particulate matter air pollution. As a result, the Lancet report said, concentrations of such pollution have increased after having declined steadily for decades before he took office.Fine particulate pollution is closely linked to all sorts of lethal diseases, including childhood asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes among adults.“We see trend lines for deaths from environmental and occupational exposure start going up in 2017, reversing 50 years of decline,” Landrigan concluded. “It is hard to walk away from cause and effect.”Trump’s last EPA Administrator, Scott Wheeler, repeatedly cited cost benefit analysis as a rationale for regulatory changes that undermined Obama-era attempts to curb pollution. On the campaign trail last year, the former president pledged to ensure that the U.S. had the “cleanest air and water in the planet,” even as his administration reversed policies created to achieve those goals. Representatives for Trump didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Lancet’s willingness to wade into the politics behind health policy is highly unusual among scientific journals. Richard Horton, the journal’s editor, is no stranger to controversy, however. Under his leadership, the magazine has come under fire for one-sided critiques of Israel, for assigning greatly inflated death figures to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and for publishing a now widely discredited study linking vaccinations to autism. In April, the Lancet criticized Trump for pulling out of the World Health Organization, calling his decision a “crime against humanity.”But the fact that so many scientists were willing to break from their traditional political neutrality to put their names on this assessment is “a signal of a changing time,” according to Gretchen Goldman, a research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. While the Lancet has been more outspoken than others, she said, it’s not alone among science magazines in publicly criticizing Trump. Scientific American shocked many when it broke 175 years of tradition and gave its first ever presidential endorsement to Joe Biden, largely because it argued that Trump was such an awful alternative.“If you told me four years ago that scientific journals would be speaking out against Trump, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Goldman said. “But since then, there has been quite a shift, reflecting both the severity of what Trump did as well as the changing willingness of the scientific community to engage in policy conversations.”This report has its roots in the spring of 2017, when the Lancet formed a commission of experts with backgrounds in a wide range of topics such as clinical medicine, public health, and epidemiology to track the public health effects of the Trump administration.On environmental policy, the report noted that Trump rolled back 84 vital regulations covering everything from toxins in water to the way scientific research gets used by the federal government, with 20 more rule changes still in progress by the end of his term. The resulting increase in airborne particulate matter was the primary cause of the excess deaths, the authors concluded. But they also proposed that Trump’s climate change denialism would be the most enduring stain on his environmental legacy.While the commission excoriated Trump, it also acknowledged that deep-seated problem in America’s health system predated him by decades. The authors note, for example, that American life expectancy rates have been declining compared to other high-income nations since the 1980s.But instead of moving to solve this decline, the report argues that the former president specifically exploited low- and middle-income White people’s anger over their deteriorating prospects to mobilize the racial animus and xenophobia that propelled his political success. The people who supported Trump were in fact among the worst affected by his policies, the commission found. The 22,000 additional 2019 deaths occurred largely in states that voted for Trump, while Democratic states such as California and New York had their own laws that acted as a safety net.The report also emphasizes the racial disparities in health that grew under Trump, including the fact that most of the 2.3 million Americans who lost health insurance while he was in office were minorities. It also underscored the fact that Covid-19 has much more heavily impacted Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people.As Mary T. Bassett, a former health commissioner for New York City and a member of the Lancet’s expert panel, wrote in a statement released with the report: “The disastrous, bungled response to the pandemic made clear how existing, longstanding racial inequities simply have not been addressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-environmental-policies-killed-thousands-of-people-scientists-say-101613027093223.html
11-02-2021||World||US President Joe Biden forms military task force to tackle China||US President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced the formation of a department of defence task force to recommend key priorities and decisions to “chart a strong path forward on China-related matters”.Biden made the announcement during his first visit to the Pentagon,the headquarters of the US department of defence, along with vice-president Kamala Harris.Later in the day, Biden affirmed his “priorities of protecting the American people’s security, prosperity, health, and way of life, and preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific” in his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.“President Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including towards Taiwan,” the White House said in a statement. Biden and Xi also exchanged views on the Covid-19 pandemic, climate crisis, and preventing weapons proliferation.Announcing the task force, Biden said it will “look at our strategy and operational concepts, technology, and force posture, and so much more” and it will work across the department to provide recommendations to secretary of defence Lloyd Austin “on key priorities and decision points so that we can chart a strong path forward on China-related matters”.Ely Ratner, a special assistant to the US secretary of defence, will head the 15-member body drawn from across the department. It will have four months to submit it recommendations.Ratner is an Asia expert and has been with Biden for a long time, working in various capacities. He served on Biden’s staff in the Senate and then on the Senate foreign relations committee. He was in the state department before joining Biden, who was vice-president at that time, as his deputy national security adviser.Ratner and Kurt Campbell, the Indo-Pacific coordinator in the National Security Council, have emerged as the Biden administration’s key hands-on officials for the region.The Biden administration has been under mounting pressure at home and abroad to come up with an explicit policy on China, going beyond remarks by the president and his top national security and foreign policy officials.During a visit to the state department last week, Biden called China “America’s most serious competitor” and, he had added, “we’ll confront China’s economic abuses, counter its aggressive, coercive action to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance”.The US president also spoke of “growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally”.Though housed in the Pentagon, the task force will require, the president said, a “whole-of-government effort, bipartisan cooperation in Congress, and strong alliances and partnerships”.The United States has said it believes China is seeking to “overturn” the rule-based structure that has worked for all nations in the Indo-Pacific region and is “using all elements of national power to bend the nations (in the region) to its will”. And countering China in this context will be the focus of the task force.Defence department officials described the task force as a “sprint effort” that will examine and marshal all aspects of American power — strategy, operational concepts, technology and force structure, force posture and force management and intelligence — as a well as “alliances and partnerships and their impact on Sino-American relations and the defence department’s relations with China”.The phrase “sprint effort” appears to be a spin-off of “pacing threat”, a terminology previously used by top Pentagon officials such as secretary Austin and deputy secretary of defence Kathleen Hicks, according to defence department officials, to describe the relationship with China as a strategic competitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-forms-military-task-force-to-tackle-china-101613031314165.html
11-02-2021||World||Dozens of former Republican officials in talks to form anti-Trump third party||Dozens of former Republican officials, who view the party as unwilling to stand up to former President Donald Trump and his attempts to undermine US democracy, are in talks to form a centre-right breakaway party, four people involved in the discussions told Reuters.The early stage discussions include former elected Republicans, former officials in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump, ex-Republican ambassadors and Republican strategists, the people involved say.More than 120 of them held a Zoom call last Friday to discuss the breakaway group, which would run on a platform of "principled conservatism," including adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law - ideas those involved say have been trashed by Trump.The plan would be to run candidates in some races but also to endorse centre-right candidates in others, be they Republicans, independents or Democrats, the people say.Also read| With Biden at helm in US, India-Iran trade prospects may improve: ExportersEvan McMullin, who was chief policy director for the House Republican Conference and ran as an independent in the 2016 presidential election, told Reuters that he co-hosted the Zoom call with former officials concerned about Trump’s grip on Republicans and the nativist turn the party has taken.Three other people confirmed to Reuters the call and the discussions for a potential splinter party, but asked not to be identified.Among the call participants were John Mitnick, general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; former Republican congressman Charlie Dent; Elizabeth Neumann, deputy chief of staff in the Homeland Security Department under Trump; and Miles Taylor, another former Trump homeland security official.The talks highlight the wide intra-party rift over Trump's false claims of election fraud and the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the US Capitol. Most Republicans remain fiercely loyal to the former president, but others seek a new direction for the party.The House of Representatives impeached Trump on Jan. 13 on a charge of inciting an insurrection by exhorting thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Congress was gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.Also read| On Twitter, govt row in India, US says committed to supporting democratic valuesCall participants said they were particularly dismayed by the fact that more than half of the Republicans in Congress - eight senators and 139 House representatives - voted to block certification of Biden's election victory just hours after the Capitol siege.Most Republican senators have also indicated they will not support the conviction of Trump in this week’s Senate impeachment trial.“Large portions of the Republican Party are radicalizing and threatening American democracy,” McMullin told Reuters. “The party needs to recommit to truth, reason and founding ideals or there clearly needs to be something new.”Asked about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.”A representative for the Republican National Committee referred to a recent statement from Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel."If we continue to attack each other and focus on attacking on fellow Republicans, if we have disagreements within our party, then we are losing sight of 2022 (elections)," McDaniel said on Fox News last month.Also read| Joe Biden in call with China's Xi Jinping raises human rights, trade"The only way we’re going to win is if we come together," she said.The Biden White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.McMullin said just over 40% of those on last week's Zoom call backed the idea of a breakaway, national third party. Another option under discussion is to form a “faction” that would operate either inside the current Republican Party or outside it.Names under consideration for a new party include the Integrity Party and the Center Right Party. If it is decided instead to form a faction, one name under discussion is the Center Right Republicans.Members are aware that the US political landscape is littered with the remains of previous failed attempts at national third parties.“But there is a far greater hunger for a new political party out there than I have ever experienced in my lifetime,” one participant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-former-republican-officials-in-talks-to-form-anti-trump-third-party-101613015717432.html

11-02-2021||World||In rural Myanmar, residents protect police who reject coup||Civil servants, even police officers, are risking their jobs to protest the military takeover in Myanmar, and one of the more dramatic examples of crossing that line also illustrates the deep roots of the country's ethnic conflicts.In a small village in the eastern state of Kayah, 42 local police officers stood as one to declare their support for the protesters and refuse entreaties from a senior officer to return to duty. Residents streamed to the scene to protect the defiant police from arrest.A video shot by a local man of Wednesday's drama showed how as the officer tried to cajole the group to return to the fold, a young policeman stepped forward to argue with him.“If we go back with you it will be so different from what we desire,” said the younger man. “That’s why we have decided not to go with you.”“Do you all agree?” he asked his fellow resisters, who shouted back: “We agree.”While The Associated Press did not independently witness the incident in Bardo village, the cameraman who filmed it provided a detailed and extensive description of what happened.The group stood behind banners, one of which read: “We don’t want dictatorship.” In the course of the full video, they frequently repeated chants popular with the protest movement, calling for democracy.The officer paced down the line of the recalcitrant men and women. “We are a team, a troop,” he retorted. “We cannot stay like this for long.”He was met with three-fingered salutes in response, the symbol of resistance adopted from the pro-democracy movement in neighboring Thailand.Then, as the two sides were at an impasse, local people arrived to prevent any attempt to force the police group into leaving in the custody of their officer.A separate video posted on Facebook by the Progressive Karenni People Force — a network of local civil society organizations — showed how more than 100 people trudged along a dirt road to make their way to the isolated police unit.The incident took place the same day an anti-coup march was held in the nearby state capital of Loikaw.By Wednesday night, reports from the area suggested the defiant police officers were in hiding.The trigger for their mutiny was the military coup last week that ousted the elected government of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, but its roots were in Myanmar’s tangled history of ethnic discord.The defiant police are mostly, if not all, local recruits from the Kayah ethnic minority, also known as the Karenni, while the senior officer is an outsider representing the central government and military, which are both dominated by the country’s Burman majority.Ethnic minorities have resented Burman control and struggled for greater autonomy at least since Myanmar became independent from British colonial rule. Kayah activists tangled bitterly with Suu Kyi’s government in 2019, when they sought the removal of an unwanted statue of Myanmar’s independence leader, Gen. Aung San, Suu Kyi’s father.The protests against the statue were reportedly put down by police using water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas — the same weapons police began to use this week against protesters opposed to the coup that ousted Suu Kyi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-rural-myanmar-residents-protect-police-who-reject-coup-101613017183481.html
11-02-2021||World||Kuwait currency peg in spotlight as nation runs short of cash||The Kuwaiti dinar’s peg to a basket of currencies is coming under scrutiny as concerns grow that one of the world’s richest nations is running short of cash.Derivatives are showing signs of pressure after 12-month forward contracts on the Kuwaiti dinar rose to about 280 points in the offshore market Wednesday, the highest since June. Most other Gulf currency forwards have declined this year as the recent recovery in oil prices eases the risks to their energy-dependent economies.While other Gulf Arab states tapped global debt markets to bolster strained finances amid the pandemic, Kuwait has been hamstrung by lawmakers’ resistance to approve a law that would enable the government to borrow. Concern over how Kuwait will cover its budget deficit has become more acute after the government transferred the last of its performing assets to the country’s sovereign wealth fund in exchange for cash.Ultimately, analysts and investors say the government will be forced to act to shore up the nation’s finances, whether by breaking the borrowing deadlock or imposing taxes to increase revenue. As a last resort, the dinar could be devalued, but it’s not clear how effective that would be in terms of bolstering the economy, they say.“Risks of devaluation are limited,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd., which holds Kuwait’s sovereign, corporate and bank debt. The country could tap capital markets some time in the first half of 2021, he said.“I expect the necessary reforms to be passed as the available options such as monetizing sovereign wealth fund assets are limited.”Fitch Ratings predicted the government would replenish its General Reserve Fund -- the main source of budget financing -- even without any new legislation by parliament. At the same time, it cut the outlook on Kuwait’s debt rating to negative from stable last week to reflect “near-term liquidity risk.”Wider SpreadsThat move contributed to a drop in the nation’s Eurobonds, sending the spread on $3.5 billion of sovereign debt due March 2022 to the widest since November. The country hasn’t tapped global debt markets since 2017 and the bonds’ scarcity value normally keeps prices stable.In 2007, Kuwait became the first Gulf Arab state to abandon its currency peg to the dollar in favor of a basket, reacting to a decline in the U.S. currency that had pushed up the cost of imports, fueling inflation.“I’m not aware of anyone speculating or hedging their Kuwaiti dinar exposure, though I wouldn’t be surprised if a hedge fund somewhere thinks it’s a trade,” said Ali Al-Salim, a Gulf-based co-founder of Arkan Partners, a consulting company for alternative investments including hedge funds and private equity.According to Al-Salim, the central bank’s latest disclosures suggest its foreign-asset position remains stable.“Kuwait’s economic challenges can’t be resolved via its currency alone,” he said. “It has a very narrow economy dominated by oil revenues, and expenses that are almost entirely imports. A weaker currency would create limited incremental demand for locally produced goods and services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-currency-peg-in-spotlight-as-nation-runs-short-of-cash-101613017205487.html
11-02-2021||World||Justin Trudeau calls up Narendra Modi, seeks Covid-19 vaccine shipment||In what could be a turning point in relations between New Delhi and Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested a shipment of Covid-19 vaccines.PM Modi took to Twitter to say that he “was happy to receive a call from my friend, @JustinTrudeau” and added, “Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of Covid vaccines sought by Canada. We also agreed to continue to collaborate on other important issues like climate change and the global economic recovery.”Later, Trudeau tweeted that he had a “good discussion” with Modi “on many important issues” and they had “agreed to stay in touch”.Indian officials said the vaccines manufactured in India will be those from AstraZeneca, sourced from the Serum Institute of India (SII). The dispatch of shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canada is believed to be “imminent” and only awaiting emergency-use authorisation by public health authorities in Canada. Verity Pharmaceuticals, a firm based in the Greater Toronto Area town of Mississauga, is believed to be working with SII for the imports.There is optimism that the vaccine deal will also result in an improvement in ties between the two countries that were affected after Trudeau had made controversial remarks about the ongoing farmers’ protest in India late last year. His remark had attracted a sharp reaction from New Delhi.That subject was mentioned obliquely in a readout issued by the Canadian PMO, but couched in diplomatic language. It said, “The leaders discussed Canada and India’s commitment to democratic principles, recent protests, and the importance of resolving issues through dialogue.”A senior official said this was a “respectful and generic formulation” that applied to protests in both countries, whether they are against farm laws in India or over indigenous rights in Canada.The call, which lasted nearly half an hour, was described as “positive”.The Indian statement said Trudeau informed Modi “about Canada’s requirements of Covid-19 vaccines from India” and the latter “assured the Canadian PM that India would do its best to support Canada’s vaccination efforts, just as it had done for many other countries already”.“Expressing his appreciation, Prime Minister Trudeau said that if the world managed to conquer Covid-19, it would be significantly because of India’s tremendous pharmaceutical capacity, and Prime Minister Modi’s leadership in sharing this capacity with the world,” it added.During a media interaction on Wednesday, Trudeau echoed that sentiment, saying, “I can highlight that India has been a great partner in fighting Covid, whether it’s helping us with delivery of other pharmaceuticals or whether it’s working together on potential vaccines.”The Canadian PMO’s release recognised “India’s significant efforts in promoting vaccine production and supply, which have provided vital support to countries around the world”.It said the “two leaders agreed to work together on access to vaccines’ and “recognised the need for continued global coordination to respond to the pandemic and to promote recovery”.Another significant topic of conversation appeared in the Canadian readout, as it stated the two PMs “reaffirmed their common interests in a free and open Indo-Pacific”. This is the formulation that has been used by the Quad nations - the United States, Australia, Japan and India - and signals that Canada is increasingly inching closer to the group as its relations with China continue to sour.The Trudeau government has faced criticism in recent weeks as its projected inoculation programme has run into difficulty due to shortage of vaccine shipments from Pfizer and Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-calls-up-narendra-modi-seeks-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-101613026813753.html

11-02-2021||World||Suu Kyi aide among new wave of arrests in Myanmar as Biden approves sanctions||A close aide to ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained in a new wave of arrests following last week's military coup, a party official said on Thursday, as Washington moved a step closer to imposing sanctions on the junta.The aide, Kyaw Tint Swe, had served as minister for the office of the state counsellor under Suu Kyi, who has been detained since the Feb. 1 coup.Kyi Toe, an information committee member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), said Kyaw Tint Swe and four other people linked to the previous government had been taken from their homes overnight.He said officials of the electoral commission had also been arrested overnight, including some down to township level, but he did not immediately have an exact number of those arrested.The military launched the coup after what it said was widespread fraud in November elections, won by the NLD in a landslide. The electoral commission had rejected those claims.Myanmar authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Reuters was unable to confirm the arrests independently. Scores of officials have been detained since the coup.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved an executive order for new sanctions on those responsible for the coup, and repeated demands for the generals to give up power and free civilian leaders.Biden said the order enabled his administration "to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests as well as close family members."Washington would identify the first round of targets this week and was taking steps to prevent the generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma, having access to $1 billion in Myanmar government funds held in the United States."We're also going to impose strong exports controls. We're freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese government, while maintaining our support for health care, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly," Biden said at the White House.The Feb. 1 coup and detention of Suu Kyi presents Biden with his first major international crisis, and a test of his dual pledges to re-center human rights in foreign policy and work more closely with allies.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was rolling out collective actions with partners on Myanmar."We can impose substantial costs ourselves. We can impose costs that are even steeper ... by working with our like-minded partners and allies," he told a briefing.ASIAN INFLUENCEEven so, analysts say Myanmar's new junta will not be as isolated as previous iterations, with China, India, Southeast Asian neighbours and Japan unlikely to cut ties given the country's strategic importance.Derek Mitchell, a former US ambassador to Myanmar, said it was vital to get nations such as Japan, India and Singapore involved in a strong response."The key will not be just what America does," he said. "It’s going to be how we get others along with us, allies who may have more skin in the game, more leverage, or at least better relationships with the key players."The United Nations' top human rights body is to consider a resolution on Friday drafted by Britain and the European Union condemning the coup and demanding urgent access for monitors.However, diplomats said China and Russia - which both have ties to Myanmar's armed forces - are expected to raise objections or try to weaken the text. The UN Security Council issued a statement last week calling for Suu Kyi's release but stopping short of condemning the coup.Also read: Myanmar largest trade union joins civil disobedience movement: ReportAlso read: Myanmar military raids Suu Kyi's party offices as UN slams violenceFESTIVE PROTESTSProtests spilled into a sixth straight day on Thursday.Hundreds of workers lined a road in the capital Naypyitaw in support of the Civil Disobedience Movement, chanting anti-junta slogans and carrying placards that read "reject military coup" and "save Myanmar". Some held up pictures of Suu Kyi with the words "we trust our leader".After a woman was shot in violent clashes on Tuesday, protests on Wednesday took on a festive air, with bare-chested body builders, women in ball gowns and wedding dresses, farmers on tractors and people with their pets.The protests have revived memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated with bloody army crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.Washington's sanctions are likely to target coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and other top generals who are already under US sanctions imposed in 2019 over abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.It could also target military holding companies with investments spanning sectors including banking, gems, copper, telecoms and clothing.Suu Kyi, 75, won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for democracy and remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Rohingyas.She has spent nearly 15 years under house arrest and now faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies.

What other reason is there for these resolutions?" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.Polish officials did not respond to requests for comment.International pressure is growing on Poland's nationalist government, with regions that oppose "LGBT ideology" labelled "humanity-free zones" by EU president Ursula von der Leyen.Reported hate crimes against LGBT+ people more than doubled to 150 in 2019, according to official data cited in the report. Only 16% of Polish LGBT+ people reported the latest homophobic attack they had suffered to police, a 2020 EU survey found.Poland says the local resolutions have no legal standing."(They) are only opinions and do not affect rights and obligations of the residents," Poland's minister of funds and regional policy, Malgorzata Jarosinska-Jedynak, said in an October letter to Norwegian officials.Some countries and international organisations have suspended funding for the conservative southern and eastern Polish regions that passed the resolutions.Norway has suspended 3.5 million euros ($4.2 million) of funding for two cultural projects. In July, the EU rejected six applications for town-twinning grants of up to 25,000 euros from such authorities.

Other large states - Queensland and Western Australia - are yet to report their numbers.Australia was one of the first countries to call for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan, an action that sparked a diplomatic backlash from Beijing which has since slapped hefty duties or banned several Australian products from its shores.The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday that an Australian scientist, part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) team investigating the origins of COVID-19, told the paper he believed the virus began in China, despite WHO’s official findings remaining inconclusive."I think the evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it’s not really very good," said Professor Dominic Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert with NSW Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cluster-in-australia-s-melbourne-sparks-mass-testing-101613014357782.html

11-02-2021||World||Migration through Panama resumes after pandemic lockdown||After nearly a year stalled in migrant camps at the edge of the jungle, hundreds of migrants have begun to move across Panama and into neighbouring Costa Rica in recent weeks.Panama closed its borders last March to try to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 2,000 migrants suddenly found their years-long journey toward the United States suspended.But on January 29, Panama announced it was reopening its land borders, setting off a surge of migration through the dense jungle covering the Colombia-Panama border.On Wednesday afternoon, more than 50 migrants trudged out of the dense Darien jungle into the village of Bajo Chiquito, the first community they encountered after days of walking. Pregnant women, adults carrying babies in their arms and others with bags of clothing balanced atop their heads forded a river and then scrambled up the bank to waiting border police.They were told to line up to register their entry into Panama. No measures — temperature checks or social distancing — against coronavirus infection were on display. Only one man carrying his daughter wore a mask.Kerline Mervilier, a 29-year-old from Haiti, made it into the line and collapsed complaining of pain in her legs. She had traveled with boyfriend Isaac Cadichon from Brazil. She left Haiti for Brazil in December 2019, but after losing her job in a beauty salon there decided to migrate again.They started to walk into the jungle in Colombia on Friday, emerging in Panama five days later. They were among 287 migrants who entered Panama Wednesday, according to border police.“I hope to get to a destination where I can find work,” Mervilier said, holding her passport and that of her boyfriend in her hands. Her mother lives in New Jersey. “My country is a tragedy and forces us to look for a new life. We had to climb mountains. They assaulted me and stole $160 while I walked.”There were some 400 migrants in Bajo Chiquito on Wednesday and more have been arriving every day as others continue on. It’s a three-hour boat ride to the nearest highway. They recover from their jungle walk in an array of colorful tents pitched beside the border police station and on a basketball court.Many of the migrants are Haitians, but others come of Cuba, Venezuela and various African and Asian countries.As they continue into Panama, many pass through a new migrant camp in San Vicente, also in Darien, but reachable by road.Paul Saenz, a 27-year-old electrician from Haiti, flew to Ecuador in December. He then took a bus to Colombia near the Panama border, joined other Haitian migrants and crossed the jungle into Panama in three days. He said Tuesday he wanted to make it to the US to help his family back in Haiti.The new US administration with a kinder tone toward immigrants gave him hope.“I hope it goes well for us,” he said. “This president (Joe Biden) is better than the other who was a little harder.”Ovidia Fernández, left Havana, Cuba two years ago with her daughter Anabel. They spent time in Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. They arrived in San Vicente on Sunday after walking through the jungle for 13 days.“There could be a chance of entering the United States,” she said. “There are people who believe that with the change (of administration) there’s hope.”José Bernal, local commissioner for Panama’s National Borders Service said the flow of migrants typically picks up during this time of year, when the rains pause. He said the pandemic restrictions sharply decreased the number of migrants who passed through last year to 8,000, down from 24,000 in 2019.“The American dream continues driving people to move despite the pandemic,” Bernal said.Idiam Osorio, a specialist with the UN’s International Organization for Migration in Panama, said the change of government in the US was just one among a variety of factors spurring people to migrate. “We don’t dismiss that this issue (the new US administration) is also connected to the growing motivation of migrants who have started to move, but the reasons are diverse, including economic (reasons),” she said.Saenz and other recent arrivals stay at two migrant camps in Laja Blanca and San Vicente in the Darien area that borders Colombia. The first is made up of tents and portable toilets, while the second, which opened in late September, has small prefabricated buildings for the migrants.Panama’s National Immigration Service said that since January 29, some 551 migrants have left those camps and moved to Panama’s border with Costa Rica, something they previously had not been allowed to do during the pandemic.The agency also says that only 168 migrants were currently in its camp in Los Planes, Chiriqui near that border, suggesting that the others had continued on into Costa Rica.Officials said Tuesday that an estimated 1,000 migrants were in Darien, including 276 of whom arrived Monday night to small community of Bajo Chiquito, the first populated area migrants emerging from the jungle encounter. Immigration officials said they expect another 800 migrants to arrive from Colombia in the coming days.Haitian Wisnel Olly, 41, had recently arrived with his wife and their 4-month-old twins. The twins were born in Chile where the family had lived for the past two years.Unlike Saenz, Olly said it took his family two weeks to cross the Darien jungle. Their goal was to continue on as soon as possible with the goal of making it to Mexico “where we’ll be taken care of.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migration-through-panama-resumes-after-pandemic-lockdown-101613009153582.html

The leadership has failed us, and we have paid a terrible price," Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chairman, said in a statement.Over 140 police officers between the Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police forces were injured. Some officers sustained brain injuries, one is expected to lose an eye and another officer was stabbed with a metal fence stake, according to The Hill.On January 6, a group of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest legislators confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid.Five people died in the riot, including one Air Force veteran and a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police.Following the violence, the US House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Trump for "inciting" last week's deadly violence at Capitol Hill, making him the first US President to be impeached twice.Trump is currently undergoing his second impeachment trial, where House managers seek to prove that Trump incited violence by stubbornly refusing to accept the election defeat and bar him from holding any public office including running for president in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-to-hold-no-confidence-vote-against-senior-leadership-101613009170177.html
11-02-2021||World||Biden backs off on TikTok ban in review of Trump's China moves||The Biden administration is backing off former President Donald Trump's attempts to ban the popular video app TikTok, asking a judge to postpone a legal dispute over the proposed ban as the government begins a broader review of the national security threats posed by Chinese technology companies.A court filing Wednesday said the U.S. Commerce Department is reviewing whether Trump's claims about TikTok's threat to national security justified the attempts to ban it from smartphone app stores and deny it vital technical services.Separately, the Biden administration has “indefinitely” shelved a proposed U.S. takeover of the TikTok, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Last year, the Trump administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in the Chinese-owned app on national-security grounds.The unusual arrangement stemmed from a Trump executive order that aimed to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it accepted a greater degree of American control.White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not deny the Journal report, but said Wednesday the Biden administration hasn't taken a “new proactive step” in the process.Psaki added that the Biden administration is comprehensively evaluating risks to U.S. data, including those involving TikTok. A review of TikTok by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which considers national security implications of such investments, is ongoing, Psaki said. She didn't offer a timetable for that process.Trump targeted TikTok over the summer with a series of executive orders that cited concerns over the U.S. data that TikTok collects from its users. But courts temporarily blocked the White House’s attempted ban, and the presidential election soon took overshadowed the TikTok fight.While President Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, his administration hadn't said whether it will continue to try to ban TikTok or force a sale. Biden has so far taken a cautious approach to inheriting Trump’s China policies and hasn’t promised to scale back or cancel tariffs and other combative measures.The Biden administration appears to be creating a clearer set of criteria to evaluate which Chinese technology platforms pose a legitimate security risk to Americans, said Samm Sacks, a China expert at Yale Law School.“I don’t think they see TikTok itself as a high-priority issue,” she said, calling it a hypothetical future threat. “This one-off ban on a rotating cast of Chinese tech companies, that’s not likely to continue.”In September, Trump gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance that would form a new U.S. arm of TikTok in partnership with Oracle and Walmart, who would make significant investments in the new company. The arrangement aimed to hand management of the app's U.S. user data to Oracle. CFIUS, however, has not completed its required review of the arrangement. A government deadline for TikTok to sell its U.S. operations has passed.TikTok is now looking to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review Trump’s divestment order and the government’s national-security review.TikTok and Oracle didn't return requests for comment Wednesday. Walmart declined comment Wednesday and referred questions to the Biden administration.The Treasury Department, which chairs the CFIUS agency reviewing the TikTok deal, did not reply to a request for comment. Neither did the Commerce Department, which last year had sought to enforce Trump’s orders, nor the Justice Department, which is handling the court challenges.The Chinese government's stance toward the deal is unclear. State media in September criticized the proposal as U.S. bullying and extortion.Trump cited concerns that the Chinese government could spy on TikTok users if the app remains under Chinese ownership. TikTok has denied it’s a security threat but said it was still trying to work with the U.S. government to resolve its concerns.TikTok said Oracle and Walmart could acquire up to a combined 20% stake in the new company ahead of a TikTok initial public offering, which Walmart said could happen within the next year. Oracle’s stake would be 12.5%, and Walmart’s would be 7.5%.Where Oracle stood to handle data management, Walmart said it would provide e-commerce, fulfillment, payments and other services to the new company. TikTok said in a November court filing that the new entity, owned by Oracle, Walmart and ByteDance's existing U.S. investors, would be responsible for TikTok’s U.S. user data and content moderation.The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics were part of a broader effort to counter the influence of China. During his term in office, Trump waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.The Biden administration shares many of the Trump administration’s concerns about Chinese technology and trade practices, but they’re likely to use “different tactics and tone on how to achieve those strategic objectives,” said Martijn Rasser, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.“They’re taking a holistic, strategic approach to these issues and not going after these companies on a one-off basis,” he said. “It’s part of a broader reassessment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-backs-off-on-tiktok-ban-in-review-of-trump-s-china-moves-101613000949952.html
11-02-2021||World||Myanmar protesters back on streets despite police violence||Large crowds demonstrating against the military takeover in Myanmar again defied a ban on protests Wednesday, even after security forces ratcheted up the use of force against them and raided the headquarters of the political party of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Witnesses estimated that tens of thousands of protesters, if not more, turned out in Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s biggest cities. Rallies also took place in the capital Naypyitaw and elsewhere.The protesters are demanding that power be restored to Suu Kyi’s deposed civilian government. They are also seeking freedom for her and other governing party members since the military detained them after blocking the new session of Parliament on Feb. 1.“As part of Generation Z, we are first-time voters. This is our first time to protest as well,” said one student who declined to give her name for fear of harassment. “They negated our votes, and this is totally unfair. We do not want that. We hope they release our leaders and implement a real democracy.”The military says it acted because November’s election, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won in a landslide, were marred by irregularities. The election commission had refuted the allegation.Some demonstrators in Yangon gathered at foreign embassies to seek international pressure against the coup.A small group outside the Japanese Embassy held signs and chanted “We want democracy, we get dictators!” They sat in several children's wading pools, three or fewer per pool, in what appeared to be a tongue-in-cheek way of showing compliance with an emergency law that bans gatherings of more than five people.Others marched through the city, chanting and waving flags of Suu Kyi’s party.Another group hauled a fake coffin as part of a mock funeral for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the military chief who is the country’s new leader.Civil servants in many areas have been risking their jobs to march with the protesters, and even some police have switched sides to oppose the coup. In a dramatic video shot Wednesday in a small village in Kayah State in eastern Myanmar, a group of 42 policemen and women declared their allegiance to the ousted elected government and resisted the entreaties of a senior officer to return to duty. Local residents flocked to their side to ward off any effort to arrest them.The head of the U.N. International Labor Organization, Guy Ryder, urged Myanmar’s military leaders “to ensure that workers and employers are able to exercise their freedom of association rights in a climate of complete freedom and security, free from violence and threats.”“I call on the military to immediately remove orders restricting assemblies of more than five persons, a halt to the repression of dissenting voices and the full respect of workers’ fundamental and human rights and freedoms,” Ryder said. “I urge military leaders to ensure no workers, including civil servants, are detained, intimidated or harassed for participating in peaceful protests.”The burgeoning protests and the junta’s latest raid suggest there is little room for reconciliation. The military, which ruled directly for five decades after a 1962 coup, used deadly force to quash a massive 1988 uprising and a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks.In Naypyitaw and Mandalay on Tuesday, police sprayed water cannons and fired warning shots to try to clear away protesters. In Naypyitaw, they shot rubber bullets and apparently live rounds, wounding a woman protester, according to witnesses and footage on social media. The reports could not be independently confirmed.Human Rights Watch cited a doctor at a Naypyitaw hospital as saying the woman was in critical condition. The doctor said the woman had a projectile lodged in her head, believed to be a bullet that had penetrated the back of the right ear, and had lost significant brain function. The doctor said a man had been also been treated with an upper body wound consistent with that of live ammunition.State television network MRTV, in one of its few reports on the protests, on Tuesday night broadcast scenes it claimed showed the protesters were responsible for the violence.“Myanmar police should immediately end the use of excessive and lethal force” the New York-based watchdog urged.No major incidents were reported in connection with the big turnout at Wednesday's protest in Mandalay. Social media users said 82 people who had been arrested were freed due to the work of local lawyers.Medical students and personnel, lawyers and Buddhist monks were among a huge cross-section of residents who marched in Mandalay, but the most social media buzz was generated by a contingent of shirtless muscled men with well-defined six-packs who were said to be members of a fitness gym.Yangon’s most photogenic marchers were a group of young women who dressed in formal gowns more suitable for a wedding reception.The military on Tuesday night raided the national headquarters of Suu Kyi’s party, which before the military seized power had been slated to take power for a second five-year term.Kyi Toe, a spokesman for the party, wrote on Facebook that the army broke into the headquarters in Yangon and another office and took away documents and computer hardware. The headquarters was shuttered Wednesday.U.S. President Joe Biden ordered new sanctions Wednesday, saying he was issuing an executive order that will prevent Myanmar’s generals from accessing $1 billion in assets in the United States. Biden added that more measures are to come.“The military must relinquish power it seized and demonstrate respect for the will of the people of Burma,” he said.A day earlier, the U.S. had “strongly” condemned the violence against demonstrators.“We repeat our calls for the military to relinquish power, restore democratically elected government, release those detained, and lift all telecommunication restrictions, and to refrain from violence,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.New Zealand suspended all military and high-level political contact with Myanmar, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced in Wellington, adding that any New Zealand aid should not go to or benefit Myanmar’s military government.The U.N. Human Rights Council, the 47-member-state body based in Geneva, is to hold a special session on Friday to consider “the human rights implications of the crisis in Myanmar.”Britain and the European Union spearheaded the request for the session, which will amount to a high-profile public debate among diplomats over the situation in Myanmar and could lead to a resolution airing concerns about the situation or recommending international action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-back-on-streets-despite-police-violence-101613000970865.html
11-02-2021||World||US pharmacies to offer Covid-19 vaccines from today. All you need to know||With the Biden administration targeting 150 million shots injected within its first 100 days of office, pharmacies in the United States will begin to offer Covid-19 vaccines from February 11 under the federal retail pharmacy program. The program would initially be limited to 6,500 participating pharmacies in the US and will eventually be expanded to around 40,000 pharmacies. The US government will allocate vaccines under the pharmacy program based on the population of the states and the program is expected to be slow at first because of the limited supply of the vaccines.What will be the cost of the Covid-19 vaccine?The vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Participating pharmacies will bill private and public insurance for the vaccine administration fee. For uninsured patients, the fee will be reimbursed through the Health resources and services administration’s provider relief fund.Which pharmacy chains will be part of the program?According to the White House, the program will include, Walgreens, CVS pharmacy, Walmart, Rite Aid, Kroger, Publix, Costco, Albertsons, Hy-Vee, Meijer, H-E-B, Winn-Dixie and retail business services like Food Lion, Giant Food, The Giant Company, Hannaford Bros Co, Stop & Shop.How to get the vaccination?Individuals who are eligible for vaccination and are interested in getting vaccinated will have to check the CDC website to see if their local pharmacy is participating in the program and then call or check with their local pharmacy’s website to find out if the vaccine is available. Most pharmacy partners will be using online scheduling systems to schedule vaccination visits for eligible individuals.Who will be receiving vaccination under this program?The eligibility criteria for the vaccination will be determined by each state individually and the pharmacy partners will focus on vaccinating individuals who are eligible for vaccination based on these state-selected criteria.What will be the screening process that the pharmacies will use during the vaccination?Pharmacies will screen individuals to determine their vaccination eligibility according to the state’s vaccination plan for which individuals may be asked about their age, occupation, or underlying medical conditions. But pharmacies will not require any proof of age, occupation, or any other type of credentials. This means that no specific identification documents are required for the vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pharmacies-to-offer-covid-19-vaccines-from-today-all-you-need-to-know-101613007626467.html
11-02-2021||World||US calls for China to end 'unacceptable' detention of Canadians||The United States on Wednesday (local time) rejected China's use of coercion as a political tool and called on the People's Republic of China (PRC) to end the 'unacceptable detention of two Canadian citizens."When it comes to the detention of Micheal Spavor and Michael Kovrig, we continue to publicly call on the PRC to end the arbitrary and unacceptable detention of these Canadian citizens. We reject the PRC's use of coercion as political tool," said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price in a press briefing.This comes after US State Secretary Antony Blinken had a telephonic conversation with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi during which he conveyed that Washington will continue to stand up for human rights and democratic values, including in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and will hold Beijing accountable for its abuses of the international system.Last year, Canada had walked away from the free trade talks with Beijing amid souring relations over a Huawei executive's arrest and the detention of two Canadians in apparent retaliation.According to Canadian foreign minister Francois Philippe Champagne, Beijing's "arbitrary detention" of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor on suspicions of espionage, in response to the December 2018 arrest of telecom's giant Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on the US warrant during a stopover in Vancouver are the reasons behind the shelving of the talks.Relations between Ottawa and Beijing soured after Canadian authorities detained Wanzhou in 2018 at the request of the US, which was followed by the arrests of two Canadian nationals on charges of espionage in China, reported Sputnik.The tense relationship has been further exacerbated by Canada's condemnation of the newly enacted Chinese law on national security in Hong Kong and a suspension of some bilateral agreements with the special administrative region.Beijing has said that it reserves the right to respond to any interference on Canada's part and the Canadian side will be held accountable for all the consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-for-china-to-end-unacceptable-detention-of-canadians-101613007344326.html
11-02-2021||World||Joe Biden visits a Pentagon hoping to shift from Trump turmoil||President Joe Biden visited the Pentagon on Wednesday for the first time as commander in chief, taking stock of the military as it pivots from the turmoil of the Trump years and focuses to an unusual degree on domestic and internal issues.Biden was meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior military and civilian leaders, and addressing the Pentagon workforce.As defense leaders await direction from Biden on possible new approaches to overseas security threats, Austin is treating the coronavirus pandemic as a top priority and ordering fresh assessments of how to root out sexual assault and extremism in the military's ranks.Austin himself is in the spotlight after winning Senate confirmation as only the third recently retired military officer to lead the Pentagon. Critics have questioned whether his appointment, which required a congressional waiver, weakens the principle of civilian control of the military.Austin moved quickly to surround himself with a core of civilian assistants, including Kelly Magsamen, a defense policy expert and former Pentagon official who is now his chief of staff. The deputy defense secretary is Kathleen Hicks, a policy expert and the first woman to win Senate confirmation for that position.Austin spent 41 years in the Army, retiring in 2016 as a four-star general after heading US Central Command. During Biden's years as vice president in the Obama administration, he worked with Austin on winding down U.S. involvement in Iraq, where Austin was the top commander in 2010-11.During the Trump administration, the Pentagon endured a loss of top-flight civilian talent, in part because of instability at the top. Trump had two Senate-confirmed defense secretaries, as well as three secretaries who held the role in an acting capacity. Morale suffered and some senior positions went unfilled.Biden had considered choosing Michele Flournoy to lead the Pentagon; she would have been the first woman in that job. Instead he picked Austin, who is the first Black defense secretary and in Biden's view is the right person at a time of evolving security threats and continuing risk from the coronavirus.On his first day in office, Austin issued a message to the force that emphasised his commitment to finding ways the military can help the government move “further and faster” to fight the pandemic. Already there are more than 24,000 National Guard members providing logistical support for the vaccine program and giving as many as 50,000 shots per day.Last week, the Pentagon announced it will deploy more than 1,100 troops to five vaccination centers at the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This marks the first wave of increased military support for the national vaccination campaign.The military is preparing to deploy the first team of about 222 service members to a vaccination center in California, and it says it is ready to deploy four similar teams to other centers when FEMA is ready. FEMA has asked the Pentagon to supply as many as 10,000 troops to staff 100 centers, but Austin is approving the teams incrementally as the locations are identified.Austin also is pushing for policy adjustments to account for the effects of climate change on military missions, as well as the consequences of extreme weather events on domestic military bases.Austin is preparing to address other Biden priorities, including an assessment of how to deal with the national security challenges posed by China's modernized and more assertive military. He has said he intends to visit the Asia-Pacific region as early in his tenure as possible.The Pentagon is participating in an administration assessment of the peace deal the Trump administration struck with the Taliban one year ago. The deal requires the United States to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by May, a deadline the Biden administration is reassessing.Austin also is launching a broad review of how U.S. forces are positioned around the world. In announcing his “global force posture review” last week, he said it will assess the military “footprint, resources, strategy and missions.”On the home front, Austin has inherited the aftereffects of the Jan. 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill. On Inauguration Day, there were about 26,000 National Guard troops in Washington providing security, though the number as of Tuesday had dropped to 6,200. The number is expected to drop to about 5,000 by the end of the month, with the remainder gone by mid-March.In addition to his ordered reviews of sexual assault programs and extremism in the ranks, Austin has launched a review of all defense advisory panels as part of a move to purge several dozen people who were last-minute appointments in the final weeks of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-visits-a-pentagon-hoping-to-shift-from-trump-turmoil-101613006796973.html
11-02-2021||World||WHO expert group recommends use of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||Independent experts advising the World Health Organization on Wednesday recommended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine even in countries that turned up worrying coronavirus variants in their populations.There had been doubts about the vaccine's effectiveness against a variant that emerged in South Africa.The advice is used by health care officials worldwide, but doesn't amount to a WHO green light for the UN and its partners to ship the vaccine. That approval could come after separate WHO group meetings on Friday and Monday to assess whether an emergency-use listing for the AstraZeneca vaccine is warranted.Wednesday's recommendations largely mirror those issued earlier by the European Medicines Agency and UK regulator MHRA.The AstraZeneca vaccine is important because the UN-backed COVAX Facility, which aims to deploy coronavirus vaccines to people in need around the world whether in rich or poor countries, hopes to start shipping hundreds of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine starting later this month.Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist, called the findings from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts an “important milestone.”She noted that the vaccine requires storage at refrigerator temperatures — not the far colder temperatures required of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that the group has already recommended for use. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one to receive a WHO emergency use listing.The expert group noted that “preliminary analyses” showed the AstraZeneca vaccine had reduced effectiveness against coronavirus variants that have emerged in Britain and South Africa.SAGE also said international travelers shouldn't get preference for vaccine doses, saying that would “counter the principle of equity” as well as a lack of evidence about whether vaccinations reduces the risk of transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-expert-group-recommends-use-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101613006544893.html
11-02-2021||World||Covid-19 origin probe ends, politics over it continues||China called on the US on Wednesday to invite the World Health Organization (WHO) to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak there, as sparring over the pandemic continued after the WHO wrapped up its field work in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Hours after the WHO team revealed preliminary findings at a Wuhan news conference on Tuesday, Washington said it wants to scrutinise data used by the team, which concluded that the coronavirus causing Covid-19 did not originate in a laboratory in Wuhan, and that bats remain a likely source.“We wish that the US side can, like China, uphold an open and transparent attitude, and be able to invite WHO experts to the US to conduct origin tracing research and inspection,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.Also Read | WHO's Wuhan team identifies two ‘most likely' scenarios of Covid-19 transmission to humansThe origins of the pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan in 2019, are highly politicised, with China claiming that the virus has roots outside its borders.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that the Biden administration had not been involved in the “planning and implementation” of the WHO investigation and wants to take an independent review of its findings and underlying data.Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, waded directly into the geopolitics surrounding the pandemic origin story.Biden “has to look tough on China”, he said in a tweet. “Please don’t rely too much on US intel: increasingly disengaged under Trump & frankly wrong on many aspects.”Peter Ben Embarek, who heads the WHO-led team that spent four weeks in China, said the investigation has not dramatically changed its picture of the outbreak.Meanwhile, two new Covid-19 variants, one of which has been classified as a “concern”, have been identified in England with similarities to the South African and Brazilian variants, a government advisory scientific committee said on Tuesday. Both are being probed. One of the new variants, first identified in Bristol, has been designated a “Variant of Concern”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-probe-ends-politics-over-it-continues-101613006039261.html
11-02-2021||World||Pentagon establishes task force to meet China challenge||The Pentagon has established a task force to provide recommendations in the next few months to address the challenge posed by China, US President Joe Biden said Wednesday."The task force will work quickly, drawing on civilian and military experts across the Department, to provide, within the next few months, recommendations to (Defense) Secretary (Lloyd) Austin on key priorities and decision points so that we can chart a strong path forward on China-related matters,” Biden said in his remarks during his maiden visit to the Pentagon on Wednesday."It will require a whole-of-government effort, bipartisan cooperation in Congress, and strong alliances and partnerships. That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition of the future,” he said.To be headed by Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Dr. Ely Ratner, the task force will provide its final findings and recommendations no later than four months after establishment. No final public report is anticipated, although the Department will discuss recommendations with the Congress and other stakeholders as appropriate, the Pentagon said in a statement.In his address, Biden said that the US needs to take on the dangers and opportunities of emerging technologies, enhance its capabilities in cyberspace, ensure that America is positioned to lead in a new era of competition, from deep sea to outer space.“And we need to meet the growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally,” he said. Vice President Kamala Harris also visited the Pentagon along with Biden.Biden, Austin and Harris did a walk-through tour of the African-American heritage hall at the Pentagon.Meanwhile, Senator Rob Portman urged the Biden Administration to reconsider its decision to withdraw a rule proposed by the Trump Administration to require American schools and universities to disclose partnerships with Confucius Institutes and Classrooms.“The Biden Administration's decision to withdraw this rule is deeply disappointing and surprising considering the serious nature of China's efforts to expand its influence operations inside the United States. I urge them to reconsider,” Portman said.Congressman John Katko, lead Republican of the House Committee on Homeland Security, also opposed the move of the Biden Administration to withdraw a proposed rule requiring US educational institutions to disclose their relationship with Confucius Institutes, entities in US colleges and schools funded by China's Ministry of Education.In another development, Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Marco Rubio, Co-Chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), called on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to detail the nature of his company's dealings with Dahua Technology Co., a Chinese company that has reportedly developed facial recognition software to recognise and report detection of Uyghur Muslims to Chinese authorities, facilitating the Chinese government’s ongoing genocide and other crimes against humanity against the Uyghur people.“These reports are extremely disturbing, and show that the comprehensive surveillance system that Chinese authorities have deployed against the Uyghurs is just as bad as we had feared, if not worse,” the Senators wrote, citing troubling software features including the “Real-time Uyghur Warnings” that report individuals with specified facial traits to Chinese security forces immediately.The Senators in their letter also raised questions concerning Bezos’ awareness of Dahua Technology's status on the Commerce Department's Entity List when his company entered into negotiations and agreed to a USD10 million contract with the Chinese company as well as Amazon's criteria to determine when to terminate a business relationship with an entity that engages in human rights violations.“While buying equipment from Dahua Technology is not illegal, it does raise several questions for you as the Chief Executive of Amazon,” the Senators added. “If these allegations against Dahua are true, it would mean that Amazon willfully ignored guidance from the United States government and purchased equipment from an entity-listed company that is complicit in China's atrocities against the Uyghurs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-establishes-task-force-to-meet-china-challenge-101613005850045.html
11-02-2021||World||Covid-19 conspiracies fuel anti-semitic incidents in UK: Report||The number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded in Britain has fallen from record levels but still remains high, with conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic playing a role, a Jewish advisory body said on Thursday.The Community Security Trust (CST), which advises Britain’s estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, said there had been 1,668 incidents in 2020, a fall of 8% from the previous year which had been the highest on record.Despite the decrease, the CST said it was still the third-highest number they had reported since the data was first collected in 1984."The COVID-19 outbreak has not merely given rise to a new medium through which offenders express anti-Semitic sentiment; it has provided them with new strands of anti-Semitic discourse as well," the report said.The CST said there had been 41 incidents connected to the pandemic, from conspiracy theories of Jewish involvement in spreading the disease for malevolent and financial purposes, to expressions of hope that Jews would catch the virus and die.Although there were fewer incidents at schools or synagogues because of strict pandemic lockdowns, there was a rise in cases at people’s homes, the report said.Of the total incidents, 100 were rated as violent, a 39% fall from the year before, although three were classified as "Extreme Violence", meaning they involved potential grievous bodily harm or a threat to life."It is shameful that in the 21st century, the Jewish community still faces racist abuse and the desecration of their synagogues and other religious and community sites," Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said.The record incidents of 2019 were fuelled in part by accusations of anti-Semitism in the opposition Labour Party.In October, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (ECHR) said Labour was responsible for unlawful harassment and discrimination in its handling of allegations of anti-Semitism, leading to the party suspending its former leader Jeremy Corbyn.The CST said there had been 175 incidents in 2020 connected to Labour, a decline from previous years, although there was a spike at the time of the ECHR report and after the decision to keep Corbyn out of the parliamentary party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-conspiracies-fuel-anti-semitic-incidents-in-uk-report-101613004425064.html
11-02-2021||World||Brexit poses ‘existential’ threat to some UK firms, BCC says||Many UK small firms are facing an “existential” threat as they grapple with obstacles Brexit has imposed on trade with the European Union, one of the country’s largest business groups said.About half of UK exporters are experiencing difficulties, mainly in the form of extra documentation, higher costs, and delays to shipments, according to a survey of 465 firms by the British Chambers of Commerce. About 95% of the respondents were small businesses.Since Britain left the EU’s single market and customs union on Jan. 1, firms have had to adapt to a raft of new paperwork when sending goods to the EU, the UK’s biggest and closest trading partner. Agricultural exports -- in particular food and meat -- have been particularly badly hit by the need to provide export health certificates signed by a qualified vet, leaving trucks that once moved freely across the Channel facing days-long delays at times.Companies “are being hit hard by changes at the border,” said Adam Marshall, director-general of the BCC. “For some firms, these concerns are existential.”Businesses are also bracing for extra controls which will apply to imports from the EU from April and July, threatening to coincide with rising economic activity as the UK emerges from lockdown restrictions. Marshall said the government should postpone these controls, and significantly increase the support it offers to firms.“This situation could get worse,” he said. “These timescales need to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-poses-existential-threat-to-some-uk-firms-bcc-says-101613004075377.html
11-02-2021||World||UK's Duchess Meghan to hear if she has won privacy case or if it will face trial||Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, will learn on Thursday whether she has won her privacy battle against a tabloid newspaper without the case going to a potentially-embarrassing trial which could see her face off against her father. Meghan, 39, the wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers after its Mail on Sunday tabloid printed extracts of the handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.She says the articles breached her privacy and copyright, and last month her lawyers asked London High Court judge Mark Warby to rule in her favour without the need for trial later this year, arguing the paper had no chance of winning.Warby is due to hand down his verdict at 1600 GMT.Meghan wrote the five-page letter to Markle after their relationship collapsed in the run-up to her glittering wedding to Harry in May 2018, which her father missed due to ill health and after he admitted posing for paparazzi pictures.The Mail published extracts in Feb. 2019, and has argued it did so to allow Markle to respond to comments made by Meghan's anonymous friends in interviews with the US magazine People.In two days of hearings, her lawyers say printing the "personal and sensitive" letter was a "triple-barrelled" assault on "her private life, her family life and her correspondence" and plainly breached her privacy.The paper argued the duchess always intended the letter's contents to become public and it formed part of a media strategy, pointing out she had admitted in court papers discussing it with her communications secretary.If the judge rules against Meghan, it raises the prospect of the duchess, former senior royal aides and her father all giving evidence in court."It was only by publishing the text of the letter that I could properly set the record straight and show that what People magazine had published was false and unfair," Markle said in a witness statement in support of the Mail.The trial had been due to start in January but was delayed until late 2021 at Meghan's request last year because of a confidential reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-duchess-meghan-to-hear-if-she-has-won-privacy-case-or-if-it-will-face-trial-101613002846181.html
11-02-2021||World||Biden, Xi plan first call as soon as Wednesday evening in US||President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are preparing to speak on Wednesday for the first time since the new administration in Washington took office last month, according to two people familiar with the matter.The conversation between the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies will take place as tensions remain high over issues including Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong, trade, technology and human rights in Xinjiang, among other issues.A White House spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.The call was arranged after Biden had spoken with numerous other counterparts around the world, including European and Asian allies and even Russian President Vladimir Putin.Xi and Biden have pledged to find common ground where they can, including on topics such as climate change. Yet Biden and his team have been clear that they intend to maintain the Trump administration’s more adversarial approach to China, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying in his confirmation hearing that China “poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States.”In a visit to the Pentagon on Wednesday, Biden said he had directed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to establish a task force to review national security policy with respect to China.US-China tensions weren’t eased during a recent call between Blinken and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi, according to two people familiar with the matter. Chinese officials objected to what they said was an overly negative tone to the American summary of the call, while Blinken’s team felt China’s readout put words in the secretary of state’s mouth over the “One China” policy regarding Taiwan.China has generally approached the US cautiously since Biden’s election and Trump’s unprecedented campaign to challenge the result. While Xi sent Biden a congratulatory message in late November, he hasn’t spoken with a sitting US president since last March.Soon after that last call, Washington and Beijing launched into a series of disputes that saw their relationship sink to its lowest point since the height of the Cold War. In recent months, the two nations have traded sanctions, expelled journalists, closed each other’s consulates and clashed over everything from Taiwan to the origins of the coronavirus.Biden has met Xi repeatedly over the years, including as vice president, and until recently touted what he said was his friendship with the Chinese leader. He gave a harsher assessment on the campaign trail last year, calling Xi a “thug” who “doesn’t have a democratic -- with-a-small-‘d’ -- bone in his body.”Trade with China will be a top economic priority for Biden. China failed to meet its 2020 trade targets under the Trump administration’s “phase one” agreement, buying just under 60% of the $172 billion worth of goods it said it would purchase. That could lead to calls for Biden to re-negotiate the deal, which is to expire within a year.The two countries have also clashed over technology, with the US seeking to curb the growth of Chinese tech champions. The Trump administration used export controls, entity lists and executive orders to block companies including Huawei Technologies Co., chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. from American goods and consumers.The status of the democratically run island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, has also re-emerged as one of the biggest flash points between the two sides. Trump oversaw a dramatic expansion of ties with Taipei, including a visit by then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar last August.Chinese leaders usually seek to get their American counterparts to reaffirm the country’s commitment to the One China policy. Trump recommitted to upholding the policy, which recognizes the People’s Republic as the sole legal government of China, during his first call with Xi in 2017, and State Department spokesman Ned Price said at another briefing that the Biden administration won’t change that position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-xi-plan-first-call-as-soon-as-wednesday-evening-in-us-101612999124833.html
11-02-2021||World||Covid-19 variant gains momentum in US as total cases plummet||A covid variant first found in the UK is infecting Americans at a pace that far outstrips the original strain, which arrived in the spring.In the 43 days since B.1.1.7 was first found in the US, more than 900 cases have been reported. At around the same point, the first strain had infected only 165 people, though testing capacity was significantly weaker.Even as overall daily cases decline, the B.1.1.7 mutation is burgeoning more quickly than others first seen in Brazil and South Africa. As of Tuesday, there were 932 reported cases of the UK variant among 34 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Florida reported the most variant infections at 343, followed by California. The two states account for more than half of the national variant cases. Early research has shown the strain to be more transmissible and may carry an increased risk of death.Researchers are still learning about the new iterations, and cases in the US are likely undercounted due to capacity constraints in identifying strains. The CDC bases its figures on a sampling of positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens. As of late January, the agency’s surveillance system was capable of testing about 750 samples per week, and the CDC is contracting with commercial labs for added capacity.Increases in variant cases come as daily infections across the country are seeing the most significant drop since the pandemic began. But the new versions are spreading quicker than Covid-19 initially did in the US and one could surpass it to become the predominant virus.The UK is a world leader in genomics, the science used to identify new strains. The country’s Department of Health and Social Care announced last month it would share its capacity to test for variants with other countries.Nationally, the US posted 92,986 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the seven-day average to 107,612, Covid Tracking Project data show. As of early Wednesday, there had been at least 468,500 reported deaths in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-variant-gains-momentum-in-us-as-total-cases-plummet-101612994047504.html
11-02-2021||World||Iran produces uranium metal, IAEA says, in latest breach of deal||Iran has carried out its plan to produce uranium metal, the U.N. atomic watchdog confirmed on Wednesday, despite Western powers having warned Iran that would breach their 2015 nuclear deal as uranium metal can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.Iran began breaching its nuclear deal with major powers step by step in 2019 in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal the previous year and Washington's reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.Iran has in recent months accelerated those breaches of the deal's restrictions on its atomic activities, potentially complicating efforts to bring the United States back into the deal under President Joe Biden.A law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran blames on its foe Israel, called for steps including opening a uranium metal plant. Iran told the International Atomic Energy Agency in December it planned to produce uranium metal fuel for a research reactor."Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today informed IAEA Member States about recent developments regarding Iran's R&D activities on uranium metal production as part of its stated aim to produce fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor," the IAEA said in a statement.Wednesday's report, seen by Reuters, and a previous one said that Iran planned to carry out research on uranium metal using natural uranium before moving on to uranium metal enriched to 20%, the level it is enriching uranium to now, short of the 90% that is weapons grade."The Agency on 8 February verified 3.6 gram of uranium metal at Iran's Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant (FPFP) in Esfahan," the IAEA statement added.France, Britain and Germany, all parties to the deal, last month said they were "deeply concerned" and that Iran's uranium metal production had no civilian credibility but potentially serious military implications.The 2015 deal's central aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb to at least a year from roughly 2-3 months. Iran, however, denies ever pursuing nuclear weapons and says it only wants to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.US intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-produces-uranium-metal-iaea-says-in-latest-breach-of-deal-101612992155282.html
11-02-2021||World||‘What trial?’ Life goes on in Trump world as ex-president faces 2nd impeachment||The diamonds were sparkling in New York. A carpenter working at a San Francisco skyscraper shrugged. There were no bar specials at the hotel near the White House, just a menu that includes cocktails called Belle of Congress and Bitter Life.As the Senate began Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, indifference reigned at properties across the billionaire’s empire on Tuesday. There were moments of disgust and adoration from some tenants, workers and customers, but mostly they seemed not to care -- or even know -- about what was going on inside Congress.For Trump, once a reality television host with his own catchphrase for firing people, the unprecedented second impeachment is proceeding after accusations that he incited a mob at the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn November’s election. But in the midtown Manhattan space he rents out to Tiffany & Co. and at the California tower he co-owns, even on the ice of the Central Park rinks that New York City is taking away from his management, life went on.Also Read | Senate agrees to hear Trump impeachment case, rejecting GOP arguments“I’m not going to watch -- it’s depressing,” carpenter James Keenan said in the minutes before the trial began. He was sipping an iced tea on the steps of San Francisco’s 555 California St., one of two towers that Trump co-owns with Vornado Realty Trust. The Trump Organization’s 30% stake in the pair is worth an estimated $685 million, its most valuable holding.Keenan, 49, has done jobs at the 52-story office building off and on since 1989. Now it’s mostly a “ghost town” as the coronavirus pandemic keeps workers at home.He thought the property was owned by a Japanese billionaire until his company’s truck driver recently told him about Trump. He doesn’t care either way. “I’m a fiscal conservative,” he said before returning to work on the 46th floor. “As long as the economy’s good, I’m good.”In New York, Mariana Legotska walked onto the ice of Central Park’s Wollman Rink wearing a pink sweater, pink gloves, a pink coat with a furry white hood and a furry black bag. A tourist from Kiev, she had little interest in the drama unfolding in D.C.“What trial?” she said. “I just want to do this because I want the feeling of skating.”After the Capitol riot, New York City terminated all contracts with Trump, whose company operates two rinks and the carousel in Central Park, plus the Ferry Point golf course. The Trump Organization has said it will “vigorously” fight the move.Also Read | Trump impeachment: What is ‘January exception’ House managers argued against?When the trial kicked off around 1 p.m., a trader who was watching his young son learn to skate said he didn’t care that Trump is still managing the rink. A few minutes later, as senators approved the rules, Anne Blatt’s 9-year-old granddaughter asked her what an impeachment is. Blatt, a Trump fan who says she wants to be his customer, was still feeling too weak after getting Covid-19 last year to skate.As House managers opened their presentation with an intense video that combined Trump’s rhetoric with scenes of the attacking mob, 18-year-old Judi Zeidan said she wouldn’t support anything with Trump’s name on it, and was only skating because her school paid. She was recording the trial to watch later.At other properties, it was business as usual. It was still morning at the Trump National Golf Club outside of Los Angeles when the trial was getting underway, and the only TV turned on showed golf videos while a patio grill served burgers and hot dogs. Later, two golfers gushed about the course and shrugged off the mob violence, and a foursome on a work retreat said the hearing just stirred up negative energy.Inside Trump’s hotel in Washington, once a hub for the administration and its fans and lobbyists, the lounge was quiet except for a few guests. Two televisions were tuned to ESPN2 and Fox Sports, and two others showed impeachment coverage from CNN and Fox News.More than 11 million people tuned in Tuesday afternoon to watch the proceedings on TV. Comcast Corp.’s MSNBC network led with 2.87 million total viewers, according to Nielsen. Fox News was third, behind CNN, at 1.95 million.Around 2 p.m., Democrats argued that two centuries of precedent and common sense make clear that former officials must be tried by the Senate when impeached. In New York, inside Trump Tower’s Gucci store, a salesman was showing off custom-made chairs that cost thousands of dollars.Around the corner, at the building’s residential entrance, a doorman in a dark coat with golden buttons said he doesn’t follow the news. There are good presidents and bad presidents, he said, and nothing changes.As the day went on, Trump’s lawyers argued that the former president’s trial is a politically motivated attempt to remove him as a challenger to Democratic power. After four hours of arguments from House impeachment managers and the defense, the Senate voted to affirm that it’s constitutional to try an official who’s no longer in office.Before the day ended, investor Michael Kimble, a specialist in high-yield bonds, went on an afternoon shopping trip. He was looking for a pearl necklace at the Tiffany store in Trump’s 57th Street building.“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I’m not going to boycott their store if they say something I don’t agree with.”Giant digital letters scrolled up Tiffany’s five floors, spelling out a message: “Winner takes all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-trial-life-goes-on-in-trump-world-as-ex-president-faces-2nd-impeachment-101612991666819.html

11-02-2021||World||Iranian nuclear scientist killed by one-ton automated gun in Israeli hit: Report||The Iranian nuclear scientist assassinated near Tehran in November was killed by a one-ton gun smuggled into Iran in pieces by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, according to a report by The Jewish Chronicle on Wednesday.Citing intelligence sources, the British weekly said a team of more than 20 agents, including Israeli and Iranian nationals, carried out the ambush on scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh after eight months of surveillance.Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report, which was published on the website of the London-based newspaper.Iranian media said Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after armed assassins gunned him down in his car. Shortly after his death Iran pointed the finger at Israel, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif writing on Twitter of “serious indications of (an) Israeli role."Israel declined to comment in November and on Wednesday night an Israeli government spokesman responded to the latest report by saying: “We never comment on such matters. There has been no change in our position.”Fakhrizadeh, 59, was long suspected by the West of masterminding a secret nuclear bomb programme.He had been described by Western and Israeli intelligence services for years as the mysterious leader of a covert atomic bomb programme halted in 2003, which Israel and the United States accuse Tehran of trying to restore. Iran has long denied seeking to weaponise nuclear energy.According to the Jewish Chronicle’s report, Iran has “secretly assessed that it will take six years” before a replacement for him is “fully operational” and that his death had “extended the period of time it would take Iran to achieve a bomb from about three-and-a-half months to two years.”Giving no further details of its sourcing, the world's oldest Jewish newspaper said the Mossad mounted the automated gun on a Nissan pickup and that “the bespoke weapon, operated remotely by agents on the ground as they observed the target, was so heavy because it included a bomb that destroyed the evidence after the killing.”It said the attack was carried out “by Israel alone, without American involvement” but that U.S. officials were given some form of notice beforehand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-nuclear-scientist-killed-by-one-ton-automated-gun-in-israeli-hit-report-101612991001032.html
