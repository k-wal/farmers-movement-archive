This is not surprising given that international flights remained suspended for most of the year owing to Covid-19 pandemic. But future bookings have also not gathered pace is what the association has indicated in its latest report.The global traffic demand fell 65.9 per cent in comparison to the full year of 2019. The demand for future bookings fell by 70 per cent in relation to a year ago, it said. This huge fall has put extra pressure on the cash positions of the aviation industry and has delayed the time of recovery. The air traffic demand for international travel fell 75.6 per cent vis-a-vis 2019 with cumulative domestic air traffic demand down by 48.6 per cent compared to 2019.Countries and airlines worst-hit in 2020:>The sharpest decline in the international passenger market was seen in Asia Pacific airlines. The revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) fell below 80.3 per cent in comparison to 2019, the deepest decline for any region.> North America trailed with Year on Year (YoY) decline in the air traffic demand dropping by 75.4 per cent.> European carriers were hit next with the fall in full-year traffic by 73.7 per cent. In December, it saw a slight upturn in comparison to YoY decline in November due to the holiday season but the trend was soon reversed by the end of the month.Also Read | Asia’s fragile aviation recovery suffers due to resurgence of Covid-19> In the domestic passenger traffic market, the sharpest decline was witnessed by Australia with a fall of 69.5 per cent.> After Australia comes the United States with a fall in demand by 59.6 per cent and India comes third with the domestic air traffic demand falling by 55.6 per cent.IATA has predicted 50.4 per cent improvement on the demand of last year that could bring the industry to 50.6 per cent of 2019 levels. However, the risk of serious travel restrictions due to the emergence of Covid variants can limit this improvement to just 13 per cent of 2020 levels and at 38 per cent of the 2019 levels or the pre-corona era.“Last year was a catastrophe. There is no other way to describe it. What recovery there was over the Northern hemisphere summer season stalled in autumn and the situation turned dramatically worse over the year-end holiday season, as more severe travel restrictions were imposed in the face of new outbreaks and new strains of Covid-19.” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/list-of-countries-worst-hit-in-aviation-by-covid-india-3rd-in-domestic-traffic-101612540792135.html

"I am not betraying the country."Thet Thet Khine had fallen out with Suu Kyi in 2018, long before last year's election and had described the Nobel laureate as a "control freak" whose ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party could not fix Myanmar's problems.The army overthrew Suu Kyi on Monday and detained her, drawing international condemnation that included a call from the U.N. Security Council call for the release of the Nobel Peace laureate and other detainees.In Myanmar, the coup has prompted widespread anger and Thet Thet Khine, 53, has been branded a traitor in a torrent of online criticism that has brought calls for a boycott of her jewellery company.She gave no comment when asked about working for the generals.Thet Thet Khine split with the NLD in October 2019 and started her own party, the People's Pioneer Party, which failed to win a single seat in a November election won by the NLD in a landslide. In her constituency, she won only 7% of the vote.The military says it intervened after what it said was a fraudulent election. The poll body and NLD rejected its accusations.Thet Thet Khine said the military, widely known as the Tatmadaw, was managing the country until a fair election could be held and would continue the previous government's policies."The military is doing democratic acts and the civilian government that calls itself the democratic government did undemocratic things," she said."While the Tatmadaw is forming the government, they are working with inclusiveness. They invited ethnic groups, civilians, political parties and they assigned positions to people with competency."Thet Thet Khine has defended the generals previously, dismissing accusations they orchestrated genocide against Rohingya Muslims and calling international legal action for alledged war crimes unnecessary.Thet Thet Khine, who describes herself as an advocate for democracy, has also advocated a middle path that engages with the military, which ruled Myanmar for 49 years after a 1962 coup."For the military to back off gradually from politics, we have to help. If we fight them and chase them away, the country will not be at peace," she said."This is democratisation in progress. There are unavoidable difficulties in democratisation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-suu-kyi-ally-says-no-betrayal-in-taking-myanmar-junta-job-101612545586062.html

Biden’s new limit, which comes into effect in October, is nearer to the 110,000 ceiling for 2017 fixed by President Barack Obama. Trump had steadily brought it down.Indians hired by US companies and US subsidiaries of Indian firms are by far the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 issued annually. Many of them stay on, sponsored by the employers for Green Card leading up to citizenship.The Trump administration had rolled out a series of measures to reform the H-1B visas to ensure it was not used by American employers to replace American workers with foreigners on low wages, as critics of the programme had long argued.In March 2017, the Trump administration issued a policy memo that said computer programmers — or those with a basic bachelor’s degree — will no longer be presumed to qualify for H-1B. Employers will have to provide additional proof to establish the beneficiary had skills for a “speciality occupation”, as H-1Bs were meant to be used.The USCIS announced on Wednesday it was rescinding that 2017 memorandum that had rescinded a “Guidance memo on H1B computer related positions”. A response is awaited from the USCIS to a request for details on who will be impacted exactly, and how. The agency has ordered its officials to discontinue the use of the 2017 memo to adjudicate petitions. And said, “further guidance will be forthcoming”.The Wednesday memo followed a December 16, 2020 order by the ninth circuit court of appeals overturning the USCIS’s denial of H-1B in one case calling it “arbitrary and capricious”. Though in denying the application, the agency had not cited the 2017 memo, “the denial followed its logic”.The Biden administration has rescinded, reversed and withdrawn many of Trump-era immigration-related orders of the Trump administration — from the Muslim ban to the border wall. Last month, the administration withdrew a Trump administration order that rescinded work authorization for certain H-1B spouses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visas-us-postpones-selection-process-changes-rescinds-speciality-criteria-101612545449275.html

The high-level conversation would be the latest step by US President Joe Biden’s administration to seek a way to revive 2015 Iran nuclear deal abandoned by former US President Donald Trump in 2018.Trump, in leaving the deal, restored the US sanctions the agreement had removed and placed more on Iran.Iran has long denied any intent to develop nuclear arms.Biden, who took office last month, has said that if Tehran returned to strict compliance with the 2015 pact, Washington would follow suit and use that as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran's missile development and regional activities.Tehran has insisted that Washington ease sanctions before it resumed compliance, but Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hinted on Monday at a way to resolve the impasse over who goes first by saying the steps could be synchronized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-to-discuss-covid-19-iran-russia-china-and-myanmar-in-e3-meeting-101612544497372.html

In May, it will try to land in Utopia Planitia, a plain in the northern hemisphere, and deploy a rover to explore for 90 days.If successful, the Tianwen-1 will make China the first country to orbit, land and deploy a rover in its inaugural mission to Mars, further boosting China's space credentials after it last year became the first nation to bring back samples from the moon since the 1970s.China previously made a Mars bid in 2011 with Russia, but the Russian spacecraft carrying the probe failed to exit Earth's orbit and disintegrated over the Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-releases-space-probe-s-first-image-of-mars-101612543859184.html

It means about 1,000 active duty military personnel will deploy to help state vaccination centers.President Joe Biden has called for setting up 100 mass vaccination centers around the country within a month. Two are opening in California, and Slavitt said military personnel will arrive at those centers in a little over a week.The Pentagon has scheduled a news briefing later Friday to provide more information about the military role.Slavitt said support from the military will play a critical role in supporting vaccination sites, helping administer thousands of shots a day.Currently about 6.9 million Americans have received the full two-dose regimen required to get maximum protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. That translates to about 2% of the U.S. population.To reach widespread or “herd” immunity — about 70% to 85% of Americans must be vaccinated. The U.S. is in a race with the virus, which is also spawning mutations that may prove resistant to vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-will-deploy-troops-to-assist-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101612543326462.html

Economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a drop of 40,000. That’s on top of 52,700 jobs lost in December.The unemployment rate jumped to 9.4%, versus 8.8% previously and a forecast of 8.9%.A new round of restrictions over the last couple of months in some regions -- including stay-at-home orders and curfews -- have triggered fresh lay-offs that have stalled the recovery.Friday’s report wipes out months of gains, leaving employment about 4.5% shy of February’s levels.Still, Canada’s labor market is faring better now than it did during the first wave of restrictions in March and April, when employment fell by 3 million.Hours worked increased 0.9% on the month in January. Losses were entirely in part-time positions, with full-time jobs increasing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-loses-213-000-jobs-unemployment-rate-jumps-to-94-101612535211125.html
05-02-2021||World||US transportation mask rule violation to attract penalty of up to $1,500||The US transportation security administration (TSA) on Friday announced that the violation of transportation face mask requirement will attract a penalty of $250. The agency said that the fine can increase up to $1,500 for repeat offenders. The penalty structure was announced days after the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) issued a sweeping order requiring the use of face masks on nearly all forms of public transportation.“Regarding the civil penalty fine structure for individuals who violate the Security Directive, TSA will recommend a fine ranging from $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders,” the TSA said in a statement.The face mask rule issued by CDC came into force on Tuesday under which passengers are required to wear a face mask in transportation hubs as well as on many commercial and public transportation networks. The rule extends to the domestic network of airports, flights operated by domestic and foreign air carriers with inbound flights to US ports of entry, and surface transportation modes like trains and buses.Read | Is wearing one mask enough?While US airlines have already taken the initiative to ban travellers who do not follow the face mask rule, the penalties by the TSA may be in addition to those imposed by transportation operators. The agency also said that it may seek a penalty amount that falls outside the $250-$1500 range, based on substantial aggravating or mitigating factor.“TSA has provided transportation system operators specific guidance on how to report violations so that TSA may issue penalties to those who refuse to wear a face mask,” it added.According to the CDC order, face masks should cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides without leaving any gap. It also states that face shields or goggles are not an acceptable substitute to a mask and may be used in addition to an acceptable mask. Medical masks and N-95 respirators fulfil CDC and TSA’s requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-transportation-mask-rule-violation-to-attract-penalty-up-to-1500-101612539882253.html
05-02-2021||World||US trade deficit rises to 12-year high $679 billion||The US trade deficit rose 17.7% last year to $679 billion, highest since 2008, as the coronavirus disrupted global commerce and confounded President Donald Trump's attempts to rebalance America's trade with the rest of the world.The gap between the value of the goods and services the United States sells abroad and what it buys climbed from $577 billion in 2019, the Commerce Department said Friday. Exports skidded 15.7% to $2.1 trillion, and imports fell 9.5% to $2.8 trillion.As president, Trump sought to narrow the gap by imposing taxes on imported goods on a scale unseen since the trade wars of the 1930s. The deficit narrowed slightly in 2019 but then ballooned last year as coronavirus restrictions hammered US exports of services such as tourism and education. Services exports dropped 20.4% last year.Still, the US ran a $237 billion surplus last year in services. But that was overwhelmed by a $916 billion deficit in trade in goods such as aircraft and auto parts.The politically sensitive deficit with China in the sale of goods fell 10% last year to $311 billion; Trump had imposed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports to protest Beijing's sharp-elbowed efforts to supplant Western dominance in technology, an effort that US alleged included cybertheft.In December, the trade deficit dropped to $66.6 billion, down 3.5% from November. Exports rose 3.4%, and imports increased 1.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-deficit-rises-to-12-year-high-679-billion-101612534036050.html
05-02-2021||World||Pakistani Taliban reunified splinter groups in Afghanistan, poses threat: UN||The Pakistani Taliban has worked with al-Qaeda to reunify several splinter terror groups in Afghanistan, a development that increases the threat to the entire region, according to a new report from a UN sanctions monitoring committee.The ability of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to bring together these splinter groups, comprising mostly Pakistani fighters, has increased its strength and led to a “sharp increase in attacks in the region”, said the report from the monitoring team that helps the UN’s 1267 sanctions committee assess activities of al-Qaeda and Islamic State.The report, released this week, also highlighted the Islamic State's activities in cyberspace in South Asia, including the publishing of Voice of Hind, an online magazine in English, and efforts by the group’s members in the Maldives and Sri Lanka.According to the report, UN member states “expressed concern at the rising number of ISIL sympathizers in cyberspace in South Asia” and noted that Voice of Hind was being published regularly since it was started in early 2020. “It has followers in Maldives and Sri Lanka, with the former also highlighted by member states as an arena for recruitment and operations,” the report said.The report added that the key Islamic State operative in the Maldives, Mohamed Ameen, is trying to forge links with the Khorasan unit of Islamic State in Afghanistan. Experts believe such a connection could increase the terrorist threat for all countries in the region, including India.Ameen's efforts are “consistent with the Al-Sadiq office objective of enhancing cooperation across the region”, the report said. The “Al-Sadiq office” is an Islamic State unit covering India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Central Asian states that is led by Shahab al-Muhajir aka Sanaullah, a former commander of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network.“Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP)...was reported to have overseen a reunification of splinter groups that took place in Afghanistan and was moderated by Al-Qaida. This was expected to increase the threat to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the region,” the report said.Five groups - Shehryar Mehsud group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar...Hizb-ul-Ahrar, the Amjad Farooqi group and the Usman Saifullah group (formerly known as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi) – pledged alliance to TTP in July and August last year, and this “increased the strength of TTP and resulted in a sharp increase in attacks in the region”.TTP’s fighting strength now ranges between 2,500 and 6,000, the report said. Though the report didn’t go into specifics, experts believe most members of the five groups united by TTP are of Pakistani origin.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said these developments could have worrying portends for India and its security interests, particularly in Afghanistan.“There is a history of terror attacks in Afghanistan in which elements associated with al-Qaeda joined hands with the Taliban to hit out at Indian interests in Afghanistan, including attacks on diplomatic compounds and the kidnapping of engineers. While there may not be any direct effect on Indian territory, Indian interests continue to be endangered, especially in Afghanistan,” he said.Patil said India also couldn’t afford to let down its guard given previous attempts by Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to create networks in the territory of friendly neighbours such as the Maldives.The UN report highlighted another issue that has been of concern to countries in the region against the backdrop of the planned drawdown of foreign troops in Afghanistan – the continuing relationship between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda despite the peace deal signed with the US a year ago.“Member States report little evidence of significant changes in relations between Al-Qaida and the Taliban. Al-Qaida assesses that its future in Afghanistan depends upon its close ties to the Taliban, as well as the success of Taliban military operations in the country,” the report said.Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have 200 to 500 cadres spread across 11 provinces in Afghanistan, and the killing of several al-Qaeda commanders in Taliban-controlled territory “underscores how close the two groups are”, the report said. Among the al-Qaeda figures killed in Taliban-controlled areas was Mohammad Hanif, a deputy of al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-taliban-reunified-splinter-groups-in-afghanistan-poses-threat-un-101612532507569.html
05-02-2021||World||US employers add just 49,000 jobs as unemployment rate falls to 6.3%||US employers added just 49,000 jobs in January, a sign that that the viral pandemic retains a tight grip on the economy nearly a year after it triggered a painful recession.The tepid increase followed a decline of 227,000 jobs in December, the first loss since April. The unemployment rate for January fell sharply from 6.7% to 6.3%, the Labor Department said Friday. About half the drop occurred because some of those out of work found jobs, while others stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.Friday's figures reflect a faltering job market, slowed by a viral pandemic that is still causing consumers to avoid traveling, shopping, dining out, attending entertainment venues and engaging in other forms of face-to-face contact. Nearly 10 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic.Some states and localities re-imposed restrictions on businesses in December as cases spiked. Some of those restrictions were loosened in January, though perhaps not in time to affect the jobs report, which measures employment in the middle of each month.As hiring has slowed, many employers have continued to lay off workers. The number of applications for unemployment benefits, though declining for the past few weeks, remained at an elevated 779,000 last week.The hardships that millions of Americans are suffering trends have fueled President Joe Biden’s push for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which would provide $1,400 checks for most US individuals and a $400 weekly unemployment payment on top of state benefits. The package would also extend two federal jobless aid programs, from mid-March through September.The damage to the job market since March has widened financial inequality in the United States, especially hurting women and people of color. At the same time, Americans fortunate enough to have kept their jobs have amassed $2.3 trillion in savings — double the pre-pandemic total. That enlarged pool of savings could fuel a rapid rebound in spending as business restrictions are lifted and more Americans become more confident about shopping, dining out and traveling.Economists increasingly suggest that as vaccinations reach a critical mass in the coming months and the government provides further stimulus, the economy and the job market will strengthen much faster than they did after previous recessions. Bank of America estimates that growth could reach 6% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984.Some hopeful signs have emerged recently to suggest that the economy might be picking up a bit. Auto sales rose solidly in January. And a gauge of business growth in the service sector picked up to its highest level in two years. It also showed that services firms added workers last month. A separate measure of manufacturing indicated that factories are also expanding. So is spending on home construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-employers-add-just-49-000-jobs-as-unemployment-rate-falls-to-63-101612532800076.html

05-02-2021||World||‘Not a word on Uighur’: Experts question silence of celebrities on China||A recent BBC report has revealed shocking details of how Uighur women are being "systematically raped" and tortured at China's Xinjiang camps. The US government has reacted to the reports and said it is "deeply disturbed" by the reports. The United Kingdom too has vowed action following the BBC investigation. British junior foreign minister Nigel Adams has said the BBC report revealed "clearly evil acts".China has not yet reacted to the reports but has so far denied the detention of Uighur Muslims and called these Centres camps for vocational training. The silence of international celebrities is also being questioned."New reports of atrocities on Uighur women have appeared which China has not denied. It comes in clear violation of human rights," former diplomat Kanwal Sibal said."A few days ago, in fact, the situation in Uighur camps in Xinjiang experienced what can be called genocide and to substantiate that there are credible investigative reports like the BBC one, which are coming out now. It's intriguing that there is no buzz about this in international media and also social media," China expert and editor of India Narrative, Atul Aneja said.Holding social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook partly responsible for not amplifying voices against the situation in Xinjiang, Aneja said, "It's absolutely unexplainable why both Twitter and Facebook are underplaying the developments at Uighur camps. The International Human Rights Council, the United Nations Security Council have to wake up to the atrocities unleashed at these camps, he said adding, "This is more than a wake-up call".The silence of celebrities on an issue like this has also drawn flak from experts in the backdrop of the statement issued by India's ministry of external affairs where it denounced international efforts to hurt India's democracy."It is the hypocrisy of the so-called international celebrities on castigating the Modi government on the farmers' agitation, which has been dealt with the utmost restraint. Their silence on the persecution of Uighur people is particularly notable as this is a women's cause, which these celebrity busybodies should have addressed for their own credibility," Kanwal Sibal said."The silence of Rihanna, Greta Thunberg who tweeted about farmers' protest in India makes me curious whether these international figures are acting alone. Or, whether there are forces behind them which pick up agendas, whether there is any grand geopolitical game behind this. In Iraq, Egypt, Libya, human rights were used as a cover for regime change. Is this the same line of thinking, one may ask," Aneja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-word-on-uighur-experts-question-silence-of-celebrities-on-china-101612530031608.html

Addressing the vaccines issue from the perspective of a narrow national strategy might lead to a moral failure in meeting the needs of the most vulnerable across the globe," the appeal said.It was signed by Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who is head of the Vatican's worldwide missionary arm and also CI president, Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican's Integral Human Development department, and CI Secretary General Aloysius John.The appeal further summoned affluent nations to remit the debt of the poorest nations so that money could be diverted to improving national health systems.It said holders of vaccine patents should set up production hubs in Africa, Asia and Latin America to speed up delivery to the poorest populations.Rich nations that look after only their own good could face another crisis in the future if poorer nations are neglected now and the pandemic gets out of hand in the global south, it said.On Wednesday, the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, which includes two U.N. agencies, said it had allocated at least 330 million doses of vaccines for poorer countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-urges-un-security-council-meeting-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-101612531333284.html

The government did not say how much it was investing in the project.The announcement Friday comes as public health officials around the world raise concerns about new virus variants that are more contagious or resistant to existing vaccines.While viruses mutate constantly, most of the changes cause little concern. But scientists are closely tracking these mutations to make sure they quickly identify variants of concern.Earlier this week, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said it would invest in CureVac for the development of new vaccines targeting emerging variants, using its messenger RNA technology to attack the disease. GSK said it plans to invest 150 million euros (USD 181 million) in the project.CureVac said its collaboration with the U.K. will support both the vaccines it is developing with GSK as well as another vaccine candidate it is developing with Bayer that is already in human trials.Authorities in England this week launched house-to-house coronavirus testing in targeted communities in a bid to snuff out a variant first discovered in South Africa before it spreads widely and undermines a nationwide vaccination program.Public health officials are concerned about the variant because it contains a mutation of the virus' characteristic spike protein targeted by existing vaccines. The mutation may mean the vaccines offer less protection against the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-backs-curevac-effort-to-make-vaccine-for-covid-19-variants-101612531015151.html
05-02-2021||World||China 'expels' US warship from South China Sea, a first under Biden presidency||China on Friday said it has expelled a US guided missile destroyer from the South China Sea, a day after the same warship passed through the Taiwan Strait.The People’s Liberation Army’s southern theatre command issued a statement saying it deployed warships and aircraft to warn and drive away USS John S McCain from near the Xisha Island (Paracel Island in English) in the SCS region.The US Navy has said it was carrying out a lawful, “freedom of navigation operation”.Friday’s exchange is part of the war of words that has broken out between Beijing and Washington on the passage of the US warship through the region in the past 24 hours - for the first time since Joe Biden took over as President in January.Four years of Donald Trump’s presidency saw increased tensions between the world powers over a range of issues including disputes in the SCS region and Taiwan.China claims nearly the entire SCS, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China claims to be its breakaway region).Tian Junli, spokesperson of the Chinese theatre command, said the passage of the US warship “seriously” infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security, undermined regional peace and stability, and deliberately disrupted the “good atmosphere” of peace, friendship, and cooperation in the SCS maritime zone.In a statement, the US Navy said its warship was asserting international navigational rights in the SCS region.“On Feb 5 (local time) USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law,” Lt Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, said.“This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging the unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging China’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” Keiley said.The spokesperson added that China, Taiwan and Vietnam each claim sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.“All three claimants require either permission or advance notification before a military vessel or warship engages in ‘innocent passage’ through the territorial sea. Under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, the ships of all states -including their warships -enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.”Keiley added: “The unilateral imposition of any authorisation or advance notification requirement for innocent passage is not permitted by international law. By engaging in innocent passage without giving prior notification to or asking permission from any of the claimants, the United States challenged these unlawful restrictions imposed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The US demonstrated that innocent passage may not be subject to such restrictions.”Meanwhile, China’s defence ministry has said that it has successfully conducted a land-based midcourse missile interception test within its territory on February 4, and “achieved the desired test objective. The test is defensive in nature and not targeted against any country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expels-us-warship-from-south-china-sea-a-first-under-biden-presidency-101612530807052.html
05-02-2021||World||In Saddam Hussein's strongholds that fought America, Iraqis fear a US departure||Abu Arkan Ibrahim picked up a rifle and joined the Iraqi insurgency against US troops when they occupied his hometown of Fallujah in 2003. He was badly burned in the fighting. Now, he fears the departure of the Americans he once battled.Over the past 17 years, the municipal employee has watched his city fall to the United States, al Qaeda, Islamic State and, most recently, Iraqi forces fighting alongside Iran-backed paramilitaries. Ibrahim said the presence of US troops in recent years helped suppress remaining Islamic State militants and rein in the Iran-backed militias - mutual foes accused by Iraqi officials of attacking locals. The US troop drawdown is creating a security vacuum, Ibrahim said, making Fallujah more dangerous.“I’d rather have the Americans here than the alternatives,” the 37-year old said.Ibrahim’s assessment is shared by many security officials, former fighters and residents in north and west regions of the country that comprise up to a third of Iraqi territory, former insurgent strongholds once loyal to Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.They say Islamic State and the Iran-backed paramilitaries stand to gain most from Washington’s troop reduction. They point to an increase in attacks by Islamic State, and fear the Iran-backed militias will use this violence to justify entrenching themselves.Last month, the United States completed a reduction of its forces in Iraq to 2,500 troops. That’s about half the level of less than a year ago.Recent months have witnessed more than 25 deadly attacks that Iraqi officials attribute to Islamic State militants. Last month, the group staged its biggest attack in years with a suicide bombing in the capital Baghdad that killed more than 30 people.The US embassy in Baghdad declined to comment.The US-led military coalition of 80 nations battling Islamic State in Iraq said it carried out 10 strikes against militant targets in Iraq in December alone.A coalition official said there were no plans to reverse the drawdown and said Iraqi forces were capable of handling the ongoing Islamic State insurgency with current levels of coalition support.Washington’s contingent is the largest in the coalition force, which includes 900 troops from other countries. Still, the US presence in Iraq is tiny compared to the 170,000 troops it stationed in the country after its invasion.Parts of Iraq’s 300,000-strong military operate across the country’s western and northern areas. The paramilitaries number at least 100,000, with a significant portion in the north and west. Security officials and analysts estimate there are thousands of Islamic State fighters.One US official acknowledged the withdrawal over the past year has reduced American military capabilities in Iraq but stressed that US assistance has continued. “We’re still working hard to enable and support our Iraqi partners,” said the official, adding the Iraqis were already operating more independently.The official conceded Islamic State remains a determined enemy. “So it’s not a bloodless future,” the official said.The administration of President Joe Biden has given no indication it intends to significantly reverse the drawdown started under predecessor Donald Trump. The Pentagon said the Biden administration is conducting a review of numbers and position of troops, including in Iraq.An Iraqi government spokesman said the drawdown hasn’t affected its ability to contain Islamic State. “There is ongoing coordination” with the US forces that remain, he said.Most Iraqis oppose foreign influence. Some welcome the US withdrawal. But many, especially in Sunni regions, say they would choose a small American military presence over increased power for the pro-Iran militias.Paramilitaries aligned with Iran say the Islamic State insurgency against the Iraqi military requires them to stay in the Sunni-majority regions to fight the militants. They vow to drive foreign forces out of Iraq if Biden does not commit to a full withdrawal. The Iran-aligned paramilitaries deny involvement in any attacks or human-rights abuses.Islamic State fighters controlled nearly a third of Iraq between 2014 and 2017. They now occupy remote desert areas and mountain ranges. They regularly claim attacks that kill soldiers and Shi’ite militiamen in Iraq.Emboldened Islamic StateFallujah and other major cities in Sunni regions once held by Islamic State have begun to revive. Newly paved main roads run past busy shops and restaurants. But outside urban centres, buildings flattened in battle remain in ruins. Thousands of displaced families have not yet returned.Accompanied by his young son, Ibrahim spoke at a crowded Fallujah intersection that in October saw the city’s first motorcycle bomb in two years. Iraqi officials blamed Islamic State. There has been no claim or denial of responsibility from the group.“In recent months, we’ve seen more Daesh attacks across all these areas,” said Salah al-Essawi, a Sunni paramilitary commander in the area, using an alternative term for Islamic State. The attacks include an assault that killed two security personnel after the Fallujah bombing in October. Essawi and other Iraqi security officials attribute the killings to Islamic State, which hasn’t commented.Some Iraqi military officials say the rise in violence is due in large part to the reduced American presence.An Iraqi army officer who works with the US-led coalition cited an example of the Iraqi military’s reliance on America: a recent airstrike that killed a top Islamic State leader. It was a joint US-Iraqi effort, he said.“Our troops were pursuing him, but would have struggled to find where he was hiding if not for the US air support,” the officer said. He said the coalition carries out fewer air strikes against Islamic State targets than it used to.The coalition official said US-led forces provided air support to Iraqi special forces for that operation. The Iraqi government spokesman said the operation was led by Iraqi forces.Iran-aligned groupsShi’ite paramilitaries say that as Islamic State intensifies its insurgency, Iraqi forces need their help. The Iran-aligned groups are part of a Baghdad-run paramilitary umbrella that works alongside Iraqi security forces to police remote former Islamic State areas.“Many threats still exist and the duty of the factions is to deal with Daesh or any other foreign threat,” Nasr al-Shammari, a senior official in the Harakat al-Nujaba paramilitary, told Reuters weeks before Biden’s inauguration.Shammari wants the United States out, saying the presence of its troops fuels instability. Iraqis who want US forces to stay are a politically-motivated minority, he said.Many residents of Fallujah and nearby towns fear being caught up in reprisals for the increasing Islamic State attacks - both from Iraqi security forces and even more so from Shi’ite paramilitaries.Ibrahim said he has been detained by both over the years on suspicion of links with al Qaeda and Islamic State, which he denies.Essawi, the Sunni paramilitary leader, said the Shi’ite militias have been emboldened by talk of the US drawdown. The Iran-aligned forces, Essawi said, have put their flags back up at some checkpoints they had planned to abandon.“We hope Biden won’t leave us in their hands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-saddam-hussein-s-strongholds-that-fought-america-iraqis-fear-a-us-departure-101612528709053.html
05-02-2021||World||Chinese actress shares botched nose job pics online to warn others||A Chinese actress has taken to social media to warn about the dangers of cosmetic surgery after a procedure left her nose damaged, prompting calls for stricter regulations of the industry worth billions of dollars in China.Gao Liu, who is a singer and actor, published photos of her face before and post-surgery on her Twitter-like Weibo page, and recounted her nightmare experience to some 5 million followers.Hundreds of millions have reacted to her situation, mostly expressing sympathy and discussing the dangers of going under the knife.Acting on the suggestion of a friend to “trim” her nose, Gao admitted herself to a cosmetic surgery clinic in the city of Guangzhou, capital of southern China’s Guangdong province, late last year.Instead of having the desired effect, the four-hour procedure left her nose with severe necrosis(death of body tissue).The operated part showed symptoms of inflammation and necrosis, Gao wrote, adding that it was only later that she learnt that the clinic did not have the required licenses to do the operation. A follow-up procedure made it worse.Local Chinese media, The Paper, reported on Thursday that the hospital staff said that they were undergoing judicial procedures while an employee at the health bureau in Guangzhou said the incident was being investigated, The Paper reported on Thursday.According to Gao, she signed a contract to film two dramas but lost the jobs due to the results of her nose surgery, losing out on payment of 400,000 yuan ($61,879) in the process. “More importantly, I will also face a high breach of contract compensation of 2 million yuan,” she wrote on her Weibo account.According to state-run China Daily, the cosmetic surgery market in China reached 256 billion yuan ($36.71bn), growing at an annual compound growth rate of 30% in the past five years by the beginning of 2020.The report estimated that the Chinese cosmetic surgery market will hit 1 trillion yuan in 2025. Statistics show that the number of unqualified plastic surgery clinics in China exceeded 60,000 in 2019, six times that of regular clinics. About 40,000 medical accidents occur in these clinics every year, an average of about 110 per day, according to a report by Guangxi Daily.A large number of Chinese also go to South Korea for cosmetic surgeries every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-actress-shares-botched-nose-job-pics-online-to-warn-others-101612529546988.html
05-02-2021||World||Vote for new Libyan government heads into run-off at UN talks||Voting on a new Libyan interim government moved to a second, run-off ballot on Friday after none of the four slates of candidates won enough support to secure victory in UN talks aimed at helping end a decade of violence and division.The selection of an interim government is part of a UN peacemaking process based around holding national presidential and parliamentary elections in December in Libya, which has been engulfed in chaos since a NATO-backed intervention ended Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule in 2011.None of the four slates - each including a candidate for prime minister and three for a presidency council - secured 60% of votes from participants at the UN meeting near Geneva, the threshold needed to win outright in the first ballot.The two slates with the most votes now go forward to a run-off vote scheduled for Friday afternoon, where a straight majority will decide the winner, UN acting Libya envoy Stephanie Williams said.The list that won most votes in the first ballot had eastern-based parliament chief Aguila Saleh as head of a new presidency council and western-based interior minister Fathi Bashagha as premier. It will face a list that has Mohammed al-Menfi as council head and Abdulhamid Dbeibeh as prime minister.Since 2014 Libya has been split between warring administrations in the west and east, backed by foreign powers.However, with many factions in the country afraid to surrender influence they already hold, and with foreign powers invested in local allies, any new government chosen may rapidly come under pressure.All candidates for the new government have undertaken to hold national presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 24 in which they will not stand for office, and to appoint women to 30% of senior government roles.The United Nations publicly broadcast images of their signed pledges.UN acting envoy Williams said the four competing lists formed among candidates on Thursday were diverse and represented Libya's potential.However, some Libyans have been critical of a process which they view as being managed from abroad and which they fear will allow existing powermongers to cling to their influence."It's just a painkiller to portray Libya as stable for a while. But war and tension will certainly come back sooner or later so long as militias have power," said Abdulatif al-Zorgani, a 45-year old state employee in Tripoli.The latest UN process emerged from a Berlin conference last year and gathered pace in the autumn after commander Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based forces were repelled from a 14-month assault on Tripoli.It has also involved a military ceasefire but not all its terms of that ceeasefire have been met - a sign of continued mistrust on both sides and internal fractures within both camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vote-for-new-libyan-government-heads-into-run-off-at-un-talks-101612527812072.html
05-02-2021||World||Navalny affair no grounds to cancel Nord Stream pipeline, says German CDU chief||Germany should not drop support for the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia over the crackdown on Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, as "feel-good moralising" is not foreign policy, the man best placed to be the next German chancellor told Reuters.Pointing to US purchases of crude oil from Russia, Armin Laschet described himself as a political realist - or "Realpolitiker" - and said: "We have to take the world as it is in order to make it better."Laschet, who last month won an election to the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said both values and interests were important in diplomacy."But feel-good moralising and domestic slogans are not foreign policy," Laschet, who is premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said in an interview that focused on understanding his little-known views on international affairs.Laschet's election to the CDU chair makes him the frontrunner to take over as chancellor from Merkel, who after 15 years in office has said she will not seek a fifth term following September elections.Asked directly whether Germany should change course and renounce the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, Laschet replied: "For 50 years, even in the aggressive times of the Cold War, Germany has bought gas from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. The German government is following the right course."Germany is facing growing pressure to repudiate Nord Stream 2 over the Navalny affair: at home, from the ecologist Greens - potential coalition partners for Laschet's CDU - and abroad from the United States, and much of Europe.Navalny, sentenced on Tuesday to 3-1/2 years in jail after a Moscow court ruled he had violated the terms of his parole, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Russia from Germany where he was treated for poisoning with a military-grade nerve agent.Moscow has accused the West of hysteria and double standards over Navalny and told it to stay out of its internal affairs.Laschet stressed that he had criticised the attack on Navalny and his imprisonment, and also supported European Union sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis."We must guarantee Ukraine's geopolitical interests and secure our energy supply through this private-sector project," he said of Nord Stream 2.The project, set to launch this year, has split the EU, with some members saying it will undermine traditional gas transit state Ukraine and deepen the EU's energy reliance on Russia.Germany's ecologist Greens, the most likely coalition partner for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party after September's elections, have doubled down on their opposition to the pipeline following the Navalny affair.Laschet did not believe these differences would be a coalition deal breaker. "I don't think Nord Stream 2 will be a big election issue. Moreover, I think consensus with the Greens, for example, is possible."Laschet viewed Germany as "deeply anchored in the West" and saw the United States as "our closest non-European partner". As for China, Germany must criticise its human rights violations, he said. "But at the same time, we trade with China."Euro bonds, debt brakeOn Europe, Western Balkan states should retain the prospect of EU accession if they fulfil the entry criteria, Laschet said, adding: "Turkey is unfortunately moving further and further away from the rule of law principles of the European Union."He opposed introducing jointly issued debt, also known as euro bonds - a policy option some EU countries want to become a permanent tool after the bloc resorted to it to fund economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis."I don't see euro bonds. And with regard to the EU Commission's borrowing, I say: this is now a one-time thing for six years," Laschet said in a nod to taxpayers who don't want Europe's biggest economy necessarily on the hook for any bailouts to more financially challenged member states.On fiscal policy, Laschet rejected a proposal from Merkel's chief of staff to soften Germany's debt issuance law, allowing continued deficit spending, on grounds Berlin would be unable to stick to strict borrowing limits for several more years."The rules are good. The mechanisms contain the necessary flexibility - both the (EU's 1992) Maastricht Treaty and the debt brake of our Basic Law," Laschet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-says-german-cdu-chief-101612528405721.html
05-02-2021||World||US aiding Saudi defence despite Joe Biden's tough stance on human rights abuses||As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden laid out a tougher line on Saudi Arabia than any US president in decades. He said he would make the kingdom “pay the price” for human rights abuses and “make them in fact the pariah that they are.”But if Biden is making Saudi Arabia a pariah now, it's a pariah with benefits.While Biden announced Thursday he was making good on his campaign commitment to end US support for a five-year Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, his administration is making clear it won’t abandon US military assistance for the kingdom and plans to help Saudi Arabia strengthen its own defences.His approach reflects the complexity of the US-Saudi relationship. While Biden is taking a tougher line than his predecessors, he and his foreign policy team recognise the US can’t allow relations to unravel. They see the importance of maintaining aspects of a military, counterterrorism, and security relationship seen as vital for security of both nations.“The United States will cooperate with Saudi Arabia where our priorities align and will not shy away from defending US interests and values where they do not,” the State Department said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.The aligned priorities have included a longstanding US emphasis on playing a lead defending the kingdom and its oil from attacks that would jolt the world’s energy markets and economies. US leaders also see Saudi Arabia as a regional counterweight to Iran.Biden said Thursday that the Saudi-led offensive in Yemen has “created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.” He said he would stop arms sales related to the Yemen offensive, but gave no immediate details what that might mean. At the same time, he also reaffirmed that the United States was committed to cooperating in the kingdom's defense.That will include helping protect Saudi Arabia's territory, critical infrastructure and shipping routes from the kingdom's opponents in neighboring Yemen, the Houthis, the State Department said. The Biden administration has yet to spell out how it plans to boost defense of the kingdom. Saudi Arabia points to missile and drone strikes and other cross-border attacks launched by Houthis in Yemen.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and critic of US involvement in the Saudi air campaign in Yemen, agreed that the US may still have a security interest in helping guard the kingdom.“Our focus should be providing basic defensive capabilities to help Riyadh defend itself from external threats, not fighting those threats for the Saudis," Murphy said.But the US should provide no “additional military support to Saudi Arabia unless we can clearly conclude that support...will not be used as irresponsibly as it has been in Yemen,” Murphy said. He called the kingdom an important partner nonetheless, and said he would work with the administration to reset relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations.International criticism of Saudi Arabia has mounted since 2015, under King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi Arabia that year led the United Arab Emirates and others in launching a war targeting Houthi rebels who had seized territory including the ancient city of Sanaa in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country. Saudi-led airstrikes since then have killed numerous Yemeni civilians, including schoolboys on a bus and fishermen in their fishing boats. The stalled war has failed to dislodge the Houthis and is deepening hunger and poverty. International rights advocates say Yemen's Houthis also have committed abuses, including repeated attacks on civilians.The CIA and others also hold the crown prince responsible for the murder and dismemberment of a US-based Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. The kingdom has imprisoned women who requested government permission to drive and other peaceful advocates. It detained numerous businesspeople and members of the sprawling royal family.Saudi Arabia has been conciliatory as the Biden administration settles in. It said Thursday it welcomes international diplomacy in the Yemen conflict. Its leaders stress the shared history and cooperation on intelligence, education and other matters. On Thursday, in what was seen as the latest gesture to Biden, the kingdom conditionally released two dual Saudi-American citizens held in a crackdown on civil society and shortened the sentence of a third, the State Department said. The latter, Dr. Walid Fitaihi, had been convicted of “disobedience” to the government."I believe we will have a great relationship with them, because all the pillars upon which the relationship stands are still there," Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told Saudi-funded Al Arabiya television about Biden officials.It was the Obama administration — focused at the time on closing a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia's rival, Iran — that greenlighted Saudi Arabia's military offensive in Yemen. American involvement with Saudi Arabia's command and control was supposed to minimize airstrikes on civilians, but often did not. Yemeni survivors displayed fragments showing it was American-made bombs that hit them. Some of those same Obama officials have since expressed regret, and are now in the Biden administration as it moves to end involvement with the offensive.It's not yet clear how far Biden will go in fulfilling his campaign pledge to stop the multibillion US arms trade with Saudi Arabia.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the Democracy for the Arab World Now rights advocacy organization, said she was pleased at the administration's messaging so far involving Gulf countries and the Yemen war. The organization was founded by Khashoggi shortly before Saudis killed himWhitson said she would watch to see if the US maintained arms sales to the kingdom simply by rebranding offensive weapons as defensive, however.Ultimately, stepped-up US pledges to help Saudi Arabia build up its defenes could give the kingdom the face-saving cover it needs to give up on its Yemen offensive, said Steven Cook, a Middle East researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.It could be “convincing the Saudis to declare victory and go home is really the only way,” Cook said. “Hold our nose and do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aiding-saudi-defence-despite-joe-biden-s-tough-stance-on-human-rights-abuses-101612527333298.html
05-02-2021||World||Chinese Navy balances India’s ‘destabilising role’ in Indian Ocean: Pak Navy chief||Alleging that India is destabilising the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the chief of Pakistan Navy has said the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) presence in the maritime area is important to maintain regional balance of power.The expanding partnership between Chinese and Pakistani navies will also play an important role in maintaining peace in the IOR, Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi told Chinese state media in an interview.Asked if China is building a naval base in Pakistan, Niazi said visits by navies will not change the “commercial” nature of the Beijing-built Gwadar port, even as he welcomed the visit of Chinese naval ships including aircraft carriers to Pakistani ports.He was speaking to the Chinese nationalist tabloid Global Times ahead of the multinational naval exercise AMAN-2021 to be hosted by Pakistan in February, where dozens of navies including from the US, UK, Japan, and Russia are expected to participate.Besides the multilateral exercise, the two countries have a bilateral naval drill “Sea Guardians”, the last edition of which was held in the northern Arabian Sea in January 2020.In the interview, Niazi accused India of destabilising the region, without evidence. “On our eastern side, India, with an expansionist mindset, is destabilising the region by actions that could imperil regional security,” he said when asked about the maritime security environment in the IOR.He showered praise on China and its role in the IOR repeatedly. “The PLA Navy has been sending its flotilla to the Gulf of Aden since 2009, which has contributed significantly toward maritime security in Indian Ocean region.“The PLA Navy’s consistent participation in Multinational Exercise AMAN since 2007 and conducting of bilateral exercises have been conducive to the overall maritime security environment in the Indian Ocean region.“The PLA Navy’s presence in the Indian Ocean region is thus an important element in maintaining the regional balance of power and promoting maritime security.”Niazi went on to outline how valuable the cooperation between the navies of China and Pakistan is as the former continues to equip the latter’s sea forces with latest warships, submarines, and new technologies.“Naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F-22P frigates, fast attack craft (missile), helicopters and state-of-the-art survey ship. The PN has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” the Pakistani navy chief said.Pakistan is also looking to China to enhance its long-range anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare capability through induction of long-range maritime patrol jets, unmanned combat aerial vehicles and modernising our existing fleet with state-of-the-art weapons and surveillance systems, Niazi said.“We are also looking at acquisition of modern helicopters, corvettes and shallow-water attack submarines,” he said.Niazi also spoke on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and how the Gwadar port is the initiative’s lynchpin.Cooperating with the Pakistani navy gives China reach across the IOR and the Arabian Sea, close to India’s west coast. For Pakistan, it’s access to weapons and technology to counter India.“Chinese Navy hosts a number of modern and technologically advanced platforms in their inventory. Operating with these modern and high-tech platforms affords us an opportunity to refine our tactics and procedures,” Niazi said.“It is heartening to know that the PLA Navy now operates two aircraft carriers. The PN would like to conduct an exercise with these carriers whenever an opportunity arises. Moreover, the PLA Navy and PN ships regularly visit each other’s ports. In the same stride, the PN would continue to welcome further visits by PLA Navy ships, including aircraft carriers,” Niazi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-navy-balances-india-s-destabilising-role-in-indian-ocean-pak-navy-chief-101612528466879.html
05-02-2021||World||A glance at Marjorie Taylor Greene's incendiary words that led to her removal from House committees||Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has been stripped of her committee assignments by the House Democratic majority over racist remarks, her embrace of conspiracy theories and her past endorsement of violence against leading Democratic officials.Greene, 46, is a newcomer to politics, and previously worked for her family's construction business in Georgia. She was labeled a “future Republican Star” by former President Donald Trump, whose political style she emulates. The House Democrats took the unusual step on Thursday.Here’s a look at some of Greene’s past statements and social media posts, many of which were deleted after the liberal group Media Matters unearthed them online.Las Vega mass shootingIn 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire from a hotel room window overlooking an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 people. Afterward, Greene suggested that the shooting might have been staged.“How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation?” Greene asked in an online video. “You make them scared, you make them victims and you change their mindset and then possibly you can pass anti-gun legislation. Is that what happened in Las Vegas?”“I don’t believe (Paddock) pulled this off all by himself, and I know most of you don’t either,” Greene said.Space lasersIn 2018, a poorly maintained electrical grid sparked a California wildfire that killed 84 people. In a Facebook post in November of that year, Greene falsely speculated that darker forces were at work.Connecting a series of scattershot points, Greene suggested a bank controlled by the Rothschild family, who are Jewish, a utility company responsible for the fire and then-Gov. Jerry Brown had a compelling motive to spark the blaze: clearing the path for a high speed rail project Brown wanted. She also floated the possibility that the fires could have been started by “lasers or blue beams of light” shot down from space by allies of Brown who were said to be in the solar energy industry.“There are too many coincidences to ignore,” she wrote.Omar and TlaibIn February 2019, Greene appeared in an online video filmed at the US Capitol, arguing that Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan weren’t “really official” members of Congress because they didn’t take the oath of office on the Bible. Both women are Muslim.“I really want to go talk to these ladies and ask them what they are thinking, and why they are serving in our American government," Greene said. “They really should go back to the Middle East.”Tlaib was born in Detroit. Omar was born in Somalia and came to the US when she was 12, becoming a US citizen five years later.Hillary ClintonIn May 2018, a Facebook user purporting to be the mother of a New York police officer falsely claimed that the officer had seen a video taken from the laptop of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner that showed Hillary Clinton and a top aide cutting off a child’s face. Greene “liked” the comment and replied, “Most people honestly don’t know so much. The (mainstream media) disinformation warfare has won for too long!”Nancy PelosiGreene once suggested in an online video that Pelosi could be executed for treason.“She’s a traitor to our country, she’s guilty of treason,” Greene says in the video, which CNN first reported. “And it’s, uh, it’s a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.”She also “liked” a January 2019 Facebook post that called for “a bullet to the head” of Pelosi.9/11 attacksIn November 2018, Greene shot a video in which she talked about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, referring to a “so-called” plane that crashed into the Pentagon. She added, “It’s odd, there’s never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon.”She also “liked” a comment posted by a Facebook user in 2018 who falsely argued that 9/11 was “done by our own Gov.” Greene responded: “That is all true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-glance-at-us-lawmaker-marjorie-taylor-greene-s-incendiary-words-101612525744695.html
05-02-2021||World||Fiercely divided House kicks Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees||A fiercely divided House has tossed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees, an unprecedented punishment that Democrats said she’d earned by spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.Underscoring the political vise her inflammatory commentary has clamped her party into, nearly all Republicans voted against the Democratic move Thursday but none defended her lengthy history of outrageous social media posts.Yet in a riveting moment, the freshman Republican from a deep-red corner of Georgia took to the House floor on her own behalf. She offered a mixture of backpedaling and finger-pointing as she wore a dark mask emblazoned with the words “FREE SPEECH.”The chamber’s near party-line 230-199 vote was the latest instance of conspiracy theories becoming pitched political battlefields, an increasingly familiar occurrence during Donald Trump’s presidency. He faces a Senate trial next week for his House impeachment for inciting insurrection after a mob he fueled with his false narrative of a stolen election attacked the Capitol.Thursday’s fight also underscored the uproar and political complexities that Greene — a master of provoking Democrats, promoting herself and raising campaign money — has prompted since becoming a House candidate last year.Eleven Republicans joined 219 Democrats in backing Greene's ejection from her committees, while 199 GOP lawmakers voted “no.”Addressing her colleagues, Greene tried to dissociate herself from her “words of the past.” Contradicting past social media posts, she said she believes the 9/11 attacks and mass school shootings were real and no longer believes QAnon conspiracy theories, which include lies about Democratic-run pedophile rings.But she didn’t explicitly apologize for supportive online remarks she’s made on other subjects, as when she mulled about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being assassinated or the possibility of Jewish-controlled space rays causing wildfires. And she portrayed herself as the victim of unscrupulous “big media companies.”News organizations “can take teeny, tiny pieces of words that I’ve said, that you have said, any of us, and can portray us as someone that we’re not,” she said. She added that “we’re in a real big problem” if the House punished her but tolerated “members that condone riots that have hurt American people” — a clear reference to last summer’s social justice protests that in some instances became violent.Greene was on the Education and Labor committee and the Budget committee. Democrats were especially aghast about her assignment to the education panel, considering the past doubt she cast on school shootings in Florida and Connecticut.The political imperative for Democrats was clear: Greene’s support for violence and fictions were dangerous and merited punishment. Democrats and researchers said there was no apparent precedent for the full House removing a lawmaker from a committee, a step usually taken by their party leaders.The calculation was more complicated for Republicans.Though Trump left the White House two week ago, his devoted followers are numerous among the party’s voters, and he and Greene are allies. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hopes GOP victories in the 2022 elections will make him speaker. Republicans could undermine that scenario by alienating Trump’s and Greene’s passionate supporters, and McCarthy took no action to punish her.“If any of our members threatened the safety of other members, we’d be the first ones to take them off a committee,” Pelosi angrily told reporters. She said she was “profoundly concerned” about GOP leaders’ acceptance of an “extreme conspiracy theorist.”At one point, No. 2 Democratic leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland strode to the GOP side of the chamber carrying a poster of a Greene Facebook post from last year. “Squad's Worst Nightmare,” Greene had written in the post, which showed her holding an AR-15 firearm next to pictures of three of the four Democratic lawmakers, all young women of color, who've been nicknamed “The Squad."“They are people. They are our colleagues,” Hoyer said. He mimicked Greene's pose holding the weapon and said, “I have never, ever seen that before."Republicans tread carefully but found rallying points.McCarthy said Greene’s past opinions “do not represent the views of my party.” But without naming the offenders, he said Pelosi hadn’t stripped committee memberships from Democrats who became embroiled in controversy. Among those he implicated was Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who made anti-Israel insults for which she later apologized.“If that’s the new standard,” he said of Democrats’ move against Greene, “we have a long list.”Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Democrats were setting a precedent by punishing lawmakers for statements made before they were even candidates for Congress. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, warned, “You engage in wrong-speak, you’re in the Thunderdome,” a term for an enclosed wrestling arena.Committee assignments are crucial for lawmakers for shaping legislation affecting their districts, creating a national reputation and raising campaign contributions. Even social media stars like Greene could find it harder to define themselves without the spotlights that committees provide.Not all Republicans were in forgiving moods, especially in the Senate. There, fringe GOP candidates have lost winnable races in recent years and leaders worry a continued linkage with Trump and conspiracists will inflict more damage.That chamber’s minority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this week called Greene’s words a “cancer” on the GOP and country. On Thursday, No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota amplified that thinking.Thune said House Republicans needed to issue a “really strong” rebuke of Greene’s conspiratorial formulations. Republicans must “get away from members dabbling in conspiracy theories,” Thune said. “I don’t think that’s a productive course of action or one that’s going to lead to much prosperity politically in the future.”The fight came a day after Republicans resolved another battle and voted to keep Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in their leadership. Pro-Trump conservatives tried removing her because she supported Trump's impeachment.The House resolution punishing Greene was barely over a page. It said House rules require lawmakers’ behavior to “reflect credibly” on the chamber and said Greene should be removed “in light of conduct she has exhibited.”News organizations have unearthed countless social media videos and “likes” in which Greene embraced absurd theories like suspicions that Hillary Clinton was behind the 1999 death of John F. Kennedy Jr. Greene responded, “Stage is being set,” when someone posted a question about hanging Clinton and former President Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fiercely-divided-house-kicks-marjorie-taylo-greene-off-both-her-committees-101612526455105.html

He stepped down shortly before announcing his bid for the Democratic US presidential nomination. He dropped out of the race in March 2020.The media mogul will support Guterres in "growing and strengthening" a coalition of governments, companies, cities, and businesses committing to net-zero emissions by 2050 in line with the goals of the 2015 global climate deal struck in Paris, the United Nations said.In 2015, nearly 200 countries committed to halt rising temperatures quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change. The United Nations in November will stage a crucial follow-up climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.By then, countries are expected to commit to make deeper emissions cuts to deliver the goal of the Paris agreement.The reappointment of Bloomberg aims to "mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action" in the run-up to the Glasgow summit, the United Nations said in a statement.New US President Joe Biden has moved to bring the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse emitter, back into the Paris deal.Washington formally left the accord last year but its role as a heavyweight in global climate negotiations had already stalled with the 2016 election of Republican President Donald Trump.Bloomberg "will engage government officials and members of the private sector and civil society to finalize and implement plans, particularly in high-emitting countries, industries and sectors, to vastly accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy," the United Nations said.He will also help deliver on Guterres' call for the "phase-out of coal in industrialized countries by 2030, and all other countries by 2040, underpinned by a just transition for affected communities and workers," the world body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-names-michael-bloomberg-climate-envoy-to-rally-action-101612524603140.html

That deadlock was broken by Vice President Kamala Harris, whose "yes" vote provided the win for Democrats.Shortly before the final vote, Democrats flexed their muscle by offering an amendment reversing some earlier votes regarding the future of the Keystone XL pipeline and coronavirus aid to immigrants living in the United States illegally.With Harris presiding, she broke a 50-50 tie to win this amendment for her fellow Democrats.It marked the first time Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, cast a tie-breaking vote after being sworn in as Biden's vice president on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-budget-plan-to-advance-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-aid-package-101612523397892.html

The new policy memorandum rescinding the guidance follows an order from a US appellate court that overturned a decision by USCIS.The immigration services agency had denied an H-1B visa application from Innova Solutions that sought to hire an Indian citizen to work as a computer programmer. In the order, the US court of appeals for the 9th circuit noted that denial of H1-B nonimmigrant visa petition was arbitrary and capricious. The appellate court said that although USCIS did not explicitly rely on the guidance memo, the denial followed its logic.In a fresh memo to officers, the USCIS on Wednesday said that it is rescinding the 2017 policy memorandum effective immediately to “ensure consistent adjudications across the H-1B program.” The federal agency has directed its officers to not apply the earlier memo to any pending or new requests for H-1B classification, including “motions on and appeals of revocations and denials of H-1B classification.”Read | US delays H-1B selection final rule, lottery system to apply for upcoming seasonThe agency further stated that the memorandum does not remove USCIS officers’ discretion in making adjudicatory decisions and is intended solely for the guidance in discharging their official duties. “It may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable under law or by any individual or other party in removal proceedings, in litigation with the United States, or in any other form or manner,” the memo reads.In the past few days, the Biden administration has made a series of announcements related to H1-B visa, delaying the measures taken by the previous administration. The department of homeland security (DHS) postponed the implementation of proposed changes to the H-1B registration system and selection process until December 31, 2021. According to the DHS, the effective date for the proposed changes has been delayed to give USCIS more time to “develop, test, and implement the modifications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-rescinds-guidance-memo-used-to-deny-h-1b-visas-to-computer-programmers-101612523163604.html
05-02-2021||World||US warship sails near Chinese-controlled South China Sea islands||A U.S. warship sailed near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in the disputed South China Sea on Friday in a freedom of navigation operation, the U.S. Navy said, the first such mission under President Joe Biden's new administration.China's military condemned the move, saying it had dispatched naval and air units to follow and warn away the ship.The busy waterway is one of a number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which include a trade war, U.S. sanctions, Hong Kong and Taiwan.China has been infuriated by repeated U.S. sailings near the islands Beijing occupies and controls in the South China Sea. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty and has accused Washington of deliberately stoking tensions.The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the destroyer USS John S. McCain "asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law".The freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging the "unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam", it said.The Southern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army said the ship had entered into what it termed the territorial waters of the Paracels without permission, "seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and security".The United States was "deliberately disrupting the good atmosphere of the South China Sea of ​​peace, friendship, and cooperation", it added.China took full control of the Paracels in 1974 after a short battle with South Vietnamese forces. Vietnam, as well as Taiwan, continue to claim the islands.Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines have claims to other parts of the South China Sea, where China has been building artificial islands and constructing air bases on some of them.The same U.S. ship involved in this mission earlier this week transited the sensitive Taiwan Strait, drawing an angry response from Beijing.Last month, a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group entered the South China Sea for what the Navy said was routine operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warship-sails-near-chinese-controlled-south-china-sea-islands-101612522068111.html
05-02-2021||World||Hong Kong imposes sweeping pro-China curriculum on schools||Hong Kong ordered schools to adopt a more patriotic curriculum and advised teachers to report any breaches of the city’s national security law, the government’s biggest move yet to overhaul the education system following the protests of 2019.The measures, announced late Thursday, seek to inculcate patriotism to kindergarten-age children through “story-telling, role-playing, drawing, singing, dancing and other activities.” Students as young as six will be taught to memorize offenses criminalised by the national security law, which was imposed on the city by China last year, including subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. The curriculum will cover all subjects from geography to biology.“The fundamentals of national security education are to develop in students a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity, as well as an awareness of and a sense of responsibility for safeguarding national security,” Hong Kong’s Education Bureau said in a statement.The new curriculum may also impact Hong Kong’s approximately 52 international schools, which largely cater to the city’s expatriate population. The government statement said that international schools have the “responsibility” to help their students “acquire a correct and objective understanding” of the law, without elaborating.No international school Bloomberg reached out to was available for immediate comment.Cutting off ‘Black Hands’Beijing has blamed Hong Kong’s education system for fostering dissent and fueling the months-long protests opposing the Chinese government’s increasing power over the former British colony. Hong Kong authorities have previously vowed to “cut off” the “black hands” -- including teachers -- deemed insufficiently patriotic.The Hong Kong government attempted to introduce a patriotic education curriculum in 2012, but shelved the decision following massive protests. The latest attempt to do so will bring the financial hub further in line with the education system in mainland China, where students are, for example, required to study the teachings of President Xi Jinping.University and high school students comprised a majority of the frontline protesters in the 2019 unrest, and people under 18 represented almost a fifth of the roughly 10,000 arrests made as of last December, according to data complied by Bloomberg. Students also organized protest activities including forming human chains and class boycotts, actions forbidden under the new rules.Ip Kin-yuen, a former lawmaker and a vice-president of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, said that the new guidelines are “not conducive for learning or fostering the development of young minds,” and that in an environment where people are trying to avoid getting into trouble “the natural response will be self-censorship.”Owl videoAs part of its promotion materials, the government produced a 7-minute animation featuring an owl explaining the concept of national security, saying it covers all aspects of Hong Kong society including culture, cybersecurity, and ecology. The video also says that it’s the “right and duty of the Central Authorities to enact the National Security Law,” and that other countries have similar laws.Garrie Chow, a father with three children in Hong Kong schools, said the new curriculum means that students are “not allowed to have independent thinking.”In September, the English Schools Foundation, which operates 22 international schools in the city, released and distributed a 15-page set of guidelines directing teachers to tell students that the classroom isn’t a “safe space” for discussion or debate of the national security law, the South China Morning Post reported. ESF did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment.Migration waveThe imposition of the new curriculum could add to the already surging number of people emigrating to places like the UK and Taiwan. Some parents and teachers have cited Beijing’s growing control over Hong Kong schools as a major reason for leaving.Jojo, a 37-year old Chinese and special education teacher who would only give her first name due to security fears, said she is seeking to relocate to the UK later this year, joining thousands of others who have already done so via a pathway made available to Hong Kong holders of the British National (Overseas) passport. She is part of a WhatsApp group with 120 other local teachers that helps educators obtain the skills and certifications needed to secure employment in the UK“The students will have to follow along (with the rules), but it will severely impact their personal relationship with us,” Jojo said. “They won’t trust us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-imposes-sweeping-pro-china-curriculum-on-schools-101612519871650.html
05-02-2021||World||China making cautious moves to save its investments in Myanmar after coup||After a military coup in Myanmar on February 1, China is again poised to be the "friend in need" it has always been in times of crisis for the country, reported Asia Times.China has made huge investments in Myanmar.In order to save its investments, China took the stand of 'understanding the coup' in Myanmar while globally the act was derided and condemned.Among the major projects that were on the table before the coup are a new railroad linking the Chinese border town of Ruili with Mandalay in Myanmar, and a China-financed deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu on the Bay of Bengal, which already also serves as a terminus for oil and gas pipelines that reach across Myanmar and flow into China's southern Yunnan province, reported Asia Times.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a news briefing on February 1 hours after Myanmar's elected government members were detained, said Beijing "noted what has happened in Myanmar and are in the process of further understanding the situation."He then went on to say that "all sides in Myanmar" should "appropriately handle their differences under the constitution and legal framework" in order for "political and social stability to be maintained."Meanwhile, the US President Joe Biden's administration quickly threatened to impose new punitive sanctions on Myanmar's coup-makers.Bertil Lintner, writing in an opinion piece in Asia Times viewed the Chinese move as a continuation of their support to the Myanmar military. China has already come to the defense of Myanmar's coup-makers and will likely see its interests grow under the new era of military rule, he wrote.China has been utilising the situation with utmost care to save its investments in Myanmar. Earlier also, China has helped Myanmar in its previous outrages, including the Rohingya refugee crisis that was condemned by the West. China had helped Myanmar after the Rohingya refugee crisis in 2016-2017, reported Asia Times.At that time, Aung San Suu Kyi's now-ousted National League for Democracy (NLD) was in power. Beijing had cozied up to her and her party before the coup because its policymakers and business groups found it easier to deal with them than the staunchly nationalistic military, known as the Tatmadaw, reported Asia Times.Myanmar, under Suu Kyi, joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) when Suu Kyi attended a forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017. The two countries then signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly build the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) in 2018, aiming to further enhance bilateral cooperation within the BRI's framework, reported Asia Times.Lintner is of the view that China will not likely criticize Myanmar's new military government, even if its new direction and policies dent somewhat its interests and ongoing projects in the country.Even though Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of Myanmar's defense forces and now national leader under the emergency rule is wary of Chinese hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, recognizes that China is the only top foreign power he can rely on after his coup, Myanmar insiders say, reported Asia Times.As per Lintner, Beijing will thus likely not risk even the mildest hiccup in its relations with strategically important Myanmar, the only neighbour that via the CMEC provides it with ready access to the Indian Ocean for trade and an alternative avenue for its fuel shipments from the Middle East that travel mainly through the strategically fraught Malacca Strait.Moreover, Aung Hlaing latest move to appoint new Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin is a clear indication that he wants to move closer to China, said Lintner. Wunna Maung Lwin served as foreign minister from 2011 to 2016 under then-president Thein Sein.He visited China several times over that period and was the first to vouch for Chinese "economic corridors" to be built through Myanmar. During a visit in August 2015 -- before the NLD won its first election victory in November of that year -- he was quoted in a Chinese Foreign Ministry bulletin saying that "Myanmar thanks China" for its humanitarian support and "Myanmar cherishes China as a friend in need," reported Asia Times.Indeed, he is known for his anti-Western and pro-Chinese stance. At one point he even told Thein Sein not to meet then-US president Barack Obama, insiders say, reported Asia Times.Now Wunna Maung Lwin is back and his cordial relations with Chinese officials will likely prove pivotal as the West contemplates renewed sanctions and other punitive measures against the coup-makers. Hence, China is poised to benefit from the Myanmar military coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-making-cautious-moves-to-save-its-investments-in-myanmar-after-coup-101612518804078.html

It has become a bastion of the Western public opinion war against China," Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed tabloid the Global Times, said on Twitter.The foreign ministry's criticism of the BBC was among the top trends on China's Weibo social media platform on Friday."BBC shall not become Bad-mouthing Broadcasting Corporation," ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Twitter.BBC broadcasts, like those of most major Western news outlets, are blocked in China.Some people called for the BBC to be expelled in response to CGTN's licence being revoked.Also watch| US President Joe Biden talks tough on Russia & China"The BBC has long been stationed in Beijing, yet has always held ideological prejudice and broadcast fake news from its platform, deliberately defaming China.

05-02-2021||World||Covid-19: Russian vaccine team in talks with China on combination trial||Fresh off global validation of their Covid-19 vaccine’s extraordinary effectiveness, Russian developers are in talks with China’s CanSino Biologics Inc. to test a combined regimen of their shots to better protect against new virus strains, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, a partner in the Sputnik V vaccine program, forged a preliminary agreement with the Tianjin-based vaccine developer and Petrovax Pharm Llc, owned by billionaire Vladimir Potanin, to conduct tests in Russia, four people said, declining to be identified as the information isn’t public. Petrovax is Cansino’s Russian partner.They are negotiating the design of the trial which would replace Sputnik’s second shot with CanSino’s, and may announce a plan as soon as this month, they said. Spokespeople for Petrovax and RDIF declined to comment, as did CanSino.Researchers are looking at whether combining different developers’ vaccines in a two-shot regimen produces results that are as good as, or better than, using the same product as a booster. That flexibility could help to relieve pressure on individual vaccine makers if they run into manufacturing difficulties. While the Sputnik V program already has success using different vectors for its two doses, it has faced challenges ramping up production amid an ambitious rollout.The prospect of a Russia-China tie-up could potentially offer developing countries a new tool to fight the pandemic and increase the two giants’ geopolitical influence as major western countries remain pre-occupied with their own crises.Also read| Covid vaccine Sputnik V turns out to be a scientific and political win for PutinOther tie-up plans are also progressing: the University of Oxford plans to start a trial combining vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc., while Russia will begin testing a mix of Sputnik V with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan next week.RDIF and the state-run Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed Sputnik V, are ready to cooperate with other producers to make their shots more effective, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Sputnik V co-developer the Russian Direct Investment Fund said in interview earlier this week.Dmitriev said that Sputnik V plans to cooperate with a Chinese vaccine maker, though he declined to identify the company.The Russian vaccine shows 91.6% efficacy, according to peer-reviewed interim analysis published in the medical journal The Lancet on Feb. 2. CanSino is preparing to release interim efficacy data before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 12. China’s other leading vaccines have shown lower protection rates, ranging from 50% to 80%.“Sputnik V was the first vaccine that offered so called heterogeneous boosting -- using two different vectors for two shots,” Dmitriev said. “Only this approach can help to fight new strains of the virus.”Sputnik V uses two different human adenovirus vectors for its shots, the second of which is the same as CanSino’s adenovirus platform. The Chinese vaccine is currently undergoing global Phase 3 trials, including in Russia with Petrovax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-russian-vaccine-team-in-talks-with-china-on-combination-trial-101612517546901.html

Merck is one of the world’s main suppliers of the custom lipid nanoparticles that are crucial to producing shots using messenger-RNA technology.German Chancellor Angela Merkel cited lipids earlier this week as a main constraint on scaling up mRNA vaccine production. CureVac NV Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas echoed those sentiments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday, saying his company is facing challenges making more of its experimental Covid shot because the mRNA industry was so small a year ago and there are now calls for billions of doses.Also read | Covid-19 vaccine: Pfizer withdraws emergency use application in IndiaBottlenecks in the supply chain include components needed to make the genetic material for the shots, along with the lipid nanoparticles required to envelop that material, Haas said. There are also shortages for the machinery used in making mRNA, Haas said.Merck, based in Darmstadt, Germany, is not affiliated with US-based Merck & Co. Over the past year, it’s intensified a collaboration with BioNTech and also supported about 50 other Covid vaccine projects in a role similar to that of a supplier in the auto sector, it said.Merck KGaA shares were little changed in Frankfurt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merck-kgaa-to-help-biontech-for-faster-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101612516975518.html

She would become the first woman to lead the organization.South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a news release Friday that its minister for trade, Yoo Myung-hee, will soon tell the WTO she is withdrawing her candidacy.The WTO, which makes world trade rules, announced in October that Yoo and Okonjo-Iweala were the two finalists to become its next director-general, ensuring a woman will fill the top job for the first time. The WTO had ben expected to announce a winner before the end of 2020, but the process dragged on because of disagreements between member states over the candidates, the South Korean ministry said.While it appeared Okonjo-Iweala had broader support, the WTO, which operates by consensus, which means that any single member country can block decisions.Also read | South Korea revamps social distancing rules amid fourth wave of Covid-19The South Korean ministry said Yoo discussed her candidacy with officials from the United States and other WTO member states before deciding to withdraw over “comprehensive” considerations.The previous WTO director-general, Roberto Azevedo of Brazil, made a surprise announcement in May last year that he would leave the job a year early, citing a “personal decision.” He left without a successor at the end of August.The Geneva-based WTO, which was created in 1995 out of the former General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has never had a woman director-general or national from Africa as its leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-trade-minister-drops-bid-to-become-wto-chief-101612516255873.html

Transportation and Tourism are among the hardest-hit sectors.Friday's data marked Indonesia's first annual economy hit since the regional currency crisis which had forced the resignation of its long-term dictator Suharto in 1998."The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the whole world, including Indonesia," said statistics agency chief Suhariyanto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.The country has some of the worst virus infection rates in Asia, and President Joko Widodo has been widely criticised over his government's handling of the pandemic.Suhariyanto said that some indicators, including trade data, showed signs of picking up last month, since the nation of nearly 270 million launched a mass vaccination plan."The vaccination program and adherence to health protocols are important keys to an economic recovery," he added.Several million Indonesians have been laid off as the central bank repeatedly cut interest rates in a bid to spur growth. Governments around the world have been struggling to contain the coronavirus, which has forced the shutdown of vast areas of the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-takes-the-biggest-toll-on-indonesia-s-economy-since-the-1998-crisis-101612499963908.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.Ambassador Sandhu said: “We have been engaging with the US administration and other stakeholders on issues related to movement of Indian professionals, highlighting the importance of people-to-people linkages and the contribution of Indian skilled professionals to the growth and development of the US economy, especially in the technology and innovation sector.“They have also been a critical component of the first responders providing Covid-19 related assistance in sectors such as health, information technology and financial services”.Responding to another question, Sandhu said that owing to the public health requirements in the initial days of lockdown, some travel restrictions were placed which were relaxed gradually.“Currently, there are no restrictions on travel to India for OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) card holders. Over four million strong Indian-American community has been playing a critical role in crafting the India-US partnership.“We deeply value their contribution and support in India’s development and further strengthening understanding and friendship between our two countries,” Sandhu added.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas in a year. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confident-that-indian-professionals-will-continue-to-be-welcomed-in-us-envoy-101612514450489.html

Yet hotel quarantine will come in to force more than 50 days after the South African strain was discovered," Labour's home affairs spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said.Health minister Matt Hancock had discussed the policy with his counterpart in Australia, where quarantine was introduced in March 2020, the Health Department said.

05-02-2021||World||Turkey Uighurs fear sellout to China in exchange for vaccine||Abdullah Metseydi, a Uighur in Turkey, was readying for bed last month when he heard commotion, then pounding on the door. “Police! Open the door!”A dozen or more officers poured in, many bearing guns and wearing the camouflage of Turkey’s anti-terror force. They asked if Metseydi had participated in any movements against China and threatened to deport him and his wife. They took him to a deportation facility, where he now sits at the center of a brewing political controversy.Opposition legislators in Turkey are accusing Ankara’s leaders of secretly selling out Uighurs to China in exchange for coronavirus vaccines. Tens of millions of vials of promised Chinese vaccines have not yet been delivered. Meanwhile, in recent months, Turkish police have raided and detained around 50 Uighurs in deportation centers, lawyers say — a sharp uptick from last year.Although no hard evidence has yet emerged for a quid pro quo, these legislators and the Uighurs fear that Beijing is using the vaccines as leverage to win passage of an extradition treaty. The treaty was signed years ago but suddenly ratified by China in December, and could come before Turkish lawmakers as soon as this month.Uighurs say the bill, once law, could bring their ultimate life-threatening nightmare: Deportation back to a country they fled to avoid mass detention. More than a million Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities have been swept into prisons and detention camps in China, in what China calls an anti-terrorism measure but the United States has declared a genocide.“I'm terrified of being deported,” said Melike, Metseydi's wife, through tears, declining to give her last name for fear of retribution. “I’m worried for my husband's mental health.”Suspicions of a deal emerged when the first shipment of Chinese vaccines was held up for weeks in December. Officials blamed permit issues.But even now, Yildirim Kaya, a legislator from Turkey’s main opposition party, said that China has delivered only a third of the 30 million doses it promised by the end of January. Turkey is largely reliant on China’s Sinovac vaccine to immunize its population against the virus, which has infected some 2.5 million and killed over 26,000.“Such a delay is not normal. We have paid for these vaccines," Kaya said. “Is China blackmailing Turkey?”Kaya said he’s formally asked the Turkish government about pressure from China but has not yet received a response.Both Turkish and Chinese authorities insist that the extradition bill isn’t meant to target Uighurs for deportation. Chinese state media called such concerns “smearing," and foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin denied any connection between vaccines and the treaty.“I think your speculation is unfounded,” Wang said at a Thursday press briefing.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in December that the vaccine delay was not related to the issue of the Uighurs.“We do not use the Uighurs for political purposes, we defend their human rights,” Cavusoglu said.But though very few have actually been deported for now, the recent detentions have sent a chill through Turkey’s estimated 50,000-strong Uighur community. And in recent weeks, the Turkish ambassador in Beijing has praised China’s vaccines while adding that Ankara values “judicial cooperation” with China — code, many Uighurs fear, for a possible crackdown.In the past, a small number of Uighurs have traveled to Syria to train with militants. But most Uighurs in Turkey shun jihadis and worry they are hurting the Uighur cause.Lawyers representing the detained Uighurs say that in most cases, the Turkish police have no evidence of links to terror groups. Ankara law professor Ilyas Dogan believes the detentions are politically motivated.“They have no concrete evidence,” said Dogan, who is representing six Uighurs now in deportation centers, including Metseydi. “They're not being serious.”Even if the bill is ratified, Dogan doubts there would be mass deportations, given widespread public sympathy for the Uighurs in Turkey. But he believes the chances of individuals being deported would go up significantly.Because of shared cultural ties, Turkey has long been a safe haven for the Uighurs, a Turkic group native to China’s far west Xinjiang region. Turkish President Recep Erdogan denounced China’s treatment of the Uighurs as “genocide” over a decade ago.That all changed with an attempted coup in Turkey in 2016, which prompted a mass purge and alienated Erdogan from Western governments. Waiting to fill the void was China, which is loaning and investing billions in Turkey.Signs of strong economic ties abound, big and small: An exporter with business in China was appointed Turkey’s ambassador to Beijing. A Chinese-funded $1.7 billion coal plant is rising on the banks of Turkey’s Mediterranean sea. Istanbul’s airport obtained the world’s first “Chinese Friendly Airport” certification, setting aside check-in counters to receive thousands of tourists from Shanghai and Beijing. And President Erdogan's once-fiery rhetoric has turned dull and diplomatic, praising China’s leaders for their assistance.China also began requesting the extradition of many more Uighurs from Turkey. In one leaked 2016 extradition request first reported by Axios and obtained independently by The Associated Press, Chinese officials asked for the extradition of a Uighur former cellphone vendor, accusing him of promoting the Islamic State terror group online. The vendor was arrested but eventually released and cleared of charges.Abdurehim Parac, a Uighur poet detained twice in the past few years, said even detention in Turkey was “hotel-like” compared to the “hellish” conditions he was subjected to during three years in Chinese prison. Imim was eventually released after a judge cleared his name. But he has difficulty sleeping at night out of fear that the extradition bill might be ratified, and called the pressure “unbearable”.“Death awaits me in China,” he said.Rising fears are already prompting an influx of Uighurs moving to Germany, the Netherlands, and other European countries. Some are so desperate they’re even sneaking across borders illegally, said Ali Kutad, who fled China for Turkey in 2016.“Turkey is our second homeland,” Kutad said. “We’re really afraid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-uighurs-fear-sellout-to-china-in-exchange-for-vaccine-101612511652611.html
05-02-2021||World||When will life return to normal? In 7 years at today's vaccine rates||When will the pandemic end? It’s the question hanging over just about everything since Covid-19 took over the world last year. The answer can be measured in vaccinations.Bloomberg has built the biggest database of Covid-19 shots given around the world, with more than 119 million doses administered worldwide. U.S. science officials such as Anthony Fauci have suggested it will take 70% to 85% coverage of the population for things to return to normal. Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker shows that some countries are making far more rapid progress than others, using 75% coverage with a two-dose vaccine as a target. Israel, the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world, is headed for 75% coverage in just two months. The U.S. will get there just in time to ring in the 2022 New Year (though North Dakota could get there six months sooner than Texas). With vaccinations happening more rapidly in richer Western countries than the rest of the globe, it will take the world as a whole seven years at the current pace.Bloomberg’s calculator provides a snapshot in time, designed to put today’s vaccination rates into perspective. It uses the most recent rolling average of vaccinations, which means that as vaccination numbers pick up, the time needed to hit the 75% threshold will fall. The calculations will be volatile, especially in the early days of the rollout, and the numbers can be distorted by temporary disruptions.For example, New York’s target date was briefly pushed out to 17 months this week after a winter blizzard prevented some from getting vaccinated (it’s now back down to 13 months). Likewise, Canada’s vaccination rate dropped by half in recent weeks following reports of delayed vaccine shipments. Based on Canada’s latest rate of inoculations it would take more than 10 years to reach 75% coverage. That might serve as a wake-up call to Canadian politicians and health officials, but it doesn’t mean the country is doomed to a decade of social distancing. Canada has contracts to buy more vaccine doses per person than any other country, and its vaccination rates are expected to climb. The pace is likely to accelerate further as more vaccines become available. Some of the world’s biggest vaccine-manufacturing hubs in India and Mexico are only just getting started. More than 8.5 billion doses of vaccine have been contracted by countries through more than 100 agreements tracked by Bloomberg. Only a third of countries have even begun their vaccination campaigns. Vaccinations protect against Covid-19 within a few weeks of getting the shots. But if just a few people in a community get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread unchecked. As more people get the vaccine, groups of people start to build a collective defense against the virus so that isolated sparks of infection burn out instead of spreading into an outbreak. The concept is known as herd immunity. In the scientific community, there are conflicting definitions for when herd immunity is achieved. Is it when enough people are protected that it begins to have a measurable effect on the speed of transmission? That could begin well before 75% of people are fully vaccinated. Others define it as the point when outbreaks can no longer be sustained. For example, even if there’s a cluster of measles cases in an unvaccinated community, herd immunity prevents it from rippling across a country. How We Run the NumbersThe vaccines available today require two doses for full vaccination. Our calculations for coverage are based on two doses per person in the population but don't distinguish between first doses or second doses administered. Those breakdowns can distort daily vaccination rates and aren’t available in more than 20% of the countries we’re tracking.A new vaccine by Johnson & Johnson recently showed positive results using a single dose in a large clinical trial. If approved, we’ll adjust the number of doses required proportionate to its market share in each country. The vaccines haven’t been authorized for use in children — those studies are currently underway. Our calculator, like the virus, includes children in the population needed to be protected. One metric Bloomberg’s calculator doesn’t account for is any level of natural immunity that might result from recovering from Covid-19. It’s possible that hard-hit places might require a lower level of vaccination to prevent widespread transmission. While there’s evidence that people who recover from illness do retain some level of natural defenses, it’s unclear how much protection is offered or how long it might last. The vaccine is still recommended for people who have recovered from illness. The calculator is the latest feature from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Tracker. The projections are updated daily and are based on the average daily vaccinations in data gathered from 67 countries and the U.S. states and territories. Countries may be excluded when they are in the earliest stages of vaccinations or if they provide infrequent updates on their vaccination numbers. More than 119 million shots have been given. See the latest numbers on Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-life-return-to-normal-in-7-years-at-today-s-vaccine-rates-101612507662353.html
05-02-2021||World||India played a key role in shaping UNSC’s position on Myanmar coup: Sources||India is learnt to have played a pivotal role to “bridge” differing positions in talks that led to a statement from the UN Security Council on Thursday calling for the “immediate release” of Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has been detained by the military.India also left its distinctive stamp on the statement with key insertions, reflecting its known positions, drawing upon a long and strategic relationship with Myanmar, according to people familiar with the negotiations. They cited the use of the word “process” by the UNSC in its call for upholding “democratic institutions and process” as proof of India’s role, alongside the use of the phrase “dialogue and reconciliation”.India was able to engage with all members during the negotiations because of a general acknowledgement of its role, according to the same people. Washington has said it has had “daily ongoing conversations” with New Delhi since the military coup last Monday.The statement issued by the UNSC followed intense negotiations with China’s acquiescence not clear until the final hours on Thursday. There was some finger-pointing over a leaked draft statement, which triggered speculation that China and Russia were blocking it. China slammed it later, saying it was “shocked and baffled by the leak and the irresponsible rumours”.The western powers in the 15-member council had pitched for a more “condemnatory” statement, according to the people familiar with the talks. A leaked draft prepared by the UK, which holds the UNSC’s rotational chair for February, had described the overthrow of Suu Kyi, her arrest and related developments as a “military coup”, which has legal ramifications and triggers punitive measures. The United States has already decided to call the overthrow a “military coup” and is considering new curbs and sanctions.Other members such as Russia, China and Vietnam “didn’t want a situation where you start condemning and it becomes counterproductive” and they wanted to “be constructive”, according to the same people.India’s own view was that “the Security Council’s pronouncements should not become counterproductive (and) it has to be constructive”, they added.The UNSC statement, which is non-binding, said the members “expressed deep concern at the declaration of the state of emergency imposed in Myanmar by the military on February 1 and the arbitrary detention of members of the government” – including Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and others. It added, “They called for the immediate release of all those detained.”In the leaked draft, as reported by POLITICO, this paragraph was stronger and had said the members expressed “deep concern at the state of emergency imposed by the Myanmar military on February 1, and the detention of members of the legitimately elected civilian government, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and civil society”.The draft had then gone on to say the members “condemn the military coup” and that they urge coup leaders to “immediately release those unlawfully detained”.That language, strong and forceful as it was, did not make it into the final statement. India played a key role there, based on its strategic relationship with Myanmar, ensuring what was acceptable to all the members, according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity.The challenge, the people said, was how to you find that bridge between the two positions. “It is not as much language as what is acceptable to the 15,” one of the people familiar with the talks said, referring to the 15 members of the UNSC.“The members of the Security Council emphasised the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar,” the UNSC statement said. “They stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. They encouraged the pursuance of dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-played-a-key-role-in-shaping-unsc-s-position-on-myanmar-coup-sources-101612503254355.html
05-02-2021||World||UN experts say Covid-19 upped extremist threats in conflicts||The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the threat from the Islamic State and al-Qaida extremist groups in conflict areas including Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, but the threat remains comparatively low in non-conflict areas despite a series of attacks in Europe, UN experts said in a new report.The panel of experts said in a report to the UN Security Council circulated Thursday that the threat continued to rise in conflict zones in the last half of 2020 because “the pandemic inhibited forces of law and order more than terrorists” who were able to move and gather freely despite Covid-19 restrictions.The panel said UN member states, which it didn't name, assess that as restrictions from the pandemic ease in various locations, “a rash of pre-planned attacks may occur.”“The economic and political toll of the pandemic, its aggravation of underlying drivers of violent extremism and its expected impact on counter-terrorism efforts are likely to increase the long-term threat everywhere,” the experts warned.The panel said Iraq and Syria remain “the core area” for the Islamic State group — also known as IS and ISIL -- and Syria’s northwest Idlib region where al-Qaida has affiliates is “a source of concern.”But the experts said Afghanistan remains the country “worst affected by terrorism in the world.”Despite initial optimism after the Feb. 29, 2020 agreement between the United States and the Taliban and the beginning of direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban last September, the panel said the situation in the country “remains challenging.”More than 600 Afghan civilians and 2,500 members of the country’s security forces have been killed in attacks since last Feb. 29, the experts said, and “terrorist activities and radical ideology continue to be a potential source of threats to the region and globally.”The panel quoted unidentified UN member states as saying the current number of ISIL fighters has fallen to between 1,000 and 2,200.While prospects of reviving its former offensive and holding territory “appear remote” ISIL has claimed responsibility for many recent high-profile attacks, it said.“Al-Qaida assesses that its future in Afghanistan depends upon its close ties to the Taliban, as well as the success of Taliban military operations in the country,” the experts said, estimating the number of al-Qaida members and their affiliates in the country at between 200 and 500 spread across at least 11 provinces.The panel said: “Afghanistan remains important to both ISIL and al-Qaida, and the peace process key to suppressing the long-term threat from both.”In Iraq and Syria, the experts said there is no indication that ISIL will be able to reconstitute its self-declared “caliphate” that once spanned a third of both Iraq and Syria and was defeated in 2017 “in the short to medium term."But they said the extremist group “will certainly exploit its capacity to remain in a region characterized by limited stabilization and reconstruction prospects.”An estimated 10,000 ISIL fighters remain active in Iraq and Syria “waging a sustained insurgency straddling the borders between the two countries,” the panel said.The majority of fighters are in Iraq but face pressure from the country’s security forces “rendering the country more difficult for ISIL operations” in comparison with Syria where the de-escalation zone in northwest Idlib remains “a limited safe haven,” it said.Elsewhere in the Mideast, the panel said al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula suffered setbacks in late 2020 and ISIL in Yemen suffered “substantial losses” in July and August, including its leader Abu Al-Walid Al-Adeni.The experts said Israel’s recent normalization of relations with some Arab countries “was used as a rallying narrative by terrorist organizations in the region” including al-Qaida groups which condemned leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and called on their followers “to retaliate by attacking foreign interests in the region.” An ISIL spokesman also called on followers “to attack foreign nationals in Gulf states” though none have been reported yet, they said.The panel said the extremist groups have made progress recently mainly in Africa.“While terrorism continues to spread in West Africa, the region of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique is among the most concerning areas,” it said.In Cabo Delgado, the experts said fighters from the Islamic State Central Africa Province have taken over towns and villages, continue to hold the port of Mocimboa da Praia despite a sustained government offensive.Elsewhere in Africa, the panel said an ISIL affiliate “remains resilient in northeast Sinal despite heavy Egyptian military pressure.” In the Sahel, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara “suffered significant attrition” in confrontations and as a result of counter-terrorism operations but “its command-and-control capacity remains effective,” the experts said. And in Somalia Al-Shabab continues to target military operations and civilians.In Europe, the experts said attacks in Austria, France, Germany and Switzerland between September and November “underscored the enduring threat” from extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-say-covid-19-upped-extremist-threats-in-conflicts-101612500593302.html

05-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta arrests senior member of ousted ruling party||A senior member of Myanmar's deposed ruling party has become the latest prominent politician arrested as the country's new military government confronts continuing resistance to its seizure of power.Win Htein, 79, is a longtime confidante of the ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and had publicly called for civil disobedience in opposition to Monday’s coup.He was arrested at his home in Yangon and and taken to the capital Naypyitaw, Kyi Toe, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, said Friday on his Facebook page.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, at least 133 officials or lawmakers and 14 civil society activists had been detained by the military in connection with its takeover. The NLD has said Suu Kyi and ousted President Win Myint are being held under charges that allow for their detention until mid-February.Win Htein told the Myanmar-language service of Britain's BBC radio in a call early Friday that he was being detained for sedition, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.“They don’t like what I’ve been talking about. They are afraid of what I’m saying,” he told the BBC.Also read| Fears raised over facial recognition use at Moscow protestsThe military government on Thursday morning had blocked access to Facebook in an evident effort to thwart protest organizing. Facebook is how most people access the internet in Myanmar and the company urged that it be restored.Still, signs of resistance were evident. Medical personnel have declared they won’t work for the military government. Anti-coup graffiti appeared in Yangon as well as flash protests on the streets, and a spirited protest by about 20 people occurred outside a medical school in Mandalay. Three people were arrested there, and Twitter posts that could not be verified said people were detained over the Yangon protests as well.Thousands of people in the capital Naypyitaw joined a rally in support of the military coup on Thursday, the latest of a number of events that aim to project an image of popular acceptance of the power grab.The takeover has been criticized by President Joe Biden and others internationally who pushed for the elected government to be restored.“The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence,” Biden said Thursday at the U.S. State Department in Washington, using Myanmar’s former name.Also read| Myanmar coup: UNSC calls for release of Aung San Suu Kyi, politiciansThe U.N. Security Council, in its first statement on the matter, “stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.” While the U.S. and others have described the military's actions as a coup, the Security Council's unanimous statement did not.The military seized power shortly before a new session of Parliament was to convene on Monday, declaring its actions were legal and constitutional because Suu Kyi's government had refused to address voting irregularities. The state election commission had refuted the allegations of irregularities and confirmed Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory.The military put all state powers into the hands of the junta, including legislative functions, during a one-year emergency. It also has formed a new election commission to investigate its allegations of voting irregularities, to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency and to turn over power to the winner.Myanmar was under military rule for five decades after a 1962 coup, and Suu Kyi’s five years as leader have been its most democratic period since then, despite continued use of repressive colonial-era laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-arrests-senior-member-of-ousted-ruling-party-101612499835590.html
05-02-2021||World||Resistance to coup grows despite Myanmar's block of Facebook||Myanmar’s new military government blocked access to Facebook as resistance to Monday's coup surged amid calls for civil disobedience to protest the ousting of the elected government and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.Facebook is how most people access the internet in Myanmar and the company urged that it be restored.The military seized power shortly before a new session of Parliament was to convene on Monday and detained Suu Kyi and other top politicians. The takeover has been criticized by President Joe Biden and others internationally who are pushing for the elected government to be restored.“The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence,” Biden said at the US State Department in Washington, using Myanmar's former name.The UN Security Council, in its first statement on the matter, “stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.” While the US and others have described the military's actions as a coup, the Security Council's unanimous statement did not.The military has said it acted lawfully and constitutionally because the government had refused to address its complaints that last November’s general election, in which Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory, was marred by widespread voting irregularities. The state Election Commission has refuted the allegations.About 70 recently elected lawmakers defied the new military government on Thursday by convening a symbolic meeting of the Parliament that was prevented from opening. They signed their oaths of office at a government guesthouse in the capital, Naypyitaw, where about 400 of them were detained in the aftermath of the takeover. They have since been told they can return to their home districts.The unofficial convening was a symbolic gesture to assert that they, not the military, are the country’s legitimate lawmakers.Some expressed their anger and their determination to resist the coup as they left the guesthouse.“This violates the human rights of the whole citizenry. This is not a coup. This is a treason against the government. I will have to say that this is state treason,” said Khin Soe Soe Kyi, a member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party.The military put all state powers into the hands of the junta, including legislative functions, during a one-year state emergency. It also plans to form a new election commission to investigate its allegations of voting irregularities, to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency and to turn over power to the winner.Anti-coup graffiti appeared in the country's biggest city with “Don’t want dictatorship”’ scrawled on a wall on a busy street, and Yangon residents banged pots and pans and honked car horns in a noise protest for a third night.In Mandalay, a northern city known for its activist politics, a spirited protest by about 20 people in front of the University of Medicine was broken up by police. Three were arrested.Medical personnel have declared they won’t work for the military government. Health workers are highly respected for their work during the coronavirus pandemic that is taxing the country’s dangerously inadequate health system.The protests have revived a song associated with a failed 1988 uprising against military dictatorship. Myanmar was under military rule for five decades after a 1962 coup, and Suu Kyi’s five years as leader have been its most democratic period since them, despite continued use of repressive colonial-era laws.Videos posted on social media showed medical personnel and others singing “Kabar Makyay Bu” — or “We Won’t Be Satisfied Until the End of the World” — sung to the tune of “Dust in the Wind,” a 1977 song by the US rock group Kansas.Thousands of people in the capital Naypyitaw joined a rally in support of the military coup on Thursday, the latest of a number of events that aim to project an image of popular acceptance of the power grab.But Suu Kyi, the daughter of an independence hero and a pro-democracy activist for more than three decades, remains the country's most popular politician. Her party said the charge against her is possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies, which were found at her house and were believed to be used by her bodyguards.The charge, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison, allows her to be held in custody until at least Feb. 15. Ousted President Win Myint is being held on a charge of violating a natural disaster management law. Suu Kyi is believed to under house arrest at her residence.Facebook users said service disruptions began late Wednesday night.“Telecom providers in Myanmar have been ordered to temporarily block Facebook. We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information,” Facebook said in a statement.In 2018, Facebook removed several accounts linked to Myanmar’s military, including that of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the new government's leader, because their content appeared to fuel hatred toward the Muslim Rohingya minority. The Rohingya were targeted in a brutal 2017 army counterinsurgency campaign that drove more than 700,000 to neighboring Bangladesh. The International Court of Justice has been hearing a case arguing the army’s actions constituted genocide.A Norway-based humanitarian group said Myanmar’s political crisis could create a humanitarian disaster affecting 1 million vulnerable people if international aid groups are restricted further.Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it was “deeply troubled” that Monday’s takeover by the military could affect ”people’s ability to access humanitarian assistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/resistance-to-coup-grows-despite-myanmar-s-block-of-facebook-101612499475438.html
05-02-2021||World||Biden calls for expanded efforts to protect LGBTQ rights globally||US President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people worldwide, including potentially through the use of financial sanctions."All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love," said the memorandum, building on a 2011 directive issued when Biden was serving as vice president."The United States belongs at the forefront of this struggle - speaking out and standing strong for our most dearly held values," the memorandum said.While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority.The memo directs US agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalisation by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report.Also read| World food price index rises in January, at highest level since July 2014: FAOIt calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for US federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people.And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions, when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people.Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild US credibility worldwide."To further repair our moral leadership, I’m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally," he said."We'll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers."Biden's campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally.Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people.White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden “stands by” his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-calls-for-expanded-efforts-to-protect-lgbtq-rights-globally-101612498792178.html

The company's chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, said last month J&J was on track to roll out the vaccine in March."Upon authorisation of our investigational Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, we are ready to begin shipping," Stoffels said in a statement announcing the application.J&J said it had rolling submissions with several global health agencies and would submit a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency in the coming weeks.J&J's application raised hopes for fighting a pandemic that has claimed more than 451,145 American lives and over 2,271,152 worldwide.Also read| Social distancing might be more beneficial for individuals during pandemicShares of Johnson & Johnson rose about 1% in extended trading on Thursday, while Moderna was down 0.7% and Pfizer stock was little changed.The United States has agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses, which J&J said it expected to supply in the first half of the year. The United States also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses.The company said it has doses ready for delivery upon emergency approval. It aims to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 with production in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.In J&J's trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers conducted in eight countries, the level of protection against Covid-19 was 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa where variants are circulating.Those results compare with the 95% effectiveness of the two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna.However, both those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the spread of new variants.J&J's main study goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response.The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that requires it to be stored in a freezer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-files-covid-19-vaccine-application-with-us-fda-101612494404649.html

05-02-2021||World||PDM announces march against 'puppet' Pak government on March 26||The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Thursday announced a long march against Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government on March 26. The march is seen as one of the major components of the opposition's anti-government movement, which began last year.According to Dawn, the alliance's leadership in Islamabad, PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the opposition parties in the PDM will contest the upcoming Senate elections jointly."Caravans of long march will leave for Islamabad from across the country on March 26," Rehman said and added that the PDM had decided that "we will contest the Senate elections jointly; there will be a joint strategy for it and we will not compete against each other. We will field joint candidates."Dawn further reported that the opposition alliance chief said that the PDM will decide about the Pakistan Peoples Party's suggestion to move a no-confidence motion against the prime minister, as well as about resigning from assemblies, after the Senate elections.Rehman said that the opposition parties had decided to "stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the common man" against the rulers, whom he held responsible for a steep rise in the prices of electricity, gas, petrol and food items.Rehman and the alliance also rejected the one-member inquiry commission comprising retired Supreme Court Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh set up by the government to probe the Broadsheet scandal, and "declares it an attempt by the government to mask its corruption", he added.The Broadsheet LLC, based in the Isle of Man, was hired by the NAB (National Accountability Bureau) during Musharraf's regime to trace out hidden assets of Pakistanis in foreign countries. The NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targeting the corrupt, the Broadsheet was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.Demanding an immediate decision in the Pakistan government's foreign funding case, Rehman said the prime minister's call for an open trial in the case was a "drama" because 18 of the party's bank accounts identified by the State Bank were being kept secret, according to Dawn."The opposition will continue its protest against the behaviour of the speaker and the chairman in the National Assembly and Senate and we will not cooperate with them in running proceedings of the house at any cost," the PDM president added.He said Transparency International, whose analysis Prime Minister Imran used to laud in the past, had today "declared him a certified thief".Accusing Imran Khan of seeking the biggest National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) in the foreign funding case, the PDM chief said "Foreign funding case is the biggest scandal in the country's history and Imran Khan is the main accused in the case."Pakistan Peoples' Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Sunday called upon the joint opposition party alliance to "force the removal of puppets", referring to Imran Khan and his cabinet.The PDM had organised several rallies including those in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Multan, and Lahore since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pdm-announces-march-against-puppet-pak-government-on-march-26-101612491414117.html

It's a difficult time for me. I want to have thought things through a lot before I make decisions," Merkel told RTL/n-tv.Facing fierce criticism from some German media, especially top-selling daily Bild, Merkel had earlier spoken to a group of Germans about the crisis and effects of the lockdown, including some distraught parents who were struggling to cope.Yet Merkel, who won praise for her handling of the first wave of the crisis, warned that although the situation was moving in the right direction, patience was still needed."I see some light at the end of the tunnel ... But we must be very, very careful to ensure so many people don't die on the last stretch," she said, adding it was too soon to say how long Germany's strict lockdown would be needed."I would love to impart some good news," she said. "But there is no point in awakening false hope so I always try to be realistic," she said.Germany has registered more than 2.2 million cases and nearly 60,000 deaths related to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-do-wake-up-at-night-germany-s-merkel-kept-awake-by-coronavirus-decisions-101612487299232.html
05-02-2021||World||In Biden's first diplomatic address, 'message' for Russia and China||U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday promised a new era after the scattershot foreign policy of his predecessor, Donald Trump, declaring "America is back" on the global stage in his first diplomatic address as president.In his speech, Biden signaled aggressive approaches to China and Russia, urged Myanmar's military leaders to halt their coup , and declared an end to U.S. support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen."American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy. We must meet the new moment ... accelerating global challenges from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation," said Biden.Trump angered European and Asian leaders with tariffs, fracturing of global alliances, and threats to withdraw U.S. troops. He did little to push back against a wave of authoritarianism in some countries.After a Trump-inspired mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, protesting Biden's election win, foreign allies and rivals alike expressed doubts about the health of American democracy.Biden's speech on Thursday was a full-throated attempt to vanquish those doubts, and convince Americans of the value of a forceful international approach."Investing in our diplomacy isn't something we do just because it's the right thing to do for the world," he said. "We do it in order to live in peace, security and prosperity. We do it because it's in our own naked self-interest."Biden's choice of the State Department as venue for his first big diplomatic address was an important symbol of the value he places in career diplomats, who Trump largely saw as opponents."American alliances are our greatest asset. And leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again," Biden said.Biden in his early days has attempted to repair what he has called the damage to America's standing around the world, rolling back Trump policies. He is working to revive the Iran deal, and renewed U.S. membership in the Paris accord and the World Health Organization.He challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin."I made it clear to President Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens, are over," he said.Trump had initially sought a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping but differences over trade, Hong Kong and what the U.S. military calls Beijing's destabilizing and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea prompted a rift.China, which is expanding its military and working to grow its influence around the world, is perhaps Biden's biggest international challenge as he begins his presidency. He called Beijing "our most serious competitor.""We'll confront China's economic abuses, counter its aggressive, coercive action to push back on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property and global governance. But we're ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so," he said.Not all U.S. allies may be happy at the sharp turn in U.S. foreign policy, including Poland, where Trump once pledged to deploy U.S. troops, or a host of nations that have criticized heavy-handed intervention by Washington in the past."We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen and our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again," said Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-touts-muscular-foreign-policy-in-first-diplomatic-speech-101612485874039.html

They called for the immediate release of all those detained, the Security Council said in a statement.It emphasized the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar and further stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."The members of the Security Council expressed concern at the restrictions on civil society, journalists and media workers. They also called for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need, including through the re-establishment of United Nations relief flights," the statement added.Council reiterated their strong support to regional organizations, in particular, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and welcomed the ASEAN Chair's Statement dated 1 February. They also reiterated their support to the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar for her good offices."The members of the Security Council reaffirmed their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar," the statement read further.Days after the coup by Myanmar military, the police on Wednesday charged San Suu Kyi for "illegally" importing at least 10 walkie-talkies.The New York Times reported an official from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party as confirming that the leader has been charged with an obscure infraction: having illegally imported at least 10 walkie-talkies.Myanmar's military launched the coup on Monday morning after days of escalating tensions between the government and the military in the aftermath of last November's general elections.San Suu Kyi-led National League for Democracy (NLD) claimed an overwhelming victory in the polls, securing over 80 per cent of the seats, according to media reports. However, the military and some political parties disputed the results, alleging that the polls were marred by irregularities.According to media reports, the detentions started in the early hours of Monday (local time), with political leaders held in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar, and soldiers said to be out on the streets and at prominent landmarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-unsc-calls-for-release-of-aung-san-suu-kyi-politicians-101612484798032.html
05-02-2021||World||Trump rejects call to testify at his impeachment trial||Former President Donald Trump's lawyers on Thursday rejected a request from Democrats to testify at his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate next week, dismissing their invitation as a "public relations stunt."Democrats in the House of Representatives accuse Trump of inciting insurrection when he urged supporters to "fight" his election defeat before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, fought with police and sent lawmakers scrambling for safety.Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer."The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding," Trump adviser Jason Miller told Reuters. In an open letter, Trump's attorneys, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, called the request a "public relations stunt."The attorneys this week rejected the impeachment charge and asserted that Trump's claims his Nov. 3 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud - which were baseless - were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Democratic lawmaker Jamie Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, wrote in a letter to the Republican Trump and his attorney inviting the former president, who left office on Jan. 20, to provide testimony under oath."If you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021," Raskin wrote.Castor told Reuters that Trump was within his rights in rejecting the request."The burden is on the House to prove their case," Castor said. "I’m not going to help them meet their burden."Several senators said it would have been a bad idea for Trump to testify. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a vocal Trump ally, told reporters: "I don't think that would be in anybody's interest."For two months after losing his re-election bid to Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump loudly argued that he lost due to rampant electoral fraud, claims that were rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.Trump's lawyers and most Republican senators have challenged the constitutionality of the trial. They have said the Senate does not have the authority to hear the case because Trump has already left office and cannot be removed.Such an argument would allow Republican senators - who hold half the seats in the chamber - to vote against Trump's conviction on procedural concerns instead of directly supporting his comments.A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate would have to support the charge to convict Trump, meaning 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats in backing it.The Senate impeachment trial of Trump, the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, is due to begin on Tuesday.Trump's first impeachment trial, on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress after he appeared to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, resulted in an acquittal last year by the Senate, where Republicans held the majority at the time and denied Democrats' attempts to present witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejects-call-to-testify-at-his-impeachment-trial-101612484526020.html
05-02-2021||World||Biden set to accept more refugees after years of Trump restrictions||U.S. President Joe Biden will seek to raise annual refugee admissions to 125,000 in the coming fiscal year, he said on Thursday, a more than eight-fold increase after former President Donald Trump slashed levels to historic lows.Speaking at the U.S. State Department, Biden also said he would approve an executive order to build up the country's capacity to accept refugees in the face of "unprecedented global need."Biden has pledged to restore the United States' historic role as a country that welcomes refugees from around the world after four years of cuts to admissions under Trump. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates there are 1.4 million refugees worldwide in urgent need of resettlement.During his presidency, Trump portrayed refugees as a security threat and a drain on U.S. communities as he took a series of measures to restrict legal immigration.Biden is confronting a refugee program hobbled by Trump's policies, which led to the closure of resettlement offices and the reassignment of program staffers. Trump's actions also disrupted the pipeline of refugees to the United States, a situation exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.Biden said the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions - up from 15,000 this year under Trump - would be for the coming fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2021."It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged," Biden said. "But that's precisely what we're going to do."Biden also intends to propose increasing the refugee ceiling for this year following a consultation with Congress, according to a White House fact sheet released on Thursday.Biden's refugee order will rescind Trump policies that "limited refugee resettlement and required excessive vetting of applicants," according to the fact sheet.Among those policies will be a 2019 Trump order that required U.S. states and localities to consent to receive refugees, two people familiar with the matter said.The rollback of that Trump order will be partly symbolic since a Maryland-based federal judge blocked it nationwide more than a year ago, a decision that was upheld in January by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Biden's order, the text of which was not immediately available, will take steps to increase U.S. capacity to process refugee applications, the fact sheet said.The order is expected to highlight the role of climate change in the displacement of people around the world, the people familiar with it said.Former President Barack Obama, whom Biden served under as vice president, set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. But Trump cut that number by more than half after taking office months later and steadily reduced refugee admissions in each year of his presidency that followed.Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a Maryland-based refugee resettlement agency, said in a statement that Biden's decision to raise the refugee ceiling would be "lifesaving for hundreds of thousands fleeing violence and persecution."Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican with hardline immigration views, criticized Biden's planned refugee increase in a written statement, saying it would "put American jobs and safety at risk during a pandemic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-set-to-accept-more-refugees-after-years-of-trump-restrictions-101612484288208.html
05-02-2021||World||Under Biden, first US warship sails via Taiwan strait||A US warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday for the first time under the new Joe Biden administration, prompting a strong response from Beijing as the two countries cautiously tread the waters after four years of Trump presidency saw increased tensions between the world powers.The 7th Fleet’s guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain transited through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday. “The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain (DDG 56) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Feb 4 (local time) in accordance with international law,” Lt Joe Keiley, the 7th Fleet’s spokesperson, said in a statement.“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” Keiley said.Taiwan’s defence ministry confirmed the passage without identifying the vessel.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the country was “closely monitoring” the situation. Wang said China would “…continue to be on high alert at all times, respond to all threats and provocations at any moment, and will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Beijing views any ships passing through the strait a breach of its sovereignty; the US and many other nations view the route as international waters open to all.China claims the democratically run Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly expressed anger as Washington stepped up support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships.On December 31, two US warships sailed through the strait, drawing a protest from Beijing. It came almost two weeks after a Chinese aircraft carrier group used the same waterway.Tensions between the two countries have risen in the last few years, in part as a result of the pandemic blamed on Beijing by former president Donald Trump, and the trade war.The latest passage warship comes two days after China’s top diplomat called for Beijing and Washington to put relations back on a constructive path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-biden-first-us-warship-sails-via-taiwan-strait-101612469104697.html
