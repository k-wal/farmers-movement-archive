All three of the vaccines authorised for use in the European Union (EU) -- made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca -- were developed to be administered in two doses delivered a few weeks apart.In trial studies, a two-shot dosing schedule was shown to be the only way to increase immunity against the virus to near-full level.France has been under fire for the slow rollout of its vaccination program. Prime Minister Jean Castex has characterized the rollout as having “a brisk pace,” and promised last week that 4 million shots -- both first and second doses — would be given this month.French authorities reported Thursday that over 2.1 million people had received one vaccine dose, of whom over 535,000 also had got their second shot.Researchers at New York’s Mount Sinai medical school also recently began studying vaccine effects in people who’d previously had Covid-19.The results are preliminary, posted on a website for researchers, but among 109 vaccine recipients those who’d previously been infected had 10 to 20 times higher antibody levels after the first dose of vaccine -- and retained higher levels after a second dose — than the never-infected.While the study is small, the Mount Sinai team concluded the findings suggest “only one dose of vaccine would not negatively impact” the previously vaccinated and offer a rationale considering policy changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-recommends-1-shot-vaccine-for-people-who-had-virus-101613148635537.html
12-02-2021||World||Salaries in US recover despite nearly 9 million fewer people working||n a stark sign of the economic inequality that has marked the pandemic recession and recovery, Americans as a whole are now earning the same amount in wages and salaries that they did before the virus struck — even with nearly 9 million fewer people working.The turnaround in total wages underscores how disproportionately America's job losses have afflicted workers in lower-income occupations rather than in higher-paying industries, where employees have actually gained jobs as well as income since early last year.In February 2020, Americans earned $9.66 trillion in wages and salaries, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Commerce Department data. By April, after the virus had flattened the U.S. economy, that figure had shrunk by 10%. It then gradually recovered before reaching $9.67 trillion in December, the latest period for which data is available.Those dollar figures include only wages and salaries that people earned from jobs. They don't include money that tens of millions of Americans have received from unemployment benefits or the Social Security and other aid that goes to many other households. The figures also don't include investment income.A separate measure tracked by the Labor Department shows the same result: Total labor income, excluding government workers, was 0.6% higher in January than it was a year earlier.That is "pretty remarkable," given the sharp drop in employment, said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.The figures document that the vanished earnings from 8.9 million Americans who have lost jobs to the pandemic remain less than the combined salaries of new hires and the pay raises that the 150 million Americans who have kept their jobs have received.The job cuts resulting from the pandemic recession have fallen heavily on lower-income workers across the service sector — from restaurants and hotels to retail stores and entertainment venues. By contrast, tens of millions of higher-income Americans, especially those able to work from home, have managed to keep or acquire jobs and continue to receive pay increases.“We’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Richard Deitz, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, referring to the concentration of job losses. “It’s a totally different kind of downturn than we’ve experienced in modern times.”Of the nearly 10 million jobs that have been eliminated by the pandemic, 40% have been in restaurants, bars, hotels, arts, and entertainment. Retailers have lost nearly 400,000 jobs and many low-paying health care workers, such as nursing home attendants and home health care aides, have also been laid off.On average, restaurant workers make just below $13 an hour, according to Labor Department data. Retail cashier pay is about the same. That’s less than half the economy-wide average of nearly $30 an hour.“It tells the story of an economy that has really tanked for the most vulnerable,” said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. “It’s shocking how small a dent that has made in the aggregate.”The figures also underscore the unusually accelerated nature of this recession. As a whole, both the job losses that struck early last spring and the initial rebound in hiring that followed have happened much faster than they did in previous recessions and recoveries. After the Great Recession, for example, it took nearly 2 1/2 years for wages and salaries to regain their pre-recession levels.“This is one of the worst recessions we’ve ever had — compressed into one-tenth of the time that a normal recession would take,” said Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at the investment bank Evercore ISI. "Hopefully, the recovery will continue to be compressed as well. That’s where the fears are and where the debate is.”One reason why the job losses have had relatively little impact on the nation's total pay is that so many of the affected employees worked part time. The average work week in the industry that includes hotels, restaurants and bars is just below 26 hours. That's the shortest such figure among 13 major industries tracked by the government. The next shortest is retail, at about 31 hours. The average for all industries is nearly 35 hours.The recovery in wages and salaries helps explain why some states haven’t suffered as sharp a drop in tax revenue as many had feared. That is especially true for states that rely on progressive taxes that fall more heavily on the rich. California, for example, said last month that it has a $15 billion budget surplus. Yet many cities are still struggling, and local transit agencies, such as New York City’s subway, have been hammered by the pandemic.The wage and salary data also helps explain the steady gains in the stock market, which have been led by high-tech companies whose products are being heavily purchased and used by higher-income Americans, such as Apple iPads, Peloton bikes, or Amazon’s online shopping.This week, the New York Fed released research that underscored how focused the job losses have been. For people making less than $30,000 a year, employment has fallen 14% as of December. For those earning more than $85,000, it has actually risen slightly. For those in-between, employment has fallen 4%.By contrast, job losses were much more widespread in the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Relatively higher-paying blue collar jobs in manufacturing and construction were hit worst: Construction lost 20% of its jobs, manufacturing 15%. Even a decade later, neither sector had fully recovered those jobs by the time the pandemic hit. Financial services lost 6% of its jobs in the previous recession, compared with 1% this time.Some companies have cut wages in this recession, but on the whole the many millions of Americans fortunate enough to keep their jobs have generally received pay raises at largely pre-recession rates. Some of those income gains likely reflect cost-of-living raises; the Commerce Department's wage and salary data isn't adjusted for inflation.Tedeschi calculates that the typical — or median — hourly pay for employed workers has risen about 3.5% in the past year, roughly the same pace as before the pandemic. That's a sign of what some economists refer to as the “sticky wages” concept: Some employers prefer to lay off workers while leaving pay largely unchanged for their remaining employees.Truman Bewley, a retired Yale University economist who wrote a book about the concept of sticky wages, said that most companies have a key core of workers they rely on through hard times and are reluctant to cut pay for them.And there’s another reason, Bewley said, why many companies cut jobs instead of pay. While researching his book, he said a factory manager told him why his company did so: “It gets the misery out the door.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/salaries-in-us-recover-despite-nearly-9-million-fewer-people-working-101613148549099.html

The United States has said it will review the mission's findings."Some questions have been raised as to whether some hypotheses have been discarded. Having spoken with some members of the team, I wish to confirm that all hypotheses remain open and require further analysis and study," Tedros said."Some of that work may lie outside the remit and scope of this mission. We have always said that this mission would not find all the answers, but it has added important information that takes us closer to understanding the origins of the Covid-19 virus," he said.The mission has said its main hypotheses are that the virus originated in a bat, although there are several possible scenarios for how it passed to humans, possibly first by infecting another species of animal.The former administration of US President Donald Trump, which left office last month, said it believed the virus may have escaped from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China has strongly denied this, and says the Wuhan Institute of Virology was not studying related viruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-all-hypotheses-still-open-in-probe-into-virus-origins-101613147004466.html

He says as spring turns into summer, everyone should be eligible to receive a vaccine.Fauci says, “As we go from April to May to June and then hopefully by July, we'll be at that point where we have enough vaccine for virtually everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dr-anthony-fauci-urges-people-to-keep-wearing-masks-as-vaccines-roll-out-101613146457618.html
12-02-2021||World||Donald Trump critics call for permanent Facebook ban of ex-president||Calling Donald Trump a "clear and present danger," a group of scholars and civil rights advocates on Friday urged Facebook to permanently ban the former US president from the platform.The group, which includes prominent longtime critics of the social media company, called on Facebook's oversight board to remove Trump from the omnipresent platform after the ex-president's account was frozen in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.Facebook's oversight board has the final say on what is removed or allowed to remain on the world's biggest social network, but the group warned of the dangers of allowing Trump to return."Overturning the Trump ban is an invitation to violence, hate and disinformation that will cost lives and undermine democracy," the group said in a letter to the board. "Don't strike the match."They described Trump as a serial abuser of social media rules who poses a danger "to democracy and human life."Rival social media giant Twitter banned Trump after January 6 and on Wednesday announced the former president will not be permitted back on the network he used constantly, even if he runs for office again."Our policies are designed to ensure that people are not inciting violence," Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said on CNBC.Conservatives on Capitol Hill and beyond say the moves by Facebook and Twitter to "deplatform" Trump demonstrate political bias and inhibit free speech.In the letter to Facebook's board, the group also lambasts the social media company for employing the board as a "fig leaf" to evade responsibility for tough decisions."More than ever, this demonstrates why we need independent, democratically accountable oversight," the group said.They also called for "laws that change financial incentives for big tech, heavy regulation and a reckoning with the algorithms that are laying waste to democratic society."Signers of the letter include Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change; Anti-Defamation League head Jonathan Greenblatt; and Harvard professor Lawrence Tribe.Facebook and its Instagram platform suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an attack on the seat of democracy that led to Trump's second impeachment by lawmakers.Members of Facebook's oversight board come from various countries and include jurists, human rights activists, journalists, a Nobel peace laureate and a former Danish prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-critics-call-for-permanent-facebook-ban-of-expresident-101613145856258.html

12-02-2021||World||Biden administration launches review aimed at closing Guantanamo prison||The Biden administration has launched a formal review of the future of the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, reviving the Obama-era goal of closing the controversial facility, a White House official said on Friday.Aides involved in internal discussions are considering an executive action to be signed by President Joe Biden in coming weeks or months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, signaling a new effort to remove what human rights advocates have called a stain on America’s global image.Such an initiative, however, is unlikely to bring down the curtain anytime soon on the high-security prison located at the Guantanamo Naval Station, due largely to the steep political and legal obstacles that the new administration will face.Set up to house foreign suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, the offshore jail came to symbolise the excesses of the US “war on terror” because of harsh interrogation methods that critics say amounted to torture."We are undertaking an NSC process to assess the current state of play that the Biden administration has inherited from the previous administration, in line with our broader goal of closing Guantanamo," National Security Council (NSC) spokeswoman Emily Horne told Reuters."The NSC will work closely with the Departments of Defense, State, and Justice to make progress toward closing the GTMO facility, and also in close consultation with Congress," she added.The immediate impact of a new approach could be to reinstate, in some form, the Guantanamo closure policy of Biden’s old boss, former President Barack Obama, which was reversed by Donald Trump as soon as he took office in 2017.Trump kept the prison open during his four years in the White House - though he never loaded it up with “bad dudes,” as he once vowed. Now, 40 prisoners remain, most held for nearly two decades without being charged or tried.Biden’s campaign said during the 2020 race that he continued to support closing the detention center but did not say how he would do it.It is also unclear how specific Biden’s coming executive action might be about his plans for the prison, which holds suspects in the Sept. 11 attacks among its detainee population.Filing out Biden's Guantanamo TeamSignaling that the process is still at an early stage, Horne said "a number of key policy roles still need to be filled within the interagency, including confirming sub-Cabinet policy roles at the Defense, State, and Justice Departments.""There will be a robust interagency process to move forward on this but we need to have the right people seated to do this important work," she said.Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, can expect to face many of the same political, legal and diplomatic hurdles that frustrated his former boss.Former President George W. Bush opened the prison and its population grew to a peak of about 800 inmates before it started to shrink. Obama whittled down the number further but his effort to close the prison was stymied largely by Republican opposition in Congress.The federal government is still barred by law from transferring any inmates to prisons on the US mainland. Even with his own Democratic party now controlling Congress, their majorities are so slim that Biden would face a tough challenge securing legislative changes because some Democrats might also oppose them.A revived Guantanamo strategy is expected to focus initially on further decreasing the number of prisoners by repatriating them or finding other countries to accept them, according to the people familiar with the matter.This could also mean re-establishing a State Department post of Guantanamo closure envoy, created by Obama but eliminated by Trump, to resume negotiations with other governments on detainee transfers, the sources said.In addition, the Pentagon could restart a parole-style review process of prisoners’ cases to determine whether they still posed a threat, the sources said.Still, any Guantanamo-closing plan could initially be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, which would make moving prisoners unlikely for now.The Biden administration has not made Guantanamo one of its top early priorities as it grapples with the pandemic and its economic fallout at home and global challenges such as China, Russia, Iran and Myanmar. In contrast, Obama made the closing of Guantanamo one of his first executive orders in 2009 but failed to achieve that goal by the end of his second term.Shutting the facility has been a longtime demand of progressive Democrats whose support helped Biden win the White House in November.The prison’s continued existence, critics say, is a reminder to the world of harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.More than a hundred human rights organizations signed a Feb. 2 letter to Biden calling on him to close the prison and end indefinite detention of terrorism suspects held there, saying it was long past time for “a meaningful reckoning with the full scope of damage that the post-9/11 approach has caused.”Even Trump once expressed dismay over the hundreds of millions of dollars a year it costs US taxpayers to keep the prison open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-launches-review-aimed-at-closing-guantanamo-prison-101613144225819.html
12-02-2021||World||NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s aide says data on Covid death was withheld||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s top aide told lawmakers she withheld nursing homes’ Covid-19 death toll for fear it would spark a federal investigation, according to reports in the New York Post and New York Times.Secretary to the Governor Melissa DeRosa told Democratic leaders that the state rebuffed an August legislative request for the number amid federal demands for a similar accounting, the Post report said.“We were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, and what we start saying, was going to be used against us and we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation,” DeRosa told lawmakers, according to a partial transcript published by the Times.“Basically, we froze,” DeRosa told the lawmakers, according to the Post report.The report was the latest blow to Cuomo, who has tried to deflect a barrage of criticism that his policies increased Covid-19 related deaths among nursing-home residents. On Feb. 3, a New York Supreme Court judge ordered the state Health Department to release data that revealed a larger increase in the number of deaths among patients in nursing homes than previously thought.State Attorney General Letitia James has also accused the Cuomo administration of undercounting Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50%, and of obscuring data available to assess the risk to patients.In a statement Friday, DeRosa tried to clarify her remarks to Democratic legislators. She said the administration prioritized answering queries about the figures from the Trump administration.“I was explaining that when we received the Department of Justice inquiry, we needed to temporarily set aside the Legislature’s request to deal with the federal request first,” she said in an emailed statement. “We were comprehensive and transparent in our responses to the DOJ, and then had to immediately focus our resources on the second wave and vaccine rollout.”She said the state couldn’t fulfill the legislators request for more data “as quickly as anyone would have liked. But we are committed to being better partners going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-s-aide-says-data-on-covid-death-was-withheld-101613143128486.html

12-02-2021||World||UK economy records worst year in three centuries||The UK economy has suffered its biggest slump in more than three centuries last year, with GDP falling by nearly 10 per cent over the course of 2020.According to CNN, this means that the Covid-19 pandemic has effectively wiped out all growth in the United Kingdom over the last seven years, returning the economy close to the size it was in 2013.The 9.9 per cent slump in the UK GDP was "less severe than expected" but it surpassed the 9.7 per cent slump experienced during the Great Depression in 1921, "making it the worst annual drop since 1709", according to a Bank of England database. That was when Europe's harshest winter in 500 years caused widespread death and destruction."This time it's a pandemic to blame whereas back then, it was a Great Frost, which saw ice in the North Sea, and the War of Spanish Succession ... which was doing the damage," wrote Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes in a research note on Friday as quoted by CNN.According to the Office for National Statistics, there were some signs of improvement in the final months of 2020, with GDP estimated to have increased by 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, following record growth in the third quarter.But there were big swings in output between October and December, largely tracking the level of restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus, CNN reported.The UK suffered one of "the worst recessions" among major economies last year.Germany, for example, held up better in the pandemic than it did during the global financial crisis. Provisional estimates suggest Europe's biggest economy contracted by 5 per cent last year. EU GDP, meanwhile, is expected to have shrunk 6.4 per cent, according to Eurostat."Today's figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world," UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement as quoted by CNN."While there are some positive signs of the economy's resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses," it added.The new national lockdown, which was imposed on January 5 in the country, is expected to hit the economy hard in the first quarter of 2021, reversing the return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2020."It seems that a double dip [recession] was merely delayed rather than avoided outright," Sam Miley, an economist at the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research said in a note on Friday.Disruption to EU-UK trade following the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 is "also weighing on activity."CNN further reported that British exporters have struggled to get their products into Europe due to border delays and glitches in new customs systems. Companies selling fresh produce, such as live shellfish and meat, have in some cases had to discard their products as a result. Even once the dust settles, new trading arrangements are expected to add additional costs to UK companies, which rely on Europe for a large portion of their imports and exports.According to a survey published on Thursday by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the coronavirus pandemic has left more than a quarter of British adults financially vulnerable, with too much debt or not enough savings to cope with a "negative life event" such as redundancy, loss of working hours, or ill health.Citing the survey, the news outlet reported that nearly 40 per cent of British adults suffered financially as a consequence of the pandemic, with younger workers, Black people and the self-employed among the hardest hit.According to Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, who pointed to high savings rates among UK households in an opinion piece published in a British media outlet on Thursday, said that half of adults in the FCA survey said the pandemic had not disturbed their finances, while some 15 per cent of adults were financially better off. That could lay the foundation for a savings-led boost to demand."The rapid rollout of the vaccination programme across the UK means a decisive corner has been turned in the battle against Covid," he said as reported by CNN quoting The Daily Mail."A decisive corner is about to be turned for the economy too, with enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-records-worst-year-in-three-centuries-101613138986614.html

[L4N2JH1KS]Outflow levels at Jinghong Dam were 785 cubic metres per second in early-January before rising to 1,400 cubic metres per second in mid-January, the MRC said.However, levels dropped again in February and were 800 cubic metres per second as of Thursday, the MRC said. The statement did not mention any recent notification from Beijing.China said the dam's outflow has been consistently more than 1,000 cubic meters per second since the end of January, a level it says is nearly twice the natural flow of the river. It called on the MRC "to avoid causing public misunderstanding".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mekong-river-at-worrying-low-level-amid-calls-for-more-chinese-dam-data-101613137861375.html
12-02-2021||World||Joe Biden administration to allow 25,000 asylum-seekers into US||The Biden administration on Friday announced plans for tens of thousands of asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico for their next immigration court hearings to be allowed into the United States while their cases proceed.The first of an estimated 25,000 asylum-seekers in Mexico with active cases will be allowed in the United States on February 19, authorities said. They plan to start slowly with two border crossings each processing up to 300 people a day and a third crossing taking fewer. Administration officials declined to name them out of fear they may encourage a rush of people to those locations.The move is a major step toward dismantling one of former President Donald Trump's most consequential policies to deter asylum-seekers from coming to the US. About 70,000 asylum-seekers were enrolled in “ Remain in Mexico,” officially called “Migrant Protection Protocols,” since it was introduced in January 2019.On Biden's first day in office, the Homeland Security Department suspended the policy for new arrivals. Since then, some asylum-seekers picked up at the border have been released in the US with notices to appear in court.Biden is quickly making good on a campaign promise to end the policy, which the Trump administration said was critical to reversing a surge of asylum-seekers that peaked in 2019. But the policy also exposed people to violence in Mexican border cities and made it extremely difficult for them to find lawyers and communicate with courts about their cases.“As President Biden has made clear, the US government is committed to rebuilding a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation’s values.”Homeland Security said the move “should not be interpreted as an opening for people to migrate irregularly to the United States.” Administration officials have said repeatedly that the vast majority of people who cross the border illegally are quickly expelled under a public health order in place since the pandemic struck in March, but releases of some asylum-seeking families in Texas and California has worked against that messaging.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that she was concerned that limited releases in the US may encourage others to cross illegally because “we don’t want people to put themselves in danger at a time where it is not the right time to come, because we have not had time to put in place a humane and moral system and process.”Hearings for people enrolled in “Remain in Mexico” have been suspended since June due to the pandemic. Getting word out on when to report to the border for release in the United States may prove a daunting job.Homeland Security said it would soon announce a “virtual registration process” available online and by phone for people to learn where and when they should report. It urged asylum-seekers not to report to the border unless instructed.Asylum-seekers will be tested for Covid-19 before entering the US.The announcement provides no relief to people whose cases were dismissed or denied, though administration officials did not rule out additional measures. Advocates argue that communication problems, including lack of working addresses in Mexico, caused some to miss hearings and lose their cases as a result.More people are getting stopped crossing the border illegally since Biden took office.Raul Ortiz, deputy chief of the Border Patrol, said Tuesday that more than 3,000 people had been stopped crossing the border illegally in each of the previous 10 days, compared to a daily average of 2,426 in January.About 50 to 80 adults and children have been arriving daily since January 27 at Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, which temporarily houses people released by the Border Patrol, said Sister Norma Pimentel, the group’s executive director. The charity tests for Covid-19 and sends anyone who tests positive to a hotel for isolation.Jewish Family Service of San Diego housed 191 asylum-seekers the first 10 days of February after the were released by U.S authorities, up from 144 in January and 54 in December, said Eitan Peled, the group’s border services advocate. They are quarantined in hotels for 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-to-allow-25-000-asylum-seekers-into-us-101613137990588.html
12-02-2021||World||Immigration to Canada falls by half on pandemic disruptions||Immigration into Canada fell by almost half last year, hitting its lowest level in more than two decades as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted travel across borders.Final government data released Thursday show Canada added 184,370 permanent residents in 2020, down from 341,175 a year earlier. That appears to be the lowest intake since the late 1990s, according to Statistics Canada data. It’s also well short of the 341,000 newcomers Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government had targeted in 2020.It’s a sharp reversal for a country that has relied on rapid immigration growth to drive its economy in recent years. A steep decline in flows could have implications for everything from the housing market to demand for services in urban centers.“The pandemic has left a significant mark on what was -- going into this year -- one of Canada’s engines of growth,” Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by email.The numbers aren’t a surprise, though, given borders have been closed to non-essential travel since March. Data for December also showed permanent residents were down by about 50% from a year earlier, suggesting the weak trend persists.Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino in October announced he’ll try to make up the losses in 2020 by ramping up targets over the next three years, in part by converting more temporary residents like foreign workers and international students to permanent residency. The goal is to attract 401,000 new permanent residents in 2021.Study permits have been showing a similar trend to immigration. At the end of last year, there were 530,540 student permit holders in Canada, down from 638,960 at the end of 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigration-to-canada-falls-by-half-on-pandemic-disruptions-101613137257734.html
12-02-2021||World||Russia ready for split with EU if sanctions over Navalny arrest imposed||Russia is prepared for a split with the European Union if the EU imposes new crippling sanctions amid a dispute over the treatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the nation's top diplomat warned Friday.In response to a question about Moscow's willingness to rupture links with the EU, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in televised remarks that Russia doesn't want to be isolated but must increase its self-sufficiency to face potential EU sanctions.“We don’t want to be isolated from international life, but we must be ready for that," Lavrov said. “If you want peace, you must prepare for war.”Asked if Russia is heading toward a split with the European Union, Lavrov replied, “We proceed from the assumption that we are ready for that.”He emphasized the importance of economic ties with the 27 EU nations, adding that Russia would continue engaging in mutually beneficial cooperation. At the same time, Lavrov said, Russia must prepare for the worst and increasingly rely on its own resources."We must achieve that in the economic sphere, if we see again, as we have felt more than once, that sanctions imposed in some areas create risks to our economy, including in the most sensitive spheres, such as supplies of parts and components," the Russian foreign minister added.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Russia wants to maintain normal ties with the EU but needs to prepare for the worst, if the bloc takes hostile actions.“If we face a destructive course that will hurt our infrastructure, our interests, Russia must be ready in advance for such unfriendly steps,” Peskov said during a call with reporters when asked about Lavrov's comment. “We must be self-reliant. We must ensure our security in the most sensitive strategic areas and be prepared to replace everything we could be deprived of with national infrastructure in case madness prevails and such unfriendly actions take place.”European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said Friday the EU welcomes “mutually beneficial cooperation whenever the other side is ready for such a cooperation and for such a dialogue,” adding that Russia has “indicated that they are not really willing to go in this direction.”German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse described Lavrov's comments as “really disconcerting and completely incomprehensible to us.” She told reporters in Berlin that Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had made Germany’s grievances with Russia clear but also emphasized that ”we are interested in cooperation with Russia.”Russia-EU relations have sunk to new lows over Navalny's arrest and imprisonment. The most prominent political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin was arrested Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recuperating from the nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have denied the allegations.Last week, a court in Moscow sent Navalny to prison for two years and eight months for violating terms of his probation while recuperating in Germany. The probation stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated and the European Court of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.Navalny was back in court Friday on a charge of defaming a World War II veteran who was featured in a video last year advertising constitutional amendments that allowed an extension of Putin's rule. Navalny called the people in the video “corrupt stooges,” “people without conscience” and “traitors.” He rejected the libel charges as part of Kremlin efforts to disparage him and could face a fine or community service, if convicted.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after visiting Russia last week that the 27-nation bloc must take a firm stance in its relations with Russia and ponder new sanctions in the wake of Navalny’s prison sentence. While Borrell was meeting with Lavrov, Moscow announced the expulsion of diplomats from Germany, Poland and Sweden for attending protests in support of Navalny.The three EU countries responded in kind Monday, each expelling a Russian diplomat.Borrell has said he plans to submit proposals for possible actions against Russia when he chairs the next meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers on Feb. 22.Navalny's arrest triggered a wave of protests across Russia that drew tens of thousands of people to the streets in the largest show of discontent in years. Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown, detaining about 11,000 people across Russia. Many protesters were fined or given jail sentences ranging from seven to 15 days.The United States and the European Union have urged Russia to release Navalny and to end the crackdown on protests. The Kremlin has accused them of meddling in Russia’s internal affairs and said it would not listen to Western criticism of Navalny’s sentencing and police actions against his supporters.Lavrov accused the West of pursuing the “aggressive containment of Russia” to punish the country for its independent foreign policy.“The sanctions wouldn't bring any result. They wouldn't change our course for defending our national interests,” Lavrov said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ready-to-sever-ties-if-eu-sanctions-over-navalny-arrest-101613135549828.html

These services are also critical in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and for economic opportunities," the company said in a statement posted on a section of its website devoted to the Myanmar crisis.“When following authority orders in these irregular times, we know it has negative impact on human rights in Myanmar. We are working to minimize this impact," it said.The company said it was assessing each government order according to its legality, impact on human rights, necessity and transparency. It listed five active directives from the government since Feb. 1 to block IP addresses and said it was urging authorities to maintain an open internet.But it also noted it needed to consider the safety of its own employees.A group of 158 Myanmar nongovernmental organizations also has released a statement protesting the draft law.Before the coup, the government had been working on a master plan for internet management and cybersecurity.Among other requirements, opponents of the draft law said it calls for banning online anonymity, removing content the government deems unacceptable and punishing violations with criminal penalties.The law demands the elimination of online comments considered to be misinformation or disinformation, that might cause “hate" or disrupt stability, and any comment that might violate any existing law.Its provisions call for a sentence of up to three years and/or a fine for any person convicted of creating “misinformation” and “disinformation” with the intent of causing public panic, loss of trust or social division in cyberspace.The law also would require internet service providers to keep usernames, IP addresses and other personal data for up to three years. The data has to be kept in a place designated by the government.The internet service providers could face maximum prison sentences of three years and a fine for failing to comply with the law's broad and vague provisions.“The proposal smacks of a legislative attempt to extend the powers the military had taken in an unlawful, anti-democratic coup,” said Kyung Sin Park, executive director of the Open Net Association, whose founders spearheaded a successful constitutional challenge against a similar law in South Korea in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/draft-cybersecurity-law-in-myanmar-adds-to-protests-over-coup-101613133740965.html
12-02-2021||World||'World is watching', UN rights body warns Myanmar after coup||The United Nations demanded Friday that Myanmar's military return power to civilian control and refrain from violence against protesters, warning that abuses would not go unnoticed.It also voiced concern over sanctions being imposed following the February 1 coup, stressing they needed to be "carefully targeted" to avoid harming vulnerable people."The world is watching," the UN's deputy rights chief Nada al-Nashif told the Human Rights Council in Geneva.The UN's top rights body was holding a relatively rare special session urgently requested earlier this week by Britain and the European Union to address the coup and its aftermath.UN officials and diplomats alike voiced alarm at the assault on democracy in the country and violence against protesters.Al-Nashif decried the detention of the Myanmar's elected civilian leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint, and of more than 350 others, including officials, activists, journalists, monks and students.In addition, she lamented, "draconian orders have been issued this week to prevent peaceful assembly and free expression".'Unacceptable'"Let us be clear: the indiscriminate use of lethal or less-than-lethal weapons against peaceful protesters is unacceptable," said al-Nashif.Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar's army, known as Tatmadaw, has justified his coup by alleging widespread voter fraud during November's election.And Myanmar's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Myint Thu, insisted to the council Friday that "in light of the post-election irregularities... Tatmadaw was compelled to take the state responsibilities".He said the country was "undergoing extremely complex challenges", and looked "forward to receiving better understanding... and constructive engagement and cooperation from the international community".Traditional allies of Myanmar's military, including Russia and China, slammed Friday's session as interference in "Myanmar's internal affairs"."Attempts to whip up hype around the situation in Myanmar need to cease," Russia's ambassador Gennady Gatilov told the council.However, most diplomats taking part in the mainly virtual session spoke out strongly against the coup, mass detentions and use of force against some protesters."This unacceptable and illegitimate seizure of power abruptly turned back the clock of history in Myanmar," Portugal's ambassador Rui Macieira said. Speaking on behalf of the EU, he added: "The will of the people must be restored."Britain's Asia minister Nigel Adams told the council: "The state of emergency and all restrictions on the rights and freedoms of people in Myanmar must be lifted immediately."The United States, which only re-engaged with the council this week after former president Donald Trump withdrew in 2018, also harshly condemned the coup.US diplomat Mark Cassayre said all those "unjustly detained" should be released, and called for "accountability for those responsible for the coup, including through targeted sanctions".President Joe Biden announced this week that his administration was cutting off the military's access to $1 billion in funds, with sanctions targeting Min Aung Hlaing and other top generals.'Complicit' Al-Nashif voiced concern over sanctions imposed in the wake of the coup."Any sanctions under consideration should be carefully targeted against specific individuals who are credibly alleged to have violated the people's rights," she said."Leaders of this coup are an appropriate focus of such actions," she said, adding that "it is of critical importance that no harm should be inflicted on the most vulnerable people in the country".The UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, Thomas Andrews, also called for targeted sanctions, and stressed that any aid should go directly to Myanmar's civil society instead of being filtered through the junta.And he called on private companies to refrain from doing business with the military "to avoid the risk of being complicit in gross human rights abuses".During Friday's special session -- the 29th held in the council's 15-year history -- diplomats will consider a draft resolution which demands the immediate release of Suu Kyi and the "restoration of the democratically-elected government".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-is-watching-un-rights-body-warns-myanmar-after-coup-101613135192671.html
12-02-2021||World||At least 400,000 Yemeni children under 5 could die of starvation this year : UN||At least 400,000 Yemeni children under 5 could die of starvation this year without urgent intervention amid soaring rates of severe malnutrition driven by war and the coronavirus pandemic, four UN agencies said on Friday.The warnings come nearly six years after the outbreak of war that rendered 80% of the population reliant on humanitarian aid.In a report published on Friday, the agencies projected a 22% increase in severe acute malnutrition among children under 5 in Yemen, compared to 2020.Severe acute malnutrition means there is a risk of death from lack of food. Aden, Hodeidah, Taiz and Sanaa are among the worst-hit areas, the report said."These numbers are yet another cry for help from Yemen where each malnourished child also means a family struggling to survive," World Food Program (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley said in a joint statement with the Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO), UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO).Another 2.3 million under 5s are expected to suffer acute malnutrition in 2021. Acute malnutrition among young children and mothers in Yemen has increased with each year of the conflict, they said, driven by the high rates of disease and rising rates of food insecurity.Around 1.2 million pregnant or breastfeeding women are projected to be acutely malnourished this year.Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen. The UN says the country is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.Along with conflict, economic decline and the pandemic, a shortfall of donations last year is also contributing to the worsening humanitarian crisis.Nutrition and other services that keep millions from starvation and disease are gradually closing across Yemen amid the acute funding shortage.The agencies said they had only received $1.9 billion of the $3.4 billion required for the country's humanitarian response. Programmes have started to close and scale down.A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthi movement in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-400-000-yemeni-children-under-5-could-die-of-starvation-this-year-un-101613133157654.html

12-02-2021||World||Donald Trump 'at 74 and overweight' was 'sicker than acknowledged' with Covid-19||Former US President Donald Trump was "sicker than publicly acknowledged" with Covid-19 when he tested positive for the disease in October last year.According to a report from The New York Times (NYT), Trump experienced extremely depressed blood oxygen levels at one point and a lung problem associated with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, according to four people familiar with his condition. It was also reported that his condition "was so poor" before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Centre from the White House officials believing that "he may need to be put on a ventilator".The people familiar with the former President's health said that "he was found to have lung infiltrates, which occur when the lungs are inflamed and contain substances such as fluid or bacteria. Their presence, especially when a patient is exhibiting other symptoms, can be a sign of an acute case of the disease. They can be easily spotted on an X-ray or scan when parts of the lungs appear opaque, or white."His blood oxygen level "was cause for extreme concern, dipping into the 80s", according to the people familiar with his evaluation. The disease is considered severe when the blood oxygen level falls to the low 90s."Trump had trouble breathing and a fever on October 2, the day he was taken to the hospital, and the types of treatment he received indicated that his condition was serious," NYT reported.Trump's medical team at Walter Reed downplayed the severity of the situation when he was at the hospital."At 74 and overweight, he was at risk for severe disease and was prescribed an aggressive course of treatments. He left the hospital after three days in which he at one point staged a brief ride in his armoured sport-utility vehicle to wave at the crowd of supporters outside the building," NYT reported further.Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, "repeatedly downplayed" concerns about the former President's condition during his illness. He also told reporters that while Mr. Trump's oxygen level had dropped to 93 percent, it had never dropped to the "low 80s."Trump had trouble breathing at the White House and was twice given oxygen before being taken to Walter Reed.While still at the White House, Trump received a drug developed by the biotechnology firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The antibody cocktail -- not widely available at the time -- helps people infected with the virus "fight it off".After Trump was hospitalised, he began a regimen for a steroid, dexamethasone, which is usually recommended only for Covid-19 patients who have severe or critical forms of the disease -- often for those who need mechanical ventilation. He received a five-day course of the antiviral drug remdesivir. Medical experts at the time believed that his medication course was a clear signal of significant issues related to his lungs, as reported by The New York Times.On Sunday, October 4, Conley acknowledged that he had given a 'rosy version' of the former President's condition."I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, his course of illness has had," he said as quoted by NYT. "I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction, and in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn't necessarily true."Trump appeared to still be struggling with the disease when he returned to the White House, where he stationed himself on a balcony in a "choreographed scene", tearing his mask off and saluting his helicopter.Doctors at the time noted how Trump used his neck muscles to help him breathe in those moments, a classic sign that someone's lungs are not taking in enough oxygen.CNN reported that as for the former first lady Melania Trump's condition, someone familiar with her treatment said she never took the then-experimental Regeneron antibody therapy used to treat her husband.This person said it took "a very, very long time" for her to get better, but she insisted on letting the virus run its course and treated her symptoms with holistic medicines, such as herbal teas, and "took nothing stronger than over-the-counter pain relievers."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-was-sicker-than-acknowledged-with-covid19-101613130691646.html
12-02-2021||World||Twitter to add more labels identifying world leader and government accounts||Twitter Inc said on Thursday it will next week add labels to identify more state-affiliated accounts, including world leaders' personal accounts, to give users more context for geopolitical conversations on the platform.The move comes as Twitter's approach to prominent figures and government is under scrutiny after the high-profile ban of former U.S. President Donald Trump's account and as political firestorms have raged in Myanmar and India.In August, Twitter said it would start labeling the accounts of state-affiliated media outlets such as Russia's Sputnik and China's Xinhua News and of some key government officials for the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.Twitter said in a blog post that it was expanding its labels to key government officials and institutions that were "the voice of the nation state abroad" from G7 countries and a majority of countries where Twitter has identified what it deems state-linked information operations.Mock-ups of the labels shared by Twitter said "US Government organization" or "US Government official."Asked how Twitter would determine government labels in situations such as Myanmar where the military recently seized power in a coup, Twitter's global public policy director, Nick Pickles, said the company was not labeling countries where government was in dispute."We will take into account the international discussion about legitimacy of the government when we are considering if it's appropriate to apply these labels," Pickles said in an interview.The labels will only be added to verified accounts, Pickles said. For example, in Iran that would mean that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would not currently get a label because he is not verified, though the foreign minister would.The new countries where senior officials and institutions will be labeled are: Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.Twitter will also label the personal accounts of heads of state from these countries and the UN Security Council permanent members, citing the use of these accounts for diplomacy.The company has faced international scrutiny over its approach to world leaders' accounts. In January it banned Trump after the Capitol riot for tweets - sent from his personal @realDonaldTrump account - that it said risked inciting violence.Twitter has generally exempted world leaders' rule-breaking content from removal because it deems their posts in the public interest, instead adding warning notices and reducing the content's reach. Pickles said the way Twitter enforced its rules on accounts would not be based on these labels.(Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-add-more-labels-identifying-world-leader-and-government-accounts-101613128694011.html
12-02-2021||World||Loujain al-Hathloul: All you need to know about Saudi activist who took the wheel||Loujain al-Hathloul, who was released on Wednesday after three years in detention, has been a key figure in Saudi Arabia’s women’s rights movement. In May 2018, al-Hathloul, along with a dozen other women activists, was arrested after being deported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Al-Hathloul is currently under probation and is not allowed to leave the country or her home. Saudi Arabia has also imposed a five-year travel ban on the activist.Who is Al-Hathoul?Al-Hathloul was an instrumental figure in the Women to Drive Movement, which fought against the Saudi law that prohibited women from driving. Al-Hathloul in support of the movement drove from the UAE to Saudi Arabia and documented it. She was stopped at the Saudi border and later sent to prison for 73 days for defying the ban, the arrest, according to al-Hathloul shaped her activism for the years to come.She stood for the municipal elections in 2015, becoming one of the first Saudi women to do so, even though she was banned from contesting the polls without being given valid reasons. Al-Hathloul later told Agence France-Presse that she wanted to run “to increase the percentage of women’s participation”. That same year hundreds of Saudi women launched campaigns to run for public office and ultimately 20 of them were elected to the approximately 2,100-member municipal council, a monumental achievement for the Saudi women’s movement.In 2016, al-Hathloul launched a movement against the Saudi guardianship law by sending a petition to King Salman calling for an end of the law. Her petition had 14,000 co-signatories. The ‘Wilayah’ male guardianship system requires Saudi women to seek the permission or accompaniment of a close male relative in matters of work, leisure, finances, law, and health. The system was reformed in August 2019 by King Salman’s son and heir the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), but by then al-Hathloul and many like her were already behind bars. The reform also did not give Saudi women the right to marry without seeking the permission of a male relative.Why was she arrested?In March 2018, Hathloul was arrested in the UAE and forcibly flown to Riyadh where she was held under house arrest before being moved to a prison in May. After months of rigorous detention, her trial began in Riyadh in May 2019. On December 28, 2020, she was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison under the country's counter-terrorism law, on charges of communicating with foreign diplomats, journalists and rights organizations and pushing for women’s rights.Al-Hathloul’s family have accused the Saudi government of torturing her in detention. Reuters reported that al-Hathloul and other activists was subjected to electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. Walid al-Hathloul, Loujain’s brother, told the Guardian in May 2019 that Saud al-Qahtani, the former adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, visited Hathloul in detention and supervised her torture.“He sat in on one of the sessions. He told her: ‘I’ll kill you, cut you into pieces, throw you in the sewer system. But before that, I’ll rape you,’” Walid told the Guardian.The Biden connectionAl-Hathloul’s family had pinned their hopes on Joe Biden getting elected as the US president. Biden’s commitment of a tougher stance on Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses was in direct contrast to Trump’s who had earlier dismissed such concerns. The fact that her release happened within a month of President Biden entering the Oval Office is not a coincidence according to many Saudi watchers.

12-02-2021||World||Facebook to curb content shared by pages, profiles run by Myanmar military||Facebook Inc. will significantly reduce the distribution of content from profiles and pages run by the Myanmar military, treating it as a source of misinformation in the wake of the February 1 coup that deposed the elected government.While US social networks have often been reluctant to pick sides in political disputes, Facebook is taking direct steps to stop distribution of the military’s narrative in the country. The company is curbing the reach of its information team and spokesperson Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun, adding “this same action will be applied to any additional pages that the army controls that repeatedly violate our misinformation policies,” it said in a statement.“Following the military coup in Myanmar on February 1, the situation on the ground remains volatile and Facebook is adapting to meet these events,” Rafael Frankel, director of policy for APAC emerging countries, said in the post.Facebook said it’s treating the situation in the Southeast Asian nation as an emergency, mobilizing resources including Myanmar nationals with native language skills to respond to any threats swiftly. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company is prioritizing the prevention of offline harm caused by content shared across its apps and services, while also preserving freedom of expression for local citizens. It is putting additional protections in place for journalists, activists and deposed political leaders and removing misinformation alleging widespread fraud or foreign interference in the country’s November election.The Biden administration was quick to denounce the coup and implement sanctions against its leaders. Thousands of protesters have been in the streets in defiance of a military order, demanding the release of political leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi. The army has responded by detaining more of her aides.The military junta has stepped up its crackdown on civil servants, lawyers, and other professionals in a bid to quell protests ahead of the large demonstrations planned for Friday, a public holiday in the nation. It’s also ordered the release of more than 23,000 prisoners, including 55 foreigners, a move that is likely aimed at weakening the protest movement and strengthening support for the coup leaders.“We’re seeing an alarming increase in arrests and detentions, usually at night, all arbitrary,” said Matthew Smith, chief executive of Fortify Rights, a human rights group. “If the amnesty is meant to free up space for political prisoners, then we’re seeing new heights of political oppression.”Demonstrators began to gather in front of the United Nations office and foreign embassies in Yangon on Friday, while there were protests in the capital Naypyidaw, Mandalay and Mawlamyine, according to social media updates. The gatherings, now into their second week, are taking place despite the risk of violence from security forces. Earlier troops used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-curb-content-shared-by-pages-profiles-run-by-myanmar-military-101613120860041.html
12-02-2021||World||Democrats pushing Biden's Covid-19 bill through House panels||Democrats pushed half of President Joe Biden's USD 1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan through a House committee Thursday, advancing USD 1,400 payments for millions of Americans and other initiatives that Republicans call too costly, economically damaging and brazenly partisan.The Ways and Means Committee approved its USD 940 billion chunk of Biden's proposal on a 25-18 party-line vote, highlighting a frenzied week that's seeing a dozen House panels fashion contributions to the sprawling measure. On Wednesday, the Education and Labour Committee approved another top Democratic priority — a boost in the federal minimum wage from USD 7.25 to USD 15 hourly over five years.“Yes it will. We're very proud of that,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters when asked if the overall House bill would include the minimum wage increase. Its fate remains precarious in the more moderate Senate.The House bill would provide hundreds of billions for state and local governments and to boost vaccination efforts, raise tax credits for children and increase unemployment benefits and federal health care assistance. Democratic leaders hope for House passage later this month, with Senate approval and a bill on Biden's desk by mid-March.In committee after committee, Republicans futilely launched waves of amendments at the Democratic measures in an attempt to derail the new president's top initial priority — a massive bill aimed at stemming the deadly pandemic and resuscitating an economy that's shed 10 million jobs and shuttered countless businesses.And while Democrats fended the amendments off, their control of the House and Senate is razor thin. Divisions between progressives and moderates and solid GOP opposition means the bill's final contours can still shift.Republicans' amendments spotlighted what they see as political soft spots they can exploit. Their themes were clear: Democrats are overspending, hurting workers and employers' job markets, being too generous to some immigrants, inviting fraud and rewarding political allies — allegations that Democrats dismiss as ludicrous.And while the GOP amendments were beaten back, they forced Democrats to take positions that could tee up GOP campaign ads for the 2022 elections.There were amendments to reduce the USD 400 extra in weekly jobless benefits Democrats want to provide through August and exempt the smallest businesses from Democrats' plans to gradually raise the minimum wage to USD 15 hourly from USD 7.25. Others would have limited emergency grants for undergraduates to US citizens and barred federal subsidies for some job-based health insurance to people without Social Security numbers, effectively targeting many immigrants.GOP proposals would also have put strings on emergency funds to help schools reopen safely, required that schools offer in-person classes or give the money to parents for education savings accounts if they remain closed. Still others would have ensured that aid for renters, homeowners and the airline industry didn't extend long after the pandemic ends, and divided $26 billion for urban transportation systems between cities and rural areas, which many Republicans represent.“I don't know if the White House knows this, but you're supposed to be creating jobs, not killing them,” said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, top Republican on the Ways and Means panel.Biden campaigned on reuniting a country riven by President Donald Trump's divisive four years. He met two weeks ago with 10 GOP senators to discuss the Covid-19 plan in a session that seemed cordial but has produced no visible movement.Democrats say attempts to compromise with Republicans wasted time and resulted in a package that proved too small when President Barack Obama sought an economic stimulus compromise in 2009, his first year. They want to finish this initial Biden goal without any stumbles and before emergency jobless benefits expire on March 14.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., eyeing 2022 elections that he hopes will make him speaker of a GOP-run House, suggested Republicans were ready to work to restore jobs, reopen schools and provide vaccines “to those who want it.” But he said Democrats' “policy distractions will only make America weaker and bring our recovery to a halt.”Democrats disputed Republican assertions that, for example, a proposed USD 400 weekly pandemic unemployment benefit was so generous it would discourage people from seeking jobs.“The whole force of this amendment is to not, quote unquote, spoil people by giving them too much money,” said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. She said it suggested people who've lost jobs do not “deserve to live above a starvation-level wage.”Even so, Republicans voiced concerns about the sheer size of the USD 1.9 trillion package. “Big doesn't necessarily mean good,” said Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-pushing-biden-s-covid-19-bill-through-house-panels-101613117404165.html
12-02-2021||World||UK economy surged in December 2020, capping worst year since 1709||The UK economy grew at double the pace expected in the fourth quarter, capping a year that delivered the worst slump since 1709.Gross domestic product rose 1% from the third quarter, fueled by a boom in construction and government spending. That averted the risk of a second recession early this year but left a 9.9% contraction for the whole of 2020, the biggest slump since a Great Frost killed crops across Europe.The figures add weight to the Bank of England’s view that growth is set to surge as Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s campaign to vaccinate the population takes hold. The central bank’s Chief Economist Andy Haldane expects consumers to unleash an estimated 250 billion pounds ($345 billion) of savings that households built up while the economy was locked down.“A year from now, annual growth could be in the double digits,” Haldane wrote Friday in the Daily Mail newspaper.GDP in the fourth quarter was 7.8% lower than a year earlier, further below pre-pandemic levels than any other Group of Seven economy.Output grew 1.2% in December alone, recouping some of the loss from the previous month when England was placed in a four-week lockdown. That suggests Britons are adapting to restrictions better than they did last spring, when the economy lost around a fifth of its value.Health care and education spending was responsible for much of the increase from the public sector. All the main segments of the economy in the fourth quarter, with construction posting the strongest reading. Companies also increased their stockpiles of goods before the UK’s Brexit transition period ended on Dec. 31.The outlook for the recovery hinges on the degree of scarring left by the pandemic. Few expect GDP to return to its pre-crisis path anytime soon, suggesting Britain will have to live with higher levels of unemployment and government borrowing for years to come.A double-dip recession would have been inevitable if the economy shrank in the fourth quarter. With the country now back under even harsher restrictions, the Bank of England expects a sharp contraction this quarter. Johnson is under pressure to ease restrictions on the economy starting March 8.The hope is for a swift recovery once the vaccine makes it safe to reopen schools and businesses. The pound was little changed after the report. trading down 0.1% at $1.3797 as of 7:14 a.m. London time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-surged-in-december-2020-capping-worst-year-since-1709-101613115944395.html
12-02-2021||World||Post-Covid digital economy must include persons with disabilities: ILO||Advances in the digital economy significantly accelerated by Covid-19 pandemic are creating unprecedented opportunities to build a more inclusive world of work for the more than one billion people with disabilities globally, according to a new report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO).However, digital barriers also threaten to aggravate existing inequalities and exclusion unless they are countered with effective and targeted initiatives.The report titled 'An inclusive digital economy for people with disabilities' was prepared by ILO Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) and Spanish disability NGO Fundacion ONCE.It looks at the effects of the digital revolution on the creation of new jobs, changes to existing roles and work models as well as online recruitment processes. It also highlights key areas for action by different groups of stakeholders including the digital industry, academia, governments, workers and employers, and people with disabilities themselves.The report highlights three main levers for creating a more inclusive digital labour market for persons with disabilities: ensuring accessibility, fostering digital skills and promoting digital employment.The increase in digital work creates acute problems for those without the necessary skills or equipment, the study says, pointing out that, due to persistent exclusion, people with disabilities generally have lower levels of education and training than their peers without disabilities.Hence, reskilling and upskilling will be key to building an inclusive future of work, alongside initiatives to foster digital employment and support collaboration between relevant stakeholders. Assistive technologies can also open up new occupations and opportunities.However, the report warns that a lack of accessible assistive technologies can create new barriers because without it many essential digital tools will not be usable by people with disabilities."The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated trends already present in the world of work, including the expansion of the digital economy," said Manuela Tomei, Director of the ILO's conditions of work and equality department."We must ensure that we direct this trend so that it supports an inclusive future of work in which the talents and skills of persons with disabilities can contribute to the success of workplaces and societies worldwide," she said.Fernando Riano, Director of Institutional Relations and Social Responsibility in ONCE Social Group, said: "In order to leave no one behind, the technological revolution which we are living and which has been accelerated by the pandemic needs to ensure an inclusive design for people with disabilities, so prevent it being a barrier for them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/postcovid-digital-economy-must-include-persons-with-disabilities-ilo-101613114964269.html

They were asked whether they wanted the movement to support a Draghi-led government which would place strong emphasis on green policies.Draghi has now forged a parliamentary majority following two rounds of talks with political leaders, and he’s expected to report back to President Sergio Mattarella with his cabinet picks as early as this week. Other backers include the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-migrant League of Matteo Salvini.In talks with party leaders Draghi has prioritized countering the pandemic and kick-starting Italy’s vaccination campaign, reviving the economy using the country’s 209 billion-euro ($254 billion) share of the European Union’s recovery package, and pushing for a common euro-area budget.Wide ConsensusNumerically, Draghi does not need Five Star, though the party’s support will allow him to muster wide consensus across the political spectrum.The online vote exacerbated tensions within Five Star, with Alessandro Di Battista, one of its most prominent members, saying after the outcome was announced that he’d leave the party. As many as ten Five Star lawmakers could follow suit, Corriere della Sera reported Friday.Party officials including co-founder Beppe Grillo, a former comic, urged Five Star members to support Draghi saying they had won agreement to create a new ministry for ecological transition, which will merge environmental and economic development issues.(Updates with Five Star internal dissent in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boost-to-italy-s-mario-draghi-wins-backing-of-largest-party-in-parliament-101613114517329.html

12-02-2021||World||Merkel defends lockdown extension, says 'mutations may destroy any success'||German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday defended the extension of the nationwide lockdown until March 7 in Bundestag and called on Germans to be "extremely cautious" and warned of the "dangers" of COVID-19 variants, reported DW News Agency.Lawmakers are hoping to avoid the health system being overrun by new COVID-19 mutations through the extension of the lockdown.Merkel also warned that the new mutations, which are already present in Germany, "may destroy any success" already achieved by the months-long lockdown.The chancellor also defended the use of infection rates to determine when it is safe to ease the lockdown measures."I really support the fact that when it comes to further openings and re-openings we've decided on the basis of these new mutations, not to give dates, but to give infection rates," she said.The German chancellor acknowledged that the lockdown had caused lots of suffering, saying: "This is a hard winter, both outside and when it comes to our lives."However, she said that her aim was to avoid another wave with out-of-control infection rates."My target is that any new wave that might happen if the new virus strains become dominant, we mustn't give that room, we mustn't end up with another two-digit exponential growth."As per the German lockdown rules, all nonessential shops and services are currently closed, as are schools, while workplaces have been urged to send workers home, reported DW News Agency.The rules also advise Germans to wear medical masks or FFP2 filter masks when entering shops or using public transport and contact is limited to one person outside of the same household.Meanwhile, State leaders and the government agreed that hairdressers may begin to open from March 1 if they follow strict hygiene guidelines while each state may decide on how to "gradually reopen" schools and daycare centers.The government is now also aiming for an infection rate of 35 new infections per 100,000 people in the past seven days. This number is lower than the previous rate of 50 that was considered necessary to allow contact tracing to function, reported DW News Agency.Further, the infection rate has been falling, but lawmakers are concerned about the spread of new, more contagious variants of COVID-19 -- which are already present in Germany -- if the country opens up too quickly, reported DW News Agency.The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recorded over 10,200 new infections in the past 24 hours on Thursday, slightly up from the previous two days, but following a general downward trend.The infection rate reached 64.2 new infections per 100,000 people in the past seven days, down from a high of 197.6 on December 22.There were also 666 new coronavirus deaths reported on Thursday, bringing the total death toll since the beginning of the pandemic up to 63,635.As pointed out in Merkel's speech, many people have been disappointed by the slow rollout of vaccines across the country, reported DW News Agency.According to the RKI, some 2.4 million people have received their first vaccine jab -- equivalent to 2.9 per cent of the population -- while 1.1 million have been given both doses -- 1.3 per cent of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-defends-lockdown-extension-says-mutations-may-destroy-any-success-101613106822969.html

Now, there's more space on the sidewalk.The barricades that went up after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2016 have been removed, New York police confirmed on Thursday.Police had already reduced their presence around Trump's New York home, located between 56th and 57th street, following President Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20.Last Friday, "In partnership with the US Secret Service, the decision was made to remove the barriers around Trump Tower," an NYPD spokesman told AFP.Since leaving the White House, Trump has moved to his resort at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, which he made his official residence at the end of 2019.But his company the Trump Organization, which is headed by his two sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, remains based in the 58-story skyscraper near Central Park.The spokesman would not say what security has been left in place to protect the Tower or when members of the Trump family visit."The NYPD does not discuss security measures" he said.Trump Tower has been the site of many anti-Trump protests over the past four years.Last summer, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, took great joy in joining with activists to paint a giant Black Lives Matter slogan outside the tower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-police-remove-barriers-from-trump-tower-101613106413457.html

12-02-2021||World||Life without Google: Australia is now facing the unthinkable||Imagine a world without Google, the search engine so pervasive it’s the starting point for more than five billion queries a day. That’s the reality facing Australia, where the tech giant is threatening to unplug its homepage in a standoff with the government.Google opposes a planned law that would force the company and Facebook Inc. to pay Australian publishers for news content. The Internet juggernaut’s ultimatum to local lawmakers -- change the legislation, or else -- has left a digital vacuum hanging over a nation that essentially knows just one way to navigate the web. Google runs 95% of Internet searches in Australia.Potential fallout from the spat goes far beyond Australia for Alphabet Inc.-owned Google, whose dominance of global advertising has made it a target for watchdogs worldwide. If the company backs down in Australia, the pay-for-news law risks becoming a template for jurisdictions including Canada and the European Union that are following the quarrel and keen to shorten Google’s lead.But disabling what is arguably the world’s most famous website would hand all of Australia to rivals, including Microsoft Corp.’s Bing and DuckDuckGo, which have failed to dislodge Google as the gateway to the web. These search-engine competitors would suddenly have a playground for development and a foothold to advance on the global stage.Software-engineering student Patrick Smith exemplifies Australia’s Google dependency. The 24-year-old from Canberra said he sometimes racks up 400 Google searches a day to help with his studies, catch up on news and look up recipes. Smith said his browser from the previous day shows 150 searches -- in the space of just five hours.“The prospect of Google search disappearing is frightening at best,” Smith said. “It’s quite reflexive of me to Google something, anything, that I’m even mildly not sure of.”Searching for ‘best beach Sydney’ shows the variance in performance among Google’s competitors. DuckDuckGo’s first result was an ad for a hotel more than 1,000 kilometers away in Queensland. Search Encrypt, which touts its data-protection capability, said: ‘It looks like there aren’t any great matches.’ Bing suggested Bondi Beach Post Office. Only Google returned a real beach, Bondi, first up.World-First LegislationThe world-first legislation will be considered by Australia’s parliament from the week starting Feb. 15 after a key senate committee recommended Friday that the bill be passed.“The government expects all parties to continue to work constructively towards reaching commercial agreements,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement welcoming the senate report.The government says the local media industry -- including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. and Sydney Morning Herald-publisher Nine Entertainment Co. -- has been bled of advertising revenue by the tech giants and should be paid fairly for content.Google argues it drives traffic to their websites, and that being forced to pay to display snippets of news breaks the principle of an open Internet. It also opposes the law’s final-offer arbitration model that determines how much it should pay publishers.Facebook has said it may stop Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law is enacted, an unprecedented step.Australia’s entire economic output is less than Alphabet’s $1.4 trillion market value, so it may be surprising the distant and tiny market is suddenly so important. But the Internet titans are so keen to avoid Australia setting a global precedent that Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg broke into their diaries in recent weeks for phone hookups with Prime Minister Scott Morrison or his ministers.Sniffing an opportunity, Microsoft President Brad Smith and CEO Satya Nadella also reached out.Grabbing the free hit, Smith told Morrison that Microsoft would invest to “ensure Bing is comparable to our competitors.” This week, Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday that the U.S. should adopt its own version of the Australian law.DuckDuckGo, a search engine that says it doesn’t track its users, is also trying to cash in.“There’s a growing global demand for privacy online and Australians don’t have to wait for government action” to stop using Google, DuckDuckGo said by email. Search Encrypt says its results expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.Non-profit alternatives have also been suggested. The Australian Greens party this month asked the government to consider setting up a publicly owned search engine rather than let Microsoft muscle in. “We should not seek out another foreign giant to fill the gap,” said Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.Google-Free ChinaTo be sure, Australia wouldn’t be the first Google-free nation in the world. In China, where the site is blocked, Baidu Inc. is the leading search engine.But Australia would stand out as a westernized democracy without access to the site and Google’s departure could set the nation back years in terms of fast access to information.With two decades of data in the vault, and processing an estimated 5.5 billion searches a day, Google is regarded as peerless in tailoring results for individuals and their idiosyncracies.“Bing is not going to be able to compete with Google in terms of quality out of the blocks,” said Daniel Angus, Brisbane-based associate professor in digital communication at Queensland University of Technology. “Australians might have to relearn how to use search.”Google again performed best under the search, ‘australia leader,’ showing Morrison and his Liberal party at the top of the page -- sourced from an official government site. Bing gave similar details, though took it from Wikipedia. DuckDuckGo offered ads for team leader jobs in Western Australia. Search Encrypt drew a blank once more.Softening StanceThere are signs Google’s hardline stance may be softening. Morrison said his meeting with the company was “constructive” and “should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process.” Google declined to comment on the meeting, though said in a statement it proposes compensating publishers through its News Showcase product, under which the company pays select media outlets to display curated content.Some older Australians who’ve lived in a pre-Google world have fewer concerns. Gino Porro, the 58-year-old owner of the Li’l Darlin bar and restaurant in Sydney’s Darlinghurst, uses Google and hasn’t heard of any other search engines.

It aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in April 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists in the mostly Russian-speaking industrial east called Donbass.Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Ukraine of failing to implement the 2015 Minsk agreement saying: “Over those six years, we still haven’t gotten an answer to two very important questions: How exactly does Ukraine intend to peacefully resolve the conflict, and how does Kiev envisage special status of Donbass within Ukraine?”“The answers to those questions will entirely determine any prospects for a settlement because after the beginning in 2014 of Kiev’s use of force and the ongoing shellings of residential areas by the Ukrainian army, which continue to this day the people, of Donbass have not felt any connection with Ukraine,” he said.Also read| US condemns China for banning BBC World News on mainlandThe United States and European allies France, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Norway, Belgium and the United Kingdom blamed Russia for fueling the conflict, which has killed more than 14,000 people, by providing financial and military support to the separatists.US political coordinator Rodney Hunter, speaking on behalf of the Biden administration, said Russia instigated the conflict in Donbass and “has blocked meaningful progress in diplomatic negotiations while arming, training, funding, and leading its proxy forces and supporting the self-proclaimed `authorities’ on the ground.”“The United States reaffirms its unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said, accusing Russia of escalating “its oppression of any dissent to its brutal occupation of Crimea.”“We will never recognize Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea,” Hunter said. “As a result, US sanctions on Russia in response to its aggression in eastern Ukraine and occupation of Crimea will remain in place unless -- and until -- Russia reverses course.”The Minsk agreements envisage that Ukraine can regain control over its border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections.The accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities, but Ukrainian forces continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire.Also read| Bumble’s 31-year-old CEO becomes a rare female billionaireWhile the July 2020 cease-fire “has largely held up,” UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo said there has been an increase in security incidents in several hotspots in recent months.“This dangerous trend needs to be quickly reversed,” she said.The cease-fire deal was reached by members of the Tripartite Contact Group that includes representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe known as the OSCE. It followed a meeting in Paris in December 2019 of the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany -- the so-called Normandy group -- who expressed support for the Minsk deal and agreed to revive the peace process.DiCarlo told the council that continuing discussions in these groups are “no reason for complacency” and no substitute “for meaningful progress.”“The risk of backsliding is real if negotiations become deadlocked,” she warned.Russia’s Nebenzia said the Minsk agreement didn’t say anything about direct dialogue with the two separatist governments of Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbass, or about agreeing on any special status for the region.“Instead of that, fantasies about establishing some sort of international administration and holding elections only two years after that are in the document,” he said. “Do you really think the people of Donbass will really agree to this international form of occupation?”Also read| India should be very, very proud: WHO’s praise amid falling Covid-19 casesIn response, a statement from the seven European countries strongly condemned “the continued destabilization of certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions” and again called on Russia “to immediately stop fueling the conflict “ by supporting the separatists.Germany’s UN Ambassador Christoph Heusgen went further, telling the Security Council how Russia violated key paragraphs in the Minsk agreements -- including the initial 2015 cease-fire, failing to withdraw heavy weapons and foreign forces, and blocking free access for OSCE monitors to observe areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border not controlled by the Ukrainian government.“Until today, there are Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,” Heusgen said. “They may not have the official stamp of the Russian army, but the Russians continue to be there, and without Russia, Luhansk and Donetsk could not survive.”Halit Cevik, chief monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, saw “a window of opportunity for the sides to find a way towards lasting de-escalation, but we also see that it is narrowing.”Cevik said the July 2020 cease-fire led to “the longest-lasting reduction in violence” since the mission began recording cease-fire violations. But he said, “adherence has frayed over time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-clashes-with-us-and-west-over-conflict-in-ukraine-101613098486364.html

We're also able to move up the delivery dates with an additional 200 million vaccines to the end of July, faster than we expected and in further good news both companies agreed and we're now contractually obligated to expedite delivery of 100 million doses that were promised by the end of June to deliver them by the end of May," he said in an address to the National Institutes of Health.He also informed that the US is on track to have a vaccine supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July."Within three weeks, round the clockwork with so many people standing behind me and in front of me, we've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans, and now we're working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people," Biden said.Biden also faulted former President Donald Trump for not doing enough to plan for the vaccination rollout.Also read| Venezuela nears Covid-19 vaccine deal using cash in frozen accounts"My predecessor -- to be very blunt about it -- did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.

He didn't set up federal vaccine centers where eligible people could go and get their shots.," said the President.The US remains the nation worst hit by the pandemic, with the world's most cases and deaths, making up more than 25 percent of the global caseload and nearly 20 percent of the global deaths.In his concluding remarks, Biden said: "We're in a national emergency and this will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever undertaken as a nation. It's going to take time. We're going to face setbacks along the way and I promise you when we do I'll just own up to it and say what they are."US Covid-19 cases reached 20 million on January 1, and have increased by 6 million within a month.According to the latest update by the Johns Hopkins University, US has recorded a total of 27,382,857 infections and 475,040 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secures-200-million-more-doses-of-moderna-pfizer-covid-19-vaccines-101613097841566.html
12-02-2021||World||UN’s race to zero draws climate pledges from a fifth of FTSE 100||Almost a fifth of FTSE 100 companies have signed up to a United Nations pledge to eliminate their carbon emissions by 2050, as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson strives to inject momentum into domestic efforts to fight climate change.Nineteen members of the UK’s benchmark stock index, with a market capitalization of about 715 billion pounds ($987 billion), have committed to the UN’s Race to Zero campaign, Andrew Griffith, the premier’s climate envoy to business, said in an interview. They include AstraZeneca Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and Rolls Royce Holdings Plc, he said.With the UK set to host this year’s major round of UN climate talks, known as COP26, in Glasgow in November, Johnson aims to put Britain at the forefront of global efforts to tackle global warming. In December, he committed to cutting Britain’s emissions 68% by 2030 compared with 1990, the deepest cuts in the Group of 20 nations. At the same time, he’s pushing corporations to embrace the push to eliminate emissions by 2050.“The prime minister was very keen that we create a real sense of domestic momentum so that COP 26 is not just about world leaders flying in and having their photos taken in front of flags; it’s about real climate action” Griffith, a Conservative Party lawmaker and former chief operating officer at Sky Plc, said in an interview.Also read| Britain's economy to reach pre-Covid-19 levels within two years: Survey“If we don’t succeed in getting business to take serious action about climate, then we’re not going to achieve our overall goals,” he said.Griffith was named the UK’s “Net Zero Business Champion” in November, with a mission to push businesses toward adopting targets for carbon neutrality.Ultimate Goal“My ultimate goal is the whole of the UK business community from the largest to the smallest,” Griffith said.Once smaller companies are included, the UK is already outstripping the likes of Germany and France in terms of involvement in the Race to Zero, he said. His message to companies is to look at their sources of energy, their buildings and their product sourcing.Commitments companies must make when signing up to the UN program include net zero emissions by 2050 as well as interim targets.Also read| CDC says severe reactions to Covid-19 vaccines are rareThey must take “immediate action” and can only use offsets that have “robust standards,” according to the UN.

12-02-2021||World||EU says it is ready to work with Biden administration to settle trade disputes||The European Union on Thursday acknowledged a move by the new US government to refrain from imposing additional tariffs on EU goods in a long-running dispute over aircraft tariffs, and said it was ready to work to resolve trade disputes.The US Trade Representative's office on Thursday said it had agreed with US industry that it was unnecessary to revise existing tariffs on European goods at this time, refraining from changes that would have been possible during a periodic review.The move came a day after USTR said it looked forward to working with European allies to resolve a 16-year-long battle over subsidies provided to Europe's Airbus and its US rival Boeing Co.Asked about Thursday's decision, an EU spokesman said, "The EU is ready to engage with the new US administration on the basis of the EU-US agenda for global change we adopted on December 2. Our aim is to find solutions to our ongoing trade disputes, including on Airbus/Boeing."Also read: US condemns China for banning BBC World News on mainlandThe American Italian Food Coalition, which represents more than 450 Italian companies, manufacturers and trade groups, said the move would give both sides time to work out a solution."The Biden Administration appropriately hit the pause button on another carousel round of tariffs," it said.Officials from the EU and Britain are keen to work out a deal with the administration of President Joe Biden, but talks are on ice until Biden's pick as top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, is confirmed in her job by the U.S. Senate. That could take several more weeks, with a confirmation hearing not yet scheduled.Envoys from Britain and the European Union on Monday stressed their willingness to resolve the aircraft subsidies dispute.EU Ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis said Brussels had proposed a six-month suspension of tariffs on both sides to allow for negotiations. Britain, which is no longer part of the EU but is part of the Airbus consortium, has said it is also willing to lift tariffs, possibly unilaterally, as a goodwill gesture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-it-is-ready-to-work-with-biden-administration-to-settle-trade-disputes-101613094939945.html
12-02-2021||World||Venezuela nears Covid-19 vaccine deal using cash in frozen accounts||Venezuela’s government and opposition are in talks with the Pan-American Health Organization to buy vaccines to inoculate 6 million people against Covid-19, according to three people with direct knowledge of the talks.About 1.4 million of those are from AstraZeneca Plc and will come from the World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative, the people said.The vaccines would be available from March, and would be paid for with offshore funds frozen by U.S. sanctions, which can’t be unblocked without the backing of the opposition. While the source of the remaining vaccines is yet to be determined, the total cost for the 12 million doses, enough to vaccinate 6 million Venezuelans, is approximately $120 million, according to two of the people.The government is looking to create a fund for Covid-19 vaccines, President Nicolas Maduro said late Thursday.“We are seeking a practical and effective agreement to create a $300 million fund with the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization for Venezuela’s vaccines,” Maduro said on state television.Maduro made no mention of talks with the opposition to secure vaccines, nor did he offer details on where the money would come from.Under the terms of the deal between the government and opposition, last discussed in a meeting earlier today, PAHO and Unicef will have strict supervision of the vaccination plan as well as the refrigeration chain needed to keep the vaccines within the required temperature range, two of the people said. Paolo Balladelli, head of the WHO-PAHO mission in Venezuela, said on Twitter that the country is getting is closer to accessing coronavirus vaccines.Health Minister Carlos Alvarado and opposition medical adviser Dr. Julio Castro attended the meeting, among others, the people said. Press officials for Alvarado and Castro didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.While the government is proposing to distribute the vaccines in major public hospitals already tending to Covid-19 patients, the opposition is asking for stricter terms after clauses for a previous deal to distribute more than 340,000 antigen tests were not met.Venezuela has so far reported 131,476 covid cases and 1,253 deaths, fewer than most regional peers.The first 100,000 doses of ten million Sputnik-V vaccines purchased by the government are set to arrive next week, Maduro said this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-nears-covid-19-vaccine-deal-using-cash-in-frozen-accounts-101613096151193.html
12-02-2021||World||5-day 'snap lockdown' likely in Melbourne over Covid-19 cluster: Reports||Australia's second-most populous city could be placed under a five-day snap lockdown, local media reported on Friday, potentially limiting crowds at the Australian Open major tennis tournament.A fresh COVID-19 cluster linked to a quarantine hotel in Melbourne, capital of Victoria state, reached 13 cases as of Thursday midnight as authorities rushed to quash the spread of the virus.The state cabinet will consider plans for the hard lockdown with restrictions to be put in place on leaving home for non-essential services and gathering at homes, the Herald Sun newspaper reported, citing a government source.The lockdown measures are expected to impact only residents of Melbourne, the report said, although those curbs could prevent crowds at the Australian Open tournament.Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered his government's full support with the decisions to be made by Victoria to contain the outbreak."We have dealt with (outbreaks) in the last few weeks in Sydney and Brisbane and Perth and so a proportionate response... enables tracers to be able to get on top of it and get the same successful result we have seen in other states," Morrison told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5day-snap-lockdown-likely-in-melbourne-over-covid-19-cluster-reports-101613095779132.html
12-02-2021||World||US condemns China for banning BBC World News on mainland||The United States on Thursday (local time) condemned China for banning the broadcasting of BBC World News for reporting on issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang and the country's handling of Covid-19."We absolutely condemn the People Republic of China's (PRC) decision to ban BBC World News. The PRC maintains one of the most controlled, most oppressive, least free information spaces in the world. It is troubling that the PRC restricts outlets and platforms from operating freely in China," said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price during a press briefing.He further added: "Beijing's leaders use free and open media environments overseas to promote misinformation. We call on PRC and other nations with authoritarian controls over their population to allow their full access to the internet and media."Price asserted that media freedom is an important right and is key to ensuring that an informed citizenry can share their ideas freely among themselves and their leaders.This comes after the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) of China barred the broadcasting of BBC World News on the mainland claiming that it has done a "slew of falsified" reporting on issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang based on interviews of victims surviving "re-education camps."Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party government's mouthpiece, said that the broadcaster is responsible "for falsified reporting" on China's handling of the coronavirus in the country.The move came after the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said that "BBC has made some false reports" on human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang after the British broadcaster reported systematic rape in so-called re-education camps.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination, although the country has been vehemently denying allegations of massive human rights violations.On January 27, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had stated that his opinions on the genocide committed against the Uyghurs by China have not changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-condemns-china-for-banning-bbc-world-news-on-mainland-101613094863783.html
12-02-2021||World||Police search Navalny headquarters in late-night raid||Russian police conducted a late-night search of the headquarters for jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose arrest last month set off nationwide protests.The search by a dozen police ended about 1 am. It was not immediately clear if the police took away items as potential evidence, but photos posted by Navalny's staff on social media showed them bagging material including a coffee mug.There was no statement from police about the reason for the search; the Mediazona news website that focuses on political repressions and human rights abuses cited a Navalny staff member as saying that police said they had received a report that pornography was being published at the office.Navalny was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin.He later was ordered to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on the grounds that his time in Germany violated a suspended sentence he was handed in a money-laundering and fraud conviction.The arrest sparked protests throughout the county on two weekends in January, in which a total of about 10,000 people reportedly were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-search-navalny-headquarters-in-late-night-raid-101613094246816.html
12-02-2021||World||US Justice Department seeks to delay appeals on WeChat, TikTok restrictions||The US Justice Department on Thursday asked a federal appeals court to pause a government appeal of a lower court ruling blocking restrictions that the Trump administration had imposed on Tencent's messaging app WeChat.The government filed similar requests on Wednesday asking two federal appeals courts to hold off on appeals seeking to overturn rulings that had barred government restrictions on the popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok.The administration of former President Donald Trump had attempted to block new users from downloading the apps and ban other technical transactions that TikTok and WeChat both said would effectively the apps' use in the United States.Three federal judges in separate rulings blocked the US Commerce Department orders issued in August that sought to prevent new TikTok and WeChat downloads and bar other transactions.The Justice Department said on Thursday it "plans to conduct an evaluation of the underlying record justifying those prohibitions" to determine whether they are warranted by the national security threat Trump described.WeChat has an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.A group of WeChat users sued to block the ban in August, which it said would have resulted in an "unprecedented shutdown of a major platform for communications relied on by millions of people in the United States."Late Wednesday, the 3rd US Circuit Court Of Appeals agreed to cancel oral arguments previously set for Thursday in one of the government's TikTok appeals.Reuters on Wednesday, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported that the plan unveiled in September for US investors, including Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc , to buy a majority stake in TikTok's American operations could face months of additional reviews, as the new Biden administration conducts a wide-ranging review of China policy.The Trump administration had contended that WeChat and TikTok pose national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China’s government. TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, has denied the allegation as has WeChat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-seeks-to-delay-appeals-on-wechat-tiktok-restrictions-101613093660824.html
12-02-2021||World||Britain's economy to reach pre-Covid-19 levels within two years: Survey||Britain's economy will narrowly dodge a double-dip recession and will have returned to pre-Covid-19 levels within two years, according to economists in a Reuters poll who said the Bank of England was unlikely to take borrowing costs negative.The country has suffered the highest coronavirus-related death toll in Europe and the government has reimposed strict lockdown measures to try and stop the virus spreading, dealing a hammer blow to its dominant service industry.Gross domestic product was forecast to contract 3.0% this quarter, the Feb. 8-11 poll of around 70 economists found, more than double the 1.4% fall predicted last month. Conversely, the median for Q4 was revised up to 0.4% growth from a 2.0% contraction previously.But Britain is among the leading countries in rolling out vaccines to its population and GDP was expected to grow 4.7% in the second quarter as some restrictions are likely to be lifted. In Q3 and Q4 it will expand 2.7% and 1.5% respectively."The UK's success in vaccinating high-risk groups and the sharp fall in COVID-19 cases suggests the government will on Feb. 22 be able to set out plans for schools to reopen... followed by non-essential retailers in the second half of March and the consumer services sector in the second half of April," said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.For 2021 as a whole the growth forecast was revised down to 4.7% from 4.9% while the 2022 median was revised up to 5.5% from 5.3%.When asked how long it would take for the economy to reach pre-Covid-19 levels 18 said within two years from now. One said within a year and nine said would take over two years. Last month 14 of 23 said it would take over two years.Britain also faces the added headache of Brexit and just under half of British companies that export goods have run into difficulties caused by the shift in trade terms with the European Union since the start of the year, a survey showed on Thursday.Trade analysts think some of the extra cost and bureaucracy will be permanent, and the Bank of England has forecast they will lower trade by 10% in the long run compared with a frictionless arrangement.HOLDING ABOVE WATERLast year the BoE slashed Bank Rate to 0.1% and restarted its bond buying programme to offer support to the economy. Medians in the poll suggest there will be no unwinding of that ultra-loose monetary policy until 2024 at the earliest.There had been talk the Bank would take borrowing costs negative - and markets had been pricing it in - but 30 of 34 economists who responded to an extra question said it was unlikely or very unlikely. Only four said it was likely."An economic recovery from spring onwards and a continued rise in inflation towards the BoE's 2% target over the course of 2021 will likely put to bed any remaining expectation that the Bank Rate could fall further," said Kallum Pickering at Berenberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-economy-to-reach-pre-covid-19-levels-within-two-years-survey-101613093295105.html
12-02-2021||World||Democrats close their case using Donald Trump’s words against him||House prosecutors concluded their case for convicting Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial, saying they’ve proven that the former president is guilty of inciting an insurrection when a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6 to stop the peaceful transfer of power.“Senators, America, we need to exercise our common sense about what happened,” Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, said in the Democrats final arguments. “Let’s not get caught up in a lot of outlandish lawyers’ theories here. Exercise your common sense about what just took place in our country.”House managers spent three days highlighting Trump’s own tweets, speeches and comments to argue that his months-long campaign to stoke anger about the Nov. 3 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The attempt to overturn the results with “the big lie” the election was stolen culminated in the riot he did nothing to prevent or stop, they argued.Trump’s lawyers are set to present an abbreviated defense on Friday, which will include video presentations after House managers played gripping footage of the assault on the Capitol and violent attacks on police officers.David Schoen, one of Trump’s lawyers, said he expects the defense to take four hours or less, even though each side was allowed 16 hours for arguments.“We’re just putting on the evidence, the evidence speaks for itself,” he said after leaving a meeting with a several Republican senators. He said there was nothing inappropriate about meeting with senators who also are serving as jurors in the trial.“That’s the practice here,” he said. “There’s nothing about this thing that has any semblance to due process whatsoever.”Schoen dismissed the House impeachment managers’ presentation, particularly the extensive use of video from the Jan. 6 riot, accusing them of using it for “entertainment value.”While some Republicans said the Democrats’ presentation was very effective, there was little sign that enough of them would be moved to convict Trump. Forty-four of 50 Republicans have already voted twice to indicate they view the trial of a president already out of office as unconstitutional. At least 17 GOP votes would be needed to reach the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction.Biden, who has avoided comment on the impeachment proceedings, said in brief remarks to reporters Thursday that “some minds may have been changed” by the vivid case presented by House impeachment managers.But Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, said that he saw little evidence that more Republicans would join with Democrats to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection.“Many of them are loyal to Donald Trump even to this day, despite what he may have said about them or their families in the past,” Durbin said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “And more of them are afraid of Donald Trump’s political power.”GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, suggested the prosecution was futile, with most of his Republican colleagues already decided against conviction. He said he had assured the former president “the case is over” and “it’s just a matter of getting the final verdict.”Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said the impeachment managers “did not connect the dots” for him Thursday in tying Trump’s words to the insurrection.Democrats used their final day of arguments in Trump’s Senate trial to cement the link between Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric and the insurrection at the Capitol by highlighting the words of the insurrectionists, which House managers said show they were following the orders of Trump.The House impeachment managers also said Trump inspired or condoned the domestic extremist plot to kidnap Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the protests at state capitals around the country and the threats that required more than 25,000 National Guard troops to lock down Washington for Biden’s inauguration.They said he must be convicted to prevent a future president from following the same destructive path.“We’re not here to punish Donald Trump,” said Representative Diana DeGette, one of the nine House managers. “We are here to prevent the seeds of hatred that he planted from bearing any more fruit.”Representative Ted Lieu, another manager, said Trump has showed no remorse or regret after the Capitol attack.“He was showing defiance,” Lieu said. “He was telling us that he would do this again, that he could do this again.”The trial is moving to a conclusion as soon as this weekend. The House managers will wrap up their case Thursday. Trump’s defense takes over on Friday and may only need one day for their arguments, which also will include video presentations.Raskin argued the attack on the Capitol was part of a long-standing “pattern and practice of inciting violence” by Trump. He ticked off examples of Trump encouraging or voicing approval of assaults going back to his 2016 presidential campaign, when he several times encouraged crowds to attack protesters disrupting the events.DeGette focused on the words of those who participated in the insurrection.In videos and other social media posts, the insurrectionists “make clear the attack was done for Donald Trump, at his instructions and to fulfill his wishes,” she said.“They tagged Mr. Trump in tweets,” she said. “Folks, this was not a hidden crime.”She then showed videos of the mob responding to Trump’s call to fight and show “strength” with chants to “fight for Trump” and to invade the Capitol.The prosecution used previously unreleased videos and audio to vividly show senators how close the rioters came to reaching them, as well as Vice President Mike Pence. Senators in the chamber listened in rapt silence as the recordings played.The impeachment managers depicted the assault as not only foreseeable but the intended result of a multitude of actions calculated to incite Trump’s followers. The strategy appeared designed to rebut defense efforts to cast his fiery speech before the assault as normal political hyperbole and to persuade the public that his actions were premeditated and cynical.Trump’s team intends to rely heavily on his use of the words “peacefully and patriotically” at one point in the Jan. 6 speech as part of his defense against the impeachment charge of incitement, according to people familiar with the effort. They also plan to show videos of prominent Democrats using similar rhetoric about fighting to argue Trump is being subjected to a double standard.Representative Madeleine Dean, another impeachment manager, anticipating the argument, said on Wednesday that Trump only used the word “peacefully” once in the 11,000-word speech, while urging on followers with the words “fight” or “fighting” 20 times.House managers also addressed the defense from Trump’s lawyers that the impeachment violates his First Amendment protection and that the quick impeachment by the House violates his due process rights. Democrats said the arguments are without merit and an attempt to distract from the facts.Trump’s free speech rights can’t protect him from impeachment for incitement to insurrection and “is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law and would flip the constitution upside down,” Representative Joe Neguse said.The House had to act quickly without calling witnesses or holding a hear because of the threat of additional violence, and the Senate trial is giving Trump “any and all process that he is due, right here in this chamber,” Lieu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-close-their-case-using-donald-trump-s-words-against-him-101613091782590.html
12-02-2021||World||Microsoft backs search engines paying for news worldwide||Microsoft on Thursday lobbied for other countries to follow Australia's lead in calling for news outlets to be paid for stories published online, a move opposed by Facebook and Google.Microsoft last week offered to fill the void if rival Google follows through on a threat to turn off its search engine in Australia over the plan.Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement the company fully supports proposed legislation in Australia that would force Google and Facebook to compensate media for their journalism."This has made for an unusual split within the tech sector, and we've heard from people asking whether Microsoft would support a similar proposal in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and other countries," Smith said in a blog post."The short answer is yes."Facebook and Google have both threatened to block key services in Australia if the rules, now before parliament, become law as written.The situation raises the question of whether US President Joe Biden will back away from his predecessor's objection to the proposal in Australia."As the United States takes stock of the events on January 6, it's time to widen the aperture," Smith said, referring to a deadly attack on the US Capitol building by a mob of Trump supporters out to overturn the election results."The ultimate question is what values we want the tech sector and independent journalism to serve."Smith argued that internet platforms that have not previously compensated news agencies should now step up to revive independent journalism that "goes to the heart of our democratic freedoms.""The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press," Smith said."It should copy it instead."- Bing goes big? -The proposed law in Australia would govern relations between financially distressed traditional media outlets and the giants which dominate the internet and capture a significant share of advertising revenues.Microsoft's search engine Bing accounts for less than 5 percent of the market in Australia, and from 15 to 20 percent of the market in the United States, according to the tech giant based in Washington State."With a realistic prospect of gaining usage share, we are confident we can build the service Australians want and need," Smith said."And unlike Google, if we can grow, we are prepared to sign up for the new law's obligations, including sharing revenue as proposed with news organizations."Under the proposed News Media Bargaining Code, Google and Facebook would be required to negotiate payments to individual news organizations for using their content on the platforms.Australia's biggest media companies, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and Nine Entertainment, have said they think the payments should amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per year.If agreement cannot be reached on the size of the payments, the issue would go to so-called "final offer" arbitration where each side proposes a compensation amount and the arbiter chooses one or the other.Google and Facebook, backed up by the US government and leading internet architects, have said the scheme would seriously undermine their business models and the very functioning of the internet.Both Facebook and Google have insisted they are willing to pay publishers for news via licensing agreements and commercial negotiations, and both have signed deals worth millions of dollars with news organizations around the world.Google has said the bargaining code should focus on facilitating these kinds of negotiations, but it rejected the idea of mandatory "final offer" arbitration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-backs-search-engines-paying-for-news-worldwide-101613091525094.html
12-02-2021||World||Biden rescinds Trump's emergency order on US-Mexico border wall||US President Joe Biden on Thursday (local time) rescinded the emergency order used by former President Donald Trump to justify the construction of the US-Mexico border wall, announced the White House."I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border was unwarranted," Biden wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reported The Hill."I have also announced that it shall be the policy of my administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall, and that I am directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to that end," he added.Trump had first floated the idea of a border wall on the campaign trail in 2016, repeatedly insisting that Mexico would pay for its construction. However, illegal immigration increased in Trump's four years.However, in early 2020, Customs and Border Protection reported it had found USD 11 billion in funding for the wall, The Hill reported.The proclamation is a final step from Biden after issuing an executive order on day one ordering a pause on all border wall construction.The national emergency at the border in early 2019 after repeatedly butting heads with lawmakers over funding for the project. The move landed his administration in court, as environmental groups and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged USD 2.5 billion in Department of Defense spending that had been diverted to complete construction, according to The Hill.The letter was welcomed by members of Congress long opposed to the wall who argued a physical barrier would do little to address immigration or security concerns."Trump's national emergency was never about security... It was about stealing money to fund a monument to his racist policies along the Southern Border. Now we must cancel the contracts & ensure that not another foot of border wall is constructed," Representative Raul Grijalva tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-rescinds-trump-s-emergency-order-on-us-mexico-border-wall-101613090929328.html
12-02-2021||World||Convict Donald Trump or face dire democracy damage, prosecutors say||Dire harm from Donald Trump’s false and violent incitements will vex American democracy long into the future unless the Senate convicts him of impeachment and bars him from future office, House prosecutors insisted Thursday as they concluded two days of emotional arguments in his historic trial.Making their case, they presented piles of new videos of last month's deadly Capitol attack, with invaders proudly declaring they were merely obeying “the president’s orders” to fight to overturn the election results as Congress was certifying his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump is accused of inciting the invasion, which prosecutors said was a predictable culmination of the many public and explicit instructions he gave supporters long before his White House rally that unleashed the Jan. 6 attack.“If we pretend this didn’t happen, or worse, if we let it go unanswered, who’s to say it won’t happen again?” argued prosecutor Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Even out of office, Democrats warned, Trump could whip up a mob of followers for similar damage.Trump’s defense will take the Senate floor on Friday, arguing that as terrible as the attack was, it clearly was not the president's doing. The proceedings could finish with a vote this weekend by the senators who are sitting as impeachment jurors.The Democrats, with little hope of conviction by two-thirds of the evenly divided Senate, are also making their most graphic case to the American public, while Trump’s lawyers and the Republicans are focused on legal rather than emotional or historic questions, hoping to get it all behind as quickly as possible. Five people died in the Capitol chaos and its aftermath, a domestic attack unparalleled in U.S. history.Trump's second impeachment trial, on a charge of incitement of insurrection, has echoes of last year’s impeachment and acquittal over the Ukraine matter, as prosecutors warn senators that Trump has shown no bounds and will pose a continuing danger to the civic order unless he convicted. Even out of the White House, the former president holds influence over large swaths of voters.The Democratic House members acting as prosecutors drew a direct line Thursday from Trump's repeated comments condoning and even celebrating violence — praising “both sides” after the 2017 outbreak at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — and urging his rally crowd last month to go to the Capitol and fight for his presidency. He spread false claims about election fraud, without evidence, and urged his supporters to “stop the steal” of the presidency.Prosecutors used the rioters' own videos from that day to pin responsibility on Trump. “We were invited here,” said one. “Trump sent us,” said another. “He’ll be happy. We’re fighting for Trump.”“They truly believed that the whole intrusion was at the president’s orders,” said Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado. “The president told them to be there.”At the White House, President Biden said he believed “some minds may be changed” after senators saw chilling security video Wednesday of the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, including of rioters searching menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence.Biden said he didn’t watch any of the previous day’s proceedings live but later saw news coverage.Though most of the Senate jurors seem to have made up their minds, making Trump’s acquittal likely, the never-before-seen audio and video released Wednesday became a key exhibit.Senators sat riveted as the jarring video played in the chamber on Wednesday. The footage showed the mob smashing into the building, rioters engaging in hand-to-hand combat with police, with audio of officers pleading for back-up. Rioters were seen roaming the halls chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” and eerily singing out “Where are you, Nancy?” in search of Pelosi.Videos of the siege have been circulating since the day of the riot, but the graphic compilation offered a moment-by-moment retelling of one of the nation’s most alarming days. And it underscored how dangerously close the rioters came to the nation’s leaders, shifting the focus of the trial from an academic debate about the Constitution to a raw retelling of the assault.Trump attorney David Schoen took issue, saying the presentation was “offensive” and that the Democrats “haven’t tied it in any way to Trump.”He told reporters Thursday at the Capitol he believed Democrats were making the public relive the tragedy in a way that “tears at the American people” and impedes efforts at unity in the country.And by Thursday, senators sitting through a second full day of arguments appeared somewhat fatigued, slouching in their chairs, crossing their arms and walking around to stretch.One Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said during a break: “To me, they’re losing credibility the longer they talk.”The goal of the two-day presentation by prosecutors from the House, which impeached the outgoing president last month a week after the siege, was to cast Trump not as an innocent bystander but rather as the “inciter in chief” who spent months spreading falsehoods and revving up supporters to challenge the election.“This attack never would have happened but for Donald Trump,” Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of the impeachment managers, said as she choked back emotion. “And so they came, draped in Trump’s flag, and used our flag, the American flag, to batter and to bludgeon.”Trump's lawyers are likely to blame the rioters themselves for the violence.The first president to face an impeachment trial after leaving office, Trump is also the first to be twice impeached.His lawyers say he cannot be convicted because he is already gone from the White House. Even though the Senate rejected that argument in Tuesday's vote to proceed to trial, the issue could resonate with Senate Republicans eager to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.While six Republicans joined with Democrats to vote to proceed with the trial on Tuesday, the 56-44 vote was far from the two-thirds threshold of 67 votes needed for conviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/convict-donald-trump-or-face-dire-democracy-damage-prosecutors-say-101613090603132.html
12-02-2021||World||Biden clear about restoring compassion, order to immigration system: White House||US President Joe Biden has been very clear about "restoring compassion and order" to the country's immigration system, the White House said on Thursday and noted that a series of executive actions signed by him in the last few weeks are just the beginning."The executive actions signed thus far are just the beginning,” a White House spokesperson told PTI."President Biden has been very clear about restoring compassion and order to our immigration system, and correcting the divisive, inhumane, and immoral policies of the past four years, which is our focus in the coming weeks and months," the spokesperson said.The spokesperson was responding to a question on an influential immigration advocacy group representing Indian-Americans urging the Biden administration not to issue the most sought-after H-1B work visa to any individual born in India, till the time the discriminatory country-cap on green cards or permanent legal residency is removed.In a statement, Aman Kapoor, president of Immigration Voice called on the Biden administration to use its authority under INA Section 212(f) to exclude any new individual born in India who are not currently in the United States legally from obtaining a new H-1B visa for the first time in Fiscal Year 2022.The White House, however, did not say if the administration intends to issue such an order. At the same time, it has committed itself to a comprehensive immigration reform which is humane and compassionate. In his immigration reform bill sent to the Congress, the White House has proposed elimination of country-quota in allocation of green cards, a major demand of organisations like Immigration Voice and Indian IT professionals.The non-partisan Congressional Research Service says that this "discriminatory and arbitrary" cap on the number of Indian nationals who can receive lawful permanent residency each year has created a backlog of over one million people waiting for green cards, with a wait time of over 195 years, Kapoor said, adding that in fiscal year 2030, the line is expected to grow to 436 years."A majority of the Green Card backlog consists of women and children, who will eventually die in these backlogs. Needless to say, the per-country limits on the employment-based green card system are, in fact, 100 per cent an 'Indian Exclusion Act'. In reality, this implies a de facto ban on employment-based green cards for any new Indian national entering the United States on an H-1B visa,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-clear-about-restoring-compassion-order-to-immigration-system-white-house-101613089424577.html

Doctors said a bullet penetrated her head and a decision on an operation will be made soon.On February 1, Myanmar's military staged a coup and overthrew the democratically elected government of National League for Democracy (NLD), alleging voter fraud in the November 2020 elections that saw the NLD securing a resounding victory.The military detained several political officials and activists including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and declared a one-year emergency.Around 100 protesters were arrested on Tuesday after police cracked down on protesters who had staged demonstrations against the forceful military takeover in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-committee-to-take-action-against-police-officer-who-fired-live-ammunition-during-anti-coup-protests-101613090146187.html
12-02-2021||World||Biden wants to quadruple refugee admissions set by Trump||The Biden administration wants to raise refugee admissions to 62,500 for the current budget year, overriding former President Donald Trump’s record-low limit of 15,000, a U.S. official and others said Thursday.The official and others with knowledge of the plans spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Trump set the ceiling in October when the 2021 budget year started, and it runs until September 30. President Joe Biden's proposal of 62,500 would replace that, and the president has already announced plans to raise admissions to twice that amount in 2022.President Joe Biden is said to have wanted to raise the cap immediately but not set the target as high as 125,000 people because that would be unrealistic to reach with the coronavirus pandemic and the work needed to rebuild the refugee program that had been largely dismantled by the Trump administration.Biden by law must submit his proposal to Congress and consult with lawmakers before making a presidential determination. The U.S. State Department confirmed that it sent the president's report to Congress, starting that process.“We are working with Congress to arrange these consultations and are eager to engage the appropriate members," the department said in a statement.Earlier this month, Biden announced plans to up admissions in 2022 to 125,000, which would surpass the ceiling of 110,00 set by President Barack Obama before he left office and be more than eight times the amount set by Trump before he left office.Biden, through executive order, also called for rescinding Trump-era rules that resulted in excessive vetting of applicants, expanding capacity for adjudicating applications for refugee applications, and other steps.It will take time to rebuild the pipeline. More than one-third of U.S. resettlement offices were forced to close over the past four years with the drop in refugee arrivals and hundreds of workers were let go.Refugee admissions are determined by the president each year, and federal funding for resettlement agencies is based on the number of people they resettle in a given year.Still, advocates have applauded Biden's plans, saying it sends a signal to the world that he intends to restore the United States' humanitarian leadership.Trump targeted the refugee program under his anti-immigration policies, dropping admissions yearly until they reached a record low of 15,000. Historically, the average has been 95,000 under both Republican and Democratic administrations.The Trump administration defended the cuts as protecting American jobs during the pandemic and said it sought to have refugees settle closer to their home countries while working on solving the crises that caused them to flee.Biden, who co-sponsored legislation creating the refugee program in 1980, has said reopening the doors to refugees is “how we will restore the soul of our nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-wants-to-quadruple-refugee-admissions-set-by-trump-101613086926872.html
12-02-2021||World||Biden hails deal for 200 million Covid vaccine doses, faster shipments||President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. has finished deals for 100 million additional vaccine doses each from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., and that the companies would deliver new and existing orders quicker than projected.The delivery dates for the orders, which the administration had already said it would place, were moved up to the end of July, Biden said in remarks Thursday at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland -- although Moderna said only that July was a “goal.” Delivery of a previously ordered batch was also sped up, to the end of May from the end of June, Biden said.“We’ve now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans,” Biden said in a speech, while warning of the ongoing threat of the virus. “We remain in the teeth of this pandemic.”The delivery timeline, if met, would give the U.S. enough doses for 300 million people by the end of July -- a number that could increase if other vaccine candidates, such as one from Johnson & Johnson, are approved. Administration of the vaccines, however, could stretch into late summer and early fall.Biden delivered his speech at the NIH while wearing a mask, thanking medical workers and researchers for sacrifices they and their families have made during the course of the crisis. He also leveled harsh criticism of former President Donald Trump’s handling of the vaccine program.“My predecessor, to be very blunt about it, did not do his job,” he said, accusing Trump of not purchasing enough doses of vaccine, doing nothing to set up shipments to pharmacies, not mobilizing enough health-care workers to inject it and not establishing enough sites around the country to provide inoculations.The White House said on Jan. 26 that it planned to order 200 million more total doses of the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer. The new orders bring the government’s total order from those companies to 600 million doses. Both vaccines require a two-dose regimen, making that enough for 300 million people.The orders were placed by exercising options in contracts negotiated with each company by the previous administration. Specific terms of the new orders weren’t disclosed, and the administration didn’t say what, if anything, it offered the companies in exchange for faster deliveries.In a written statement, Moderna confirmed the order and said it had already supplied 41 million doses to the U.S., and is on track to reach 100 million doses shipped by the end of March.“Moderna is working with its domestic manufacturing partners and the U.S. FDA to continue to explore ways to accelerate delivery, with the goal of providing this new order of 100 million doses before the end of July 2021,” the company said in the statement.Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.‘Don’t Rewrite History’Former Trump administration officials reject Biden’s criticism, pointing out that the vaccination program Biden inherited has him easily on pace to meet his goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The U.S. is averaging about 1.5 million doses administered daily, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Trump “put you on a track to reach the goal of 100 Million doses in 100 days,” Alyssa Farah, a former communications director for Trump, tweeted after Biden’s remarks. “Celebrate it, don’t rewrite history.”The Biden administration has been touting the latest order from Pfizer and Moderna since its initial announcement, saying it would give the U.S. enough vaccine by the end of summer to inoculate every adult, before Thursday’s announcement of a faster delivery schedule.Johnson & Johnson is seeking an emergency clearance for its one-shot vaccine, and the Food and Drug Administration could grant it as soon as this month. Biden has said he would rather end up with surplus vaccine than not enough. The one-shot vaccine doesn’t require as stringent storage conditions as Moderna and Pfizer, and could be used to access remote communities more easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-deal-for-200-million-covid-vaccine-doses-faster-shipments-101613086663690.html
12-02-2021||World||6 killed in 130-vehicle pileup on icy Texas interstate||A massive crash involving more than 130 vehicles on an icy Texas interstate left at least six people dead and dozens injured Thursday amid a winter storm that dropped freezing rain, sleet and snow on parts of the U.S.At the scene of the crash on Interstate 35 near downtown Fort Worth, a tangle of semitrailers, cars and trucks had smashed into each other and had turned every which way, with some vehicles on top of others.“There were multiple people that were trapped within the confines of their vehicles and requiring the use of hydraulic rescue equipment to successfully extricate them,” said Fort Worth Fire Chief Jim Davis.At least 65 people sought care at hospitals, with 36 of them taken by ambulance from the crash site, including several with critical injuries, said Matt Zavadsky, spokesman for MedStar, which provides the ambulance service for the area.The crash happened about 6 a.m., as many hospital and emergency workers were heading to and from work, so some of those involved were health care workers and emergency responders, including police officers, officials said.Zavadsky said his crews carry a sand and salt mixture in the ambulances, which they began using at the scene. At one point, he said, one of the ambulances was hit, but it sustained only minor damage and the crew members were fine.“The roadway was so treacherous from the ice that several of the first responders were falling on the scene,” Zavadsky said.The ice storm came as a polar vortex — swirling air that normally sits over the Earth's poles — has moved near the U.S.-Canada border, resulting in colder weather farther south than usual, said Steve Goss, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.“As a result we’re getting unusually or unseasonably cold air that’s spilling south across a good portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains,” he said.In Tennessee, police responded to about 30 traffic collisions and some flights were delayed at Memphis International Airport after freezing rain and sleet fell. In Kentucky, the governor declared a state of emergency to free up funding and help agencies coordinate as they responded to reports of slick roads and downed power lines. And in southern Indiana, schools and government offices closed.In suburban Austin, more than two dozen vehicles were involved in a pileup on an icy highway, and five people were taken to a hospital, emergency officials said.Goss said that smaller disturbances moving through the polar jet stream will bring “a shot of winter weather” into southern portions of the country.He said some areas that don't normally get snowfall will likely see heavy amounts over the next several days. He said current estimates show some areas of the southern Plains could get a foot or more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-killed-in-130-vehicle-pileup-on-icy-texas-interstate-101613086483887.html
12-02-2021||World||Biden says Trump 'did not do his job' on Covid vaccine program, urges patience||US President Joe Biden on Thursday said the coronavirus vaccination program he inherited from Donald Trump was in "much worse shape" than he had expected, while urging patience and said the government has bought 200 million more doses."We're not going to have everything fixed for a while, but we're going to fix it," Biden said in remarks at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.With demand for the vaccine far outstripping supply, Americans are struggling to get appointments for their inoculations, leaving Biden with an acute problem less than a month after taking over from Trump.Biden said Trump, who spent his last two months in office in a futile effort to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election that he lost, did not order enough vaccine and did not do enough to get people lined up to get vaccinated.He said the vaccine program he inherited was in "much worse shape" than he had anticipated and that his team had been misled about the vaccine supply."While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor - I’ll be very blunt about it - did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions," Biden said.A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request for reaction to Biden's comments. Trump had expressed pride in the speed of the vaccine development on his watch.Biden said the US government has signed contracts for 100 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 100 million more from Pfizer."We appreciate the confidence that the US government has demonstrated in our Covid-19 Vaccine," Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a press release.Biden said the US coronavirus death toll is likely to reach 500,000 next month. He urged Americans to wear masks to prevent the spread."We've now purchased enough vaccine to vaccinate all Americans," Biden said. He said the United States, which has a population of about 330 million, was on track to have 300 million doses by the end of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-trump-did-not-do-his-job-on-covid-vaccine-program-urges-patience-101613085090567.html

More than 45,000 people died from Covid-19 in California as of Tuesday. New York, severely hit in the early stages of the pandemic last spring, reported 44,693 lives lost, according to a Reuters tally.The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Thursday that a decline in overall virus cases conceals the increasing numbers of outbreaks and community spread involving new variants, with a strain first identified in South Africa late last year now seen in 19 countries.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said coronavirus mutations will likely become dominant across the country, threatening to derail progress as a national lockdown was extended until March 7.The Irish government said about 22% of close contacts are now catching the virus, double the rate in previous waves, suggesting that the new variants are more infectious.Former US president Donald Trump’s disdain for science, coupled with cuts to the health programme, impeded US response to the pandemic, a report in the UK’s medical journal The Lancet said. Scientists found that 40% of US deaths in 2020 from Covid-19 would have been avoided if the country’s death rate had been closer to that of its G7 peers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-now-has-more-covid-19-deaths-than-new-york-101613082389363.html
12-02-2021||World||Democrats wrap impeachment case, urging Trump be convicted||Democrats rested their impeachment case against Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he incited insurrection after losing re-election and is so dangerous he should be barred from holding office again.After two days of presentations, including hours of graphic video from the pro-Trump riot that swept the Capitol January 6, Democratic impeachment managers called on senators to vote for conviction."We humbly, humbly ask you to convict president Trump for the crime (of) which he is overwhelmingly guilty," Representative Joe Neguse said."If you don't, if we pretend this didn't happen, or worse, if we let it go unanswered, who is to say it won't happen again?"Trump's defense lawyers will deliver their case on Friday, arguing that Trump cannot be held personally responsible for the deadly assault on Congress.They also argue that the trial itself is unconstitutional because Trump is now out of office, although the Senate rejected this argument earlier this week.In a prebuttal of those arguments, Democratic impeachment leader Jamie Raskin told senators to apply "common sense," pointing out that Trump stood by, doing nothing, for two hours as his supporters rampaged through Congress."Why did president Trump not tell his supporters to stop the attack on the Capitol as soon as he learned about it?" Raskin asked. "As our constitutional commander in chief, why did he do nothing to send help?"Earlier, President Joe Biden said the video evidence against his 74-year-old predecessor presented at the Senate trial may change "some minds."But despite what even some Republicans have said was a strong prosecution, Trump retains an unshakeable grip on the party, making conviction highly unlikely. It would take a two-thirds majority, meaning 17 Republicans would need to join the Senate's 50 Democrats.'Future of democracy'The mayhem on January 6 erupted after Trump held a large rally near the White House, insisting falsely, as he had done since losing to Biden in November, that he was cheated.Instructed by Trump to march on Congress, where lawmakers were at that moment certifying Biden's election, the crowd smashed through police lines, then went on the rampage.The chaos left five people dead, including one woman shot after she invaded the Capitol and one policeman killed by the crowd.Video footage played by impeachment managers showed the mob hunting down opponents of Trump and senior figures, including then vice president Mike Pence, having to flee to safety.The defense will stress that Trump did not expressly tell his fans to commit violence, but Raskin pointed out that the Republican had been stoking anger and encouraging extremism ever since Election Day -- and even before."This pro-Trump insurrection did not spring out of thin air," Raskin said. "This was not the first time Donald Trump had inflamed and incited a mob."Raskin said it was imperative the Senate convict Trump and bar him from running for the White House again in 2024."Is there any political leader in this room who believes that if he's ever allowed by the Senate to get back into the Oval Office Donald Trump would stop inciting violence to get his way?" Raskin asked."Would you bet the future of your democracy on that?Raskin also dismissed claims by Trump's lawyers that the president did not incite the riot but was just exercising his free speech rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution.Calling this a "smokescreen," Raskin said "nobody can incite a riot."First Amendment doesn't protect it," he said. "Nobody in America would be protected by the First Amendment if they did all the things that Donald Trump did."Republicans stand by TrumpBiden said he did not watch any of the trial live but had seen news coverage of Wednesday's heart-rending video footage."My guess is some minds may be changed," Biden told reporters in the White House.Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden, who has been trying to stop the trial from overshadowing his push for a huge economic stimulus package and the fight against Covid-19, was not intending to predict the outcome.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said video footage shown by House managers on Wednesday was "powerful," but "how that influences final decisions remains to be seen."Other Republican senators have clearly already made up their minds and do not intend to break with Trump, who has threatened to derail their careers."The 'Not Guilty' vote is growing after today," tweeted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "I think most Republicans found the presentation by the House Managers offensive and absurd."Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri echoed the argument of Trump's defense lawyers that it is unconstitutional to try a former president."You're not going to get anything but condemnation from me for what happened with those criminals at the Capitol on January 6," Hawley told Fox News. "But that doesn't make the trial any more legitimate than it is, which is totally illegitimate -- no basis in the Constitution."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-house-democrats-finish-making-their-case-101613079108992.html
12-02-2021||World||President Joe Biden thinks impeachment video may have swayed 'some minds'||President Joe Biden said Thursday he had watched coverage of Donald Trump's impeachment trial and thought “some minds may have been changed” after prosecutors showed gripping and graphic video of the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol.Biden told reporters in the Oval Office that while he did not view any of the Senate trial live, he had seen the morning news. “I think the Senate has a very important job to complete,” the president said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said later that “the footage was just a reminder of how shocked and saddened” Biden was on the day rioters stormed the Capitol.It was a notable shift in tone after the new president spent much of the week doing his best to avoid the issue. And it came after House prosecutors aired never-before-seen footage from the violent insurrection that showed police officers being beaten by the rioters and presented a fuller picture of the precarious situation at the Capitol on the day when Congress was meeting to affirm Biden's victory.Biden had insisted previously that he would not watch the proceedings, and for much of this week, Psaki dodged questions about the trial. She had declined to offer Biden’s opinion on whether the trial was constitutional or about the outcome because, as she said, the president is “not a pundit."While expanding on Biden’s views about the trial, she refused on Thursday to weigh in on Trump’s culpability.She said Biden, in his new comments, “was not intending to give a projection or a prediction, but was just giving a very human and emotional response” to what many were feeling on that day. Pressed on whether Biden believes the Senate should convict Trump, an outcome that's seen as unlikely, Psaki avoided answering directly. She said the president “knows there’s a role for Congress to play and a role for him to play."It reflects the message Biden's team has tried to drive home: The focus is on governing and not the historic events unfolding at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.Biden’s calendar this week was meant as counterprogramming to the trial, with events on pandemic aid and vaccine distribution.Privately, White House aides said Biden would gain little politically from weighing in on the trial and that any comment he makes would draw the focus away from his predecessor’s misconduct and onto Biden’s own views.They said that staying above the fray would allow Biden to focus on his COVID-19 relief package and remain on cordial terms with Republicans as he tries to steer the $1.9 trillion bill through Congress.Among some Biden aides, there is a sense he will need to weigh in at the end of the trial, particularly if an expected acquittal prompts Trump to break his silence and further inflame a deeply divided nation.Until now, the White House’s public approach to the proceedings has been: Impeachment? What impeachment?Psaki at times has all but twisted herself in knots at the White House podium to dodge saying much of anything about the trial. "He’s not going to opine on back-and-forth arguments,” she said Tuesday.On Wednesday, she insisted that Biden would “not be a commentator” and would instead focus on the pandemic.The president met with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and business leaders on Tuesday to push for his economic recovery package. On Wednesday, he announced sanctions on Myanmar's military rulers in the wake of a coup and then he visited the Pentagon. On Thursday, he planned a trip to the National Institutes of Health to discuss the nation’s vaccination program.It's all in keeping with Biden’s overall approach to Trump throughout the 2020 campaign: avoid getting bogged down in each new attack or controversy from Trump and focused on his own overarching message about a return to competent leadership in the White House. It also reflects a belief among White House aides that the chattering classes in Washington and on Twitter are often far removed from the realities of everyday Americans.“I think the biggest news story for most Americans is getting the virus under control, and President Biden has shown, both on the campaign trail and in the White House, that his focus is what the American people are waking up thinking about every day,” said Ben LaBolt, a former Obama campaign press secretary.With the Senate occupied by impeachment, White House legislative affairs staffers were working with House committee members on the COVID-19 legislation.But while the administration’s outward focus was on the pandemic, the trial was inescapable within the West Wing.Televisions were tuned to the proceedings. Aides kept one another updated and briefed the president. Preliminary work was underway for Biden to weigh in at the end of the trial in an effort to lower the temperature of a divided nation.Trump's Twitter account has been suspended and he so far has followed aides' advice to keep a low profile for fear of endangering an acquittal.In Trump’s previous impeachment, a year ago, he relentlessly weighed in on the trial on Twitter and mixed in a variety of events. The prior president to be impeached, Bill Clinton, also made a show of focusing on his day job, scheduling a flurry of events opposite the 1999 trial that ended up improving his approval ratings.The clearest historical precedent for the moment in which Biden finds himself may be that of President Gerald Ford seeking to unify the nation after the damaging Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon's resignation. Like Biden, Ford sought to move the country past his predecessor in part by ignoring him and focusing on his own agenda. In a move that was controversial at the time but one that presidential historian Jeff Engel said was ultimately seen as beneficial for the national mood, Ford pardoned Nixon.Engel suggested that Biden continue to focus his message on Americans, rather than wade into fights on Capitol Hill.“Joe Biden, I think, will by his very nature feel responsible for and speak to Americans of all stripes," he said. “That’s not going to cure our problems by any measure, but it will provide a balm, if you will, to allow things to quiet down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-joe-biden-thinks-impeachment-video-may-have-swayed-some-minds-101613078361773.html

That's in the run up to the violence; throughout the violence, and afterward."Graphic video of the attack and evidence of Trump's role in encouraging the violence have been shown at his ongoing Senate impeachment trial.Trump, who is accused of inciting insurrection, is expected to avoid conviction due to Republican support in the Senate.Facebook reported it had taken down 6.4 million pieces of organized hate content, up from 4 million in the previous quarter, and 26.9 million pieces of content violating hate speech rules in general.At Facebook-owned Instagram, 308,000 pieces of organized hate content were removed, up from 224,000 in the previous quarter, while the amount of removed hate speech content in general was up only slightly to 6.6 million items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-touts-fighting-abuse-during-us-capitol-attack-101613078206632.html
12-02-2021||World||US slaps sanctions on Myanmar in response to military coup||The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Myanmar's acting president and several other military officers and warned the generals there could be more economic punishment as Washington responds to the military coup.The US Treasury Department said it targeted eight people, including the defense minister, three companies in the jade and gems sector, and updated sanctions on the top two military officials, accusing them of playing a leading role in overthrowing Myanmar's democratically-elected government.But Washington stopped short of including the entire Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), the military's conglomerates that are prevalent throughout Myanmar's economy.President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved an executive order for new sanctions on those responsible for the coup in Myanmar, also known as Burma, that ousted the civilian-led government and detained elected leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi."The February 1 coup was a direct assault on Burma's transition to democracy and the rule of law," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement."We are also prepared to take additional action should Burma's military not change course. If there is more violence against peaceful protesters, the Burmese military will find that today's sanctions are just the first," Yellen added.Thursday's action designated Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military Min Aung Hlaing and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win under Biden's executive order. Both were previously hit with sanctions in 2019 over allegations of abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.Others listed were six members of the National Defense and Security Council and four military officials announced as members of the State Administration Council by the military, including Defense Minister Mya Tun Oo.The three companies named by Washington - Myanmar Ruby Enterprise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co, LTD, and Cancri (Gems and Jewellery) Co, LTD - were identified by a U.N. mission on Myanmar in 2019 as part of the MEHL conglomerate.The White House said the sanctions do not need to be permanent, urging Myanmar's military to "immediately restore power to the democratically elected government, end the state of emergency, release all those unjustly detained, and ensure peaceful protesters are not met with violence."The Biden administration has been working to form an international response to the crisis, including by working with allies in Asia with closer ties to Myanmar and its military.John Lichtefeld, vice president at Washington-based strategic consultancy The Asia Group, said Thursday’s announcements were an "opening salvo putting the military on notice," adding that sanctions against the MEHL and MEC conglomerates may still occur."I think this is a signal to the military that the United States is serious and has a very wide range of tools at its disposal. The range of actors potentially implicated by this order is exceptionally broad, even though the order itself does not directly sanction any individual or entities," he said.Suu Kyi's party won a 2015 election but the transition to democracy was brought to a halt by the coup that ousted her government as it was preparing to begin its second term after her National League for Democracy (NLD) swept a Nov. 8 election.The military cited election fraud as justification for its takeover. The electoral commission dismissed accusations of fraud.Also on Thursday, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said it is immediately redirecting $42.2 million of assistance away from work that would have benefited Myanmar's government.Protesters have taken to the streets in cities and towns in the largest demonstrations in Myanmar for more than a decade, reviving memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated with bloody army crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slaps-sanctions-on-myanmar-in-response-to-military-coup-101613077751163.html
12-02-2021||World||Snowstorms aim for US east while fierce cold grips Texas||A parade of snowstorms is threatening to roll through the Eastern US over the next few days while bitter cold grips the heart of the country, driving temperatures below freezing all the way to Houston.A system will sweep out of the Ohio Valley Friday, bringing freezing rain and ice across the central Appalachian Mountains and likely passing south of Washington. Another one will work its way up the East Coast late Saturday into Sunday, but it isn’t clear whether it will bring rain, sleet, snow or a frigid mixture. And a third storm will arrive in the Northeast, hitting New York and elsewhere on Monday to Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.Temperatures, meanwhile, are forecast to be 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (17 to 22 Celsius) below normal through the central US as frigid air spills down from the Arctic. In the Northeast, where a gentle snow fell early Thursday, temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees lower through next week. Even in Houston, the mercury will fall to 28 degrees Sunday and 12 in Dallas.“The core of the Arctic air is just sitting over the north central US,” said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. “It will be diving southward down the Plains all the way right into Texas.”The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the state’s main power grid, warned of record power demand due to extreme temperatures. The average spot price for electricity in North Texas climbed 738% to $289.40 a megawatt-hour Thursday at 2 p.m. local time, after much of the region spiked briefly to about $1,900 earlier, according to data compiled by Genscape Inc. If that price holds, it will be the highest since Nov. 22, 2019.​Prices for natural gas, propane and heating oil, fuels used to heat homes, are surging, too. Natural gas for next-day delivery to Houston and Chicago climbed to the highest level in seven years. The frigid temperatures are also boosting the risk of so-called freeze-offs, or well shutdowns that occur because of liquids freezing inside pipelines. Demand for propane has surged to its highest since 2004.​Highs in New York will linger in the low- to mid-30s through the weekend as a series of storms pushes west to east across the US“We are in an unsettled weather pattern,” said Brian Ciemnecki, a Weather Service meteorologist in New York. “The main story is the cold and the unsettled pattern.”Propane stockpiles have tumbled amid the cold, with inventories of the fuel sliding to the lowest since April 2019 last week, government data released Wednesday showed. The drawdown will likely support even higher prices, which may dent exports and prompt petrochemical plants to use a cheaper feedstock like ethane.The cold snap stems from a sudden stratospheric warming event high above the North Pole, which led to a weakening of the polar vortex, the girdle of winds that traps frigid air in the Arctic. Making the situation worse is a block in the atmosphere over Greenland that’s holding the cold in the US It also weakened the Pacific jet stream, which had been keeping winter mild through much of December and January.The only places in the contiguous US that will be able to avoid the chill will be parts of California and Florida. The cold will get to the east and west, probably bringing snow to Seattle this week and potentially the East Coast next week.There are indications the deepest cold will begin to relax by February 20. By March and April the weather could begin to moderate and the US could see a milder spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/snowstorms-aim-for-us-east-while-fierce-cold-grips-texas-101613077279396.html
12-02-2021||World||Capitol rioters acted on Trump's 'orders,' Democrats say in impeachment trial||House Democrats prosecuting Donald Trump's impeachment said Thursday the Capitol invaders believed they were acting on "the president's orders” and reflected his violent rhetoric when they stormed the building aiming to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's election.The prosecutors described in stark, personal terms the horror they faced that day and showed the many public and explicit instructions Trump gave his supporters — both in the weeks before the Jan. 6 attack and at his midday rally that unleashed the mob on the Capitol. Rioters in videos, some posted to social media by themselves, talked about how they were doing it all for Trump.“We were invited here,” said one. "Trump sent us,” said another. “He’ll be happy. We’re fighting for Trump.” Five people died.“They truly believed that the whole intrusion was at the president’s orders,” said Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado. “The president told them to be there.”Also Read | Chilling video clips of Capitol siege aired at Trump impeachment trialProsecutors were wrapping up their two days of opening arguments on Thursday, with Trump's defense taking the floor on Friday. The entire process could wind up with a vote by this weekend. The Democrats, with little hope of conviction by two-thirds of the Senate, are making their most graphic case to the American public, while Trump's lawyers are focused on legal rather than emotional or historic questions, hoping to get it all behind him as quickly as possible.At the White House, President Joe Biden said he believed “some minds may be changed” after senators saw chilling security video Wednesday of the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, including of rioters searching menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence.Biden said he didn’t watch any of the previous day’s proceedings live but later saw news coverage.This second impeachment trial, on the charge of incitement of insurrection, has echoes of last year's impeachment over the Ukraine matter, as prosecutors warn senators that left unchecked Trump poses a danger to the civic order. Even out of office, the former president holds influence over large swaths of voters.The prosecutors on Thursday drew a direct line from his repeated comments condoning and even celebrating violence — praising “both sides” after the 2017 outbreak at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and urging his rally crowd last month to go to the Capitol and fight for his presidency.“There’s a pattern staring us in the face,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the lead prosecutor.“When Donald Trump tells the crowd as he did on January 6 to fight like hell, or you won’t have a country anymore. He meant for them to fight like hell.”Trump lawyers will argue later this week that his words were protected by the Constitution’s First Amendment and just a figure of speech.Though most of the Senate jurors seem to have made up their minds, making Trump’s acquittal likely, the never-before-seen audio and video released Wednesday is now a key exhibit in Trump’s impeachment trial as lawmakers prosecuting the case argue Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.Also Read | Democrats seek to show Trump was indifferent to Capitol assaultSenators sat riveted as the jarring video played in the chamber. Senators shook their heads, folded their arms and furrowed their brows. Screams from the audio and video filled the Senate chamber. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma bent his head at one point, another GOP colleague putting his hand on his arm in comfort.Videos of the siege have been circulating since the day of the riot, but the graphic compilation shown to senators Wednesday amounted to a more complete narrative, a moment-by-moment retelling of one of the nation’s most alarming days. In addition to the evident chaos and danger, it offered fresh details on the attackers, scenes of police heroism and cries of distress. And it underscored how dangerously close the rioters came to the nation’s leaders, shifting the focus of the trial from an academic debate about the Constitution to a raw retelling of the assault.The footage showed the mob smashing into the building, rioters engaging in hand-to-hand combat with police and audio of Capitol police officers pleading for back-up. Rioters were seen roaming the halls chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” and eerily singing out “Where's Nancy?” in search for Pelosi.Pence, who had been presiding over a session to certify Biden’s election victory over Trump — thus earning Trump’s censure — was shown being rushed to safety, where he sheltered in an office with his family just 100 feet from the rioters. Pelosi was seen being evacuated from the complex as her staff hid behind doors in her suite of offices.The goal of the presentation was to cast Trump not as an innocent bystander but rather as the “inciter in chief” who spent months spreading falsehoods about the election.“This attack never would have happened, but for Donald Trump,” Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of the impeachment managers, said as she choked back emotion. “And so they came, draped in Trump’s flag, and used our flag, the American flag, to batter and to bludgeon.”Trump's lawyers are likely to blame the rioters themselves for the violence.The first president to face an impeachment trial after leaving office, Trump is also the first to be twice impeached.His lawyers also say he cannot be convicted because he is already gone from the White House. Even though the Senate rejected that argument in Tuesday's vote to proceed to the trial, the legal issue could resonate with Senate Republicans eager to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.While six Republicans joined with Democrats to vote to proceed with the trial on Tuesday, the 56-44 vote was far from the two-thirds threshold of 67 votes needed for conviction.Minds did not seem to be changing Wednesday, even after senators watched the graphic video.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was among those leading the effort to challenge the Electoral College tally, said, “The president’s rhetoric is at times overheated, but this is not a referendum on whether you agree with everything the president says or tweets.”Trump's second impeachment trial is expected to diverge from the lengthy, complicated affair of a year ago. In that case, Trump was charged with having privately pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, then a Democratic rival for the presidency.The Democratic-led House impeached the president swiftly, one week after the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-trial-capitol-rioters-acted-on-trump-s-orders-democrats-say-in-trial-101613076817867.html
