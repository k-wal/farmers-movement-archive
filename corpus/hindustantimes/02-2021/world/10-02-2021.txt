He added, “Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of Covid vaccines sought by Canada. We also agreed to continue to collaborate on other important issues like Climate Change and the global economic recovery.”Indian officials said the vaccines manufactured in India will be those from AstraZeneca and sourced from the Serum Institute of India. The start of shipments of the vaccines to Canada is believed to be “imminent” and only awaiting emergency-use authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by public health authorities in Canada.There is optimism that the coronavirus vaccine deal will result in an improvement in ties between the two countries, which were adversely affected after Trudeau had made controversial remarks about the ongoing farmers’ protests late last year during a virtual event.The Trudeau government has faced criticism in recent weeks for its handling of the pandemic as its projected inoculation programme has run into difficulty due to shortage of vaccine shipments from Pfizer and Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-justin-trudeau-dials-narendra-modi-for-vaccine-supplies-101612981148618.html

But she said that “it’s not accurate that there is a new proactive step by the Biden White House.”The administration is “comprehensively evaluating” risks to US data from companies including TikTok “and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion,” she said.Psaki’s remarks followed a report in the Wall Street Journal that the sale of TikTok, owned by Bytdedance Ltd, had been shelved indefinitely as the Biden administration takes on a broad review of national security risks posed by Chinese technology companies.Psaki said the review of national security risks related to US data, including from TikTok, is ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-sale-still-in-security-review-says-white-house-101612980763928.html

When a storm goes by, the situation around the storm will continue to reinforce the cold air that's in place," Petersen said.The first of those storms on Wednesday bombarded Kentucky, southern Illinois, northwestern Tennessee and eastern and central Arkansas."A lot of areas have light freezing drizzle, and it's going to get heavier later today," Petersen said. "That has the ability to break down power lines and, of course, it's very difficult to travel on icy roads."Next up is a storm expected on Thursday to drop 3 to 5 inches (7.6 cm to 12.7 cm) of snow on West Virginia into Virginia and the nation's capitol in Washington, DC Winter storm warnings were issued for the same time for metropolitan Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.On Saturday, a brewing storm threatens to head for New York and New England, fueled by snow likely to turn to sleet and freezing rain in the mid-Atlantic states.On Sunday yet another large system of "significant" snow and freezing rain is likely to slam the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley before heading north into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes, he said."Possible freezing rain in northern Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. There aren't too many ice storms down there so this will definitely stand out," Petersen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-storms-in-10-days-loom-amid-bitter-cold-in-north-united-states-101612979906224.html
10-02-2021||World||Trump 'inciter in chief' of Capitol attack: Democrats||Prosecutors in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial said Wednesday they would prove that Trump was no “innocent bystander” but the “inciter in chief” of the deadly attack at the Capitol aimed at overturning his election loss to Joe Biden.Opening the first full day of arguments, the lead House prosecutor said they will lay out evidence that shows the president encouraged a rally crowd to head to the Capitol, then did nothing to stem the violence and watched with “glee" as a mob stormed the iconic building. Five people died.“To us it may have felt like chaos and madness, but there was method to the madness that day,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.The day's proceedings were unfolding after an emotional Tuesday start to the trial that left the former president fuming after his attorneys delivered a meandering defense and failed to halt the trial on constitutional grounds. Some allies called for yet another shakeup to his legal team.Trump is the first president to face an impeachment trial after leaving office and the first to be twice impeached. The riot followed a rally during which Trump urged his supporters to “fight like hell,” words his lawyers say were simply a figure of speech. He is charged with “incitement of insurrection.”Senators, many of whom fled for safety the day of the attack, watched Tuesday’s graphic videos of the Trump supporters who battled past police to storm the halls, Trump flags waving. More video is expected Wednesday, including some that hasn’t been seen before.House Democratic prosecutors on Wednesday plan to use Capitol security footage that hasn’t been publicly released before as they argue that Trump incited the insurrection, according to Democratic aides working on the case.Security remains extremely tight at the Capitol, fenced off with razor wire and patrolled by National Guard troops.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would not be watching the trial.“Joe Biden is the president, he’s not a pundit, he’s not going to opine on back and forth arguments,” she said.The House impeachment managers described police officers maimed in the chaos and rioters parading in the very chamber where the trial was being held. Trump’s team countered that the Constitution doesn’t allow impeachment at this late date.That’s a legal issue that could resonate with Senate Republicans eager to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.Lead defense lawyer Bruce Castor said he shifted his planned approach after hearing the prosecutors’ emotional opening and instead spoke conversationally to the senators, saying Trump’s team would denounce the “repugnant” attack and “in the strongest possible way denounce the rioters.” He appealed to the senators as “patriots first,” and encouraged them to be “cool headed” as they assessed the arguments.Trump attorney David Schoen turned the trial toward starkly partisan tones, arguing the Democrats were fueled by a “base hatred” of the former president.Republicans made it clear that they were unhappy with Trump’s defense, many of them saying they didn’t understand where it was going — particularly Castor’s opening. Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial, said that Trump’s team did a “terrible job.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who also voted with Democrats, said she was “perplexed.” Sen. Lisa Murkowki of Alaska said it was a “missed opportunity” for the defense.Six Republicans joined with Democrats to vote to proceed with the trial, but the 56-44 vote was far from the two-thirds threshold of 67 votes that would be needed for conviction.At one pivotal point, Raskin told his personal story of bringing his family to the Capitol that day to witness the certification of the Electoral College vote, only to have his daughter and son-in-law hiding in an office, fearing for their lives.“Senators, this cannot be our future,” Raskin said through tears. “This cannot be the future of America.”The House prosecutors had argued there is no “January exception” for a president to avoid impeachment on his way out the door. Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., referred to the corruption case of William Belknap, a war secretary in the Grant administration, who was impeached, tried and ultimately acquitted by the Senate after leaving office.If Congress stands by, “it would invite future presidents to use their power without any fear of accountability," he said.It appears unlikely that the House prosecutors will call witnesses, and Trump has declined a request to testify. The trial is expected to continue into the weekend.Trump's second impeachment trial is expected to diverge from the lengthy, complicated affair of a year ago. In that case, Trump was charged with having privately pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, then a Democratic rival for the presidency.This time, Trump's “stop the steal” rally rhetoric and the storming of the Capitol played out for the world to see.The Democratic-led House impeached the president swiftly, one week after the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-inciter-in-chief-of-capitol-attack-democrats-101612979348154.html
10-02-2021||World||Prominent Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul released from prison||One of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent political activists was released from prison Wednesday, her family tweeted, after serving nearly three years on charges that have sparked an international uproar over the kingdom’s human rights record.Loujain al-Hathloul, who pushed to end a ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to almost six years in prison last December under a broad counterterrorism law. She was accused of crimes that rights groups describe as politically motivated, including agitating for change and pursuing a foreign agenda.Her sister Lina al-Hathloul posted a screenshot from FaceTime of a smiling Loujain on Twitter, declaring that she was finally home.Her early release was widely expected as the judge suspended part of her sentence and gave her credit for time already served. The move comes as Saudi Arabia faces new scrutiny from the United States, where President Joe Biden has vowed to reassess the US-Saudi partnership and stand up for human rights and democratic principles.Although released, Al-Hathloul will remain under strict conditions, her family has previously said, including a five-year travel ban and three years of probation.The 31-year-old Saudi activist long has been outspoken about human rights in Saudi Arabia, even from behind bars. She launched hunger strikes to protest her imprisonment and joined other female activists in telling Saudi judges that she was tortured and sexually assaulted by masked men during interrogations. The women say they were caned, electrocuted and waterboarded. Some say they were forcibly groped and threatened with rape.Al-Hathloul rejected an offer to rescind her allegations of torture in exchange for early release, according to her family. An appeals court on Tuesday had rejected her claims of torture, her family said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-saudi-women-s-rights-activist-loujain-al-hathloul-released-from-prison-101612977732608.html

Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of COVID vaccines sought by Canada. We also agreed to continue collaborating on other important issues like Climate Change and the global economic recovery," PM Modi tweeted.The development comes in the wake of India clearing the supply of 24 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 25 countries on a commercial basis in February. This is more than than twice the 10.5 million vaccines that were exported in January, according to people familiar with the development.Was happy to receive a call from my friend @JustinTrudeau. Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of COVID vaccines sought by Canada. We also agreed to continue collaborating on other important issues like Climate Change and the global economic recovery.However, Canada was not included in the list of countries who will receive the vaccines from India, they added. Canada has sought 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).The country has registered nearly 813,000 coronavirus cases till now of which 20,984 have died while 753,386 people have recovered. PM Trudeau had said on Tuesday that the government will step up its fight against the pandemic by obliging citizens returning home overland from the United States to show they do not have Covid-19, according to Reuters."Everyone arriving by air already has to prove they tested negative within the previous 72 hours and this rule is being expanded to land crossings starting on February 15", he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-would-do-its-best-to-facilitate-supplies-of-vaccines-to-canada-pm-modi-101612977542590.html
10-02-2021||World||Georgia launches criminal probe into Trump's efforts to overturn 2020 elections||A Georgia prosecutor's office confirmed Wednesday that it has opened a criminal investigation into “attempts to influence” the outcome of last year's general election. Officials did not mention former President Donald Trump by name, but Trump has come under intense criticism for a call he made to the state's top elections official last month.Trump pressed Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state. During the Jan. 2 phone call, Trump repeatedly argued that Raffensperger could change the certified results, an assertion the secretary of state firmly rejected.“All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump said. “Because we won the state.”In letters to Raffensperger as well as the state's governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis informs them that an investigation has been opened and that all records related to the administration of the election should be preserved, particularly those that may be evidence of attempts to influence the actions of people administering the election.Willis spokesman Jeff DiSantis said he couldn’t name the subjects of the investigation, but said in an email that “the matters reported on over the last several weeks are the matters being investigated.” In her letters, Willis also remarks that officials "have no reason to believe that any Georgia official is a target of this investigation.”The initiation of a criminal investigation comes just two days after Raffensperger’s office opened an administrative investigation into the call prompted by a third-party complaint that alleged Trump had violated Georgia law.Investigators with the secretary of state’s office who look into such complaints typically present their findings to the state election board, which then decides how to proceed. If the board believes there’s evidence that a crime occurred, it could take action ranging from issuing a letter of reprimand to referring the case to Georgia’s attorney general or to a local district attorney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-launches-criminal-probe-into-trump-s-efforts-to-overturn-2020-elections-101612976112002.html
10-02-2021||World||Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine recommended for all adults by WHO panel||A World Health Organization panel recommended AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine for all adults over 18, paving the way to speed up inoculations in developing countries.The recommendation may encourage more countries to use the vaccine broadly, after some European Union countries advised against giving it to the elderly, citing insufficient trial data involving older people.The shot’s effect in older people is expected to be the same as for younger recipients, said Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of the WHO panel, in a briefing.The move is good news for developing countries, many of which are waiting to administer their first shots as wealthier countries have already inoculated millions of residents. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, has pledged significant supplies to Covax, a facility that aims to distribute vaccines equitably around the world.The WHO’s recommendation on the Astra shot follows the organization’s decision to clear a vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in December. The U.K. drugmaker’s shot is easier to deploy than other vaccines like Pfizer’s that need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, and costs less.As mutated virus strains spread across the globe, concern has grown that they’ll impact vaccine efficacy. South Africa, where one of the variants was first identified late last year, said it would pause a rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a trial showed it had limited efficacy against mild infections with the strain. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said the shot should still protect against severe disease, and WHO officials underlined the benefits of continuing to use the vaccine even in variant-hit areas.Covax Plans“We made the recommendation that even if there is a reduction in possibility of this vaccine having a full impact in its protection capacity, there’s no reason not to recommend its use, even in countries that have the circulation of variants,” Cravioto said.Covax said last month that it’s on track to deliver at least 2 billion doses -- about two-thirds of which will go to lower-income economies -- and to vaccinate at least a fifth of each participating country’s population by year’s end.The WHO’s emergency use authorization is needed for Covax to send the vaccines to participating countries, in order to ensure a product’s safety and efficacy for countries that might not have the resources to make the assessments themselves. Individual countries can still make their own decisions on the use of shots.AstraZeneca shares traded 0.9% lower in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxfordastrazeneca-covid-vaccine-recommended-for-all-adults-by-who-panel-101612975812404.html

The announcement comes days after Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg, in an earnings call, indicated that the social media giant plans to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations in the United States for the long term and expand the policy globally.Zuckerberg had said that such steps are necessary to ensure the communities users connect with are healthy and positive. The 36-year-old internet entrepreneur then revealed that the company was considering steps to reduce the amount of political content in News Feed as well. Citing feedback from Facebook users, Zuckerberg said that “people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.”“So one theme for this year is that we're going to continue to focus on helping millions more people participate in healthy communities and we're going to focus even more on being a force for bringing people closer together,” he added.Facebook has now said in a blog post that the upcoming changes to the News Feed are along similar lines. It added that although the company already offers controls to help users manage what they see in their feed, it is trying to find a new balance of the content people want to see.Here are important takeaways from today’s announcement:The social media firm, over the next few months, will work to better understand the varied preferences for political content and test a number of approaches based on those insights.Facebook will temporarily reduce the distribution of political content in the News Feed this week for a limited number of users in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia. It will extend the move in the United States in the coming weeks.It will explore ways to rank political content in the feeds of Facebook users using different signals, and then decide on the approaches the company will use going forward.Content from official government agencies and services, Covid-19 information from health organisations and agencies will be exempt from these tests.It will not remove political content from Facebook altogether to preserve people’s ability to find and interact with political content on the social media platform “while respecting each person’s appetite for it at the top of their News Feed.”Facebook will carry out a survey on the users’ experience during these tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-first-step-towards-reducing-political-content-all-you-need-to-know-101612974893637.html

The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the department of homeland security (DHS) was originally published on November 19, 2020, which invited the public to provide feedback on the proposed amendments for non-US citizens entering and exiting the country.What are the proposed changes?Currently, the CBP may only conduct pilot programs to collect biometrics at exit points, that too at a limited number of airports and seaport and only from a limited population. The proposed amendment would eliminate the references to pilot programs and port limitations in the DHS entry/exit regulations. It would allow the DHS to collect photographs and biometrics from non-US travellers departing from airports, land ports, seaports, or any other authorized point of departure.The department of homeland security had drafted the regulation to increase the vetting of immigrants by expanding the scope of biometrics collection policies. The proposed regulation will authorise the expansion of methods for collecting biometrics, which will include palm imprints, iris images, voice recognition, and even DNA collection in certain circumstances. Foreign nationals such as H-1B visa holders could be subject to such biometric collections until they become US citizens.Read | Fears raised over facial recognition use at Moscow protestsKen Cuccinelli, a senior DHS official under Trump administration, had then said that the proposed regulation would reduce the dependence on paper documents and biographic information to prove identity and familial relationships. The proposed rule also authorises the DHS to collect DNA or DNA test results to verify a claimed genetic relationship when the applicant fails to provide sufficient documentary evidence to establish the same.The draft regulation drew flak from rights groups on the grounds of violations of privacy norms. Andrea Flores, deputy director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), had said that new rules will make it easier for the government to surveil and target immigrants.The comment period originally closed on December 21, 2020, but the CBP, under a new administration, has decided to reopen it from February 10 to March 12, 2021. “We welcome the public’s input to the rule as we work to further secure and enhance a touchless, seamless travel experience through facial biometrics,” William A. Ferrara, executive assistant commissioner of field operations, CBP, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-agency-invites-comments-on-proposed-biometrics-policy-for-noncitizens-101612967254329.html

Sharma Oli's decision to call for an early election, said on Wednesday the premier should resign and repent over the move.Nepal was plunged into crisis on Dec. 20 when Oli declared he could no longer work with rivals in his Nepal Communist Party (NCP), dissolved parliament and called for a fresh election more than a year ahead of schedule.Tens of thousands of people have since joined protests for or against the move."K.P.Oli if you want some political space, there is still time for you to resign and express repentance publicly," Prachanda told an anti-Oli rally.Prachanda, a former prime minister who still goes by the nom de guerre he used while leading a decade-long Maoist insurgency that ended in 2006, said protests to oppose Oli's "unconstitutional" move would rage across Nepal."Oli is not interested in the election ... don't be misled by his talks about elections, they can't be held as planned," Prachanda told the cheering and whistle-blowing crowds, near Oli's office in the capital Kathmandu.Oli blames Prachanda and other opponents in the party for a lack of cooperation he says has stymied effective government as the Himalayan nation seeks to navigate a pandemic-induced economic crisis.The Supreme Court is hearing more than a dozen petitions challenging the dissolution of parliament. Judges are expected to give their verdict this month.If the verdict is in Oli's favour then Nepal faces an election in two phases, on April 30 and May 10.Last week, addressing a rally of supporters in Kathmandu, Oli said the dissolution of parliament was his prerogative and pledged that the vote would be held on schedule.Nepal, a country of 30 million people, has seen vital remittances and tourism revenue hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected 272,349 people in the country, with 2,047 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-communist-rival-prachanda-says-pm-kp-sharma-oli-should-resign-repent-101612963272328.html

Conviction requires a two-thirds majority, which means at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with all Democrats in the 50-50 chamber.Only six Republicans on Tuesday voted in favor of the constitutionality of the Senate process. While that was enough for the simple majority required to proceed with the trial, it suggests that most GOP senators don’t want to vote against Trump.McConnell, in a leadership meeting Monday night, said the same things he has said publicly, a person familiar with the matter said.On Feb. 2, he told reporters: “We’re all going to listen to what the lawyers have to say and making the arguments and work our way through it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcconnell-signals-republicans-that-trump-s-conviction-is-a-conscience-vote-101612961198155.html
10-02-2021||World||Explained: What the WHO Covid-19 experts learned in Wuhan||A World Health Organization team is leaving China on Wednesday after gaining some new insights into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that has now killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide — but with the major questions still unanswered.The visit was politically sensitive for China — which is concerned about any allegations it didn't handle the initial outbreak properly — and has been closely watched around the world.Team member Peter Daszak sounded an upbeat note on arriving at the airport at the end of the four-week trip to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in December 2019.“We have clear leads on what the next steps should be," he said. "We know a lot more after the work that's been done.”The team's major conclusions seemed to confirm what most researchers had already surmised about the virus. The visit was never expected to definitively pinpoint the origin of the pandemic — an undertaking that, based on others, could take years.Here's a look at the theories the team explored during their visit:The BatsThe mission to Wuhan did not change a major theory about where the virus came from. Scientists think bats are the most likely carriers, and that they passed it on to another animal, which passed it on to humans. While there are other possibilities — a bat could have infected a human directly, for instance — the path through a second animal remains the most likely scenario, according to the WHO team and its Chinese counterparts. The question is what animal and where.The MarketThe Huanan Seafood Market, which had a cluster of cases at the start of the outbreak, has long been suggested as a possible place humans first became infected. The market dealt mainly in frozen seafood but also sold domesticated wildlife. That included rabbits, which are known to be susceptible to the virus, and bamboo rats and ferret badgers, which are suspected of being susceptible. At the WHO mission's closing news conference Tuesday, one team member said some of these animals have been traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to bats that carry the virus that is the closest known relative of the one that causes Covid-19.That finding could put renewed focus on the market. Chinese health officials have downplayed the market's role, noting that only surfaces at the market tested positive for the virus, not any of the animal products. A Chinese official said Tuesday that it appears there were cases elsewhere in Wuhan around the same time as the market cluster, so it remains possible the transfer of the virus from animals to humans happened elsewhere.The LabThe conclusion of the Chinese and international experts was that it is extremely unlikely the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab with an extensive collection of virus samples. Former U.S. President Donald Trump and officials in his administration were among those who floated that possibility — prompting angry denials from China. And most experts have long been skeptical of it.In making its determination, the team said that such leaks are extremely rare and there's no evidence the virus existed in that lab or any lab anywhere in the world when the pandemic began. It also reviewed safety protocols at the institute, leading the team to conclude “it was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,” WHO team leader Peter Ben Embarek said.The Cold ChainThe joint investigation left open the possibility that the virus could have been spread to humans through frozen food products, a bit of a surprise as foreign experts have generally played down the risk.It's a theory that has been widely promoted by Chinese officials, who have detected the virus on imported frozen food packaging and seized on that to suggest the virus could have come to China from abroad.WHO team member Marion Koopmans noted that it still wouldn't answer the question of where the virus came from originally. “Its not the cold chain by itself, that cannot be," she said at the airport. "The virus has to come from somewhere.”The DataThe mission has been dogged by questions about how much freedom China would give the researchers to visit the places and talk to the people they wanted to. In the end, they appeared satisfied with the arrangements, at least in their public comments. Team member Thea Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-the-who-covid-19-experts-learned-in-wuhan-101612961173222.html

The group has denied involvement in a recent wave of targeted assassinations which the government and many foreign powers have blamed on it.Almost daily deadly attacks with small, magnetic bombs attached to the undercarriages of vehicles, roadside explosive devices and shootings are unnerving Afghan officials, activists and journalists.The attacks are concentrated in urban centres and come as protracted peace talks take place in Doha between Taliban militants and the Afghan government.Officials say the talks have largely stalled as US President Joe Biden's administration reviews how to handle the peace process, including a troop withdrawal agreement Washington signed with the Taliban under previous President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-blasts-hit-kabul-district-police-chief-among-the-dead-101612961215916.html

10-02-2021||World||Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma spotted playing Golf after weeks out of public view||For months, speculation over Jack Ma’s whereabouts has run rampant. Maybe the embattled billionaire had fled to Singapore, some posited. Or he had been placed under house arrest. Or worse yet, he was locked up in a high-security jail.As it turns out, China’s most talked-about tycoon has been working on his golf game.The co-founder of Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. teed off in recent weeks at the Sun Valley Golf Resort, a secluded 27-hole course on the Chinese island of Hainan, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Located near the island’s southern tip, the course offers expansive greens and stunning views.It’s the first known Ma sighting since the former English teacher joined a live-streamed video chat with rural educators on Jan. 20. While that appearance helped quiet talk of Ma’s detention, speculation about his standing with China’s Communist Party has continued to swirl as authorities clamp down on his sprawling business empire.Ma’s golf outing adds to recent evidence that the outspoken entrepreneur has -- for now at least -- avoided nightmare scenarios like jail time or a government seizure of his assets.Ant, for instance, has reached an agreement with Chinese authorities on a restructuring plan that could be officially announced as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 3, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal is a first step on what could be a long path back to a revival of the fintech behemoth’s initial public offering, which was halted by regulators in November just days before Ant was due to start trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong.Another positive clue emerged this week from SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son, a longtime friend of Ma’s who was among the earliest investors in Alibaba. Son said during SoftBank’s quarterly earnings presentation on Monday that he has remained in touch with Ma. While he didn’t talk about the Chinese billionaire’s whereabouts, Son said Ma likes to draw and has been sharing his sketches via chat.Representatives for Ant, Alibaba and the Sun Valley Golf Resort declined to comment.Before the implosion of Ant’s IPO, Ma’s appearance on a golf course would have attracted little if any attention. The 56-year-old has been steadily relinquishing day-to-day oversight of his businesses in recent years, stepping down as executive chairman of Alibaba in September 2019.But even in semi-retirement, Ma has rarely stayed out of public view for as long as he did after his now-infamous critique of Chinese financial regulators in October. Within weeks of his speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, authorities scuttled Ant’s listing, called for an overhaul of the company and started an antitrust probe of Alibaba.Ma’s extended absence during the crackdown sent China’s rumor mill into overdrive, with some observers drawing parallels to Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia’s richest man, the Yukos Oil Co. boss spent about a decade in prison on fraud and tax-evasion charges that he said were retribution for challenging the authority of Vladimir Putin.Given the opacity of Xi Jinping’s Communist Party, it’s difficult to assess the endgame for Ma with any certainty. He was conspicuously absent from a list of Chinese tech luminaries published by state media last week, a sign his standing with the party remains diminished.For Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong, the most likely explanation is that Ma is simply laying low as his companies sort through their issues with regulators. Both Alibaba and Ant have formed special teams to work with the Chinese government, which is still fine-tuning new rules for the country’s fintech and internet industries.Ma, described as a golfing novice by one observer at the Sun Valley resort, may have ample time to work on his swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-co-founder-jack-ma-spotted-playing-golf-after-weeks-out-of-public-view-101612959156530.html
10-02-2021||World||Indian, Chinese troops begin to disengage at Pangong lake: China||Indian and Chinese troops have begun to disengage from the southern and northern banks of the Pangong lake, the Chinese defence ministry announced on Wednesday.In a statement published on the Chinese defence ministry website, spokesperson Wu Qian said that according to the consensus reached at the 9th round of military commander-level talks, the frontline units of the Chinese and Indian armed forces have begun to disengage at the southern and northern banks of the Pangong lake on February 10.“The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10,” said the statement. “This move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting.” The Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between India and China, passes through the lake, parts of which are controlled by the Indian and Chinese militaries.The details of the disengagement were not shared by the Chinese defence ministry, but it possibly indicates a movement towards resolving the nine-month military standoff between the two neighbours across multiple points in eastern Ladakh.The 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level meeting was held on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point on January 24.At the meeting, the two sides had “…agreed to push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops. They also agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, maintain the good momentum of dialogue and negotiation, and hold the 10th round of the Corps Commander Level Meeting at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation.”The two sides agreed to continue their effective efforts in ensuring the restraint of the frontline troops, stabilise and control the situation along the LAC in the western Sector of the China-India border, and jointly maintain peace and tranquility, a statement from the Chinese defence ministry said.The announcement on disengagement comes just two days ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year on Friday. It also comes two days after the Chinese foreign ministry said Indian minister VK Singh’s statement on the Indian army transgressing across the LAC more than Chinese troops was an “unwitting confession”.Interestingly, the nationalistic tabloid the Global Times had reported in November that China and India had agreed to “implement a disengagement plan under reciprocal principle with the premise that India should firstly withdraw staff who illegally crossed lines on the southern side of the Pangong Tso Lake.” “India should first withdraw staff who illegally crossed the line on the southern side of the Pangong Tso Lake, and China will then consider disengaging on the northern side of the lake,” the tabloid had reported quoting anonymous sources.The announcement of disengagement from China is also markedly different from the resolution of military tension during the 2017 Doklam standoff: The two countries had issued simultaneous statements on troop withdrawals unlike this time.The Indian ministry of external affairs had said on August 28, 2017 that the “two sides” had agreed to defuse the crisis in Doklam, near the Sikkim border.The Indian ministry of external affairs had then said the “two sides” had agreed to defuse the crisis following diplomatic talks.Qian Feng, director of the Research Department at the National Strategy Institute at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, said Wednesday’s announcement was a positive move.“The agreement between the two sides to withdraw troops before the Chinese lunar calendar Spring Festival is good news, not only to avoid a continued decline of Sino-Indian current relations, but also to ease tensions along the border between the two countries and reduce the possibility of friction and conflict in the short term,” Qian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-chinese-troops-begin-to-disengage-at-pangong-lake-china-101612958523004.html
10-02-2021||World||US-China bickering over Covid-19 continues after WHO's Wuhan team ends probe||China called on the United States on Wednesday to invite the World Health Organization to investigate origins of the Covid-19 outbreak there, as sparring over the pandemic continued after the WHO wrapped up its field work in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Hours after the WHO team revealed preliminary findings at a Wuhan news conference on Tuesday, Washington said it wants to scrutinize data used by the team, which concluded that the virus causing Covid-19 did not originate in a laboratory in Wuhan, and that bats remain a likely source."We wish that the US side can, like China, uphold an open and transparent attitude, and be able to invite WHO experts to the US to conduct origin tracing research and inspection," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular daily briefing, repeating a call it has been making recently.The origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, are highly politicized, with China pushing the idea that the virus has roots outside its borders.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that the Biden administration had not been involved in the "planning and implementation" of the WHO investigation and wants to take an independent review of its findings and underlying data."The US independently examining the WHO's data? It's the WHO who should examine the US data," said Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People’s Daily, on social media platform Weibo."Did we all mishear, or is this spokesperson really so shameless?"Peter Ben Embarek, who heads the WHO-led team that spent four weeks in China - two of them in quarantine - said that the investigation had not dramatically changed its picture of the outbreak, although the virus could have crossed borders before arriving in Wuhan.In addition to ruling out a lab leak, he said that frozen food could possibly be a means of transmitting the virus, which would support a thesis backed by Beijing, which has blamed some case clusters on imported food packaging.The WHO's conclusion "completely refutes the conspiracy theory raised by some anti-China hawks, like former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has been accusing the Wuhan Institute of Virology of leaking the virus," the Global Times wrote.Pompeo had said there was "a significant amount of evidence" that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory.Chinese officials have stressed in recent months that the virus could have emerged in multiple regions outside China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uschina-bickering-over-covid-19-continues-after-who-s-wuhan-team-ends-probe-101612957806843.html
10-02-2021||World||Satya Nadella says big tech needs clearer laws on online speech||Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Satya Nadella said social-media services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need clearer laws and rules to govern whether controversial accounts, like former US President Donald Trump’s, have a place on their services, rather than being asked to make free-speech decisions themselves. “Unilateral action by individual companies in democracies like ours is just not long-term stable—we do need to be able to have a framework of laws and norms,” Nadella said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “Depending on any one individual CEO in any one of these companies to make calls that are going to really help us maintain something as sacred and as important as our democracy in the long run is just no way that at least I, as a citizen, would advocate for.”Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the de-platforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a US antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said. “There is no God-given right for US tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said.  “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satya-nadella-says-big-tech-needs-clearer-laws-on-online-speech-101612956802666.html

10-02-2021||World||Ursula von der Leyen says EU was late, over-confident on vaccine rollout||As the European Union surpassed the toll of 500,000 people lost to the virus, the EU Commission chief said Wednesday that the bloc's much-criticized vaccine rollout could be partly blamed on the EU being over-optimistic, over-confident and plainly “late."European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the EU’s overall approach of trying to beat the pandemic with a unified vaccine plan for its 27 nations, even if she admitted mistakes in the strategy to quickly obtain sufficient vaccines for its 447 million citizens.“We are still not where we want to be. We were late to authorize. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps we were too confident that, what we ordered, would actually be delivered on time," von der Leyen told EU plenary.Despite weeks of stinging criticism as the EU's vaccine campaign failed to gain momentum compared to the Britain, Israel and the United States, the three main parties in the legislature stuck with von der Leyen's approach of moving forward with all member states together.“The key decisions were right," said Manfred Weber, the leader of the Christian Democrat European People's Party.The Socialists and Democrats party leader Iratxe Garcia said “Fiasco, catastrophe, disaster: they ring very true to our citizens," but added her party will stick with von der Leyen on the bloc moving together. “Criticism is necessary but with a constructive spirit."Von der Leyen's assessment came as the bloc's death toll passed a landmark of 500,000, a stunning statistic in less than a year that fundamentally challenges the bloc's vaunted welfare standards and health care capabilities.It came as the bloc was fighting off the remnants of a second surge of Covid-19 that has kept communities from Portugal to Finland under all kinds of lockdown, curfews and restrictions as authorities race to vaccinate as many people as possible.The last official weekly figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are only expected on Thursday but Johns Hopkins University produced a daily tally showing how the mark stood at 500,809 on Wednesday.In comparison, the United States, with a population of 330 million, leads the world per nation with more than 468,000 deaths.Von der Leyen stuck with her promise to have 70% of the EU's adult population vaccinated by the end of summer and blamed big pharmaceutical companies for not keeping vaccine production up with scientific advances.“Indeed, industry has to match the groundbreaking pace of science," von der Leyen said. “We fully understand that difficulties will arise in the mass production of vaccines. But Europe has invested billions of euros in capacities in advance, and we urged the member states to plan the vaccine rollout. So now we all need predictability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ursula-von-der-leyen-says-eu-was-late-over-confident-on-vaccine-rollout-101612954993888.html

As the prosecutors made their case on the constitutionality of the impeachment and removal of a former president, Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, said that the argument of Republicans would create a brand new “January exception” to the American Constitution.Raskin said that Trump’s defence team wants to call the trial over even before the introduction of any evidence on the basis of an argument that “if you commit an impeachable offence in your last few weeks in office, you do it with constitutional impunity.” According to the impeachment manager, the argument suggests conduct that would be a high crime and misdemeanour in the first three years and the “vast majority” of the fourth year of a presidency will be ignored during the last few weeks in office.“This would create a brand new January exception to the Constitution of the United States of America. A January exception,” Raskin emphasised, referring to the month in which the outgoing president leaves the office.Read | As Trump trial opens, Democrat recalls daughter's fear during riotThe House representative for Maryland's 8th congressional district said that such an exception would be an invitation to the president to do anything on his way out of the office, including use of violent means to seize the power. He warned that the lawmakers would risk allowing January 6, the day Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, to become the future of the United States if they buy the “radical argument” advanced by the defence team.“In other words, the January exception is an invitation to our founder’s worst nightmare...What will the January exception mean to future generations if you grant it?” asked Raskin.“And if the president’s arguments for a January exception are upheld...he would have you believe there is absolutely nothing the Senate can do about it. No trial, no facts. He wants you to decide that the Senate is powerless at that point. That can’t be right,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-what-is-january-exception-house-managers-argued-against-101612953595134.html

It is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a strategically vital region that witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in recent years."What I would say generally is that the Quad is a key example of the United States and our closest partners, including, in this case, India, pulling together for the good of a free and open Indo-Pacific region," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Tuesday.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad, comprising a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea.

It also expects to receive 117,000 Pfizer shots in the first quarter from the COVAX facility co-led by the World Health Organization."The supply that will be sent to South Africa and to COVAX is manufactured at our site in Puurs, Belgium," Pfizer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-could-directly-deliver-covid-19-shot-to-south-africa-vaccination-points-101612949619412.html

As of February 7, an additional six countries have reported cases of this variant, CNN reported.In the UK, for example, Covid-19 test samples of this strain increased from 63 per cent in the week of December 14 to 90 per cent in the week of January 18, the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological update.The WHO has also been monitoring two additional coronavirus strains that are actively spreading: B.1.351, initially seen in South Africa, and the P.1 strain that was first identified in Brazil, CNN reported.As of February 7, the B.1.351 strain has been reported in 44 countries , while the P.1 strain has been reported in 15 nations, said the WHO.According to CNN, scientists are not surprised to see the coronavirus changing and evolving but they fear that a variant could mutate to the point that it causes more severe disease, bypasses the ability of tests to detect it or evades the protection provided by vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-variant-of-coronavirus-strain-detected-in-86-countries-says-who-101612952057305.html

They wanted to disrupt public security by creating panic among the people," Zakir said.Two of the men are still on the loose and were sentenced in absentia, including mastermind Syed Ziaul Haque, a sacked army officer, Zakir added.Haque has been charged with the killings of several secular activists.A defence lawyer for the eight men said they would appeal against the sentences.The Bangladesh government has set up two major anti-terrorism police units in recent years to crack down on Islamic extremists.More than 100 suspected Islamists have been killed in anti-terror raids across the country and hundreds have been detained. Around half-a-dozen Islamist militant outfits have been banned.Star Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al Hasan has become the latest target of radicals and had to be given an armed bodyguard after he was threatened for attending a Hindu ceremony in neighbouring India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-hang-eight-islamists-over-murder-of-publisher-101612950019809.html

10-02-2021||World||Explained: Why Warren Hastings, 18th Century governor-general of Bengal, mentioned during Trump’s impeachment trial||The first day of former US president Donald Trump’s impeachment trial on Tuesday in the Senate revolved around the constitutionality of the case before the Upper chamber voted 56-44 in favour of the trial. House impeachment managers made their case for an impeachment trial, rejecting the argument of Trump’s defence team that a president cannot be tried after he or she has left the office. Warren Hastings, the former governor-general of the British colony of Bengal, was at the centre of the argument by prosecutors while debating the constitutionality of impeachment trial.Who was Warren Hastings?Warren Hastings was the first governor of the presidency of Fort William (Bengal) and de facto governor-general of Bengal during the reign of East India Company in the 18th Century. He abolished the dual system introduced by Robert Clive, the first British governor of the Bengal presidency, in which the company had the rights to collect revenue (Diwani rights) and the Nizam, Indian rulers, had the administrative authority. Both Hastings and Clive are credited for laying the foundation of the British Empire in India.Read | Key takeaways from Day 1 of Trump’s second impeachment trialWhy was Hastings mentioned during the Senate trial?The lead House impeachment manager, Representative Jamie Raskin, highlighted that the framers of the American Constitution borrowed the idea of this institution from Britain. Allegations of corruption and misconduct were rampant during Hastings’ term in Bengal and after he returned to England, the former official was impeached by British House of Commons over mismanagement and corruption. However, Hastings was later acquitted by the House of Lords.Raskin said that every single impeachment of a British government official that occurred during the lifetime of the framers of the Constitution concerned a former official. Hastings impeachment trial in the UK House of Commons took place during the Constitutional Convention in the old Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia where framers had gathered to write the Constitution.“It was the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the former governor-general of the British colony of Bengal, and a corrupt guy. The framers knew all about it, and they strongly supported the impeachment. In fact, the Hastings case was invoked by name at the convention,” said Raskin.The lead House impeachment manager argued that Hastings’ case played a key role in the adoption of “the high crimes and misdemeanours standard” since it was the only specific impeachment case discussed at the convention. He further stated that not a single framer raised a concern when Hastings impeachment was held up as a model for writing the American Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-was-warren-hastings-mentioned-during-trump-s-impeachment-trial-101612948011906.html
10-02-2021||World||WHO expert slams US Covid-19 pandemic intel as curbs tightened in Europe||A WHO expert sent to China to probe the coronavirus hit out at US intelligence on Covid-19 as his team headed home with few answers about the origin of a pandemic that was forcing more clampdowns in some of the hardest-hit parts of the world.German Chancellor Angela Merkel was set to seek an extension of strict virus curbs, as the European Commission chief prepared to defend the stumbling vaccination rollout in the continent -- which accounts for a third of the 2.3 million Covid-19 deaths worldwide.The coronavirus has infected close to 107 million people, devastating the global economy, and questions over the handling of the initial outbreak in central China sparked an intense diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.The WHO mission to the ground zero city of Wuhan wrapped up Tuesday without any concrete answers, with Washington again expressing scepticism about China's transparency and cooperation.But WHO team member Peter Daszak tweeted: "Please don't rely too much on US intel: increasingly disengaged under Trump & frankly wrong on many aspects."He said they worked "flat out under the most politically charged environment possible".China had repeatedly delayed the WHO trip, and bristled at accusations of a lack of transparency. Beijing warned Washington not to "politicise" the mission after the White House demanded a "robust" probe.State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that the United States supports the investigation. But when asked if China had fully cooperated with the WHO, he said: "The jury's still out."The WHO team did not identify which animal transferred the coronavirus to humans, but said there was no indication it was circulating in Wuhan before December 2019, when the first official cases were recorded.WHO expert Peter Ben Embarek also scotched the controversial theory that the virus may have leaked from a lab in Wuhan.Vaccine, surge worries in EuropeEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was due to explain the EU's vaccine strategy to the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday, with the bloc's leadership under growing pressure.Vaccine supply issues have already caused a diplomatic row after AstraZeneca said it would not be able to immediately ship the doses it promised to Britain and the EU.At the same time, the resurgence of infections across the continent is adding to the pressure on its leadership.A stricter lockdown will be imposed in Greece from Thursday -- in particular in the Athens region -- as Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned that his country was facing a third Covid-19 wave.Wary of infection numbers exploding again, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will seek to extend strict curbs at least until the end of February as fatigue grows with the partial lockdown in Europe's top economy.Immunisation efforts are being ramped in other parts of the world with a number of vaccines.Peru on Tuesday began administering shots developed by China's Sinopharm, while Argentina approved the Indian-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.South Korea on Wednesday also authorised the AstraZeneca shot for people aged 18 and above, including over-65s.A number of European countries have not authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine for the elderly -- considered the demographic most vulnerable to Covid-19.Japan will start vaccinations next week -- most likely the Pfizer/BioNTech jab -- but it is scrambling to secure suitable syringes so doses won't go to waste.Valentine's Day worries Along with mass vaccinations, researchers and engineers around the world are searching for other ways to help end the pandemic and return life to normal -- especially international travel.Tech-savvy Estonia is working on a pilot project with the WHO on how a globally recognised electronic vaccine certificate might work, including addressing concerns about security and privacy.A more immediate concern for authorities in many countries this week is Valentine's Day, with fears that the upcoming celebrations could lead to a surge in infections.Authorities in Thailand's capital Bangkok announced the city would not register marriages on Valentine's Day, a popular day for weddings.In Brussels, however, where restaurants are closed, some hotels have converted rooms into private dining salons for two."We're over the moon about being here tonight, just like in a restaurant," said Marine Deroo, a 34-year-old who tried out the concept ahead of Valentine's Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-expert-slams-us-covid-19-pandemic-intel-as-curbs-tightened-in-europe-101612948378563.html
10-02-2021||World||Indian-Americans are more liberal towards issues in US, conservative in India||Indian-Americans have relatively more conservative views of policies in India while on issues affecting the US, the diaspora has a more liberal take, according to a survey of the political attitudes of the influential community in this country.Indian-Americans comprise slightly more than 1 per cent of the total US population-and less than 1 per cent of all registered voters.The survey, a collaboration between the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins-SAIS, and the University of Pennsylvania, “How Do Indian Americans View India? Results from the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey,” draws on the Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS).The IAAS is a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian American adults conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020, in partnership with YouGov. The survey has an overall margin of error of /- 2.8 per cent, a media release said on Tuesday.Indian-Americans’ policy views are more liberal on issues affecting the United States and more conservative on issues affecting India, it said.Regarding contentious issues such as the equal protection of religious minorities, immigration, and affirmative action, Indian-Americans hold relatively more conservative views of Indian policies than of US policies, according to the survey results.Indian Americans, in other words, believe that white supremacy is a greater threat to minorities in the United States, a country where they are a minority, than Hindu majoritarianism is to minorities in India, a country where Hindus are in the majority, the report said.Seventy per cent of Hindus agree or strongly agree that white supremacy is a threat to minorities in the United States, compared to 79 per cent of non-Hindus.Regarding Hindu majoritarianism in India, however, the data point to a much sharper divide: only 40 per cent of Hindus agree that Hindu majoritarianism is a threat to minorities, compared to 67 per cent of non-Hindus, it said.Noting that Indian-Americans are divided about India’s current trajectory, the survey said that respondents are nearly evenly split as to whether India is currently on the right track or headed down the wrong track.On India’s top three challenges, government corruption (18 per cent) ranked the highest followed by the economy (15 per cent). Foreign policy issues—exemplified by China and terrorism—are found in either the middle or bottom tier of the rankings.Among the Indian Americans, a majority either strongly or somewhat support an all-India National Register of Citizens 55 per cent and the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act (51 per cent), the report highlighted.However, they are more opposed than not to two other issues: the use of police force against peaceful protesters (65 per cent oppose) and government crackdowns on the media (69 per cent oppose).On the other issue of caste-based affirmative action in higher education admissions, the community is divided-with 47 per cent supporting this measure and 53 per cent opposing it, it said.Indian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group in the United States. There are 4.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the United States, according to 2018 data.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the most popular political party among Indian-Americans, the survey said.“One-third of respondents favour the ruling BJP while just 12 per cent identify with the Congress Party,” it said.However, two in five Indian Americans do not identify with an Indian political party-suggesting an arms-length relationship to everyday politics in India, it added. Indian-Americans hold broadly favourable views of (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, the survey said.Nearly half of all Indian-Americans approve of Modi’s performance as prime minister.“This support is greatest among Republicans, Hindus, people in the engineering profession, those not born in the United States, and those who hail from North and West India,” the survey results said.Further, the Indian-Americans, who have raised their political profile in the country, are broadly supportive of the US-India relationship, the survey results concluded.A plurality of Indian-Americans believe that current levels of US support for India are adequate, while a large majority hold unfavourable opinions of China.However, Indian-Americans are divided about US efforts to strengthen India’s military as a check against China.Foreign-born Indian-Americans and those who identify as Republicans are more supportive of the US efforts to support India militarily than their US-born and Democratic counterparts.Authors of the report are Sumitra Badrinathan from University of Pennsylvania, Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins-SAIS and Milan Vaishnav from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.According to a UN report in January, India has the largest diaspora population in the world with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland in 2020. The UAE, the US and Saudi Arabia host the largest number of migrants from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamericans-are-more-liberal-towards-issues-in-us-conservative-in-india-101612944866259.html
10-02-2021||World||Indian-American Neera Tanden owes her success to her immigrant mother||Indian-American political consultant Neera Tanden, who has been nominated by President Joe Biden as his budget director, attributed her success to the grit and resilience of her mother, an immigrant from India who was left to make it on her own in America with two young children after divorce.Tanden, 50, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman of colour and first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which serves the President of the United States in overseeing the implementation of his vision across the executive branch.Her mother Maya and family members were present during her confirmation hearing by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday.“I owe my presence here to their love and support and to the grit and resilience of my mother, an immigrant from India who was left to make it on her own in America with two young children after her divorce from my father. Back then, she faced a harsh choice. Stay in the United States and rely on the social safety net or return to India where she knew her children would face the stigma of divorce,” Tanden told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing.“She (mother) had faith in this country and made the decision, I believe the courageous decision, to stay. We relied on food stamps to eat, Section 8 vouchers to pay the rent,” she told the Senators.“At school, I remember being the only kid in the cafeteria line who used USD 0.10 vouchers from the free and reduced lunch programme. I remember using food stamps in the grocery store. Within just a few years, my mother found a job and a few years later, she was earning a middle-class salary. Soon, she was able to buy a home and eventually, she saw her children off to college and beyond,” Tanden said.Senator Amy Klobuchar who introduced her during the hearing also praised her mother Maya.“Neera is the daughter of Indian immigrants and grew up in Bedford, Massachusetts, raised by her mom Maya, Neera learned the value of perseverance at a very young age. Determined to succeed, like so many immigrants, Maya put her kids first and, as a single mom, she first relied on food stamps and public housing to make ends meet,” Klobuchar said.“Maya then found new footing and began working as a travel agent, forging her family's path to the middle class. It is her mother's work ethic and resolve that all of us see in Neera and it's those same qualities that I know will serve her well as our next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” she said.“As she started out as a travel agent, Maya may not have ever thought that her daughter would one day be asked to serve in the cabinet of the president of the United States. But after years of never taking no for an answer and setting high expectations for Neera, somehow we all ended up here today. Maya, Neera, her family, and all of us.Growing up, Neera understood the circumstances of her family's struggle and watched social programs work. Because of what--that personal connection, she knew from a young age that she wanted to pursue public service,” the Senator said.Tanden told lawmakers that she spent every day grateful for a nation and a government that had faith in her mother and in her, that invested in humanity and gave her a fair shot to pursue her potential.“As I sit before this committee, I'm mindful that my path in life would never have been possible without budgetary choices that reflected our nation's values, many of them made in the very agency I am now nominated to lead,” she said.During the hearing, Tanden also apologised for deleting the tweets that were critical of the Republican Senators and its leadership.“I appreciate people's concerns about my tweets and I've regretted them. And I deleted tweets because I regretted my tone. I've deleted tweets over many months. But for those concerned about --my rhetoric and my language, I'm sorry for any hurt that they've caused,” Tanden said.Senator Rob Portman said that there are media reports that during November of 2020 after the election, more than 1,000 tweets were deleted from Tanden’s account. “Some of these public statements have been tweets. Are these media reports that you deleted more than 1,000 tweets in November in advance of your nomination accurate? And if so, why did you delete them?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-neera-tanden-owes-her-success-to-her-immigrant-mother-101612946639407.html
10-02-2021||World||South Africa scraps AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, will give J&J jabs||South Africa will give the unapproved Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its front-line health care workers beginning next week as a study to see what protection it provides from Covid-19, particularly against the variant dominant in South Africa, the health minister announced Wednesday.Zweli Mkhize said South Africa has scrapped plans to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine because it “does not prevent mild to moderate disease” of the variant that has spread widely in South Africa.The one-shot J&J vaccine is still being tested internationally and has not been approved in any country.But Mkhize, in a nationally broadcast address, declared that the vaccine is safe, relying on tests of 44,000 people done in South Africa, the United States and Latin America.The J&J vaccines will be used to launch the first phase of South Africa's vaccination drive in which the country's 1.25 million health care workers will be inoculated, he said, adding the medical workers will be closely monitored to see what protection they get from the inoculation.“The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been proven effective against the 501Y.V2 variant (dominant in South Africa) and the necessary approval processes for use in South Africa are underway,” said Mkhize.“The roll-out of vaccination will proceed in the form of an implementation study with the partnership of the Medical Research Council and the National Department of Health vaccination sites across the country," he said. "This will provide valuable information about the pandemic in the post-vaccination community and thus, ensure early identification of breakthrough infections should they occur amongst vaccinated health workers.”Those vaccine shots will be followed by a campaign to vaccinate an estimated 40 million people in South Africa by the end of the year. South Africa will be using the Pfizer vaccine and others, possibly including the Russian Sputnik V and the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, Mkhize said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-scraps-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-will-give-j-j-jabs-101612946498782.html
10-02-2021||World||Chinese envoy calls for putting boundary issue in ‘appropriate place’||China and India should “meet each other half way” in addressing problems and put the boundary dispute in “an appropriate place in bilateral relations” while tackling differences in a constructive manner, Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong has said.In an article titled “China and the world in the year of the Ox” published on the website The Policy Chronicle on Wednesday, Sun also called for the two sides to “respect each other, enhance mutual trust [and] seek common ground while shelving differences”.The Chinese envoy’s remarks go against the position taken by the Indian leadership amid the dragging military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Indian side has said the development of the overall relationship with China is based on peace and tranquillity built up at the LAC in recent decades through several agreements on border management.While outlining eight principles to help repair strained relations with China on January 28, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said China’s actions in Ladakh last year have “profoundly disturbed” ties because they reflected a disregard for commitments on minimising troop levels and a “willingness to breach peace and tranquillity”.Also Watch: Biden official on ties with India, China challenge & farmers’ protestJaishankar also said any expectation that things could “carry on undisturbed despite the situation at the border” was “simply not realistic”.The Chinese envoy described China and India as large developing countries at a critical stage of development, and wrote in the article, “We should put the boundary issue in an appropriate place in bilateral relations, address differences in a rational and constructive manner and not allow our differences to become disputes.”He added, “It’s important for China and India to respect each other, enhance mutual trust, seek common ground while shelving differences and meet each other half way.”Sun also wrote that cooperation between China and India “far outweighs our differences, and our common interests are far greater than our inconsistencies”.“On the journey toward common rejuvenation, our two countries should run the marathon together and help each other achieve their respective dreams. In the new year, we must stick to the right direction of China-India relations and implement the important consensus reached between our leaders that China and India are partners and opportunities to each other, not adversaries or threats to each other,” he wrote in the article ahead of the Chinese year of the ox, which is set to begin on February 12.Sun also called for boosting cooperation in combating Covid-19, economic recovery, multilateralism and global governance, and bringing “bilateral relations back on the right track of sound and steady development, making our due contribution to maintaining world peace and promoting common development”.India and China have been unable to resolve the border standoff that emerged in the open in May last year despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks. There has been no headway in efforts aimed at disengagement and de-escalation even after meetings between the foreign ministers of the two sides.The standoff also led to the first incident with fatalities on the LAC since 1975, when 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops were killed in a clash in Galwan Valley last June. Tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in along the LAC for the harsh winter and there is mounting evidence that China has bolstered military and civilian infrastructure in Tibet over the past three years to facilitate the speedy movement of forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-calls-for-putting-boundary-issue-in-appropriate-place-101612945502970.html

10-02-2021||World||US concerned over China’s attempt to ‘intimidate’ neighbours, stands by partners||The US has expressed concern at China’s attempts to “intimidate its neighbours” against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, and said it will stand with friends and partners to advance security and prosperity across the Indo-Pacific. US state department’s spokesperson Ned Price made the remarks at a news briefing on Tuesday in response to a question on the Biden administration’s position on China’s efforts to encroach on India’s territory. The US views India as “one of the most important partners in the Indo-Pacific”, and welcomes India’s emergence as a “leading global power and its role as a net security provider in the region”, Price said.Also Read | Joe Biden withdraws US policy to track Chinese influence in American schools Key members of the Biden administration, such as secretary of state Antony Blinken have identified China as one of the main concerns for the US while supporting the strong position taken against China by former president Donald Trump. However, they have signalled the new administration’s handling of the issue will not be as confrontational as the approach adopted by Trump. Price said the US is closely monitoring the India-China standoff. “We are concerned by Beijing’s pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours. As always, we’ll stand with friends, we’ll stand with partners, we’ll stand with allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in...the Indo-Pacific,” he said. “We note the ongoing talks between the governments of India and China, and we continue to support direct dialogue and a peaceful resolution of those border disputes,” he added. Price pointed to India’s key role as an important partner for the US in the Indo-Pacific region and said: “We welcome India’s emergence as a leading global power and its role as a net security provider in the region. We cooperate on a wide range of diplomatic and security issues, including defence, non-proliferation, regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping, the environment, health, education, technology, agriculture, space, and oceans.” He also described the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – which groups the US, India, Australia and Japan – as a key example of the US and its closest partners “pulling together for the good of a free and open Indo-Pacific region”. The US is going to build on the Quad by deepening cooperation on areas of traditional focus, including maritime security, while also working closely with Quad partners to “confront some of the defining issues of our time”, such as Covid-19, climate change and democratic resilience, he said. The two countries also work closely in international organisations, and the US welcomes India joining the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term. “We also remain India’s largest and most important trading partner, with total bilateral trade increasing to $146 billion in 2019. US companies, of course, are a large source of India’s foreign direct investment,” Price said. Price highlighted people-to-people ties and noted that nearly four million Indian Americans “call the US home, contributing in their communities and proudly serving their country in uniform”. Responding to a question about Democratic Party lawmakers and vice-president Kamala Harris raising concerns in the past about human rights in India and the situation in Kashmir, Price said the US is “committed to supporting democratic values, including a free and open civil society and the strong rule of law” in the case of India and every partner across the board. “We regularly engage with the government of India...on our shared commitment to democratic values. We believe it’s the bedrock for the US-India relationship. And it’s actually in keeping...with India’s own democratic values, its pluralistic values, and its history of tolerance,” he said. The US-India comprehensive global strategic partnership is broad and multifaceted, and the US will continue engaging at the “highest levels of our government to deepen cooperation on many fronts, and we are confident that the strong and upward trajectory of our partnership will, in fact, continue”, Price added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-by-china-s-attempts-to-intimidate-neighbours-we-stand-by-partners-us-101612942862199.html
10-02-2021||World||Democrats attempt to push through school funding, wage increase||House Democrats muscled past Republicans on portions of President Joe Biden's pandemic plan, including a proposed $130 billion in additional relief to help the nation's schools reopen and a gradual increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.Democrats on the Education and Labor Committee say schools won't be able to reopen safely until they get an infusion of federal funding to repair building ventilation systems, buy protective equipment and take other steps recommended by federal health officials. The plan faces opposition from Republicans who want to tie new school funding to reopening.The panel met Tuesday to craft its portion of a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package that tracks with Biden's plan for battling the pandemic and reviving a still staggering economy. Democrats hope to rush the bill to Biden for his signature by mid-March, using a special budget-related process allowing certain legislation to be approved by a simple majority.Rep. Bobby Scott, chair of the Education and Labor Committee, dismissed complaints from Republicans who objected to use of the process.“We must address the urgent needs of the people now," said Scott, D-Va., “The multiple crises affecting our communities will grow worse every day if we do not act. We must recognize that we cannot afford to prioritize process over the urgent needs of people across this country.”House Republicans attempted dozens of changes to the legislation at a hearing that stretched late into the evening. They proposed amendments to limit funding only to schools offering in-person instruction, or to steer aid to families if their schools continued operating online. On the wage increase, they sought to exempt small businesses or certain rural areas. It appeared all of the amendments would be defeated.Biden has made reopening most of the nation's K-8 schools within his first 100 days in office a key goal. The issue has become increasingly heated as some school districts face gridlock with teachers who have refused to support reopening until their demands are met. Biden's plan for $130 billion in school funding is in addition to more than $8 billion from previous relief packages.In a tweak to Biden's plan, the Democratic proposal would require schools to reserve at least 20% of the funding for efforts to address learning loss, including after-school programs and summer classes. The bill also matches Biden's proposed $40 billion for colleges and universities but, unlike the White House plan, makes private colleges eligible for relief.Democrats also tucked in a new limit on for-profit colleges that the party has pushed for years. The proposal would prevent for-profit colleges from accepting more than 90% of their overall funding from federal sources. An existing federal law includes that cap for some federal sources but excludes funding from the GI Bill and other veterans programs.Republicans blasted the legislation in its entirety, saying schools have already received billions in aid and are safe to reopen. They cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that social distancing and wearing a mask significantly reduce the spread of the virus in school settings.“Students are falling behind, and mental health issues are on the rise. We know the costs of keeping schools closed are high. So why are schools still closed?” said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Education and Labor Committee. “Unfortunately, this bill is full of partisan policies disguised as COVID relief measures.”The lawmakers' dispute reflected the complexities and frustrations of the national debate over reopening schools. Republicans proposed several variations of the same idea: to limit funding to schools that don't reopen. Rep. Gregory Murphy, R-N.C., sought to block funding from schools unless they bring at least high-needs students back to the classroom.“We need to stop the excuses," Murphy said. "We need to stop all the nonsense. We need to get our kids back in school. Stop ruining their futures and stop playing games.”Scott countered that schools can't make changes needed to reopen safely unless they get the funding in Biden's plan.Republicans also signaled a fight over standardized testing, backing a proposed change to prevent relief funding from being used on academic assessments. Republicans say states should be exempt from federally required tests this spring because of the pandemic, while some Democrats say it's necessary to identify and help students who have fallen behind.The $350 billion portion of the bill before the committee also includes Biden's plan to raise the minimum wage from $7.25, where is has been since 2009. The proposal calls for gradual increases that would reach $15 over five years. It faces an uphill climb, however, and even Biden has said it likely won’t survive.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that Democrats were trying to overcome a potential procedural obstacle that could prevent them from including the wage increase in the COVID-19 relief bill.“We’re trying to work as well as we can with the parliamentarian to get minimum wage to happen,” Schumer said.Under Senate rules, provisions cannot be included in the special procedure Democrats are using if the language’s impact on the budget is only secondary to its main thrust. It is up to the chamber’s nonpartisan parliamentarian to determine that, though it would be possible for Democrats to vote to ignore that ruling. The fast-track process Democrats are using would let them prevent a GOP filibuster.The minimum wage boost faces other significant challenges, including opposition from Republicans and a wariness by some Democrats arguing it would hurt small businesses, especially during a pandemic.Also on Tuesday, Biden met with five business leaders, including the heads of JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Gap, Lowe’s and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Biden said the meeting was a chance to find common ground with the business community.“We’re going to talk about the state of the economy, the recovery package. We’re going talk a little bit, God willing, about infrastructure down the road, and also about the minimum wage,” Biden said at the start of the meeting.The president said he has been “exchanging correspondence and telephone calls with Republicans to see if we can follow up beyond where we are with members of House and Senate,” even as Congress is moving forward with a budgetary process that will enable them to pass the relief package along party lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-attempt-to-push-through-school-funding-wage-increase-101612939404638.html
10-02-2021||World||Joe Biden to visit a Pentagon hoping to shift from Trump 'turmoil'||President Joe Biden is making his first visit to the Pentagon as commander in chief, taking stock of a military as it pivots from the turmoil of the Trump years and focuses to an unusual degree on domestic and internal issues.Biden planned to meet Wednesday afternoon with senior civilian and military leaders and address the Pentagon workforce.As defense leaders await direction from Biden on possible new approaches to overseas security threats, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is treating the coronavirus pandemic as a top priority and ordering fresh assessments of how to root out sexual assault and extremism in the military's ranks.Austin himself is in the spotlight after winning Senate confirmation as only the third recently retired military officer to lead the Pentagon. Critics have questioned whether his appointment, which required a congressional waiver, weakens the principle of civilian control of the military.Austin moved quickly to surround himself with a core of civilian assistants, including Kelly Magsamen, a defense policy expert and former Pentagon official who is now his chief of staff. The deputy defense secretary is Kathleen Hicks, a policy expert and the first woman to win Senate confirmation for that position.Austin spent 41 years in the Army, retiring in 2016 as a four-star general after heading US Central Command. During Biden's years as vice president in the Obama administration, he worked with Austin on winding down U.S. involvement in Iraq, where Austin was the top commander in 2010-11.During the Trump administration, the Pentagon endured a loss of top-flight civilian talent, in part because of instability at the top. Trump had two Senate-confirmed defense secretaries, as well as three secretaries who held the role in an acting capacity. Morale suffered and some senior positions went unfilled.Biden had considered choosing Michele Flournoy to lead the Pentagon; she would have been the first woman in that job. Instead he picked Austin, who is the first Black defense secretary and in Biden's view is the right person at a time of evolving security threats and continuing risk from the coronavirus.On his first day in office, Austin issued a message to the force that emphasized his commitment to finding ways the military can help the government move “further and faster” to fight the pandemic. Already there are more than 24,000 National Guard members providing logistical support for the vaccine program and giving as many as 50,000 shots per day.Last week, the Pentagon announced it will deploy more than 1,100 troops to five vaccination centers at the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This marks the first wave of increased military support for the national vaccination campaign. The military is preparing to deploy the first team of about 222 service members to a vaccination center in California, and it says it is ready to deploy four similar teams to other centers when FEMA is ready. FEMA has asked the Pentagon to supply as many as 10,000 troops to staff 100 centers, but Austin is approving the teams incrementally as the locations are identified.Austin also is pushing for policy adjustments to account for the effects of climate change on military missions, as well as the consequences of extreme weather events on domestic military bases.Austin is preparing to address other Biden priorities, including an assessment of how to deal with the national security challenges posed by China's modernized and more assertive military. He has said he intends to visit the Asia-Pacific region as early in his tenure as possible.The Pentagon is participating in an administration assessment of the peace deal the Trump administration struck with the Taliban one year ago. The deal requires the United States to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by May, a deadline the Biden administration is reassessing.Austin also is launching a broad review of how US forces are positioned around the world. In announcing his “global force posture review” last week, he said it will assess the military “footprint, resources, strategy and missions.”On the home front, Austin has inherited the aftereffects of the Jan. 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill. On Inauguration Day, there were about 26,000 National Guard troops in Washington providing security, though the number as of Tuesday had dropped to 6,200. The number is expected to drop to about 5,000 by the end of the month, with the remainder gone by mid-March.In addition to his ordered reviews of sexual assault programs and extremism in the ranks, Austin has launched a review of all defense advisory panels as part of a move to purge several dozen people who were last-minute appointments in the final weeks of the Trump administration.

10-02-2021||World||Covid-19: Vital to learn as much about the earliest outbreak days says US||It is imperative that the world learns as much as possible about the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic so that the world can understand its origins and prevent future biological catastrophes, the US has said after international experts investigating the origins of the disease have dismissed as unlikely a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China.The US, which is the worst affected country from the pandemic, is looking forward to receiving the report and the data from the investigation by the World Health Organisation's (WHO) team of experts into the origins of the Covid-19 in China's Wuhan city.The WHO experts arrived in China last month for the long-awaited probe into the origins of the deadly coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the team dismissed that the virus could have leaked from a Chinese lab, a theory strongly supported by former US president Donald Trump.The team members said that the deadly virus was most likely to have transmitted from an animal to humans.“Broadly speaking, we have expressed our concerns regarding the need for full transparency and access from China and the WHO to all information regarding the earliest days of the pandemic," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Tuesday at his daily news conference.Also read| Joe Biden withdraws US policy to track Chinese influence in American schools"It's imperative that the world learns as much as possible about the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic so that we can understand its origins and so, importantly, we can prevent future biological catastrophes,” Price said.“I think the jury is still out. Clearly, the Chinese, at least heretofore, had not offered the requisite transparency that we need and that just as importantly, again, the international community needs so that we can prevent these sorts of pandemics from ever happening again. This goes back to one of the very first actions that President (Joe) Biden took as president when he re-engaged with the WHO,” Price said.China reported the first Covid-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and since then the disease has snowballed into a pandemic, affecting 106,880,652 people with 2,339,991 deaths worldwide.According to Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the US alone has reported 27,189,188 cases and 468,103 deaths from the deadly virus.Trump had repeatedly blamed China for covering up and not sharing information about the virus with the world, leading to a strain in relation between the two countries.Also read| US closely monitoring India-China border disputes: State DeptHowever, China has refuted the allegations. While denying that coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China points to reports from Italy, Spain and the US about its prevalence to predating its emergence in Wuhan.At the state department briefing, Price highlighted the importance of international cooperation in preventing future outbreaks of diseases.“We know that there needs to be international cooperation if we are going to be able to be in a position to staunch future outbreaks or epidemics before they become pandemics. The WHO is leading this investigation. We clearly support this investigation."We recognise there is an urgent need for an investigation. But I wouldn't want to be conclusive yet about any sort of cooperation that the WHO may or may not have received from China,” Price said in response to a question.The United States, he said, is supportive of the WHO investigation.Also read| Senate votes to proceed with Trump’s trial“And I think more broadly too, we can speak to our own efforts. We will work with our partners and also draw on information collected and analysed by our own intelligence community to evaluate the report once we've received it as well as the data from the WHO evaluation,” he said.Price said that rather than rush to conclusions that may be motivated by anything other than the science, the US wants to see where that data leads us, where that science leads us, and its conclusions will be predicated on that.“We are talking in this case about the origins of the coronavirus. I don't think there is any reasonable person who would argue that the coronavirus originated elsewhere, so that is why our focus is on this WHO investigation."We look forward, again, to seeing the report, to seeing the underlying data, to using what we may have within our own reach based on our own intelligence and analysis to corroborate what the WHO has found and to reach our own conclusions,” Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vital-to-learn-as-much-about-the-earliest-outbreak-days-says-us-101612933896522.html
10-02-2021||World||South Korea to approve AstraZeneca as first Covid-19 vaccine||South Korea on Wednesday said it would grant its first approval for a coronavirus vaccine to AstraZeneca, and will allow use in people 65 years or older, despite advisory panels' warning of a lack of data on its efficacy for the elderlyRegulators will grant AstraZeneca's vaccine emergency authorisation under the condition the company must submit its full clinical trial results, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a news conference."However, we have added a precautionary line for cautious decision for use of the shots the elderly aged 65 and older," Kim said.Several European countries have warned that the shot should only be given to those ages 18 to 64, and such concerns had threatened to upend South Korea's plan to prioritise elderly residents and medical workers in the first round of vaccinations.On Monday, authorities sought to reassure elderly residents after a panel of advisers urged caution over the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people older than 65 because of a lack of data.AstraZeneca and the chief of clinical trials for Britain's Oxford University, which co-developed the vaccine, have said it triggers a good immune response in older people.The approved doses for South Korea are produced by SK bioscience, the drugmaking arm of SK Chemicals, Kim said.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) had said vaccinations will begin on Feb. 26 with about 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, enough for 750,000 people. It will inoculate about 10 million high-risk people by July and aim to reach herd immunity by November.The ministry has asked to receive by April final clinical trial results from AstraZeneca's survey in the United States on about 30,000 people. The study includes around 7,500 elderly people, Kim said.He added that the KDCA is reviewing the efficacy of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot on new UK or South African variants, after uncertainty over protection. Oxford had said its vaccine has similar efficacy against the British coronavirus variant as it does to the previously circulating variants.The KDCA reported 444 new Covid-19 cases by Tuesday, bringing the total number of infections to 81,930, with 1,486 deaths. The daily cases rebounded above 400 ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, boosted by cluster infections mostly in near the capital Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-approve-astrazeneca-as-first-covid-19-vaccine-101612939450636.html
10-02-2021||World||Putin’s hopes for economic revival threatened by worker shortage||Vladimir Putin’s hopes of getting his economy growing again quickly are likely to be dashed by Russia’s shrinking workforce.Employers, especially in construction, are struggling to find enough people to fill jobs because coronavirus restrictions have halved the number of immigrants. Companies ranging from gold miners to builders say they’ve been forced to push up wages to attract locals.Almost half of construction companies surveyed by the national builders union said they have increased pay. MIC Group, a Moscow-based constructor, has hiked wages by as much as 15% on average and that’s helped bring in more staff, said Andrey Ryabinskiy, head of the board of directors.“It was hard enough to find qualified workers before the pandemic, but now we’re feeling it much more,” he said.The Kremlin is relying on a rapid recovery from the pandemic to quell growing discontent over falling incomes and rising consumer prices. Despite the success of its Sputnik vaccine, Russia is behind on its ambition to inoculate 60% of the population by the middle of the year.Russia has already lifted most of its coronavirus restrictions and a recent rally in oil prices should help an economic rebound kick in as soon as the second quarter, but the pace of growth could be limited without an ample supply of workers. A shrinking labor force could shave about 25 basis points off potential growth every year for the next decade, according to Bloomberg Economics.Russia usually relies on an army of laborers from other parts of the former Soviet Union to help meet the increased demand when the economy picks up, but most borders have been closed for almost a year.Migrant workers usually make up about 7% of Russia’s workforce and contribute to about 6% of gross domestic product, according to Evgeny Vinokurov, chief economist at the Eurasian Development Bank.“Construction sites are still noticing the shortage of workers, despite the fact that they increased wages,” said Anton Glushkov, president of the Nostroi, the national builders union. “This will ultimately result in an increased cost of construction.”Russia’s already shrinking workforce has also taken a hit from the third-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world last year. The population shrank by almost 700,000 people in 2020, the biggest annual slump in 15 years.Older people may choose not to reenter the workforce immediately due to increased health risks, according to Sofya Donets, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.“The pandemic has increased demand for workers in key sectors, even as restrictions limit the flow of people. In the long term, the workforce is shrinking, and that will be a more structural drag on growth once the economy recovers.”Scott Johnson, Bloomberg Economics.Migrants are in such high demand that they made more money on average than Russians in the fourth quarter of last year, according to research by Evgeni Varshaver at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. They earned on average 47,000 rubles ($630) a month, compared to 34,000 rubles for Russians.Mass vaccinations and border re-openings would help smooth out the bottleneck, but neither are expected in the coming months. Meanwhile, many Central Asian nations, which are a big source of migrant labor, don’t yet have access to any vaccine.“One of the main outcomes of the pandemic for Russia’s labor market will be a continuing decline in supply, which will keep pressure on wages,” Donets said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putins-hopes-for-economic-revival-threatened-by-worker-shortage-101612933811381.html
10-02-2021||World||Indonesian authorities to brief relatives before releasing Sriwijaya Air crash report||Indonesia's air accident investigator will brief relatives of the 62 victims of last month's Sriwijaya Air crash in Jakarta on Wednesday morning ahead of the release of a preliminary report in the afternoon, a family member told Reuters.The briefing follows one held for families on Tuesday in Pontianak, the doomed flight's destination, and comes as divers search for the missing memory unit from the plane's cockpit voice recorder.The 26-year-old Boeing Co 737-500 jet crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta, marking Indonesia's third major airline crash in just over six years and shining a spotlight on the country's poor air safety record.Rafik Alaydrus, whose wife died in the crash, said investigators on Tuesday told family members that the cause had not been determined but that various factors, including the plane's autothrottle system, were being investigated."For family of victims, we do not understand about technical issues," he said. "We responded this incident had happened and the victims should get their right compensation."Investigators quickly located and read the plane's flight data recorder (FDR) and sent parts of the plane, including the autothrottle system that controls engine power automatically, to the United States and Britain for examination.Citing sources close to the investigation, the Wall Street Journal last month reported the FDR data showed the autothrottle system was not operating properly on one of the plane's engines as it left Jakarta.Instead of shutting off the system, the FDR indicated the pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function, the WSJ said. That could create significant differences in power between engines, making the jet harder to control.National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono last week said that the WSJ report was incorrect and that more information would be provided in KNKT's preliminary report.Safety experts say most air accidents are caused by a combination of factors that can take months to establish. Under international standards, the final report is due within a year of the crash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-authorities-to-brief-relatives-before-releasing-crash-report-101612927804145.html
10-02-2021||World||China poses serious threat to Canada’s security, says Canadian spy agency chief||The head of the Canadian spy agency has publicly accused China of “pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts” that poses a “direct threat” to Canada’s “national security and sovereignty”.“It is no secret that we are most concerned about the actions by the governments of countries like Russia and China,” said David Vigneault, director of Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Vigneault made these remarks during a speech to the Centre for International Governance Innovation. The text of the speech was also released by the Canadian government.Canada and China have not been on the best of terms in recent years, especially since the arrest of Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in December 2018. While Vigneault did say that China was an important global actor and a partner for Canada on some important fronts, he outlined the cause for concern, stressing, “To be clear, the threat does not come from the Chinese people, but rather the government of China that is pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts - economic, technological, political, and military - and using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty. We all must strengthen our defences.”He said Beijing’s Operation Fox Hunt “claims to target corruption but is also believed to have been used to target and quiet dissidents to the regime”.Vigneault went on to add that “these activities are different from the norms of diplomatic activity because they cross the line by attempting to undermine our democratic processes or threaten our citizens in a covert and clandestine manner”.The CSIS chief also said that hostile state actors seek to leverage all elements of state power to advance their interests, and “this has accelerated” during the Covid-19 pandemic.He said that while traditionally spies worked to gather Canada’s military, diplomatic and political secrets, “adversaries are more focused on intellectual property and advanced research”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-poses-serious-threat-to-canada-s-security-warns-canadian-spy-agency-chief-101612938961970.html
10-02-2021||World||As Trump trial opens, Democrat recalls daughter's fear during riot||The leader of the Democratic team prosecuting Donald Trump's impeachment trial welled up in tears on Tuesday as he recalled his 24-year-old daughter and son-in-law hiding in fear in the U.S. Capitol during the rampage by the former president's supporters.U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, now in his third two-year term representing parts of Maryland and a constitutional law expert, was defending the legality of considering impeachment charges against a former president.When he invited his family to witness the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress to certify Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory, Raskin, 58, was also mourning the Dec. 31 death of his 25-year-old son.He said his daughter had asked whether they would be safe visiting on Jan. 6, after hearing of plans by thousands of Trump supporters to descend on Washington to try to stop the normally routine proceeding."I told them, of course it should be safe. This is the Capitol," Raskin said as he wrapped up his opening argument.But when the mob breached the Capitol, in a violent assault that left a Capitol Police officer and four other people dead, his daughter Tabitha and other family members were left to huddle in an office off the floor of the House of Representatives.Raskin said when he finally was reunited with his daughter and son-in-law, he apologized to them and promised things would be better on their next visit."And you know what she said? She said, 'Dad, I don't want to come back to the Capitol,'" the congressman recalled.With the Senate's 100 members pausing from their note taking and fiddling with papers on their desks, they locked onto Raskin as he spoke tearfully of his daughter's fear.At times barely able to speak, he wrapped up his opening statement to the Senate, saying, "Of all the terrible things I saw ... that one hit me the hardest. That and watching someone use an American flag pole, the flag still on it, to spear and pummel one of our police officers."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-trump-trial-opens-democrat-recalls-daughter-s-fear-during-riot-101612935560731.html
10-02-2021||World||US Senate votes to proceed with Donald Trump’s impeachment trial||The US Senate on Tuesday voted 56-44 to proceed with the impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump, rejecting his defence team’s contention that it is not constitutional to try a president after he has left office.Six Republicans joined 50 Democrats in the evenly split 100-member Senate, clearing the way for the trial to begin on Wednesday. House impeachment managers — nine Democratic members of the House of Representatives — will make their case for Trump’s conviction for inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. They have 16 hours to make their case, spanning the next two days. Trump’s defence team will follow, also for 16 hours.“Their argument is that if you commit an impeachable offence in your last few weeks in office, you do it with constitutional impunity,” Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead House manager, said while opening the arguments. He was referring to the Trump defence team’s contention that a president cannot be tried after leaving office. He said, “You get away with it. In other words, conduct that would be a high crime and misdemeanor in your first year as president, and your second year as president, and your third year as president, and for the vast majority of your fourth year as president, you can suddenly do in your last few weeks in office without facing any constitutional accountability at all.”He added, “This would create a brand new January exception to the constitution of the United States of America.”Raskin later returned during the arguments by Democrats, making an emotional appeal, “Senators, this cannot be our future. This cannot be the future of America.”Democrats also cited precedence from US and British history of senior officials impeached or tried after leaving office. William Belknap, a former US secretary of war, was impeached after leaving office in 1876, but was acquitted. Warren Hastings, the governor general of Bengal during the reign of the East India Company, faced impeachment proceedings in 1786 after leaving service, and was acquitted in a trial that went on from 1788 to 1795.Trump’s lawyers - Bruce Castor and David Schoen - condemned the January 6 violence at the Capitol, but they argued it is unconstitutional to try a president who is no longer in office. They contended that the case against Trump is based on partisan politics and also said that Democrats had been obsessed with impeaching him. “This trial will tear this country apart, perhaps like we have only seen once before in our history,” said Schoen, referring to the American civil war.Trump’s lawyers, especially Castor, were criticised for their underwhelming performance, even by Republicans. “President Trump’s team was disorganised. They did everything they could but to talk about the question at hand. And when they talked about it, they kind of glided over, almost as if they were embarrassed,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, one of six Republicans who voted to hold the trial constitutional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-votes-to-proceed-with-trump-s-trial-101612935121639.html
10-02-2021||World||Indonesia: Boeing engine-control system in focus in Sriwijaya air crash probe||The investigation into last month’s Sriwijaya Air crash in Indonesia is focusing on the engine-control system of the Boeing Co. 737-500 jet, potentially dealing another blow to the US manufacturing giant as it emerges from the global grounding of its 737 Max following two other fatal crashes.While Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee is still trying to determine the exact cause of the crash, the left engine throttle lever was trimming back the power output just before the 26-year-old jet plunged into the sea, according to a family member who attended a briefing given by the regulator in Jakarta on Tuesday.“The NTSC hasn’t reached any conclusion on the cause of the crash, but they did say that there was an uncommanded backward movement of the left throttle lever while the autopilot was in operation,” said Rafik Alaydrus, who lost his wife in the disaster.NTSC Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono and lead investigator Nurcahyo Utomo didn’t immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment. A representative for Boeing also didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The NTSC is due to issue its preliminary report on Wednesday.A person familiar with the investigation told Bloomberg News last month that a malfunctioning automatic throttle was being considered as a reason for the pilots losing control by producing more thrust in one of the two engines. The device had been having problems on previous flights, according to the person. Unequal thrust can cause a plane to roll onto its side and descend abruptly.Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 crashed into the Java Sea four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta’s main airport on Jan. 9, killing all 62 people on board. Searchers retrieved the flight-data recorder from the jet, but the memory module of the cockpit-voice recorder still hasn’t been found.The jet nosedived more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) in about 15 seconds, according to tracker Flightradar24. The NTSC had said that both engines appear to have been functioning prior to the plane hitting the water.“An auto-throttle issue shouldn’t crash the aircraft unless it is combined with several other problems or factors, because the crew could simply just switch it off,” Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said.The pilots were experienced and flying an aircraft with a relatively good safety record. Sriwijaya Air, despite being little known outside of Indonesia, has a solid history too, with no fatal crashes since its establishment in 2003.But the crash was yet another blight on Indonesia’s poor aviation safety record, with two other major tragedies in recent years. In 2014, an AirAsia jetliner carrying 162 people went down in the Java Sea, killing all on board, and then in 2018 a Lion Air crash in the same waters claimed 189 lives.The aircraft in the Lion Air crash was a Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide following another crash in Ethiopia the following March. Safety regulators are only just lifting their ban on the Max, which started flying again in countries including the US and Brazil at the end of last year. The grounding is still in place in several places, including China and Indonesia.Boeing’s 737-500 has been involved in eight hull-loss accidents -- where the aircraft isn’t repairable, according to Aviation Safety Network. The Sriwijaya Air crash was the third-deadliest involving the plane. Eighty-eight people were killed in a 2008 Aeroflot crash and another 68 died in an Asiana Airlines disaster in 1993. Investigators linked those to factors including pilot performance, training and weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-boeing-engine-control-system-in-focus-in-sriwijaya-air-crash-probe-101612934553500.html

The institute, also known as Hanban, is affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Education.Earlier, the Daily Caller had reported that many of Hanban's directors were members of the Chinese Communist Party.As per the information at RegInfo.gov, the website for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which operates under the Office of Management and Budget and the White House, the Biden administration has withdrawn from the consideration on January 26.Meanwhile, the OIRA website has not provided any other information about the move.Also, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of DHS, confirmed the withdrawal of the rule.The spokesperson did not elaborate on the reason for withdrawing the rule and declined to speculate on whether the Biden administration will re-submit it."ICE does not speculate about future pre-decisional proposed rules or policies," the spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation.In August, the Trump administration had labelled the Confucius Institutes US Center a "foreign mission" of the Chinese Communist Party.The officials too had said that the Chinese government used the Confucius Institutes as part of its propaganda and influence efforts in the US.Trump administration's, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo too had said on August 13 that the Confucius Institute was "an entity controlled by the PRC that advances Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence campaign on US campuses and K-12 classrooms."The Confucius Institute US is yet to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-withdraws-us-policy-to-track-chinese-influence-in-american-schools-101612932697599.html
10-02-2021||World||Michigan GOP leader who called Capitol riot a 'hoax,' apologises||A Republican legislative leader in Michigan apologised Tuesday after falsely claiming supporters of President Donald Trump were not involved in the deadly attack at the U.S. Capitol, having called it a "hoax."Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey made the remarks last Wednesday while meeting with leaders of the Hillsdale County GOP, according to a video posted on YouTube by a group called Reclaim Our American Republic."I said some things in a videoed conversation that are not fitting for the role I am privileged to serve," he said in a statement. "I own that. I have many flaws. Being passionate coupled with an occasional lapse in restraint of tongue are at least two of them. I regret the words I chose, and I apologize for my insensitive comments."The statement did not specify the remarks for which he was apologising.In the contentious meeting, three Republicans spoke with Shirkey at a restaurant a day before the Hillsdale County Republican Party's executive board censured him for a number of reasons, including backing a ban on the open carry of guns into the Statehouse and allegedly not doing enough to fight Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions.At one point, a participant who said he was at the Jan. 6 protest in Washington, D.C., asked Shirkey about it.Also read: Indian-American groups condemn attack on US CapitolHe responded: "That wasn't Trump people. That's been a hoax from day one. That was all prearranged."Another participant, who also said he had been in D.C., suggested that police tear-gassed "their own guards."Shirkey said: "Why wasn't there more security there? It was ridiculous. It was all staged," claiming that then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell "was part of it. ...They wanted to have a mess." He added that some Trump backers "probably got caught up in the emotion" of the mob.The siege of the Capitol stunned the world as hundreds of Trump supporters ransacked the building to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory. Five people died, including a police officer.Jon Smith, the Hillsdale County GOP's secretary, told The Associated Press that he recorded the hour-long conversation with a phone in his pocket because he was worried Shirkey would lie. It was unclear whether Shirkey knew he was being recorded.Hillsdale County is one of three south-central Michigan counties Shirkey represents in the Senate.Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, a Flint Democrat, said "it is past time to accept the facts. On Jan. 6, 2021, there was an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Republicans need to decide for themselves if they are going to hold their leaders accountable for spreading lies."Shirkey was among seven Michigan lawmakers who met with Trump at the White House after the election amid the president's extraordinary efforts to subvert the democratic process that handed the battleground state to Biden. He said he and then-House Speaker Lee Chatfield told Trump that state law did not give the Legislature a say in awarding Michigan's 16 electoral votes. Days later, the state elections board certified Biden's victory.Shirkey has faced criticism from Democrats for meeting with militia leaders last May, weeks after armed protesters had entered the Capitol to object to a coronavirus lockdown — some blocked by police while demanding entry onto the House floor, others shouting down from the Senate gallery. Shirkey, who called some demonstrators "jackasses," has said he challenged the groups to develop a "code of conduct" so they could protest safely.Some of the men who carried guns at protests against Whitmer's stay-at-home order last spring, including one at which Shirkey spoke, were later charged in a plot to kidnap her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-gop-leader-who-called-capitol-riot-a-hoax-apologises-101612929431871.html
10-02-2021||World||Key takeaways from Day 1 of Trump’s second impeachment trial||Former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial began on Tuesday with House impeachment managers and Trump’s defense team clashing over whether the Constitution allowed the Senate to hold a trial of a former president or not, ultimately deciding it could move forward. Trump is facing the charge of inciting insurrection following a January 6 speech, two weeks before leaving office, to thousands of supporters urging them to fight against his election defeat. Following the speech, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, fighting police and sending lawmakers running for safety. The first impeachment trial of Trump, in which the articles of impeachment charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, started on January 16,2020 and concluded with his acquittal on February 5. The Senate kicked off Trump's second impeachment trial with Democrats using a 13-minute video of the Capitol riot violence to build their case.Here are the key takeaways from day 1 of Trump’s second impeachment trial:Senate decided that a trial can be held to impeach a former PresidentTrump’s defense team consistently argued that a former president cannot be impeached but the impeachment managers argued that if the trial is dismissed, it would set a bad precedent for future Presidents as they could act without consequences in the last weeks of their administrations. Six Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in deciding that the Senate could proceed with the trial.Democrats showed video footage of the events of January 6In order to fortify their argument against the former President, Democrats used a 13-minute video of scenes from the January 6 assault on the Capitol. The video showed scenes of chaos and mobs of protesters violently pushing past security barricades.Senator Patrick LeahyAs the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate, Leahy became the presiding officer in the Senate’s trial of Trump after Chief Justice John Roberts who had served this role for Trump’s first impeachment trial backed out from the trial this time. Leahy was witness to the violence in Capitol Hill because of which Trump’s defense team argued unsuccessfully that he had a conflict of interest in the trial.Outcome of the trial could be similar to the first oneEven though Democrats are in the majority in the Senate, Trump could be ultimately acquitted, just like in the first trial as the Democrats need 17 Republicans to break with the former president and vote with them to have the two-thirds necessary to convict Trump. If the six Republican senators who voted with Democrats on Tuesday on the Senate’s right to hold the trial also vote to convict Trump, Democrats would still need 11 more Republican defectors to secure a conviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-takeaways-from-day-1-of-trump-s-second-impeachment-trial-101612930989763.html
10-02-2021||World||Five Republicans who said Trump's impeachment trial is constitutional||Donald Trump's impeachment trial will open on Tuesday with a debate about whether the US Constitution allows a former president to face trial after he has left office. A similar effort led by Republican Senator Rand Paul last month drew the support of 45 fellow Senate Republicans.Here's a look at the five Senate Republicans who voted that the trial was constitutional:BEN SASSEThe Nebraska senator handily won reelection in 2020 and is considered a potential contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He publicly denounced Trump's false claims of widespread electoral fraud and said there was no basis to object to Democrat Joe Biden's Nov. 3 victory.LISA MURKOWSKIMurkowski of Alaska became the first U.S. senator in 50 years to win an election with a write-in campaign in 2010 after losing in the Republican primary. She called for Trump to resign after his followers rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to disrupt the formal certification of the election by Congress.MITT ROMNEYRomney, a Utah senator and the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, has been a vocal critic of Trump. In 2020, Romney was the only Republican senator to vote for conviction during Trump's first impeachment trial.PAT TOOMEYThe Pennsylvania senator announced in October 2020 he would not be seeking re-election. He said in television interviews Trump committed "impeachable offenses" and called on him to resign after the Jan. 6 attack.SUSAN COLLINSThe Maine centrist was the only Republican senator re-elected in 2020 in a state also won by Biden. She said Trump had incited the Jan. 6 riot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-republicans-who-said-trump-s-impeachment-trial-is-constitutional-101612923427979.html

According to an official statement issued by RDIF, clinical trials will begin by the end of February. RDIF, The Gamaleya Center, AstraZeneca and R-Pharm had earlier signed a Memorandum of Intent aimed at cooperation in vaccine development, which was announced in December 2020 during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 toll below 100, here’s which states are contributing mostThe world’s first combined vaccine use will be conducted in line with clinical trials protocol registered on December 24, 2020. “The study will allow evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of the combined use of Sputnik V and the vaccine jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University,” said the statement.The research will be carried out over the course of six months in several countries with 100 volunteers recruited in each.“We need to join our international efforts and use the most advanced solutions to defeat the coronavirus. A publication in the leading peer-reviewed medical journal, The Lancet, showed Sputnik V to be 91.6% efficacious. It is only one of three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, RDIF.“We are ready to develop cooperation with other manufacturers to increase the number of affordable and effective vaccines. The partnership for the clinical study of the combination of the AZD1222 vaccine with the adenoviral vector Ad26 of the Sputnik V vaccine has become the first and very important example of such cooperation in the world,” he added.According to the vaccine developers, Sputnik V vaccine uses the unique technology of combining two different vectors based on human adenovirus, which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response compared to vaccines using the same vector for two shots.The regimen with two different adenoviral vectors for a prime and a boost immunisation helps to avoid immunity to the first vector, which is formed after the first inoculation, and thus to raise efficacy of the second inoculation and create long-term immunity. This regimen is one of the reasons why the vaccine shows efficacy of over 90%, with full protection against severe cases. The AstraZeneca vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford in conjunction with Vaccitech. It uses a replication-defective chimpanzee viral vector based on an attenuated version of the common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infection in chimpanzees, and contains genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) spike protein.“R-Pharm has been actively working with the Republic of Azerbaijan for several years, we opened a modern production facility here in 2019, later in 2020 we registered two drugs from our anti-Covid portfolio: Artlegia and Coronavir. This pilot study is vital for developing of a new approach to the prevention of Covid-19. Moreover, the leading scientific and clinical centres of Azerbaijan will be able to make their own important contribution in this direction,” said Alexey Repik, chairman, board of directors, R-Pharm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-trials-of-sputnik-v-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-combination-to-begin-soon-101612929901062.html

Conviction requires a two-thirds majority, which means at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with all Democrats in the 50-50 chamber.Only six Republicans on Tuesday voted in favor of the constitutionality of the Senate process. While that was enough for the simple majority required to proceed with the trial, it suggests that most GOP senators don’t want to vote against Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/matter-of-conscience-senate-minority-leader-on-final-vote-in-trump-trial-101612926618715.html
10-02-2021||World||Single dose of Pfizer vaccine shot gives two-thirds protection, data suggests||One dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offers two-thirds protection against coronavirus, data seen by the U.K. government suggests.Early findings from the U.K.’s vaccination program, due to be released within days, show that the first dose reduced the symptomatic infection risk among patients by 65% in younger adults and 64% in over-80s, a person familiar with the matter said.The data, first reported by The Sun newspaper, showed that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine saw protection rise to between 79% and 84%, depending on age. The AstraZeneca vaccine offers similar protection, the newspaper said.While efficacy results are lower than those found in Pfizer’s clinical trials, Boris Johnson’s government is likely to hail the U.K.’s first real-world data as a significant boost to its efforts to immunize the population. A successful mass vaccine rollout is key to the government’s hopes of reopening the economy after months of lockdown.More than 12.6 million people in the U.K. have so far received their first doses of either the Pfizer shot or the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to latest data published Tuesday. That includes more than 90% of the over-80s.Johnson has set a target to immunize almost 15 million people by Feb. 15, focusing on the most vulnerable groups and their carers. After that, his team will consider when and how to begin lifting the U.K.’s third national lockdown, which has been in place for the past month and has compounded the economic damage already done by the country’s deepest recession in more than 300 years.From March 8, schools could begin to reopen, followed by the easing of other curbs. But while the U.K.’s vaccine rollout is one of the most advanced in the world, the one big doubt is whether the shots will remain effective against new strains of coronavirus.This week Johnson led efforts to reassure the public that vaccines will still work to prevent the most severe illness and death from the South Africa variant. Some scientists are concerned that the strain is far more widespread in the U.K. and could derail the plan to lift restrictions.Data from the real world rollout of the U.K.’s two vaccines will be critical in determining how fast the government can begin to ease the lockdown.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the early results were “quite amazing” and he believed gradual lifting of the curbs would be possible, starting with schools from early March.“If these numbers are borne out, then they are very reassuring,” Hunter told The Sun. “If they are achieving 65% protection after three weeks with both jabs, then I think that’s really good.”The government has deployed more surge testing of the population in parts of Lambeth, south London, in an attempt to trace and contain the new strain found there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/single-dose-of-pfizer-vaccine-shot-gives-two-thirds-protection-data-suggests-101612919939677.html
10-02-2021||World||GOP senator Cassidy flips on impeachment trial, rips Trump lawyers||Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana joined Democrats in voting against ending Donald Trump's impeachment trial Tuesday, a surprise reversal that Cassidy said was a response to the former president's lawyers doing “a terrible job” of arguing their case.Cassidy was among six Republican senators who sided with Democrats on the question of whether a former president can be tried after leaving office. The Louisiana senator's position was a switch from January, when he voted to end the proceedings on the grounds that they were unconstitutional.The vote drew swift criticism from Republicans in the senator's deeply conservative state. But Cassidy said Trump's attorneys didn't make their case. While the Democrats' impeachment managers were “focused, they were organized,” relying on precedent and legal scholars, Trump's team “was disorganized, random, had nothing," he said."They talked about many things, but they didn't talk about the issue at hand," Cassidy said after the vote.Still, the senator said his decision to move ahead with the trial shouldn't be taken as a sign he will later vote to convict the former president. In recent calls with reporters, including one Tuesday morning, Cassidy has refused to say whether he believes Trump committed an impeachable offense.“I have not yet decided on how I will vote,” he said.Trump is the first president to face impeachment charges after leaving office. The House accused him of inciting an insurrection for his role in the Jan 6. siege on the U.S. Capitol. Hundreds of rioters ransacked the building to try to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory, a domestic attack on the nation’s seat of government unlike any in its history. Five people died.The Republican Party of Louisiana quickly issued a statement Tuesday criticizing Cassidy for his vote and praising Louisiana's junior GOP senator, John Kennedy, for voting against moving ahead with the impeachment trial. The Louisiana GOP said it was “profoundly disappointed” by Cassidy's vote.“We feel that an impeachment trial of a private citizen is not only an unconstitutional act, but also an attack on the very foundation of American democracy, which will have far reaching and unforeseen consequences for our republic,” the party's statement said.Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana said he was “surprised” by Cassidy’s vote and suggested it was causing a stir in their ruby red state.“I have not spoken to him, but I can tell you a lot of people from back home are calling me about it right now," Johnson said.Cassidy won reelection this fall to a six-year term, giving him some time to make amends with his party. But he's already received criticism for accepting the Electoral College vote for Biden and for acknowledging the Democratic president's victory weeks ahead of many of his colleagues.A local Republican women's club sent Cassidy a letter in December telling him they felt “betrayed” after he declared Biden had won the presidential election.Kennedy, who is up for reelection next year, has issued statements panning the impeachment trial as unconstitutional and calling it "a thinly veiled effort by the uber-elites in our country, who look down on most Americans, to denigrate further those people who chose to vote for President Trump and not vote for President Biden.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-senator-cassidy-flips-on-impeachment-trial-rips-trump-lawyers-101612917655751.html
10-02-2021||World||For Hong Kongers, Canada is beaten path out of China’s grip||A second generation of Hong Kongers is heading to Canada for refuge from political uncertainty, but unlike their parents in the 1980s and 1990s, this time seems for good.Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto are a magnet for those looking to escape as China tightens its grip on the territory of 7.5 million people. Some 300,000 already have Canadian citizenship after many families initially moved there ahead of Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Back then, many families separated, with one parent staying in Hong Kong for work, usually fathers who were dubbed "astronauts" as they soared through the sky on visits. Among those who went to Canada, many eventually returned, lured by the booming economy and what still seemed to be a relatively free environment.Things have changed.With recent pro-democracy protests virtually snuffed out and Beijing enshrining control last year via a national security law, bags are being packed once more."Staying in Hong Kong is not an option anymore," said Maria Law, 39, who moved to Vancouver last year with her two girls ahead of her husband. "I'd rather have a free future for my daughters instead of making money while they have to keep their mouths shut."For Law, a former flight attendant, history has repeated itself.She is part of a rare cohort of double political emigres.Taken to Vancouver when she was 12, Law remembers daily speakerphone calls from the living room with her father, who was earning the family bread as a hotel chef back in Hong Kong.Enthusiasm for the calls waned as it became clear he was staying. Yet like many such "satellite" children, separated from one or both parents, Law eventually followed in her father's footsteps to return to Hong Kong herself for work in 2004."When I was young, I asked my father why I had to move. But now I am in his position, I understand," she said. "He sacrificed more than we did. He's the one who had to be alone."LEARNING FROM MISTAKESThanks to Canada's liberal immigration system, 335,646 Hong Kongers moved there between 1984 when Britain's handover was declared and 1997, according to the Canadian International Council think tank. That was most of the half-million exodus.This time, Britain may take most Hong Kongers as it offers visas to potentially 300,000 people.The flow to Canada may also be large, with existing Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong from the first wave and new immigration pathways for the younger generation.A Hong Kong government spokesman said concerns about erosion of freedoms were "totally unsubstantiated" and that the security law had stopped chaos. "People's decisions to remain in or leave Hong Kong, or anywhere for that matter, are based on many factors including job situation, schooling, business and investment opportunities or personal/family reasons," he added.China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's top representative body, did not respond to requests for comment.The scars of the first uprooting are informing the second."I'm not going to make the same mistakes as my parents, like having a satellite family," said Tsang, a 36-year-old legal compliance officer who did not want to give her first name because she was yet to resign from work in Hong Kong.Her parents' marriage did not survive separation, but Tsang hopes to do better. Her daughter and husband move to Vancouver this month and she is to join them after selling their home.In Law's case, she is eagerly waiting for her husband, for whom it is a wrench to leave his wider family and career as a university IT officer, to rejoin the family in Vancouver.In October, she gave him the sponsorship paperwork and urged him not to miss their girls' growing up. To her relief, he returned the forms on Jan. 1. While he waits to travel, he watches his younger daughter's growth spurt via a screen and waits for both girls to say hello before he sleeps.It is hard to track exactly how many Hong Kongers are moving to Canada as so many can travel freely between the two.New visa applications from Hong Kong rose more than 20% to 10,819 in 2020, Canadian immigration says.The Hong Kong government did not have data, but the Security Bureau estimated 7,000 people may have emigrated in 2019, 1,300 to Canada. However, that methodology is based only on applications for documents showing no criminal records, which many departing Hong Kongers do not in fact request.BUNS AND NEWSPAPERS FROM HOMESocial media posts about paperwork, schools, real estate and jobs abound for Hong Kongers returning to Canada.One frequently-asked-questions group by the "Return Vancouver" Facebook page has 5,800 members.Miu Chung Yan, a University of British Columbia professor of social work, and himself from Hong Kong, said those returning to Canada were often giving up better-paying jobs at home but had long known they would return for children's education or retirement.Violent scenes of blazing streets and protesters clashing with police in 2019, plus China's subsequent response, hastened their decision-making.Pre-handover immigrants created ethnic enclaves with strip malls featuring Hong Kong-style cafes, Cantonese-speaking dentists and Chinese supermarkets.In Richmond, a Vancouver suburb, 21.9% of residents counted Cantonese as their first language, followed by 20% for Mandarin, the main language in the rest of China, in a 2016 census.In Markham, just north of Toronto, the vast Pacific Mall shares the same name as Hong Kong's centrally-located Pacific Place shopping centre.Pacific Mall's corridors bear the names of major arteries in Hong Kong, such as Hollywood Road or Hennessy Road.In nearby plazas, those nostalgic for Hong Kong fare can pick up warm pineapple buns with a cold slab of butter and Chinese-language newspapers Sing Tao and Ming Pao.Jason, who plans to move back to Canada with his wife and nine-year-old twins, acknowledges he is "a little bit confused" about his identity.His father moved to Hong Kong during Mao Zedong's rule after four of 10 siblings starved to death in mainland China, he said. His parents sent him to high school in Canada in 1993 at 13.But in 2001, his father's construction company was struggling and he had to drop out of college to return to Hong Kong, where he later became a furniture salesman.Over the years he noticed Hong Kong transforming: the luxury flats he fitted were increasingly owned by mainland Chinese. Mandarin became the more common language with customers in the famous IFC and ICC commercial towers."It's kind of sad," said Jason, who did not give his full name as he is yet to tell his twins about leaving. "Every time I have a gathering with friends or chit-chat with colleagues, the only topic is 'where are you going to live'?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-hong-kongers-canada-is-beaten-path-out-of-china-s-grip-101612916815782.html
10-02-2021||World||Pakistan faces bleak future with rising food insecurity||Pakistan's future seems vulnerable as it grapples with lower-than-expected levels of food output and is in urgent need to import key food items including edible oil, wheat, sugar, tea and pulses.In an article in The News International, Dr Khaqan Hassan Naqeeb and Dr Yusuf Zafar write that the production of the highly-valued cotton crop has dipped to a level of a 30-year low and the productivity of the five staple crops has slipped to less than half of the world's best. Moreover, recent supply shocks have increased food prices by an average of 31 per cent in the past 29 months.According to a finding by the National Nutritional Survey 2018 conducted by Pakistan's Ministry of Health and Unicef, 36.9 percent of the country's households are food insecure. Children under five years suffering high levels of severe stunting at 40 percent and almost 30 percent of them underweight.A high population growth rate of 2.4 percent, inefficient use of water in the Indus River basin irrigation system; unfavorable climate changes; weak policies and regulations governing markets for agricultural inputs and commodities, all raise the concern of a marked increase in food insecurity, according to The News International.Naqeeb and Zafar write that though Pakistan's agriculture has benefitted from the green revolution, it has however missed on the gene revolution and is currently losing out on the precision agriculture revolution.The conditions of Pakistan's vegetables and fruit markets as well as of grain markets are in dire need of a makeover and the infestation of rodents in grain markets cannot be tolerated as a routine. The country currently suffers an irrecoverable loss of 20 to 40 per cent due to poor transportation and storage and interventions in all these areas are required to improve overall productivity.Furthermore, The News International reported that with a low per capita income of USD 1,497, rising prices and high poverty concentrated in rural areas have made Pakistan struggle with issues of under-nourishment and lack of micronutrients. Limited technological innovation in farming, weak research, trade restrictions and low quality of inputs is also less than desirable.The plight of the agriculture sector had led to insufficient availability of local production of food items and the impact of rising domestic demand. Shortages can have serious repercussions for the country's fiscal and external payments. Pressures will surmount with increasing global food prices, making the laudable objective of food security more distant, wrote the Pakistani daily.Saying that Pakistan cannot afford an unsteady agriculture pulse, Naqeeb and Zafar argue that a radically successful reform effort can lift agricultural productivity, create market efficiency and increase farm incomes.A reconsidered focus on investment and reform of governance especially in agriculture research and regulatory public-sector bodies is also required with the involvement of all the provinces.

10-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta cracks down on crowds defying protest ban||Police cracked down on demonstrators opposing Myanmar’s military coup, firing warning shots and shooting water cannons to disperse crowds that took to the streets again Tuesday in defiance of new protest bans.Reports of many injured demonstrators drew strong concern from the U.N.'s office in Myanmar.“According to reports from Nay Pyi Taw, Mandalay and other cities, numerous demonstrators have been injured, some of them seriously, by security forces in connection with the current protests across the country,” the U.N. said.“The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable,” said Ola Almgren, the U.N. resident coordinator in Myanmar.Water cannons were used in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-biggest city, where witnesses said at least two warning shots were fired in early attempts to break up the crowd. Gunfire could be heard on videos from the city, some of which showed riot police flailing wildly with their batons at people trying to flee. Reports on social media said police arrested more than two dozen people there.Police also used water cannons in the capital, Natpyitaw, for a second day and fired shots into the air. Police were reported to have also shot rubber bullets at the crowd in Naypyitaw, wounding several people. Photos on social media showed an alleged shooter — an officer with a short-barreled gun — and several injured people. Protesters posted photos online of bullet casings they said they found at the scene.Unconfirmed social media reports circulated of shootings with live rounds and deaths among the protesters, with the potential of sparking violent retaliation against the authorities — an outcome proponents of the country’s civil disobedience movement have warned against. The AP was unable to immediately confirm the reports.The weekly magazine 7Day News reported on its Twitter account that a 19-year-old woman was shot by police in Naypyidaw and was undergoing emergency surgery at the city's main hospital. It cited Min Thu, the local chairman of the National League for Democracy party of ousted national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Security forces on Tuesday night raided the NLD’s national office in Yangon, following raids of regional party offices last week that the party called illegal.The protesters are demanding that power be restored to the deposed civilian government and are seeking freedom for Suu Kyi and other governing party members detained since the military took over and blocked the new session of Parliament from convening on Feb. 1.The growing defiance is striking in a country where past demonstrations have been met with deadly force and are a reminder of previous movements in the Southeast Asian country’s long and bloody struggle for democracy. The military used deadly force to quash a massive 1988 uprising against military dictatorship and a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks.The protests were banned by decrees issued Monday night for some areas of Yangon and Mandalay that made illegal rallies and gatherings of more than five people, along with motorized processions, while also imposing a 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew. It was not clear if restrictions were imposed for other areas. Violators could be punished by up to six months in prison or a fine.Demonstrations were also held in other cities Tuesday, including Bago — where city elders negotiated with police to avoid a violent confrontation — and Dawei, and in northern Shan state.In Magwe in central Myanmar, where water cannons were also used, unconfirmed reports on social media said several police officers had crossed over to join the protesters’ ranks. Police in Naypyitaw and Pathein, west of Yangon, were also said to have switched sides. The AP was unable to immediately confirm the reports.Crowds also gathered in Yangon, the country’s biggest city where thousands of people have been demonstrating since Saturday, despite a heightened security presence. No violence was reported.Police, not soldiers, appeared to have been deployed to stop the demonstrations, a small indicator of restraint by the military government. The army has a record of brutality in crushing past revolts as well as in fighting ethnic minorities in border areas seeking self-determination. It also has been accused of carrying out genocide in its 2017 counterinsurgency campaign that drove more than 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority across the border to seek safety in Bangladesh.State media for the first time on Monday referred to the protests, saying they were endangering the country’s stability.“Democracy can be destroyed if there is no discipline,” declared a statement from the Ministry of Information read on state television station MRTV. “We will have to take legal actions to prevent acts that are violating state stability, public safety and the rule of law.”However, the military commander who led the coup and is now Myanmar’s leader made no mention of the unrest in a 20-minute televised speech Monday night, his first to the public since the takeover.Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing instead repeated claims about voting fraud that have been the justification for the military’s takeover, allegations that were refuted by the state election commission. He added that his junta would hold new elections as promised in a year and hand over power to the winners, and explained the junta’s intended policies for COVID-19 control and the economy.The general's remarks, which included encouragement for foreign investors, did nothing to assuage concern in the international community.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. condemned violence against the protesters and reiterated the U.S.'s earlier calls for the military to restore power to the elected government. “The international community is attempting every avenue to ensure that democracy and civilian leadership is restored in Burma," Price said in Washington, using Myanmar's former name.The U.N.’s Human Rights Council, based in Geneva, will meet Friday to consider the human rights implications of the crisis. Britain and the European Union spearheaded the request for the special session, which will amount to a high-profile public debate among diplomats over Myanmar and could lead to a resolution airing concerns or recommendations of international action.New Zealand suspended all military and high-level political contact with Myanmar, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced Tuesday in Wellington, adding that any New Zealand aid should not go to or benefit Myanmar’s military government.“We do not recognize the legitimacy of the military-led government and we call on the military to immediately release all detained political leaders and restore civilian rule,” Mahuta said. New Zealand was also placing a travel ban on the military leaders.——-Associated Press writers Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-cracks-down-on-crowds-defying-protest-ban-101612922208004.html
10-02-2021||World||Trump 'absent' from second impeachment but his team is speaking||Donald Trump isn’t attending his unprecedented second impeachment trial and is banned from tweeting, but his team is making sure Republicans feel his presence.The former president was in his private quarters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as the proceedings unfolded on television, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, his allies were actively tweeting and re-tweeting posts in Trump’s all-caps, exclamation-pointed style from multiple accounts, defending him as Democratic House managers laid out their case on the first day of his trial in the Senate.Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows was in the U.S. Capitol, meeting with the defense team and letting Republican senators see him there on behalf of Trump.Meadows told reporters he was there to meet with Trump’s impeachment team, and that those meetings would continue “sporadically.”Asked if he’d spoken to Trump, Meadows said he hadn’t in the hours since the trial started Tuesday but, “I speak to him on a regular basis, yes.”Trump’s office also issued a statement with “key points” and a “Q and A” after the Senate voted 56-44 that the trial was constitutional with six Republicans siding with Democrats. It slammed the proceedings as “political vengeance” against the former president, and reaffirmed that he wouldn’t testify or participate in what he called a “unconstitutional sham hearing.”“This is ‘cancel culture’ on a constitutional level,” Trump’s office said in the statement.What to Know About Trump’s Second Impeachment Trial: QuickTakeThe Senate is trying Trump on a charge of incitement to insurrection. Democrats said he encouraged his supporters to help him overturn the results of his Nov. 3 election loss to Joe Biden, culminating in a mob of his supporters storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress was counting Electoral College votes. The violent assault left five people dead.Trump’s team argued that the trial is unconstitutional because he is out of office, but also that he didn’t incite the riot and spoke under protection of the First Amendment.As House managers presented to the Senate their case that the trial is legitimate, Trump’s allies were tweeting in real time -- using familiar Trump phrases -- and trying to undercut the Democrats’ case.The @TrumpWarRoom account, managed by his Save America political action committee, tweeted a photo of the Senate’s presiding officer, Democrat Patrick Leahy, and said, “Imagine having a ‘trial’ where the ‘judge’ had already voted to convict the defendant? That’s what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!”Trump adviser Jason Miller also tweeted, as lead House manager Jamie Raskin argued that it was legal to try Trump even though he’s out of office, saying that “using Raskin’s argument, House Democrats could impeach George Washington.”These overt acts of support weren’t just for solidarity. The trial is firing up his political base and an acquittal -- which will happen unless 17 Republican senators join 50 Democrats in voting to convict -- would leave him free to run for office again. Trump would be able to argue that he was vindicated after another Democratic “witch hunt,” as he has described previous attempts to remove him.It comes as two wings of the Republican Party are grappling for supremacy -- those loyal to Trump and those such as Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, who voted to impeach him, who want to move on from Trump.Representative Jim Jordan, a Ohio Republican and staunch Trump ally, went on Fox Business Network right before the trial started and said Democrats impeached Trump because they fear facing him in 2024.“I think he would win -- will win again in 2024,” Jordan said. “I think it’d be good for the nation if he did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-absent-from-second-impeachment-but-his-team-is-speaking-101612923796736.html

About 135 staff and 48 residents who were in the hotel between Jan. 7 and Feb. 9 will need to enter a 14-day quarantine, while two schools located in the suburb that’s recorded seven new exposure sites have closed as a precaution.Also Read | Quarantine worker at Melbourne hotel tests positive for Covid-19The closing comes after a hotel quarantine worker became infected with the virus, and another person who was quarantined in the Holiday Inn tested positive after leaving there three days ago.Melbourne, which is currently hosting the Australian Open Grand Slam tennis tournament, last year endured one of the world’s strictest and longest lockdowns, which confined the city’s 5 million residents to their homes for more than three months.Australia, which has recorded fewer than 29,000 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, has come close to eliminating community transmission of the virus through the hotel quarantine system for all international arrivals, vigilant contact tracing methods, and promoting high testing rates.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne that while his state had improved its hotel quarantine system since breaches triggered last year’s three-month lockdown, hyper infectious strains of the virus being imported from overseas were proving very difficult to contain.“This is a wicked enemy, made more challenging by the fact that it is changing, it is a moving target, and that really does cause significant concern for all of us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-hotel-being-used-for-quarantine-shut-as-new-covid-19-cases-emerge-101612923194726.html
10-02-2021||World||US senators revive bill to make refugee status easier for Hong Kong protesters||A bipartisan group of senior US senators reintroduced a bill on Tuesday to make it easier for people from Hong Kong fearing persecution after joining protests against China to obtain US refugee status.The 12 senators, led by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bob Menendez, said the bill was a response to a draconian national security law introduced by China in Hong Kong last year that was the focus of mass street protests.The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act would make "Hong Kongers who participated peacefully in the protest movement and have a well-founded fear of persecution" eligible for processing as refugees in Hong Kong or a third country.Refugees from Hong Kong would not be subject to a numerical limitation, a statement from the senators said.The proposed law would also make it easier for dissidents to seek asylum by waiving provisions that make suspected intent to immigrate or a criminal record disqualifying factors for non-immigrant visas.Additionally, it would make Hong Kongers who have their residency revoked eligible for refugee status as victims of political persecution."The U.S. must do all it can to assist those Hong Kongers who have courageously stood up to defend the city they love from the CCP’s persecution and open our doors to them," Rubio said.Menendez said the aim was "to reiterate to the Chinese Communist Party that the United States stands foursquare with the people of Hong Kong" and to show they would not "fall through the cracks of our broken immigration system... ."The bill was reintroduced because a previous version expired when a new Senate was seated last month.The new Biden administration's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said the United States should accept people fleeing the Hong Kong crackdown."If they're the victims of repression from Chinese authorities, we should do something to give them haven," he told NBC news late last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-revive-bill-to-make-refugee-status-easier-for-hong-kong-protesters-101612920697282.html

10-02-2021||World||El Salvador opposition proposes president's removal||Opposition lawmakers in El Salvador on Tuesday proposed starting a process that could lead to the removal of President Nayib Bukele from office just two weeks before his party is widely expected to win a majority in legislative elections.El Salvador’s historical parties from the left and right appeared poised to unite against Bukele who ran an outsider’s campaign that carried him to the presidency less than two years ago. He maintains broad popular support, but has battled against the opposition-controlled legislature at every turn.“We’re either facing a criminal or a nut; we’re facing a deranged person who is lacking the faculties to do the job,” said Deputy Ricardo Velásquez Parker, a lawmaker from the conservative Nation Republican Alliance party, or ARENA. Velásquez proposed invoking a provision in the constitution that would allow for Bukele's removal if he's found to be physically or mentally unfit.The proposal has the support of the leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, or FMLN, and the Christian Democrat Party. The proposal goes to the Legislative Assembly’s political committee, which is controlled by those parties. Eventually, the proposal would need the support of at least two-thirds of the body’s members and the unanimous support of a five-doctor panel appointed by the assembly.Also read: US cuts military aid to El Salvador amid intense lobbyingAlso read: Biden administration moves to reverse Trump's migration agreementsBukele, 39, quickly responded via Twitter, calling it an attempted coup in the run-up to national elections.“It’s incredible, but revealing, to see the self-proclaimed ‘defenders of democracy’ maintain total silence before this attempted parliamentarian coup d’etat, just days before a democratic election in which all of the polls say they will lose 80% of their seats,” Bukele wrote.Bukele’s electoral victory broke a three decade-long hold on power by ARENA and the FMLN. Both have suffered high-profile corruption scandals and the public was primed for the young Bukele, who had come up in the FMLN but cast himself as an outsider ready to speak directly to the people.The upcoming elections were the first chance for Bukele’s supporters to give him the legislative support he had been lacking.Bukele has faced criticism inside and outside El Salvador for not respecting democratic institutions, including the Legislative Assembly — he sent heavily armed troops to surround it a year ago during a clash over security funding — and the Supreme Court, which has repeatedly shot down his executive actions during the pandemic.He enjoyed a cozy relationship with the Trump administration, supporting some of its hardline policies on immigration. The new Biden administration has expressed a willingness to keep Bukele at arms length until it sees signs that he will keep El Salvador on a democratic path.The AP reported Monday that the Biden administration turned down a meeting request with Bukele on an unannounced trip to Washington last week. Bukele denied having sought a meeting with Biden officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/el-salvador-opposition-proposes-president-s-removal-101612918017386.html
10-02-2021||World||WHO rejects coronavirus lab theory, saying animals likely source||A World Health Organization-led investigation in China found that the coronavirus most likely jumped to humans through an animal host or frozen wildlife products, finding that it’s “extremely unlikely” it came from a laboratory leak.No further research is needed to look into the theory about a leak, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO food-safety scientist, told reporters Tuesday at a joint briefing with China in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 first mushroomed at the end of 2019. That speculation has been promulgated by former U.S. President Donald Trump and some others.The virus could have been introduced to the Huanan wet market in Wuhan, which many of the first Covid patients were linked to, by a person who was infected or by a product that was sold there, Ben Embarek said.“Among the more interesting products were frozen wildlife animals,” he said. “Some of these species are known to be susceptible to these kinds of viruses.”The highly anticipated mission followed months of negotiation with a defensive China to facilitate and cooperate with the probe. Stung by criticism that it initially covered up the extent of the crisis, Chinese state media and officials have promoted the theory that the virus didn’t start in China, but was brought in. The WHO’s validation of a potential cold-chain transmission route is likely to bolster those efforts.Unpublished instances of SARS-CoV-2 detections that showed the virus was present outside China before Covid-19 cases emerged in Wuhan indicate studies into the virus’s origins need to be widened to other countries, Liang Wannian, a senior official at China’s National Health Commission, told the briefing.US Department of State spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. has expressed concerns regarding the need for full transparency and access from China and the WHO to all information regarding the earliest days of the pandemic, and cast doubt about Liang’s argument.China Cooperation“I don’t think there is any reasonable person who would argue that the coronavirus originated elsewhere,” he told reporters in Washington Tuesday. “We clearly support this investigation. We recognize there is an urgent need for an investigation. But I wouldn’t want to be conclusive yet about any sort of cooperation that the WHO may or may not have received from China.”The team of investigators examined tens of thousands of patient samples from Wuhan prior to the emergence of sick people in 2019. There was no evidence of significant outbreaks in the country before December 2019, WHO officials said.“We embarked on a very detailed and profound search for other cases that may have been missed early on in 2019,” said Ben Embarek. “The conclusion was we did not find evidence of large outbreaks that could be related to cases of Covid-19 prior to December 2019 in Wuhan or elsewhere.”The panel, comprising 17 Chinese and 17 international experts, looked for clues to understand how SARS-CoV-2 -- whose closest known relative came from bats 1,000 miles away -- spread explosively in Wuhan before causing the worst contagion in more than a century. Finding the source will inform efforts to stop the virus, and other pathogens with pandemic potential, spilling over into human populations.Worldwide, Covid-19 has caused more than 106 million infections and 2.3 million deaths.Mission delegates worked in three groups that focused on the epidemiology or spread of the disease, the potential involvement of animals and the environment, and the molecular evolution of the virus.Related VirusResearchers found a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand, according to a study released Tuesday in the Nature Communications journal, another indication of how widespread such viruses are. While highly similar to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the Thai version doesn’t appear adapted to spread in humans by the same mechanism, researchers from Thailand and Singapore said in the report.Scientists still don’t understand if the virus can spread to humans after persisting in frozen conditions, and how that would occur, according to Ben Embarek. More work is needed to study that possible path and trace the source of animal products, he said.“It’s interesting to explore if a frozen wild animal that was infected could be a potential vehicle for the introduction of the virus into market environments where we know the temperature, humidity, environment could be conducive to rapid spread of the virus,” he said.The lack of a clear pathway from bats to humans had stoked speculation -- refuted by many scientists -- that the virus might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, home to a maximum bio-containment laboratory that studies bat-borne coronaviruses.Members of the WHO mission visited the lab last week and asked Shi Zhengli, who has collected and analyzed these viruses for more than a decade, about the research and the earliest known coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-rejects-coronavirus-lab-theory-saying-animals-likely-source-101612916775101.html

On his persistent refusal, the Raiwind police arrested him from his residence," Punjab PML-N President Rana Sanaullah Khan said on Monday, reported Dawn.He further added that the 'puppet' government, which had been claiming to champion the cause of farmers' rights, is now harassing the farmers' leadership through arrests.Meanwhile, a police source says the PKI president was arrested from Multan by the Raiwind police on a complaint of an overseas Pakistani, who alleged he had given ₹32 million in cash besides some machinery for an agriculture project to the farmer leader.The complainant had alleged that life threats had been hurled at him when he demanded his money back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-slams-govt-over-farmer-leader-s-arrest-in-lahore-101612916059449.html

10-02-2021||World||UK airports warn 11th hour confusion threatens quarantine plan||The UK’s latest clampdown on air travel was met with alarm by industry executives, who called the restrictions complex and said they fear a worsening struggle for survival.Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined details of new restrictions, including a hotel quarantine and multiple Covid-19 tests, coming into force from Feb. 15 in an attempt to prevent dangerous new virus strains entering the country.But key aspects of the policy’s implementation weren’t spelled out, leaving executives in the travel industry guessing.Each traveler arriving in England from 33 nations on the government’s “red list” will be forced to pay as much as 1,750 pounds ($2,410) to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. They will also be required to test negative for Covid-19 three times.More testing “adds a further barrier to viable air travel and deepens the worsening 2021 outlook for our sector,” Karen Dee, chief executive officer of the Airport Operators Association, and Tim Alderslade, who leads Airlines UK, said in a statement. “Airports and airlines are battling to survive with almost zero revenue and a huge cost base, and practically every week a further blow lands.”The government still hasn’t made it clear who will be responsible for shepherding high-risk passengers through the airport and to the quarantine hotels, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified before decisions are finalized. Airports want financial aid if they are expected to do this, and are asking for details on how these passengers will be separated from others as they make their way through the airport, the people said.Frequent ChangesThe travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus and has had to contend with sudden changes to rules as the government attempts to get a handle on the risk posed by new variants of the virus. The UK has lagged behind other countries in imposing tighter border restrictions, with countries such as Australia bringing in mandatory quarantine months ago.In their statement, the airport and airline lobbies called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to provide a road map for a return to international travel with “transparent and risk-based health criteria” for the lifting of restrictions. They also said aviation-specific financial aid is urgently needed.“U.K. aviation can be the conduit to the government’s Global Britain and leveling-up agendas, but only if we have viable and competitive sector still standing come the end of the pandemic,” they said.The government has signed contracts with 16 hotels near London’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and Birmingham in central England, to provide 4,600 rooms so far. More rooms will be booked as needed, Hancock said.Westminster is in contact with authorities in Scotland and Ireland, and measures will apply to British and Irish residents returning home from virus hot spots. “We must strengthen our defenses yet further,” Hancock said. “People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk.”Under the plans for tighter border rules:Border LoopholesWhile the travel industry decried the lack of detail in the policy, opposition politicians and others criticized ministers for taking too long to close border loopholes for travelers.The new policy will come into force almost three weeks after it was announced and the number of hotel rooms secured so far falls well short of the 28,000 reported to be the government’s target.British officials have spoken to their Australian and New Zealand counterparts for advice about how to quarantine travelers in hotels. More than 112,000 people in the UK have died from coronavirus, compared with 909 in Australia.Johnson’s government is still resisting a blanket hotel quarantine policy in an effort to minimize disruption to vital supplies and essential travel.In Parliament, Mark Harper, a Conservative former minister, urged Hancock to spell out when the rules will be lifted. Hancock replied that the rules will be replaced “over time” once the population has been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-airports-warn-11th-hour-confusion-threatens-quarantine-plan-101612916329892.html
10-02-2021||World||Attorneys challenge Weinstein company's bankruptcy plan approval||Four women who have accused disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct are appealing a Delaware judge’s approval of the Weinstein Co.’s bankruptcy plan.Attorneys filed the appeal in U.S. District Court in Delaware on Tuesday on behalf of producer Alexandra Canosa and actresses Wedil David and Dominique Huett, who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault, and a former Weinstein Co. employee who claims she was subjected to a hostile work environment.They also filed an emergency motion in bankruptcy court asking that the judge stay implementation of her plan confirmation order pending the appeal.The reorganization plan would provide about $35 million for creditors. That’s about $11.5 million less than under a previous plan, which was scrapped after a federal judge in New York refused to approve a proposed $19 million settlement between Weinstein and some of his accusers. The settlement in that purported class-action lawsuit was a key component of the initial bankruptcy plan.Roughly half of the approved settlement, about $17 million, is allocated for a single sexual misconduct claims fund, down from about $25.7 million allocated for three separate categories of sexual misconduct claims under the previous plan. Another $8.4 million would go to a liquidation trust for resolving non-sexual misconduct claims, and $9.7 million would be used to reimburse defense costs for former company officials other than Weinstein. The plan also releases those officials from liability for tort claims related to Weinstein’s conduct.Holders of sexual misconduct claims will receive 100% of the liquidated value of their claims if they agree to release Weinstein from all legal claims. A claimant who elects not to release Weinstein but to retain the option to sue him in another court would receive 25% of the value of her bankruptcy claim.Attorneys for the objectors say the plan includes overly broad releases from liability for third parties such as insurance companies and former Weinstein Co. officers and directors. They also argue that it contains a provision that unfairly prevents non-consenting sexual misconduct claimants from pursuing their claims.Weinstein is serving a 23-year prison sentence after being convicted by a New York jury for the rape and sexual assault of two women. He also has been charged in California with rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint and sexual penetration by use of force.

10-02-2021||World||Bolder climate action could save millions of lives each year by 2040||Countries could save millions of lives annually by 2040 if they commit to bolder plans to cut planet-heating emissions and curb global warming in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, researchers said Tuesday.A study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal found policies to that end could, each year, save 5.86 million lives due to better diets, 1.18 million lives from cleaner air and 1.15 million lives through more walking and cycling by 2040.In 2015, governments set a global goal of limiting average temperature rise to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times and set emissions reduction targets as a first step to getting there.On Monday, however, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries to take bolder action ahead of November's COP26 U.N. climate conference and come up with stronger 2030 targets consistent with cutting emissions to net zero by 2050.The new research highlighted how the potential health benefits of climate action could give added impetus to countries to submit more ambitious national climate plans ahead of COP26.The nine countries modeled in the study - the United States, China, Brazil, Germany, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa and Britain - represent half of the world's population and 70% of global emissions.Six of them have yet to submit revised climate action plans, which were due in 2020 but put back by many countries as the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the climate summit for a year."Ahead of COP26, we'd like to see governments focus on health as one of the priorities in climate change policies," said lead author Ian Hamilton, executive director of The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change."There's good evidence to show that meeting the Paris Agreement commitments will be good for our health, and that these benefits accumulate to those individuals in the countries taking leadership," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.SHORT-TERM WINSUsing national and international data, the study analyzed emissions generated by the energy, agriculture and transport sectors, along with factors like national diets and lifestyles.The researchers modeled the scenarios required for each country to meet the Paris accord, including changes like adopting cleaner energy and reducing car use, as well as to achieve global development goals such as zero hunger.They found that changes towards "flexitarian" diets - with moderate amounts of animal-based foods and a high share of plant-based foods - offered the greatest health benefits as well as reducing carbon emissions.For example, many deaths would be avoided by lower rates of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and heart disease, connected to excessive consumption of carbon-intensive red meat and processed foods, and lack of access to fruit and vegetables."Why wouldn't we prioritize investments that will save more lives near-term if they give us the same amount of carbon value?" said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Changing diets is a complex challenge for governments, he noted, but potential ways to do it include subsidizing healthier foods and putting a price on the emissions produced by more carbon-intensive foods that require a lot of natural resources.Beef production, for instance, fuels greenhouse gas emissions as carbon-storing forests are cut down for pasture and cattle burp out methane.A focus on health is one way to make climate action more personal and appealing, Bernstein added, instead of being framed as a cost now that will bring benefits for future generations."We have to make this issue relevant to today, and (talk about) improving the welfare, economic opportunities and health of people in a time frame that they can get their heads around," he said.A separate study out on Tuesday found pollution from burning fossil fuels causes one in five premature deaths globally, totaling 8.7 million in 2018 and suggesting the health impacts of those emissions may be far higher than previously thought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolder-climate-action-could-save-millions-of-lives-each-year-by-2040-101612914117706.html

10-02-2021||World||Twitter sees jump in user base amid US election turmoil||Twitter said Tuesday its user base jumped to 192 million in the quarter marked by US presidential election turmoil and a battle against misinformation.Ranks of "monetizable" daily active Twitter users rose 27 percent from a year earlier during the fourth quarter, which ended just days before former president Donald Trump was booted from the service.Chief executive Jack Dorsey said the San Francisco platform remained focused on "promoting healthier conversations for those who use our service."Twitter and Facebook suspended Trump in early January over posts accused of inflaming violence in the US Capitol, as social media scrambled to respond to mayhem by supporters buying into his baseless attacks on the integrity of the election.The unprecedented sanctions came after the president took to social media to repeat his numerous false claims about fraud and other impropriety in the election he lost to Joe Biden.Twitter suspended Trump during a social media crackdown that came after Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol in a deadly siege, interrupting congressional debate over Biden's election victory.Twitter reported profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to $222 million on revenue that soared 28 percent to a record $1.29 billion."2020 was an extraordinary year for Twitter," Dorsey said."We are more proud than ever to serve the public conversation, especially in these unprecedented times."The results sparked a modest uptick in shares of Twitter, which has been working to boost advertising as it seeks to broaden its base beyond its core audience of celebrities, journalists and politicians."Twitter caps off a turbulent 2020 with a strong performance," eMarketer analyst Nazmul Islam said of the quarterly results that beat market expectations.Twitter might see user growth ebb in the current quarter due to "removal of accounts and defections from those who oppose account bans," Islam noted.He expected spending by advertisers at Twitter to remain strong nonetheless.- Apple bite? -Twitter warned that ad revenue could take a hit from changes Apple is making to the iOS software powering its mobile devices.A new Apple feature referred to as a "privacy nutrition label" tells users what tracking data is gathered by mobile apps and asks for consent via an onscreen prompt.Tracking data is used to target advertising in ways that make it more likely to get clicks, making money for platforms in the process."Assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14, we expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021," Twitter said.Financial analysts were watching to see whether the absence of Trump's attention-grabbing behavior at Twitter will take a toll on the messaging platform's use or revenue."It looks like Twitter has a solid path of profitability, but they could take a hit this quarter due to Trump and a lot of Republicans being pulled off the platform," said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group."I know the platform is a lot more pleasant now."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-sees-jump-in-user-base-amid-us-election-turmoil-101612914127673.html
10-02-2021||World||North Korea lays out paths to take with South Korea, external affairs||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the paths for his ruling Workers' Party to take with South Korea and external affairs, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.Kim called last month for more advanced nuclear weapons and said the United States was "our biggest enemy," presenting a stark challenge to U.S. President Joe Biden just days before he took office.Kim, who cemented his power at January's party congress with his election as general secretary, further discussed Pyongyang's five-year policy plan on the second day of the plenary meeting on Tuesday."The General Secretary in the report evinced the militant tasks to be carried out by the People's Army and the munitions industry this year," KCNA reported, "and the direction of future action to be taken by the sector in charge of affairs with South Korea and the sector in charge of external affairs, before underscoring the need to thoroughly carry them out without fail."While raising the issue of reshaping relations with South Korea "as required by the prevailing situation and the changed times", Kim has criticised Seoul for offering cooperation in "non-fundamental" areas such as COVID-19 aid and tourism and said it should stop buying arms from and conducting military drills with the United States.South Korea's new foreign minister said on Tuesday he was confident about coordinating North Korea policy with the United States despite earlier signs of differences.South Korean President Moon Jae-in said last month that Biden should hold talks with North Korea to build on progress that former President Donald Trump made with Kim.Kim's unprecedented personal meetings with Trump failed to lead to a breakthrough in denuclearisation talks or a loosening of sanctions.KCNA did not provide further details of the meeting, but said the meeting would continue at least until a third day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-lays-out-paths-to-take-with-south-korea-external-affairs-101612914136612.html
10-02-2021||World||Senate agrees to hear Trump impeachment case, rejecting GOP arguments||Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial opened Tuesday with graphic video showing the former president whipping up a rally crowd to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” against his reelection defeat, followed by images of the deadly attack on Congress that came soon after.In an early test of the former president's defense, Trump's team lost a crucial bid to halt the trial on constitutional grounds. Senators confirmed, 56-44, their jurisdiction over the trial, the first of a president no longer in office. While six Republican senators joined the Democrats in proceeding, the tally showed how far prosecutors have to go to win conviction, which requires a two-thirds threshold of 67 senators.Tuesday's vote was on whether a former president could be tried after leaving office.House Democrats prosecuting the case told senators they were presenting “cold, hard facts” against Trump, who is charged with inciting the mob siege of the Capitol to overturn the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.Senators sitting as jurors, many who themselves fled for safety that day, watched the jarring video of Trump supporters battling past police to storm the halls, Trump flags waving.“That's a high crime and misdemeanor,” declared Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., in opening remarks. “If that's not an impeachable offense, then there's no such thing.”Trump is the first president to face impeachment charges after leaving office and the first to be twice impeached. The Capitol siege stunned the world as hundreds of rioters ransacked the building to try to stop the certification of Biden’s victory, a domestic attack on the nation’s seat of government unlike any in its history. Five people died.Acquittal is likely, but the trial will test the nation’s attitude toward Trump's brand of presidential power, the Democrats’ resolve in pursuing him, and the loyalty of Trump’s Republican allies defending him.Trump's lawyers are insisting that he is not guilty of the sole charge of “incitement of insurrection,” his fiery words just a figure of speech as he encouraged a rally crowd to “fight like hell” for his presidency. But prosecutors say he “has no good defense” and they promise new evidence.Security remained extremely tight at the Capitol on Tuesday, a changed place after the attack, fenced off with razor wire with armed National Guard troops on patrol. The nine House managers walked across the shuttered building to prosecute the case before the Senate.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would not be watching the trial of his predecessor.“Joe Biden is the president, he’s not a pundit, he’s not going to opine on back and forth arguments,” she said.With senators gathered as the court of impeachment, sworn to deliver “impartial justice,” the trial started with debate and a vote over whether it’s constitutionally permissible to prosecute Trump after he is no longer in the White House.Trump’s defense team has focused on that question, which could resonate with Republicans eager to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.Lead lawyer Bruce Castor said that no member of the former president’s defense team would do anything but condemn the violence of the “repugnant” attack, and “in the strongest possible way denounce the rioters.”Yet Trump’s attorney appealed to the senators as “patriots first,” and encouraged them to be “cool headed” as they assess the arguments.At one pivotal point, Raskin told the personal story of bringing his family to the Capitol the day of the riot, to witness the certification of the Electoral College vote, only to have his daughter and son-in-law hiding in an office, fearing for their lives.“Senators, this cannot be our future,” Raskin said through tears. “This cannot be the future of America.”Trump attorney David Schoen turned the trial toward starkly partisan tones, the defense showing its own video of Democrats calling for the former president's impeachment.Schoen said Democrats are fueled by a “base hatred” of the former president and “seeking to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scene."It appears unlikely that the House prosecutors will call witnesses, in part because the senators were witnesses themselves. At his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump has declined a request to testify.Presidential impeachment trials have been conducted only three times before, leading to acquittals for Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and then Trump last year.Timothy Naftali, a clinical associate professor at New York University and an expert on impeachment, said in an interview, “This trial is one way of having that difficult national conversation about the difference between dissent and insurrection."The first test Tuesday was on the constitutionality of the trial, signaling attitudes in the Senate. Six Republicans joined with Democrats pursue the trial, just one more than on a similar vote last week. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana added to the ranks of Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.The House prosecutors argued there is no “January exception” for a president on his way out the door. Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., referred to the corruption case of William Belknap, a war secretary in the Grant administration, who was impeached, tried and ultimately acquitted by the Senate after leaving office.Trump's case is hardly a run of the mill corruption charge, he said, but incitement of insurrection. If Congress stands by, “it would invite future presidents to use their power without any fear of accountability.”In filings, lawyers for the former president lobbed a wide-ranging attack against the House case, suggesting Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment rights and dismissing the trial as “political theater” on the same Senate floor invaded by the mob.Because of the Covid-19 crisis, senators were allowed to spread out, including in the “marble room” just off the Senate floor, where proceedings are shown on TV, or even in the public galleries above the chamber. Most were at their desks on the opening day, however.Presiding was not the chief justice of the United States, as in previous presidential impeachment trials, but the chamber’s senior-most member of the majority party, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont.Under an agreement between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the substantive opening arguments will begin at noon Wednesday, with up to 16 hours per side for presentations. The trial is expected to continue into the weekend.Trump's second impeachment trial is expected to diverge from the lengthy, complicated affair of a year ago. In that case, Trump was charged with having privately pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, then a Democratic rival for the presidency.This time, Trump's “stop the steal” rally rhetoric and the storming of the Capitol played out for the world to see.The Democratic-led House impeached the president swiftly, one week after the attack. Five people died, including a woman shot by police inside the building and a police officer who died the next day of his injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-finds-donald-trump-s-impeachment-trial-constitutional-101612908969457.html
10-02-2021||World||Xi Jinping was testing Biden admin. The answer is 2 American aircraft carriers||Two American aircraft carriers including USS Nimitz, which was pulled out from the Persian Gulf earlier this month, conducted military exercises in the South China Sea in a clear signal to Xi Jinping’s China that President Joe Biden would continue with the Trump administration’s tough approach to Beijing.The coordinated operations, combining ships and planes of the two strike groups Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz, were carried out in a highly-trafficked area to demonstrate the US Navy's ability to operate in challenging environments, the US Pacific Fleet said in a statement on Tuesday on the exercises that angered China. Beijing described the exercises as an effort by the US “to flex its muscles”.It is more, a China watcher in New Delhi suggested, underlining that the US used deployment of its strike groups as a show of force to deter adversaries. The last time the US conducted dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea was in July 2020. That round of exercises had come after China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy conducted military drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp and worried reaction from China’s neighbours.Tuesday’s exercises came against the backdrop of multiple provocations over the past few weeks including flying nearly a dozen military aircraft including strategic bombers into the Taiwan Strait last month. Last week, Beijing responded aggressively to the presence of USS John S. McCain, claiming that it was able to drive away the US guided-missile destroyer from near Paracel island in the South China Sea region.The China watcher cited above said that the US Navy deployed elements from three strike forces - USS John S. McCain had teamed up with USS Ronald Raegan last October - was indicative of the importance that the US was laying on its messaging to Beijing. Biden hasn't spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping yet.The news of the exercises by the supercarriers in China’s neighbourhood came a day after US President Joe Biden, in his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made a pointed reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the strategic dialogue between India, USA, Japan and Australia that mostly focuses on Beijing.Biden and PM Modi, according to a White House readout of the conversation between the two leaders, “agreed to continuing close cooperation to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and a stronger regional architecture through the Quad.”Yongwook Ryu, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy who focuses on East Asia, told Bloomberg that the US earlier emphasised its policy mainly verbally. But since the Trump administration, it has been promoting it much more explicitly with specific actions such as dispatching its two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea.Biden is sending out a clear message to Beijing that it is not going to be soft toward China on certain issues, including the South China Sea disputes, despite its willingness to cooperate with China on some other issues such as climate change, Yongwook Ryu said.Furious at Washington’s show of force in the South China Sea, the Chinese foreign ministry said: “This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region. China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly defend national sovereignty and security and work together with regional countries to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea.”A new Chinese law that came into force on Monday allows its coast guard to fire at foreign ships in its waters and remove buildings constructed by foreign countries on what it believes are Chinese territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-us-warships-in-south-china-sea-spell-out-joe-biden-s-hardline-on-xi-jinping-101612885133151.html
10-02-2021||World||Indo-Canadian groups protest over alleged Khalistani role in farmers’ stir||Indo-Canadian organisations are stepping up efforts to counter the narrative related to the ongoing farmers’ protests in India, as they believe the agenda has largely been hijacked by pro-Khalistan elements in Canada.More than 350 vehicles participated in a “tiranga rally” in Metro Vancouver, including members from various Indo-Canadian groups in the region. The participants waved India flags in front of the Indian consulate in Vancouver, a symbolic gesture as this was the scene of a blockade carried out by protesters on January 26, 2021.Khalistan flags had been brandished during the course of the Republic Day protest, and among its organisers was Mo Dhaliwal, founder of Poetic Justice Foundation, which was also behind the toolkit for organising criticism of the Indian government with regard to the farmers’ agitation.Among those who organised Saturday’s pro-India rally was a resident of the Delta region of British Columbia. “There was so much anger within the community here over what happened in New Delhi on Republic Day that we had to do something,” said the person who chose not to be identified. The person added that the community respected the views of protesting farmers, but their cause had been taken over by separatist elements in Canada and elsewhere.Referring to the protests in Canada, the person said, “Everyday, it’s happening here. This is very disturbing.” The person added that the rally started from Surrey and the cavalcade of cars travelled to Vancouver. HT is withholding some of the names at the request of the participants.According to a video, during the course of a speech delivered in front of the consulate on January 26, Dhaliwal had said, “You have to understand the feeling and the emotion that the Khalistan movement is bringing to this. I want people to hear this. The reason why the Khalistani people are so passionate about this is that 40-50 years later, we’re seeing the truth that they predicted in the 1970s. In the 1970s, they wanted an independent land, so that we wouldn’t have to live through this movement.” The authenticity of the video has yet to be verified.Meanwhile, Indo-Canadian groups continued to reach out to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to underscore the importance of relations with India, which were undermined by his remarks on the farmers’ protests. A letter sent by the Ottawa-based Overseas Friends of India Canada said, “It is no surprise that a single comment at this moment has put us on the back foot with regard to our relations with India. It is imperative for Canada to maintain a just stance especially when it comes to a close ally like India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-groups-rally-to-protest-alleged-khalistani-role-in-farmer-protest-101612678967334.html
