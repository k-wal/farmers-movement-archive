However, it is expected to rise in coming days and arrangements are being made accordingly,” Dr Ravi Gupta, medical superintendent, GMCH-32, said.GMCH has said that since the threat of Covid has yet not fully receded, crowding of the hospital where mostly immunocompromised patients visit needs to be restricted.A total of 711 patients were seen at the OPD, including 268 new ones. However, Chandigarh-specific data was not shared by the hospital.The situation is expected to be reviewed after a week.

The decision was taken after the first mop-up round conducted on Monday for left out health workers recorded a very poor coverage of nearly 20%, officials said.During the mop-up round on February 15, only 1405 beneficiaries, out of listed 6,776 health-care workers, opted to get vaccinated, the officials said. Also, on February 15, 309 of 379 identified health workers, who had received their first dose during the inaugural session of January 16, got their second shot and their coverage stood at 81.53%.The department has decided that they will conduct one more mop-up round where they will devote 30 sessions for health workers and also similar number of sessions for front-line workers who will get their first dose. “February 19 will also be the day when those who received the first dose on January 22 will come to get second dose. On the same day, we will conduct a final mop-up round for remaining health workers who have so far not arrived to take up their first dose,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. According to the officials, the district has a total of 24,340 health-care workers and about 19,100 front-line workers whose vaccination round is presently in progress. Of 24,340 health workers, 18,969 have received vaccine while only 4,138 front-line workers have opted for getting the shots. The front-line workers include personnel of police and central police forces, home guards, jail staff and staff of Nagar Palikas, among others. During the nine rounds of vaccination, including one mop-up round, from January 16 to February 15, the district has an overall coverage of 77.93% of health workers and 45.73% (4,138 of 9,047 mapped) front-line workers so far. “The low turnout of front-line workers is a cause of concern. But we have requested respective departments to increase awareness and also take steps suggested by the state officials in their recent communication. The mop- up round for front-line workers is scheduled for February 22. We intend to start the vaccination for third category of beneficiaries from March 15 and will vaccinate them over a period of six months,” Dr Gupta added.

He urged them to withdraw their agitation.Listing out long statistics, the CM said the government has done everything possible and inducted maximum candidates in service and asked the youth not to become a pawn in the hands of opposition parties.The chief minister said that during the tenure of the present government, 44,000 fresh posts were created and 1.59 lakh appointment orders were given.“The opposition is playing with fire by provoking youngsters. They are spreading canards and concocted stories to mislead job aspirants. Youngsters should realise this election stunt and withdraw stir,” he said, adding that it was impossible to give job opportunities to all who figured in the rank list of public service commission. He also denied reports that there were enough back door entries in government service to block opportunities for genuine candidates.Also read: Kiran Bedi removed as Puducherry LG amid political crisis in Union territory“They are spreading studded lies. The government did not do anything to compromise chances of real aspirants,” he said.The CM’s press conference came in the wake of the secretariat witnessing moving scenes. On Monday, some of the aspirants crawled on their knees and collapsed. When former CM Oommen Chandy came to meet them at the protest venue, some of them fell on his feet pleading his intervention. Last week, two candidates had threatened self-immolation. The CM took a dig at Chandy saying he should have fallen on the feet of youngsters for scuttling many appointments during his tenure.Agitating youth, however, rejected the CM’s demand and said they will continue their stir till they get justice. “We have no politics. We are not kids to fall into the hands of some parties. We don’t want the CM to reel out old statistics, he has to address our woes,” said one of the leaders Laya Rajesh. She said due to Covid-19, many appointments were frozen and they want to extend the tenure of their rank list.Amid protest on Monday, the government had decided to give permanent posting to 221 people who were working on a temporary basis. While the government insisted that these temporary workers were inducted on a humanitarian basis, rank holders alleged that party affiliation was the main criteria and their appointments were illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-cm-asks-job-aspirants-not-to-fall-into-opposition-s-trap-end-agitation-101613499221425.html

16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC polls: Repolling ordered at two booths||Punjab state election commission on Tuesday ordered repolling at two booths in ward number 10 of the Mohali municipal corporation, from where Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, brother of health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, is the Congress candidate. Repolling will take place from 8am to 4pm on Wednesday. Resultantly, counting of votes polled in all 50 wards of the Mohali MC will now be held on Thursday. However, counting for seven municipal councils in the district will be held as scheduled on Wednesday.Paramjeet Singh Kahlon, Azad group candidate from Ward No. 10, had lodged a complaint with the state election commission (SEC) against Amarjeet Singh, demanding repolling in the ward. In his complaint, he alleged that on Sunday, Congress workers captured booths in Phase 7 in connivance with police, who he claimed forcibly removed his polling agents from there. Kahlon also moved the Punjab and Haryana high court, which has sought response on allegations by February 18.Action on basis of SDM’s summary inquiryAn official spokesperson of the SEC said that the commission has received a report from the subdivisional magistrate-cum-returning officer through the deputy commissioner, in which irregularities have been pointed out during polling while suggesting repolling in booth numbers 32 and 33 of Ward No. 10. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan confirmed that the summary inquiry conducted by the returning officer following Kahlon’s complaint on Monday has substantiated the allegations. “Since an error/ irregularity in procedure is likely to vitiate the poll committed at a polling station under Section 59 (c) of the Punjab State Election Commission Act, 1994, so as mandated by the Act, the matter was brought to the notice of the SEC for further necessary action,” he said, adding that the sanctity and integrity of the poll process is paramount and should be above any suspicion or doubts. A detailed inquiry has also been ordered to look into the irregularities committed at the two polling booths, he said, adding that on its basis, action as warranted under law will be taken against the guilty with intimation to the commission.Reacting to the SEC’s decision, Balbir Singh Sidhu claimed the Congress will win with a record margin from the ward in question. Sidhu said, like all others wards, elections were held in a peaceful, free and fair manner in Ward No. 10. He alleged a candidate, upset over his apparent defeat, made false complaints to the SEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-polls-repolling-ordered-at-two-booths-101613498938068.html

16-02-2021||Noida||Residents slip anti-stress pills into dog food to calm strays||With incidents of dogs biting people, residents of Noida sector 34 said they were slipping anti-stress medicines into food for stray canines. Animal feeders said that this was a tried and tested method that worked. While there is no census data on the number of stray dogs or community dogs, the Noida Authority claims they sterilise 1,200 streets dogs a month. Sector 34 residents’ welfare association (RWA) said they had urged the authority to initiate a special sterilisation drive in their area as well. “So far there were 15 cases of dog bites here this month alone. The latest victim was a seven-year-old girl who was attacked on Monday. Often it happens that such incidents leads to heated arguments and even clashes between the animal lovers and victims. So with the help of experts we have decided to include medicines to allay the animals’ aggression and get them all vaccinated,” said KK Jain, president, sector 34, RWA. The RWA said they consulted vets to procure the medicines. “The government rules are such that we cannot do much to allay the anger of people who or whose loved ones were attacked. We cannot relocate dogs either, so we have decided to live along with them. We are deploying a medicine called Anxocare into food that feeders leave for them,” Dharmendra Sharma, General Secretary RWA sector 34. “It has helped.”The RWA said they would vaccinate the dogs as well to prevent rabies. “We will tie up with NGOs for that. It will cost ₹400 to vaccinate a dog, while the calming medicine costs ₹150 a pack that can cover eight to 10 dogs a week,” said Sharma. The RWA had recently also held a special awareness session on do’s and don’ts to avoid dog aggression or spooking them. “Feeders have been using the nerve calming medicine for dogs for years, and it’s good that now RWAs are coming along and considering it. The dogs often get aggressive when being cornered or hit by anyone. If suppose a dog is hit by a guard, it will have an aggressive stance for any human. We need to understand that,” said Rafat Ahmed, a dog feeder heling the RWA and runs an NGO named animal connect. Sector -34 has about 3500 families – roughly 20,000 residents. While there is no census on the number of street dogs, the RWA estimates there must be over 200 street dogs while the authority pegs the number to be around 500. “We have a roster prepared under which sectors are selected, dogs are sterilised and left at the same spot where they were picked from. We are sterilising about 1200 dogs every month in Noida, and working on initiating a drive in sector-34 soon,” said Gaurav Bansal, assistant project engineer, public health, Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-slip-anti-stress-pills-into-dog-food-to-calm-strays-101613498697923.html

The senior town planner has given directions to town planning officials to ensure that no construction or development takes place at these project sites spread across the city. DTCP officials said they have also written letters to the district administration to enter the details of the cancelled licences in the revenue records of the department so that no registration of sales or lease deed can take place in the land for which licenses have been cancelled. A senior DTCP official said that they have also started the assessment of these projects and sought the details regarding the number of buyers, inventory of the project and third-party rights, which have been created. “The records are being scrutinised and we are also keeping a close watch on these sites to ensure that there is no sale or purchase of units. In many cases, the builders have gone incommunicado and we are finding difficult to get information on the projects,” he said. The developers of these projects, which include both residential and commercial ones, have been asked to share information and notices have been issued to them, said officials. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) Gurugram said that transactions are not allowed in these projects. “We will be keeping a close watch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-take-over-17-project-sites-after-cancellation-of-licences-101613498579460.html
16-02-2021||Gurugram||Fire department proposes tech upgrades, new stations to reduce response time||In a bid to reduce response time, officials have proposed to install GPS trackers in all fire tenders and link them to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) integrated command control centre. Further, the proposal to set up four fire stations to provide proper coverage to newer sectors has also moved forward.Officials of the fire department and GMDA said that this would notify the command centre about the ground situation and in case a fire tender is stuck in a jam, another vehicle could be sent via a different route so that there is no delay in response.“Often, our fire tenders get stuck in snarls and hence, get delayed in reaching the site of a fire. A tracker would help give us this information on a real-time basis and we can accordingly send a fresh batch of fire tenders through less congested routes,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer.The fire department has 25 fire tenders located at its fire stations in Sector 29, Sector 37, Bhim Nagar, and Udyog Vihar. Kashyap said that the matter of making all fire tenders GPS-enabled was discussed in a meeting with GMDA officials last week.“The matter was discussed with both representatives of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) as well as the fire department. We want it to operate on similar lines as the police control room, which relays all complaints or distress calls to the nearest PCR vehicle. We want to build a similar system, where the official at the command control centre relays any fire incident to the nearest fire station or fire tender,” said a senior GMDA official who had attended the meeting.The official said that the proposal is currently at a nascent stage and its outlines are being chalked out.“For this system to function, we will have to create or make alterations to the existing software at the command centre. We will figure out the best way to make it operational in the coming weeks and subsequently, draft a comprehensive project model,” the official cited above said. Besides the GMDA, Kashyap also said that the state government is planning on making all fire tenders GPS-enabled across Haryana. “Soon after the GMDA meeting, we learnt that the Haryana government is also planning on enabling all fire tenders across the state with GPS and they are also in the process of starting an assessment survey in this regard. The proposal has been floated at both the district and state levels, and whichever process is done earlier, will be implemented in Gurugram,” said Kashyap.Kashyap also said that a proposal sent to the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradikharan (HSVP) in Gurugram by MCG in February last year for seeking land in sectors 9, 9A, 23A, 43 for setting up new fire stations has moved forward. The Gurugram fire department comes under the ambit of MCG.Kashyap said that due to the coronavirus outbreak, the matter was put on the back burner. “The proposal has just recently been cleared by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) within Gurugram and has been sent to the HSVP headquarters for final approval. The city has expanded a lot over the last decade and the existing four fire stations do not provide proper coverage, especially to those living in the newer sectors (sectors 58-115). Hence, new fire stations are urgently needed to reduce response time to such areas,” said Kashyap.The latest fire station to be opened in the city is in Udyog Vihar, in April 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fire-department-proposes-tech-upgrades-new-stations-to-reduce-response-time-101613498578866.html
16-02-2021||Gurugram||Vehicles line up at Kherki Daula toll plaza as payments go digital||A traffic jam stretching for more than a kilometre was witnessed at the Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway (NH-48) during the morning peak hours on Tuesday, as all toll plazas in the country switched to digital-only payments through FASTags. The concessionaire, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), deployed toll collectors with hand-held machines to read tags faster. The reason for the heavy jam, said highway and traffic officials, was that a large number of vehicles without the tags had entered designated FASTag lanes, slowing down traffic considerably in the morning. However, the situation normalised later in the day, with slight congestion reported from 5pm to 6.30pm. To ensure that commuters without tags were able to pay the penalty in minimum time, the toll officials were asked by the police to deploy toll collectors with hand-held machines. The vehicular movement was slow but remained in control, barring the peak hours, said police. The police said that a tractor-trolley also overturned just ahead of the toll plaza on Tuesday morning, which compounded the situation. Commuters, meanwhile, said the 25-lane Kherki Daula toll plaza continues to be a bottleneck on the expressway and despite several trial runs and campaigns, the authorities have failed to find solutions. A recent spurt in traffic on the expressway increased the severity of congestion. The number of vehicles crossing the toll has reached 80,000 daily, around 20,000 more than the number a week ago. Motorists said that it took almost 30 minutes to cross the toll plaza on Tuesday. The worst-affected were the daily commuters and employees working in the industrial townships of Manesar, Dharuhera, and Bhiwadi. Sumit Kumar, a resident of DLF Phase-2 and a daily commuter, said that despite having a FASTag, he had to wait for more than 20 minutes to cross the toll. “The FASTag lanes are also congested as people without tags enter these lanes and are ready to pay penalty, resulting in congestion,” he said. Another tag user said that there were no arrangements to ensure smooth movement of the tag holders, despite the system becoming completely digital. “It’s been more than three years that I have been using this stretch and nothing has changed. Peak hours are the most challenging as there is always congestion, even on public holidays. The marshals are rude and do not respond well when we object to other vehicles using the tag lanes,” said Amit Jha, a resident of Sector 10A. MCEPL officials, however, said that the situation remained under control. A senior official, requesting anonymity, said that congestion was witnessed only during the peak hours as vehicles without tags entered the designated lanes. “There was also a minor accident involving a tractor-trolley, but, overall, the situation was under control. We appeal to people to maintain balance in their tags as our purpose is to have digital compliance and not penalties. Those who haven’t adopted FASTags should get these installed,” the official said.Highway officials said that many were ready to pay the double penalty but not ready to buy the FASTags.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the police deployed 100 personnel on both carriageways to manage the traffic movement. “We have deployed two assistant commissioners of police and asked them to monitor the vehicular movements for the first few days. Around 10 FASTags kiosks were set up to ensure commuters who do not have these stickers can get them at the spot and the marshals of the toll operator were guiding them to opt for digital payments instead of paying a penalty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vehicles-line-up-at-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-as-payments-go-digital-101613498577476.html

Police Divyansh Tiwari, a native of Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh, lives in a rented accommodation in Sector 37 area and works at a mall on Golf Course Road. On Sunday night, after finishing his shift he boarded an auto rickshaw and got down at Hero Honda Chowk. “I was walking down towards my house when three men on a motorbike intercepted my way and started abusing and hitting me. They asked me to hand over my belongings. Otherwise, they said, they would kill me. One of them was directing them to take out a gun and kill me,” he said. Fearing for his life, Tiwari did not raise alarm but noted down the registration number of the motorbike while they were leaving. The police said the number belonged to Madhya Pradesh. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that this is the sixth such incident reported from the city in the last 10 days. “These three bike-borne men are targeting people carrying bags and rob them of their mobile phones, gold chains and cash. We are scanning CCTV footage of a few locations in Sector 37, South City 2, Sector 50, Sector 14 and Palam Vihar to identify the suspects,” he said.

The police said that the drugs, in small packets, were to be supplied to another dealer.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Sharma used to run a fast food joint in Suncity residential area in Sector 54 since 2017, but had to shut it due to losses during the lockdown. “He faced a financial crunch, due to which he met a few drug peddlers who used to get supply from Delhi to sell in Gurugram,” he said.The police said that he is a hotel management graduate and lived with his mother, who was unaware of his illegal trade.Sangwan said he was supplying drugs to pubs, bars, restaurants, clubs and farmhouses for parties and made nearly ₹3 lakh per month. “He was selling MDMA at ₹6,000 per gram for high-end parties at farmhouses and clubs,” he said.Sharma was produced before a court on Tuesday and sent to judicial custody till February 28.A team of plainclothes police made the arrest after being tipped off about drug trade. The CIA team raided the black Creta SUV around 11.30pm.Officials said that a search of the vehicle was conducted in the presence of the suspect, and the drugs were found concealed in one-gram pouches in the car boot.Sangwan said that as per a preliminary investigation, Sharma used to supply drugs even during the lockdown. “He saw the pandemic as an opportunity to earn money as those who consumed it would not hesitate to pay him two to three times the regular price,” he said.The police said they are scanning Sharma’s phone calls and contact details to know about his associates and clients, and are also investigating his bank accounts and transactions. Sharma was booked under sections 20 (B) (ii) (A), 16 and 21 of the Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act at the Sector 29 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-held-with-consignment-of-illegal-drugs-worth-rs-1-lakh-at-sector-29-parking-lot-101613498518727.html
16-02-2021||Gurugram||No scaling down of Covid-19 tests despite low case count, says health department||Despite the Covid-19 spread ebbing to its lowest since last May, health department officials have said that there will be no further scaling down of tests in the district. A minimum of 2,500 tests per day, with 95 percent of them being RT-PCR (Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests, will be conducted daily even if the growth rate of new Covid-19 cases improves further in the coming weeks, officials confirmed on Tuesday. Officials also said they have discontinued antigen camps in the district, since rapid diagnostic tests — which are known to yield a larger number of false negatives than RT-PCR ones — have limited efficacy at this stage in the epidemic.In Gurugram — which is one of Haryana’s worst-hit districts — the daily growth rate of Covid-19 cases is down to 0.5 percent, with the test positivity rate(TPR) hovering just above 1 percent for at least two weeks now. At the height of the epidemic’s third wave in early November, the district’s total caseload was growing by almost 3 percent daily, with daily TPR at almost 25 percent. At that time, the district was conducting at least 6,000 tests per day, with about 80 percent of them being RT-PCR ones.“We were preferring to use more antigen tests because of limited resources, and because antigen positivity is an important indicator when you are trying to keep up with widespread transmission. Now we are more concerned with treating individual cases, for which the current rate of testing is sufficient,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram. “We are expecting new cases to slow down further before March-end, but in terms of tests we will keep conducting at least 2,500 to 3,000 tests every day. We will be able to make RT-PCR tests available more widely now, which is why antigen tests are being deprioritised,” Yadav added. Presently, official data shows that around 95 percent of all daily tests are RT-PCR in nature. “This is more than the centrally recommended ratio of 80 percent RT-PCR and 20 percent antigen. There is no rule which states that it is mandatory to conduct a certain amount of rapid antigen tests. We started scaling them down in early January itself, but camps were still being organised as a surveillance tool in some areas. They are no longer serving that purpose anymore,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. This is also because there has been a significant drop in the number of walk-in tests at antigen camps organised in localities which until recently were regarded as hot spots for Covid-19. “In some areas, like Tigra and Patel Nagar, we would see dozens of people come in every day with symptoms. Now there are hardly any walk-ins. Contact tracing has once again become the main route to identify suspected cases,” said Sharma, adding that authorities are being able to trace at least six to seven contacts per positive case, as against just three contacts per case in November. However, Sharma clarified that contact tracing remains a challenge because people are far more mobile now. “The number of people each positive person interacts with is hard to figure out because everything has mostly opened up. People are meeting others quite freely. But we are doing better at following up with close contacts, which is the important part,” he said. Despite these changes in their epidemic response, officials also sad it would not be accurate to say that their strategy has changed. They maintained that they are simply adapting the existing guidelines to the changes in the ground reality of the district. “We have assigned more staffers toward the vaccine roll-out but that has not affected testing. The overall strategy is the same as that directed by the Central government, which is to trace contacts and enable access to tests for people who fall sick. If the ministry issues new guidelines on increasing or reducing tests, or changing the type of tests, we will follow them. The main thing is that our positivity rate remains below five percent,” said Dr Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-scaling-down-of-covid-19-tests-despite-low-case-count-says-health-department-101613498518054.html

Then they would take the customers in a car and either used violence to rob them or blackmail to extort money from them,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.The officials said that the gang was being run by a 27-year-old Assam-based woman and her 27-year-old husband from Uttar Pradesh. Three more women aged 35, 28 and 26 years were also arrested along with them. The couple was currently living in Delhi, police said.“After initiating contact with clients, the suspects would share photos of women who were available for various services and once the clients were lured, they would rob them. The operation came to the fore when one such client approached us to file a complaint against the gang. They were traced using technical surveillance and arrested today from near a park in Sector 54,” said the DCP.The police officials said that they have recovered multiple sets of social media chats of the suspects which also showed connections with other similar gangs. The suspects had been operating for the past two years in the Delhi-NCR and their meeting places with prospective clients included malls and markets, police said.Police also recovered a car from the suspects, along with several mobile phones, packets of contraceptives and ₹3,500 that was stolen from the complainant. They were booked at Sector 24 police station under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.Police are now identifying other members of the gang and the cases in which they might be involved. Complainants take time coming forward due to social stigma, said police.The five suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-held-for-running-a-prostitution-ring-robbing-people-101613498517320.html
16-02-2021||Noida||Murder suspect flees from police custody; arrested after six hours||Noida Police on Tuesday afternoon managed to arrest a 25-year-old murder suspect who had given them the slip only hours earlier.Police identified the suspect by a single name, Vijay, who they had first arrested after an alleged encounter in Greater Noida’s Surajpur on Monday night. He was taken to the Noida district hospital in sector 30 to be treated for a bullet injury. At around 9.30am, he went missing.“The suspect damaged the false ceiling in the first-floor washroom and climbed in. He was able to crawl his way through and make his way out and then down to the ground floor where he hid inside a wardrobe next to room 101,” said deputy commissioner of police (Noida central) Harish Chander. “During this time, the constable assigned to guard him was outside the washroom. He got suspicious when the man did not return. He raised the alarm when he realised that the suspect was no longer there. A police team then launched a search.”Six hours later, a police team found the suspect hidden inside the wardrobe.Vijay was wanted in the kidnapping and murder of four-year-old boy Hrithik Kumar of Gulistanpur village in Surajpur.The Surajpur police recorded the child missing from the evening of January 24 and began an investigation.While recording statements, the police came to know that two persons, Vijay and his 25-year-old flatmate Anil, had been missing from their rented accommodation since that day.Tarun, the victim’s uncle, said Vijay and his wife had shifted to the neighbourhood from Kannauj on January 13. “A few days later, Anil joined them. He too was from Kannauj. They used to play marbles with my nephew.”Police team searched the flat to find these marbles in one of the rooms.On February 13, Chander said, they arrested a man named Anil, 25, from Surajpur roundabout based on a tip.“He admitted that Vijay and he murdered the child for money,” he said. “They had heard that the boy’s father, who is the grocery business, had applied for a ₹8-lakh loan. Thinking they would be able to get some of that money, they abducted the boy for ransom.”But Vijay, after his arrest, allegedly told police that they feared arrest after the family approached the police and could not go ahead with making the ransom call. They strangled the boy and disposed his body behind a closed factory in Site B, 5 km from his home.Based on Anil’s alleged confession, police found the body.On Monday night, the police received a tip on Vijay. Near 130-m road in Surajpur, a police team signalled a motorcyclist to stop, but instead he fired at the team, said Chander.“In the counterfire, he was injured in his right leg,” he said, adding that they recovered a country-made gun and a live cartridge from him.Police said they had registered a case under the Indian Penal Code sections 363 (abduction) and 302 (murder) against Anil and Vijay. A magistrate sent both suspects were sent to 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/murder-suspect-flees-from-police-custody-arrested-after-six-hours-101613498457984.html

16-02-2021||Noida||Farmers at UP Gate gear up to tackle summers||Now that the summer has started, farmers protesting at UP Gate are making arrangements, and the union leaders are meeting panchayats to garner the support of farmers across the National Capital Region (NCR).Around 2,000 to 2,500 farmers and people gathered at the protest site on Tuesday. They are taking part in the ongoing agitation on a rotational basis, according to the members of UP Gate farmers’ committee. The protesters have plans to deal with the increase in temperature, they said.“To ensure a good turnout, the dais will be entirely covered, and fans will be installed in a few days. Covered tents used during the winter will be removed and will set up new tents. The existing tents will be covered with haystacks. We have brought two big generators and will rope in more to run fans and desert coolers,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and a member of UP Gate farmers’ committee.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who is spearheading the protests at UP Gate, conducted a panchayat with other farmer leaders and members of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha at Garhi Sampla in Rohtak on Tuesday.To keep the momentum of protesters at protest hotspots, Tikait asked people to protest at different sites, in groups. He also urged the central government to form an “agriculture cabinet”, which would focus on various issues faced by the farmers.“The farmers should have known that there is no ‘krishi mantralaya’ (agriculture ministry) or ‘krishi mantri’ ((agriculture minister) in the country. People and farmers are being deceived. Those who talk to us (government representatives) only have 18 per cent charge of the agriculture ministry. There are 17-18 other departments that look after issues impacting agriculture. So, we have asked the government to come up with an agriculture cabinet,” Tikait said.“There is no law on minimum support price (MSP) yet, but the godowns (corporate) have come up beforehand. The price of the crop will be decided on the basis of people’s hunger and this will affect the poor and the shopkeepers. There is a new trend of ‘bhook ka vyapar’ (business of hunger). We have to stop this, otherwise even dogs will die of hunger,” he added.“They will try to divide us (on the basis of caste, economic status and even on the regional basis), but you must stay strong. It is for the first time that the Sikhs have come with us and we will stay with them. We have got strong groups from Punjab and we have learnt a lot from them. It is a strong bond. It is high time that farmers from different states start meeting each other,” Tikait said.The protest, which primarily started as a farmers’ protest has now become a ‘Jan Andolan’ (public movement), he said.“It is because the prices are on the rise, and even the fuel rate is on the higher side. This will also affect the common people. People have been supporting us, and we are raising their issues as well,” Tikait said on Monday.Recently, questions were raised about the dip in the number of protesters at the UP Gate, which saw a massive surge ahead of the tractor rally on Republic Day (January 26) and following Tikait’s emotional appeal to the people to bring food and water for him on January 28.The farmers have been camping at the protest site near Uttar Pradesh Gate since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of the farm laws, and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). As part of an offer, the Centre had proposed staying the implementation of the three controversial farm laws for one and half years. However, there’s a stalemate between the farmers and the central government continues, with no talks held since January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-at-up-gate-gear-up-to-tackle-summers-101613498397372.html

Two of the nine persons against whom a case, including charges of murder, was registered, were arrested. The incident took place on Monday when Simrandeep Singh, 18, came out of Baba Namdev Senior Secondary School after appearing in his English examination. “His younger brother Harmandeep Singh was waiting for him on a bike to take him home. As the two were about to leave, two bike-borne youngsters came and attacked them with a ‘datar’ (a sharp-edged weapon),” the police said. Harmandeep, who also suffered minor injuries, somehow managed to escape and rushed to the local police station to inform the cops about the attack. The assailants fled from the spot, leaving him groaning in pain. Simrandeep, who suffered injuries on his head, neck and chest, was taken to a nearby hospital by the school staff but was declared brought dead by doctors, said the eyewitnesses. CCTV footage of the incident has surfaced, in which two persons are seen hitting the 18-year-old with the weapons. The assailants have not been identified yet, the police said. The family of the victim, who belongs to nearby Sellowal village, shifted to Hoshiarpur district six months ago over the alleged property dispute with their neighbours, it is learnt. He had come from Hoshiarpur to appear in the examination. Simrandeep’s father Hardev Singh, the complainant, accused his neighbour’s family of killing his son. Ghuman police station in-charge Surinder Singh said those arrested were identified as Harmanpreet Singh and Gurmeet Kaur. Batala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rachhpal Singh said teams were conducting raids to nab the absconding accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-12-student-killed-outside-batala-school-over-property-dispute-2-held-101613498039595.html
16-02-2021||City||Amid pressure from striking transporters, Meghalaya govt slashes fuel prices||Faced with criticism from citizens and pressure from a two-week-long agitation by commercial vehicles, the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government reduced the prices of petrol and diesel by a little over ₹7 on Tuesday.Highly placed sources in the state secretariat said the public criticism, the 2-week-long stay off the road by commercial vehicles, a 2-day road blockade (with minimal impact) and a possible hunger strike outside the secretariat had a major role in the government rescinding its earlier decision to hike tax on petrol and diesel and instead reduce it.Although the government had earlier reduced the tax by ₹2, the opposition continued.Announcing this decision after a meeting on Tuesday, chief minister Conrad K Sangma said, “The government of Meghalaya has decided to reduce the Value Added Tax (VAT) for petrol and diesel by approximately ₹7.”He said that the move is primarily to ensure that the consumers are not affected by the high prices and to give some relief to them. Sangma said, “I am sure this will make the consumers of the state happy and even the commercial vehicles will also benefit from the reduction in the prices of petrol and diesel.”Presently, the price of petrol is ₹91.26 per litre while diesel is at ₹84.23 per litre compared to neighbouring Assam which stands at ₹86.25 for petrol and ₹80.41 for diesel per litre.“The price of petrol in Meghalaya would reduce from ₹91.26 to ₹85.86, a reduction of approximately ₹6 and if you were to include the earlier ₹2 that we have already reduced, it will come up to almost ₹7.4 per litre,” Sangma elaborated.“The cost of diesel would now be down to ₹79.13 from ₹84.23, a reduction of approximately ₹5 in diesel. Also, if you were to include ₹2 that was done initially, that would be approximately ₹7,” he added.Ri-Bhoi district which borders Assam has it a little cheaper when compared to Shillong. From ₹89.81, petrol is now at ₹84.76 while diesel will now cost ₹78.21 from the previous rate of ₹83.10.Also read: Kiran Bedi removed as Puducherry LG amid political crisis in Union territoryWith this reduction, the price of petrol and diesel in Meghalaya is now amongst the lowest in the country, confirmed M Aggarwal, owner of a chain of petrol pumps in the state.On the other hand, Sangma also said that the state has always maintained competitive pricing with Assam to ensure that the sales are not affected.“We are hopeful that with this, our sales also will go up and will be able to make up for some of the losses in the taxes that we may have incurred due to the reduction in the prices of both petrol and diesel,” he said.According to him, the VAT collected from petrol and diesel has helped the state which has faced lots of challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the chief minister said the revenue loss due to the reduction in the VAT collection from petrol and diesel will be approximately ₹20 crore every month.“I would also like to inform you that the revenue compared to last year, which was ₹326 crore, has increased. This year in January we touched ₹451 crore. Even though the revenue will come down, we expect that the overall revenue from VAT in the petrol and diesel will go up from ₹326 crore last year to at least ₹470 crore this year, so it is a jump of ₹140 crore but it would have been more if the prices had not come down,” he stated.Sangma ruled out any possibility of increasing passenger fares. “We had revised the passenger fares in 2020 and the revised fares will be applicable,” he emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-pressure-from-striking-transporters-meghalaya-govt-slashes-fuel-prices-101613497252611.html

Several students have reported facing technical issues, difficulties in filling up the application form and even during the online payment. Students have repeatedly complained about these issues to their concerned colleges and even the university examination department, however, no solution has been given. Adil Shaikh, Bachelor of Arts student who faced technical issues while submitting the exam form said, “I was trying to fill up my backlog examination form online, but the system is not making the payment. There are several glitches which I and my friends faced while applying for the examination. When we contacted our college, they told us to take up the issue with the SPPU examination department. In this our deadline of applying for backlog exams is passing and then we have to pay a late fee as well due to no fault of ours.” Similarly, Pratiksha Borse, another student from Nashik under SPPU said, “I have already given the internal and other oral exams and have passed. Now I only want to appear for the written backlog exams but while filling up the form it is showing that I will be appearing for the practical exams as well. There are a lot of difficulties which we are facing but no solution is given to it despite repeated attempts from our side.” From October 12, 2020, SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day, both online and offline students faced a lot of issues while appearing for the exam and it even continued in the results. For the offline exams, 113 centres were identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a one-hour duration. Sachin Pandule, student and Yuvak Kranti Dal organisation volunteer said, “We are daily getting many complaints from students about applying for backlog exams, there are multiple technical issues like PNR no. not showing, internal or practical marks not included payment issues and many other. When students go to college administration, they are redirected to the SPPU examination department and then students are frustrated. It has become difficult to even apply for backlog exams; some of the students don’t even have internet connectivity or smartphone to apply.” Mahesh Kakade, SPPU director of the board of examination and evaluation said, “We are addressing each and every grievance by students about the application for backlog exams. Those students who still have any technical issue can contact our examination department and get their issue resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-students-face-technical-issues-while-applying-for-backlog-exams-101613491857094.html

In one case registered at Talegaon Dabhade police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police, he was booked for celebrating his release from Taloja jail with scores of people in cars, firecrackers, louds chants, and shooting a video using a drone the public rally that travelled along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway on Monday. He was arrested by Pune police after a case was registered at Kothrud police station on Tuesday night, according to Pornima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3, Pune police. Marne was acquitted in two murder cases in the month of February by a court in Pune. In the first case, Marne was booked along with 13 others for the murder of Santosh alias Pappu Gawade (28) on November 4, 2014, with sharp weapons. Marne was again booked along with 22 others for the murder of a man named Amol Hari Badhe (26) on November 19, 2014, by opening fire at him and two others. Both the men were members of the gang of Nilesh Ghaiwal, who was once a member of the Marne gang but split from him to start his own gang. Their rivalry had led to a gang war in the early 2010s after which Marne was in jail while Ghaiwal is currently on externment from Pune. Marne was soon arrested in both the cases and was facing trial in both cases. However, Special Judge AY Thatte acquitted him in both cases for a lack of evidence. The 50-year-old gangster’s celebration was, however, short-lived as the Pimpri-Chinchwad police, as well as Pune police, arrested him one day after release. A case under Sections 188, 143, 286 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 37(1) with 135 of Maharashtra Police Act and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act was registered at Talegaon Dabhade police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gajanan-marne-arrested-booked-in-two-new-cases-hours-after-leaving-jail-101613491377057.html

Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of SII, said, “We have not received anything in writing from the South African government and I do not want to comment on the matter. These are all just media reports as of now.” He said that the current Covishield dose is effective against the new UK variant of the Sars-Cov-2 strain, as well as the South African strain of the Covid-19 causing virus. Poonawalla said, “The vaccine is effective against severe disease so nobody has had to go to hospital after taking the vaccine. Patients have experienced only mild to moderate symptoms even in South Africa.” The new variant of the virus found in South Africa has become a matter of concern as in January researchers found that the variant has mutations which may be resistant to immunity from a previous Covid-19 infection. Following this, there were several media reports claiming that the South African government has requested the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the only mass manufacturer of Oxford University’s Covishield vaccine in India, to take back its one million doses of Covishield which was delivered to the country about a week ago.SII has been at the forefront to deliver the vaccine to multiple countries.Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, epidemiologist and former head scientist of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “We have to do our independent validation study. I am told that the mutated virus is being cultured. Once the culture is done we need to study the effectiveness of the current vaccines. We need to do genomic sequencing on the same variant, of the rare South African Covid-19 strains found in our country, to see if there is any difference in the South African strain reported in India or the classical SA strain as there could be multiple mutations in the same kind.”With respect to how effective these vaccines are against the ongoing mutations, Dr Gangakehkdar said both the vaccines are safe and only their efficacy is under study. He said, “Covaxin has provided data about its effectiveness against the UK strain. As about Covishield, there is data from other place, including the UK, that it does work against the UK variant. We need to try and develop a new mechanism to ensure that we are able to conduct our own study for any new mutation and develop vaccines accordingly and use it as second dose. As of now with respect to the general public, it is important to know that it is essential to get vaccinated as all the approved vaccines are safe and only their efficacy is being tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-written-request-from-sa-govt-to-return-covishield-doses-poonawalla-101613489816901.html

Khed-Shivapur toll plaza saw long queues of vehicles in the evening due to technical problems. Till 7pm, 34,000 vehicles passed through the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza with 20,000 using the FASTag mode and 3,800 paid a double toll fee. Six thousand vehicles paid cash. According to toll authorities, citing the traffic situation, a single fee was collected but, post 4pm, a double toll penalty was implemented. The rest of the vehicles had an exemption category“In the morning we didn’t face any issues because people were majorly aware that if they are not using FASTag, they have to pay a double penalty. In the evening we faced a few arguments. After entering the lane some are expecting FASTags to be provided then and there. This is not practically possible. They must take a FASTag before entering the lane,” said Amit Bhatia, regional head, west, Pune-Satara Toll Road Private Limited, Reliance Infrastructure. He manages the Khed-Shivapur and Anewadi toll plazas.An eyewitness confirmed the long vehicles queues in the evening. “Around 5.30 pm there were long queues at the Khed-Shivapur toll plazas. They must have been at least a km long,” said Mahendra Shinde, a commuter from the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza.To avoid such a situation a police force was deployed at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza. “Our team has been present here and will be present at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza as it is one of the biggest junctures. They have installed FASTag readers in all the lanes. Will keep watch on the situation,” said Pravin Randive, assistant police inspector of highway police.Union minister of road transport, Nitin Gadkari, made it clear on Sunday that no more extensions would be given for FASTag implementation across the country. FASTag do’s and don’ts - Account should be recharged sufficiently for the journey - Do not recharge after entering the lane at toll plaza. It may take a while to get deposited. - Make sure you have the tag from good service provider - Keep an eye on the mobile phone network at the toll plaza.

16-02-2021||City||Courier firm founder, OBC chief are BJP's Gujarat Rajya Sabha candidates||By Darshan DesaiThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sprang a surprise on Tuesday as it announced the names of candidates for by-elections to two Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat. The polls will take place on March 1. Among the candidates is an old-time party worker, Ram Mokariya, who is also the founder-chairman of a courier company. Mokariya has been associated with the party for nearly four decades. Another candidate is other backward classes (OBC) leader Dinesh Anavadiya.The ruling party will have a walkover on both the seats since the Congress has decided not to nominate any candidate since it doesn’t have the adequate numbers to win any seat. The opposition party will have to concede the seat that fell vacant after the death of veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel.Another seat held by the BJP fell vacant after the death of recently-elected Abhay Bhardwaj. Both, Patel and Bhardwaj, succumbed to Covid-19 complications.Gujarat’s OBC Morcha chief Dinesh Anavadiya is a senior leader from North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district. He served as the director of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation between 2014-17.Ram Mokariya, who is a surprise choice, had founded Gujarat’s first Shree Maruti Courier service in 1985 to cater to four cities of the Saurashtra region where he belongs to. The primary reason behind Maruti’s success was its service to the remotest towns of Gujarat where only India Posts reached.Also read: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruOn his selection, Mokariya told reporters, “I have been a dedicated party worker for four decades without any expectations. I am indeed happy that the party has picked me to contest the Rajya Sabha elections.”The BJP's strength, which had won 99 seats in the 2017 elections, stands at 111 legislators in a House of 182, while that of the Congress has fallen from 77 to 65 now after several desertions. The Bharatiya Tribal Party has two MLAs, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has one and one Independent, Jignesh Mevani. As of now, two assembly seats are vacant.Gujarat Congress chief spokesperson Manish Doshi told Hindustan Times, “We don’t have the numbers to nominate a candidate. If polling was to be held together for both the seats, we could still have a chance of retaining our one seat since the voting MLAs would be equally divided. In a separate ballot, all 180 (as of now) MLAs will vote for each seat.”Meanwhile, BJP’s candidates are also a surprise since the party was expected to field Balwantsinh Rajput yet again but dropped him. Rajput had created an upset in 2017 when he quit the Congress to join the BJP and was immediately nominated against Ahmed Patel for Rajya Sabha and brought the latter, his mentor, close to a humiliating defeat. Patel had won that seat by one vote, apparently from Bharatiya Tribal Party chief Chhotubhai Vasava from Bharuch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/courier-firm-founder-obc-chief-are-bjp-s-gujarat-rajya-sabha-candidates-101613488739430.html

The vaccination drive for frontline workers, including police personnel and civic staff, began on February 8. The vaccination drive began across the country from January 16. In terms of cumulative numbers, the district is at the third spot in the state as 65,000 have been vaccinated of the registered 2.04 lakh beneficiaries, including HCWs and FLWs. The figure takes the average percentage to 32.31% for the district. The Covid vaccination drive in the city primarily included administering Covishield and Covaxin in the district hospital alone. While almost half the HCWs have received their first dose in 21 days, only 7% of FLWs got their second dose in seven days. As per the information provided by the state health department, Pune stands at third spot in terms of cumulative beneficiaries being covered. It stands at a lower rank when it comes to the percentage coverage among beneficiaries. Mumbai tops in the state with over 1.14 lakh beneficiaries vaccinated, Thane comes second with 68,000 and Pune has a little over 65,000 inoculated. However, in terms of percentage, Pune stands at a much lower position with bigger cities like Mumbai and Thane overtaking the numbers and also smaller districts like Ahmednagar, Solapur and Satara overtaking the district’s overall vaccination performance. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “PMC’s cumulative numbers are the highest as 46% beneficiaries have been covered. Pune rural and PCMC which have fewer registered beneficiaries comparatively have covered more than the state average. Pune district’s vaccination average is about 50% which is lower than the state average of 53%. We have asked the local authorities, including both the civic bodies and all the talukas, to increase vaccination through more information, education and communication campaigns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/50-hcws-7-flws-vaccinated-in-21-days-pune-lags-behind-most-districts-in-the-state-101613487896676.html

Commercial consumers have paid ₹51.54 crore (22,818 consumers) and industrial consumers (2,750 consumers) also paid ₹24.29 crore. Sachin Talewar, chief engineer, MSEDCL, Pune circle, said, “We have started taking action against defaulters and especially those consumers who haven’t paid their electricity bills from April 2020. However, consumers are paying their outstandings after our appeal.” “We had also given them the option to pay bills in 12- month instalments,” he said. According to MSEDCL officials, 24,746 consumers in Haveli, Mulshi, Velhe, Ambegaon, Junnar, Maval and Khed talukas have paid total ₹1.52 crore. Vivek Velankar, civic activist, said, “Due to political interference in the electricity bill issue, people were anticipating that the bill amount will be waived during the pandemic, but that was not the case. Now the outstanding amount is high and so MSEDCL has started taking action against defaulters. Consumers are paying outstanding amounts to MSEDCL. Now, MSEDCL should cooperate and give defaulters time to pay bills in instalments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msedcl-collects-rs-100-crore-in-two-weeks-with-4-922-disconnections-in-pune-circle-101613486396632.html

Thanks to a caring gesture from their senior. Yuvraj Renuse has gifted two closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to his alma mater — the primary school that runs Classes 1 to 7. The 29-year-old, who works as a computer operator for government projects on contract basis, also farms in his village. Renuse’s Valentine gift has crowned the zilla parishad school in Pabe as the first school in Velhe taluka to have CCTV camera facility. “For me education is top priority and this is a small gesture of giving back to the society as my parents overcame many struggles to get me educated. We all should take steps to ensure that zilla parishad schools also get the facilities available at private school in cities,” said Renuse, who added that his son was born on Valentine’s Day two years ago. “Installation of CCTV cameras at the school has become the new attraction for students who have not seen such technology. Though we have computers in classes for students, the CCTV camera facility will help to monitor the wards as they are told that the principal is watching their activities through these cameras. This warning is coming handy since the last two days after CCTVs were installed,” said Suresh Koli, principal, zilla parishad school, Pabe.

As the fuel prices have been soaring in recent times many are viewing e-vehicles as an efficient alternative. “My husband and I use e-bikes to go to work. We have faced no problems and it is very cost efficient. Our expenditure to buy the vehicle has been recovered and there has been no maintenance. Only thing is we should have compatible infrastructure for e-vehicles,” said Poonam Sonwane, a resident of Sangvi area. In 2020, a total 1458 e-vehicles came on the road.

16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Year after locust attack, experts monitor movement||A year after swarms of locusts invaded parts of Punjab and Haryana besides Rajasthan and Delhi, causing widespread damage to crops, the central government authorities have begun monitoring the pest’s breeding hotbeds in the sub-Saharan desert region and Asian countries. Experts say nearly half a billion population of the desert locust had invaded India from Pakistan from October 2019 onwards. Climatic conditions to determine threat of invasion KL Gurjar, the deputy director of the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), a subsidiary of the central ministry, is analysing movement of swarms of locusts in coordination with the Food and Agriculture Organisation. He says the climatic conditions in the African and Arabian peninsulas will determine the threat of locust invasion this year. “We are keeping our fingers crossed though the country is fully prepared for another locust invasion. According to the latest field analysis on February 9, swarms persist in East African regions of Kenya and Ethiopia but other areas, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, are calm. The breeding situation of the insect in the Arabian peninsula in the coming months will help in issuing a warning for this summer,” said Gurjar, the national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks. It was after about three decades that India experienced a massive locust attack in 2019-20 when the insect moved from Rajasthan to various states, including Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and parts of Punjab. Surge in greenery in Rajasthan attracts locusts Experts say locusts move with the wind and follow a definite cycle from the Sahara desert in North Africa, into East Africa – Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea and parts of Chad. They then move to the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. When they finish the food there, they move to Pakistan and India. A former vice-chancellor of Himachal Pradesh-based Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Hari Chand Sharma, attributes exceptional rains in the last season and upgraded irrigation in the desert state of Rajasthan for the unusual locust invasion. “Swarms of desert locust normally enter India during monsoon that provides it with a suitable breeding environment. With an increase in irrigation infrastructure, several parts of Rajasthan have seen a surge in greenery, attracting locusts for food while providing a breeding ground as well,” said Sharma, an entomologist. “Locusts have a pheromone communication that informs them of wind patterns as it determines rainfall, which means more vegetation. From October 15, 2019, to March 15, 2020, there was about 40% excess rain in locust breeding countries in Africa and Asia, which provided plenty of food for the insect,” he said. With the onset of winter, the locust population leaves the Indian region in October. No locust colony left in country since August 27The LWO authorities say no locust colony was left in the country last year. “After the movement in various parts of the country, locust swarms had returned to Rajasthan to lay eggs in August last year. The insect tends to lay eggs during humid weather. The desert locusts normally live and breed in semi-arid regions and numerous egg colonies were reported in various parts of Rajasthan. But our teams contained the situation and entire egg colonies were wiped out by August 27,” Gurjar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/year-after-locust-attack-experts-monitor-movement-101613474396367.html

The announcement comes in the backdrop of a rising number of Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru and some other parts of the state.

Children, young people and old, some with cycles, had formed a human chain with placards on reducing pollution and improving road safety (of course, everyone was requested to maintain Covid-19-appropriate distance). Cycling enthusiasts from Aundh and Model Colony and students of Suryadatta College had joined in. Talking about how the initiative started, Dushyant Bhatia from Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum said, “During lockdown, people enjoyed a pollution-free environment with fewer vehicles. We want to continue that experience with ‘No vehicle Sunday’, on the first Sunday of every month.” Tejashree Patil, a member of theforum, says that participant numbers have increased from 30 in November 2020 to almost 170 this month. Activities include cycle rides in Bavdhan, cycle rentals, e-cycle demos, and repairing old cycles languishing dustily in society parking lots. Corporators from Bavdhan are supportive. This month, the Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum presented a request to corporator Dilip Vede Patil to improve footpaths and create cycle tracks, rental cycle hubs and cycle parking. Mr Vede Patil has in turn promised to pursue the cause with the relevant municipal departments, and proposed a local e-rickshaw shuttle service. “No-vehicle days, walking plazas, Happy Streets promote the idea of ‘streets for people’, rather than roads meant only for vehicles,” says Ashik Jain, architect, urban designer, and ‘Bicycle Mayor’ in Pimpri-Chinchwad. This is a fundamental concept for cities: streets are public places; how they are designed, managed and used, influences our well-being. People use streets for many activities: personal mobility, transporting goods, for livelihood and as work spaces, to hang around, meet friends, and as conduits for service lines. Historically, and in current times, streets are venues for democratic communication and protest. Street uses change with the time of day, seasons and festivals. Streets and chowks define, as well as reflect, the history and neighbourhood character – khaugalli, parathe wali galli, Fashion Street are self-explanatory. Some streets are quiet, leafy avenues, others bustle with activity. Some streets are pleasant and friendly, others feel uncared for, boring, devoid of human activity, or worse, unsafe. Well-designed streets can make an area more comfortable, functional, safe and attractive. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have programmes for street design and sustainable transportation. Citizen movements can tie in to these, and new synergies can emerge in multiple neighbourhoods to benefit from, and help make wonderful streetscapes for everyone. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is currently seeking public suggestions on its Draft Non-Motorised Policy to promote walking and cycling. PCMC is also preparing a Harit Setu masterplan to improve street infrastructure. With PCMC, Ashik Jain hopes to conduct no-vehicle days in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) policies and plans applicable across the city to improve facilities for walking, cycling and public transport include the Development Plan, Comprehensive Mobility Policy, Pune Cycle Plan, Pedestrian Policy, and Parking Policy. The municipal budgets of both PMC and PCMC and on-ground projects now must reflect the intent of these excellent policies and plans. PMC’s draft budget even has allocations for cycling infrastructure. However, the allocation should be for much more than 10km budgeted this year, so that a city-wide network is ready within two to three years. While the municipal corporations prepare city-wide plans and projects, the bottom-up citizens’ movement for streets for people and sustainable mobility should grow, become stronger, inclusive and deliberative. Residents associations working with NGOs, experts and municipal authorities can make our connections to streets, places and people more holistic – road side greening efforts and neighbourhood nature walks, recycling treasure hunts to know what happens beyond the two bins at home, and walkability audits to check if street spaces can be used by children, women, seniors and people with disabilities. Along with street vendors, auto-rickshaw associations and SWaCH, residents groups can check if adequate spaces are provided for these essential services and the people who run them. Surveys can check if parking is disciplined or if vehicles occupy road space meant for pedestrians, cyclists, street vendors, autorickshaws and buses. Residents’ associations can check for bus routes connectivity and frequency, and possibilities of local area share rickshaw shuttle services. School and college students can even take up such surveys for their environment science projects. The initiative by the people of Bavdhan is commendable. May it inspire a city-wide movement of individual, collective and collaborative efforts from many neighbourhoods, accompanied by open, inclusive civic deliberations!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-sanskriti-neighbourhoods-change-one-small-concrete-decision-at-a-time-101613470735632.html

16-02-2021||West||Told not to campaign when I pointed out corruption within TMC: Trivedi||Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi, who quit the Trinamool Congress on February 12, said that he was often denounced as a "bad person" for finding flaws within the TMC. In an exclusive conversation with Hindustan Times during the video series On The Record, Trivedi said that on several occasions like the Narada scam and when tapes of TMC leaders taking bribe were leaked in media, he had asked the party's top brass to keep tainted leaders away from the party.“During Narada, I opposed (what was going on) tooth and nail and I was being seen as the bad guy. When the Narada tapes came out, I told the leader to keep all of them out. I am not saying that they are guilty but they must be kept out but it was me who was kept out,” Trivedi told Hindustan Times.He also said that a parliamentarian, whom he chose not to name, said that it was not the right moment to call the perpetrators out as elections are near. He also said that Mamata Banerjee gave clear instructions stopping Trivedi from campaigning ahead of the legislative assembly elections in 2016.Trivedi pointed out that if the real change or ‘poriborton’ which was initially promised by the Trinamool Congress did not happen then it looks like that the government in West Bengal has failed the people.“There is no poriborton as far as violence is concerned. There is no poriborton as far as corruption is concerned, rather it has become hundredfold when compared to the Left Front rule,” the parliamentarian further added.Trivedi said, “Mamata Banerjee is known for her simplicity but no one can have a split personality. If your leaders are found in some kind of a corruption then (there should be) no mercy. You (may) not declare them corrupt but the due process of law has to be there.”Dinesh Trivedi also said that under the Mamata Banerjee-led government the middle class has been facing problems as no one pays attention to their grievances as well. Trivedi when asked about the issue of ‘cut money’ he said that he has raised the issue with the Trinamool chief as well as other senior leaders almost ‘everyday’.Trivedi, who is currently serving his third term in Rajya Sabha, also said that there is a need to end the culture of dynastic politics in the country. He chose not to name Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, who also happens to be the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and said that leaders need to be humble as humility is an important aspect of India’s culture.“You must give credit to the Left and also to the BJP that at the top level there is no bhai-bhatija politics. It is vulgar,” Trivedi said. He also said that one should not take choppers to their constituency while campaigning. He also said that the young parliamentarian should exercise caution before using foul language and it is not a good culture. Trivedi also reflected on Abhishek Banerjee’s references to Gujarat during his rallies and said that just because the Prime Minister is from Gujarat one should not abuse people of Gujarat.BJP has also previously targeted the TMC government and said that post-elections BJP will end the ‘didi-bhaipo’ (aunt-nephew) regime. PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah too have alleged that the TMC has become a dynastic party and the chief minister has favored her nephew on several occasions.Dinesh Trivedi resigned from Trinamool Congress on the last day of the Rajya Sabha proceedings on February 12 saying that he felt ‘suffocated’ within the party. Trivedi also said that Mamata Banerjee no longer holds the ‘reins of the party’ anymore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/told-not-to-campaign-in-2016-when-i-pointed-out-corruption-within-tmc-trivedi-101613454344648.html

The annual event of Sufi Basant falls on the third day of Jumada-al-awwal, the fifth month of the Islamic calendar. “This festival is celebrated in memory of the poet Amir Khusrow who dedicated his songs of spring to Khwaja Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Celebrating with the community assumes greater importance in the face of the pandemic. We will start the celebrations around 4.30pm in the dargah. Namaz se pehle basant leke ayenge aur phir program shuru hoga. Masks will be compulsory and we will also be providing sanitiser on the premises of the dargah for all visitors,” says Peerzada Altamash Nizami, a descendant of Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya and joint secretary of the dargah committee. The qawwalis, today, will be performed by Nizami brothers Ghulam Sabir and Gulam Waris, who have been keeping with this tradition for years. “Humare dada, pardada ke time se humari family Sufi Basant par dargah mein qawwali kar rahi hai. We will be singing Amir Khusro’s qawwalis along with our family members. The qawwali programme usually happens in the courtyard of the dargah, but on this day we perform around the tombs of Amir Khusrow and Hazrat Nizamuddin. Covid ki wajah se sab pareshan hai, but this will be a good occasion for everyone to come together,” says Ghulam Waris, sharing how they celebrate this festival to commemorate the day when Amir Khusrow got his master to smile after he was grief stricken at the death of his nephew. People from different religions gather at the dargah to mark the celebrations, and revel in the spirit of ushering in spring. “I go to Nizamuddin every year on this day and feel at peace to see people come together,” says Archie Saxena, a Noida-based corporate professional, adding, “I don’t think there could be a better way to celebrate communal harmony than attend the Basant Panchami celebrations at a dargah. This speaks about India’s Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.” Catch It LiveWhat: Sufi BasantWhere: Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, Nizamuddin West, New DelhiWhen: February 16, todayTiming: 4.45pm onwardsNearest Metro Station: Indraprastha Metro Station on Blue Line and Jangpura on Violet Line Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sufi-basant-2021-spring-arrives-in-hues-of-yellow-at-hazrat-nizamuddin-101613455341333.html
16-02-2021||Lucknow||UP woman set aside ₹5/day for 28 yrs for construction of Ayodhya's Ram Mandir||Krishna Dixit, an 80-year-old woman from Kanpur, donated a little over ₹51,000 for the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. She collected the amount by putting aside ₹5 daily for the last 28 years, said her family members.“I continued saving five rupees a day till date. I am happy I did my bit,” she said. It was in 1992 that she began saving ₹5 per day for the Ram temple construction.A resident of Yashoda Nagar, Kanpur, Dixit recently handed over her savings to the prantiya pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Shri Ram for Ayodhya Ram temple construction.Designated RSS and VHP leaders are going door-to-door to raise funds for the construction of Ram temple and are accepting as little as ₹10 for the cause. Since not more than ₹20,000 can be accepted in cash, Krishna’s contribution, collected over the years, was first deposited into her son Gaurang’s bank account before a cheque could be issued to the RSS leader, said Omendra Awasthi of VHP.“There are so many mothers who are devoted completely to nation-building and playing the role of Jijabai,” said Shri Ram.Also Read: Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra receives ₹1,511 crore in contributionsDixit’s family’s total contribution to Ram temple construction was ₹130,900, which included her grandson Namit Dixit’s first month’s salary, kept aside a year ago, especially for this purpose, said Krishna.“My family was associated with the Ram temple movement since the beginning; I always, like millions of Indians wished to see the Ram temple at his birthplace,” Krishna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-woman-set-aside-rs-5-day-for-28-years-for-ayodhya-ram-mandir-construction-101613454151896.html

16-02-2021||Business||Elon Musk’s Tesla hits mute on Yediyurappa announcing its entry into India||Confusion over the plans of California-based Tesla and its billionaire founder, Elon Musk, in Karnataka continues days after the chief minister BS Yediyurappa issued a statement confirming the former’s imminent entry into India.Ever since Tesla registered a subsidiary in Bengaluru earlier in January, speculation has been rife over the plans of the iconic electric vehicle maker to enter the Indian automobile sector. The company has remained tight-lipped about its plans.People aware of the development say the chief minister signed off on a statement confirming Tesla’s entry sent by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “It was a statement that was sent to the chief minister’s office by the party,” said people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.The intent of the statement, the people said, was to show global investor interest in India.Yediyurappa issued the statement on Saturday confirming that Tesla will indeed set up a manufacturing plant in Karnataka. But talks between the company and the state are where they were last September.“Our officials are in constant touch with Tesla and there is still no agreement on their plans even though we have offered all available options and assistance,” Jagadish Shettar, Karnataka’s minister for large and medium industries said.The chief minister’s statement made headlines globally, heralding Tesla’s venture into the sub-continent as an opportunity to tap the potential of India’s untapped EV sector. Electric vehicles account for less than 1% of the total automobile market estimated at $118 billion and estimated to reach $300 billion by 2026.Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment.The state industries department is engaging with the company that is reported to be in talks with at least three other states in the country.Musk, founder and chief executive officer of the Cupertino-based Tesla, said on Twitter last year that the company plans to enter India “for sure” in 2021. Tesla India has named Vaibhav Taneja, Venkatrangam Sreeram and David Jon Feinstein as the three directors of its Indian subsidiary. Taneja is Tesla’s chief accounting officer; Feinstein is global senior director of trade market access at the company; and Sreeram is an entrepreneur and former Tesla employee who was part of the company’s launch team in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/confusion-over-tesla-s-plans-to-set-up-india-plant-prevails-101613451052987.html

In a statement issued here on Monday, Jayant said the government chose to ignore farmers’ hard work and rising input cost by not increasing the SAP for the third year in a row.“The prices of diesel, electricity, urea etc are rising constantly and farmers were looking forward to an increase in the SAP but the government has disappointed them yet again,” he said.He alleged that the government wanted to decrease the SAP this year but could not dare do this because of ongoing farmers’ agitation. He also claimed that cane farmers’ ₹10,174 crore dues were still pending against the sugar mills.Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Several Delhi borders points remain closed, traffic divertedHindustan Times highlighted on Monday that high-frequency economic indicators suggest that the rural demand growth might be heading into rough weather once again.

Price indexes measure the average growth in prices that farmers receive at the farm gate for their product, and in the prices paid for inputs to production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-hits-out-at-yogi-adityanath-government-for-not-increasing-sugarcane-sap-101613448813956.html

16-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Paradise in the midst of roses||A sea surface dotted with clouds—this is what the blue sky looks like these days, in this brief window of pleasant non-smoggy weather, when the winter has ended and the summer is yet to start.But this view can be experienced only in certain spaces of Delhi, open spaces, unencumbered by trees or monuments, flyovers or towers—such as the BRICS Rose Garden, here in central Delhi’s diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri.This evening the sky is looking like a placid ocean in which white clouds are floating as languidly as Venetian gondolas. The clear light is stained in places by the golden glow of the setting sun, whose slanting rays are streaming through the cool air and drilling straight into the park’s dewy grass. At such a magical hour, the garden is surprisingly empty, except for a woman sitting alone on a bench, and another woman playing absentmindedly with her red dupatta in another side of the garden. At this very moment one knows for certain that the nearby Nehru Park, so much more famous, must be milling with people.Silence is an important character of this park. Its presence is intensely felt each time a passing car on the adjacent avenue blows its horn. The sound of the water falling from the many fountains (lit up with pink lamps) further solidifies the quietude.The park has a circular lawn in the centre. The grass is uneven, making this otherwise tamed space look a tad wild. Roses naturally abound in the rose garden. The poles along the walking track are decked with white roses. Big fat red roses speckle the flower beds. One of the most beautiful sights, however, is of a bench surrounded with flowers that are not roses. It is now taken over by two masked boys. They are chatting, oblivious to the sunset halo setting around the Russian embassy on the other side of the park.Before leaving, do bow at the grand Pilkhan standing by the gate. It has a thick tall trunk pricked from top to bottom with dozens of straight branches. The tree looks like a god with many arms.The garden was set up some years ago to mark the summit between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—the BRICS nations. It lies across the road from the India-Africa Friendship Rose Garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-paradise-in-the-midst-of-roses-101613420530103.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Government to run Gymkhana club for now||The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday dissolved the governing council of the Delhi Gymkhana and appointed an administrator to oversee and check “mismanagement” even as the case that will decide the future of one of the Capital’s hoary old clubs continues at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) .M.M. Juneja, director general of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, took charge of the club on Monday, “As of now we have implemented the order and will look into the issues,” Juneja said. “The case will go on further on merit in the NCLT.”The order criticised the club for “perpetuating apartheid .... under the garb of distinctive character”.President of the disbanded Delhi Gymkhana governing council, Air Marshal (retd.) PS Ahluwalia, said the club will file an appeal in the Supreme Court against the order. “It is incumbent on behalf of the members to challenge the judgment in the Supreme Court and argue the merits of our case.”People familiar with the matter at Delhi Gymkhana said the government’s move to appoint an administrator with immediate effect may keep the club from seeking stay on the order from the Supreme Court. “Whether or not there is an appeal, the club’s management now lies with the government,” one of these people said on condition of anonymity. “The president informed the forum of members on WhatsApp that the council has been disbanded and the detailed judgment will soon follow.”The club has been embroiled in a legal battle for nearly four years, with the ministry of corporate affairs citing nepotism, financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to take over the Delhi Gymkhana club.“Prima facie evidence of mismanagement has been found,” said a senior ministry of corporate affairs official who asked not to be named. “The court has found that it is prejudicial to public interest and has asked for a government administrator to be appointed.”“We are of the considered opinion that the impugned order, in so far as finding in regard to existence of a prima facie case demonstrating that the affairs of the club are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest, does not suffer from any legal infirmity,” the order of NCLAT said . HT has reviewed a copy of the order.HT reported on June 27 that Gymkhana club argued that the functioning of the club was not “prejudicial to public interest” as it is “purely a private club”. All private clubs are governed by their own rules. “It is not a public place such as the Lodhi garden or public marketplaces where the government can even levy parking fees,” a Gymkhana official said then.The appellate tribunal’s order also stayed the club from accepting new membership applications till the waitlist is cleared or increasing fees until NCLT delivers the final judgement.In an interim order, NCLT on June 26 asked the government to appoint two nominees to the governing body of Delhi Gymkhana Club and set up a five-member committee to look into the alleged “irregularities”.In a scathing interim judgment, the tribunal said that the club still had an “imperial mindset”, continued to embrace a colonial past and pandered to the privileged and elite . “It is on record that soon after independence, the caption “Imperial” is wiped off from the name of the club, but I doubt whether it has been wiped off from its mindset,” stated the judgment. “It is not a barb against the club…. there is no space to commoners unless they are positioned on the highest pedestal …”The interim order was challenged by both MCA and Delhi Gymkhana in NCLAT. MCA thought the order was inadequate and the club wanted it overturned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/government-to-run-gymkhana-club-for-now-101613419830663.html
16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Why Katyal not arraigned as accused: Court to CBI in Gurugram land case||Putting CBI yet again in dock, a special court has asked the investigating officer (IO) of the Gurugram land release case to file an affidavit explaining “how, why and under what circumstances” Amit Katyal, director of a real estate company, M/s Krrish Buildtech, has not been included as an accused in the chargesheet.In the February 11 orders, special judge CBI, Jagdeep Singh, had said that in the chargesheet filed by the CBI, there is a specific mention to the effect that “in furtherance of criminal conspiracy entered with Amit Katyal, director of Krrish Buildtech, despite having major discrepancies, accused and former chief town planner JS Redhu dishonestly and fraudulently, proposed to seek approval of the government to grant license to the accused company, by releasing notified land of 130 acre from acquisition proceedings, thereby caused cheating to the related land owners, HUDA, and the state of Haryana.”“But in the array of accused, Katyal has not been arraigned as an accused,” the court stated.The court has directed the IO of the case, deputy superintendent Kailash Sahu, to file an affidavit explaining the position in this regard.Incriminating document recovered during searchThe CBI had on July 9, 2019, conducted searches at the office of Krrish Buildtech in New Delhi, an accused in the case and recovered incriminating documents. A CBI spokesperson said that the agency got hold of 10 incriminating documents from the Jasola office of the real estate company during the search.CBI officials had said that Krrish Buildtech was one of the biggest beneficiaries in the entire episode as about 130 acre, the highest among all realtors, situated across four villages of Nangli Umrapur, Kadarpur, Ulhawas and Maidawas was released from the acquisition for them by the then Congress government.Official-developer nexus angle probedThe agency, in its preliminary enquiry, had tried to establish a nexus between the government functionaries and real estate companies, including Krrish Buildtech.

Bharat Biotech, a Hyderabad-based company, has produced this vaccine. Last week, the Centre had clarified doubts of many states over its use. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan writing a letter to Chattisgarh health minister over his queries on Covaxin. Vardhan had claimed that the vaccine was safe, ‘immunogenic’ and ‘full of efficacy’. Experts, however, claim that the issue with Covaxin is that its clinical efficacy is still being studied in phase-3 clinical trial. “All modalities regarding the use of the vaccine are almost ready after due consultation with experts. We are planning to start administering this vaccine by the end of this week,” said Punjab’s nodal officer for covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.Another health department functionary said states have mostly been using Covishield, developed by Serum Institute of India, Pune. Of 2 crore vaccine doses supplied to states till last week, Covaxin’s share is less than 11%. States that have received the supply of Covaxin have been hesitant in using it.“Like many other states, we also had some issues regarding the use of the vaccine. However, after consulting state government experts and clarifying our concerns with experts from the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), we have decided to use the vaccine,” a Punjab health department functionary said. The protocol and procedure regarding the use of Covaxin will be identical to that of the Covishield and the second dose is also to be given after 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covaxin-shots-to-be-administered-in-punjab-101613419852076.html

16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Finance commission recommends ₹350 crore crop diversification grant for Punjab||The Finance Commission has recommended a grant of ₹350 crore to Punjab for crop diversification in the state with a view to reducing pollution caused by stubble burning and saving groundwater. The grant has been recommended from the 2021-22 to 2025-26 financial year. The commission’s report was tabled in the Lok Sabha by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman two weeks ago and has been accepted “in principle” by the central government. “The Punjab government has sought support for bringing down pollution levels through a shift from paddy to other crops, especially maize. This will also help reduce the air pollution in the northern region,” the commission said while making recommendation for state-specific grant. The spike in pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas in the winter months each year is blamed on fumes from the burning of paddy residue by cultivators in Punjab and Haryana. The request for central funds for crop diversification was made by a state team led by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh during a meeting with the 15th Finance Commission team headed by former bureaucrat NK Singh in Chandigarh in January 2019. The commission, which recommended funds for crop diversification as part of the ₹1,545 crore state-specific grants, has stressed on the need for the state to diversify from paddy and wheat into low water-intensive and high-value crops, including horticulture. Exploitation of the groundwater in Punjab is the highest in the country at 76% as compared to the all-India figure of 16%. “With only 1.5% of India’s geographical area, the state produced 17.4% of the country’s wheat and 11.3% of the rice in 2015-16. The state (where farmers get free power) had the second highest discharge of groundwater through irrigation (34.1 billion cubic metres) in 2017 and the estimated groundwater availability for future irrigation is negative,” the report said, pointing out the state’s declining trend in crop diversification between 1994-95 and 2014-15. The farmers’ over-dependence on water-guzzling paddy crop is seen as one of the main reasons behind the dropping water table. The expert panel headed by former Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, in an interim report titled ‘Medium and Long-Term Post-Covid Economic Strategy for Punjab’ had suggested last year to the state government to reduce the area under common paddy by about 1 million hectares (out of total 3.1 million hectares) over the next 6-7 years to reduce the use of electricity and avoid environmental damage from excess use of water. Agriculture experts have been recommending maize – used as chicken feed – as the best bet for crop diversification for a switch from paddy given its low-water consumption, but its prices saw a sharp drop last year due to a fall in demand from poultry business during the coronavirus pandemic, leaving the farmers disappointed. Other state-specific grants recommended||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finance-commission-recommends-350-crore-crop-diversification-grant-for-punjab-101613419372136.html

The bench of justice TS Dhindsa while seeking response by May 20 said the government may continue with the counselling process but it can’t issue appointment letters without court’s permission. The government counsel was also asked to seek instructions as regards the weightage contemplated for higher qualifications in the advertisement for preparation of the final merit, which, court observed, prima facie runs contrary to the statutory rule. Initially, 1,600 posts were advertised in March 2020 and later increased to 2,364. The court has acted on the plea of one Daljit Kaur and 17 others. The court was told that mode of selection was to be a written test objective type of 100 marks and the final merit list was to be prepared on the basis of the written test and after adding marks for higher qualification. The post in question is governed by the Punjab State Elementary Education (Teaching Cadre) Border Area Group ‘C’ Service Rules 2018. An amendment to the rules was carried out in February 2020 according to which no person can be appointed to the service by way of direct recruitment unless he qualifies in the competitive test as specified from time to time. The final selection of candidates has to be on the basis of their merit in the written examination and no marks is to be given for viva voce or interview, the court was told adding that the language in the statutory rule is unambiguous and to the effect that the final selection of candidates would be on the basis of their merit in the written examination and there would be no marks for viva voce or interview. However, in violation of the rules, additional marks are being given for the higher education. No advertisement can be issued contrary to the statutory rules and no new condition can be imposed or removed in the advertisement without notification of the same in the statutory rules, the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-punjab-from-issuing-appointment-letters-for-2-364-ett-posts-101613419315640.html

This decision came after MU received confirmation letters from collectors of Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Thane rural and other districts with MU-affiliated colleges.“For colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs, we’ll wait for official word from the local civic authorities before taking a call on reopening of institutes. However, we received official intimation from collectors of respective districts and have therefore given colleges in those districts confirmation to reopen,” said an MIU spokesperson. MU has around 800 affiliated colleges across Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri.However, colleges in corporation areas like Mira Bhayander, Ulhasnagar and Navi Mumbai will not open until further directions from MU.Earlier this month, state education minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant had announced that colleges may reopen and not more than 50% of students would be in attendance on campus at any given point of time. MU affirmed this move with a circular that required colleges to approach the local civic authority or collector’s office before restarting classes on campus in a phased manner. The circular also shared Covid-19 safety guidelines as prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).However, on February 12, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials asked that the reopening of colleges be postponed until February 22, to ascertain if the resumption of local train services for the general public leads to a spike in recorded Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. MU has now asked all affiliated colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs to delay reopening of colleges until further notice.City colleges say that the lack of clarity has plunged them in chaos, especially since many were prepared to reopen on Monday. “We are spending a lot of money to carry out sanitisation of the entire campus. Now that the reopening date has been postponed, we’ll have to redo this process next weekend and then continue the same at regular intervals,” said the principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/affiliated-colleges-in-districts-other-than-mumbai-can-reopen-says-university-of-mumbai-101613417212081.html

The police are investigating the matter further,” Deshmukh said on Monday. After a delegation of state Congress demanded probe into the tweets of some Indian celebrities, Deshmukh had promised inquiry into the alleged pressure on the celebrities to tweet in response to the statements by the international celebrities during the farmers’ protest. Deshmukh also clarified that he never ordered for a probe against celebrities such as cricketer Sachin Tendulkar or singer Lata Mangeshkar. “My statement was distorted. I never ordered a probe against them, but had asked to probe the BJP IT cell’s role. Mangeshkar and Tendulkar are respected by every Indian and we have high regard for them,” he said after being discharged from a hospital where he was admitted 12 days ago for Covid-19 treatment.On February 8, state Congress’s delegation, led by general secretary Sachin Sawant, in a meeting with Deshmukh, demanded probe into the tweets. During the meeting, Deshmukh announced to probe on the alleged pressure on celebrities to tweet.Celebrities including Tendulkar, Mangeshkar and Bollywood actors such as Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar took to Twitter on February 3 after international personalities such as Rihanna and climate change activist Greta Thunberg expressed support for the farmers’ protest. The Indian celebrities tweeted using hashtags #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether, framed by the external affairs ministry. “There’s a similar pattern behind the tweets by Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Tendulkar and Saina Nehwal. The contents of the tweets by Nehwal and Kumar are the same, while Shetty had tagged Mumbai BJP’s vice-president Hitesh Jain.

Students would be required to attend college on a rotational basis, but only a handful of institutes have reopened as teachers and students say train schedules need to be more frequent for them to reach college conveniently. Although colleges in urban parts of Thane, Mumbai city and suburban Mumbai are yet to receive permission to reopen, degree and diploma colleges and colleges affiliated to other universities in rural areas were allowed to reopen on Monday. “Colleges have to ensure teachers are tested for Covid-19 before reopening. Moreover, students have to be called on rotational basis and the seating within the classes have also to be arranged accordingly. These notifications are applicable for Shahapur and Murbad talukas as well,” said resident deputy collector of Thane district, Shivaji Patil. Geeta Jayraj, principal of Shivajirao Jondhale College in Asangaon, said, “We are affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) and have not received any circular from MU to reopen and hence, haven’t yet allowed students to attend lectures. We are currently continuing with online classes and it will be difficult for us to take a call unless local trains begin functioning regularly as most students and teachers travel from various places to attend classes.” The Thane Gramin Shikshak Sanghatan has also raised this issue. “Currently, train timings for all are only during morning and afternoon hours. We will either have to request colleges to change timings accordingly or continue with online classes. Teachers will not find it comfortable to commute regularly though bus or other modes of transport,” said Ravi Rajput, a member of Thane Gramin Shikshak Sanghatan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/colleges-in-rural-thane-allowed-to-open-train-timings-a-hassle-for-students-101613415771966.html
16-02-2021||Other||Pune suicide victim’s kin under pressure: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) raised questions over the police probe in the suicide case of a Pune woman in which the name of state forest minister from the Shiv Sena Sanjay Rathod has cropped up. BJP leaders said the police investigation is dubious and the evidences are not properly collated. The 22-year-old victim was popular star on a video-sharing social networking app. She allegedly committed suicide on February 8 in Pune. The police have registered an accidental death case and ruled out any foul play. Though there were talks of foul play, the whole episode gained prominence when 11 audio clips of Rathod talking to his party worker about the victim became viral. State BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh alleged that the victim’s family is under pressure to remain silent. “The woman’s father said that he does not have any complaint against anybody. But at the same time, her grandfather and brother have called for a probe by the criminal investigation department CID in the case. The father appears to be under pressure for obvious reasons. The audio tapes which are in circulation on social media clearly indicate foul play, but the police have not gone through them properly, nor is the data from the victim’s mobile and laptop been retrieved,” she said, questioning how are two eyewitnesses, who stayed with the victim, missing. Wagh also questioned about the whereabouts of Rathod. “He has been missing since the incident. Unfortunately, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said that he does not want his minister to be victimised or his political life be ruined. I think honourable CM has not heard the audio tapes. This is not about the minister’s life – it’s about the life of the victim. The minister should be booked for culpable homicide immediately,” she said. State home minister Anil Deshmukh said, “Pune Police have been probing the case properly as per rules. CM has already said that the probe is in progress as per the laws. Action would be taken on the basis of the probe report. There is no substance in the allegations by the opposition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-suicide-victim-s-kin-under-pressure-bjp-101613415713480.html
16-02-2021||Chandigarh||All bird flu-hit poultry farms sanitised in Mohali||After three weeks of extensive curtailment measures, threat of spread of avian influenza in the district has been successfully countered, informed Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Monday.The administration has been on high alert ever since the bird flu confirmation was received on January 21. Twenty five rapid response teams comprising five members each were deployed for swift action.In the infected farms — Alpha, Royal and Evergreen — in Behera village, nearly 84,505 birds were culled between January 22 and January 29. Subsequently, 2,760 eggs and 1,28,850kg feed was destroyed. This was followed by a period of mopping which lasted for nearly 10 days. Thereafter, large-scale sanitisation measures were initiated, the DC said. These farms have been issued the certificates of sanitisation and the all aspects of the culling operation are complete, he added.Replying to a query regarding the district being free of avian influenza, Dayalan said, “As of now, the threat is over, but it is a bit early to officially declare the zone bird flu free.”For the zone to be declared free of the avian flu, it is mandatory that after the culling, mopping and sanitisation, the area in 10-km radius of the epicentre is monitored closely, the DC said. “The area has to be divided into four zones, frequent sampling has to be conducted and fortnightly testing is to be carried out for two months from each zone. If no more positive samples surface, it is only then that the area is declared bird flu free. In the meantime, formalin spraying after every 15 days has to be done for three months in each of the farms where culling was undertaken; then they can re-start the business,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-bird-flu-hit-poultry-farms-sanitised-in-mohali-101613415712254.html

However, some students taking the exam from remote locations experienced technical issues.Around 84,000 students of various university departments and affiliated colleges appeared in the examinations on Monday.Though majority of the students said they did not face any technical issues during the exams, some of those from remote areas faced problems while downloading the question papers from the university website and uploading their answer sheets.A PU student from Himachal Pradesh, who did not wish to be named, said, “I was not able to download the question paper timely due to network issues and later I faced problems while uploading my answer sheet.”Exams for 78 papers of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses were conducted on the first day in two time slots. According to the instructions given by the university, if the student has opted online mode for the submission of the answer sheet, it should be done within 90 minutes of the completion of the paper in both morning and evening slots.“Despite many attempts, I failed to submit my answer sheet within the given time,” said a student from a PU-affiliated college.The varsity also received queries from students on the first day which were resolved by the controller of examination and his technical team.PU in its official communique said that all the colleges and departments downloaded the question papers as per the scheduled time from PU website and official email IDs provided to them.

The court also imposed a fine of ₹25 lakh on the convicts.According to the CBI, Tarsem Lal Singla, 65, director, Aakriti Constructions and Developments Limited, in connivance with Inderjit Singh, 67, the then senior manager, Punjab and Sindh Bank, submitted fake documents for a loan and caused a loss of ₹3.5 crore to the bank. The bank official allegedly made fake entries and did not maintain a proper record of the loan file. A case was registered in 2013 after a complaint from the bank authorities.The CBI court on February 10 convicted Singh and Singla under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 (1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which pertain to criminal misconduct by a public servant. The sentencing took place on Monday.In court, both convicts pleaded for leniency, citing their age and poor health. However, public prosecutor KP Singh argued for an exemplary punishment to check rampant corruption.Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI, in his order stated that the convicts “have committed economic offences which are detrimental to financial health of the country. Therefore, financial fraud is like a murder and rape”.Stating that the conduct of the two was “highly deplorable”, the judge ordered: “Any softness in this regard could produce an undesirable result, namely encouragement to adoption of corrupt means by public servant in connivance with private party, which has indeed to be checked, and not allow to be increased.”Besides awarding four-year imprisonment to the two, court also imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh on Singh and ₹10 lakh each on Singla and his firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/banker-bizman-get-4-yr-jail-in-loan-fraud-case-in-chandigarh-101613415411785.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC tells ED to not take coercive action against Avinash Bhosale||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday adjourned the hearing of the plea filed by Pune businessman Avinash Bhosale and his son Amit challenging the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) till February 24 after ED gave an oral assurance that it will not take any coercive action against the two. ED had issued summons to the father-son duo in the ongoing investigation into alleged violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). The court directed the duo to cooperate with the investigation and appear before ED officials on February 17 as per summons issued by the central agency.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition of Bhosale and his son, was informed by senior counsel Shirish Gupte that his clients were willing to cooperate with ED in the investigation, but were apprehensive of being arrested by agency officials when they responded to the summons. Hence, the father was seeking directions from the court to ED to refrain from taking coercive action. However, special counsel for ED Hiten Venegaonkar opposed the plea and said the Bhosales had not responded to the summons and hence the plea should not be allowed.The court then observed that as the applicants were willing to cooperate with the investigation, there was no hurry for arresting them. Venegaonkar then orally submitted that if the Bhosales were willing to cooperate and respond to the summons for February 17, ED would not take any coercive action.The court accepted the assurance and directed the Bhosales to respond to the summons and directed ED not to take any coercive action till the next hearing on February 24. The Bhosales have been accused of violation of FEMA and ED had initiated investigations last year. The duo approached the HC last week after ED raided their office premises in Pune on Tuesday and Wednesday and brought Amit along with them for interrogation in the case. Amit was interrogated for around 18 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-tells-ed-to-not-take-coercive-action-against-avinash-bhosale-101613415111786.html

Kappan won from Pala legislative assembly in Kottayam during Kerala Assembly elections held in 2016. The decision was taken after Kappan’s decision to join the United Democratic Front (UDF) led by the Congress.The NCP is one of the partners of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) coalition in the state and has two legislators in the 140-seat assembly. The coalition is led by the Communist Party of India (M) and Communist Party of India (CPI).A statement released by the NCP on Monday states, “Sharad Pawar [NCP president] has expelled Mani C Kappan from the party with immediate effect for anti-party activities.”Ahead of Kerala Assembly elections, LDF had planned to handover Pala, the legislative assembly seat in contention, to the Kerala Congress party which has recently joined the coalition after breaking its decade-old alliance with UDF. Kappan was upset with the move. The former NCP leader had claimed the support of seven district presidents and nine office-bearers of the NCP and had decided to part ways with the party and LDF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-expels-kerala-legislator-mani-kappan-over-anti-party-activities-101613414991881.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai breathes cleanest air of the year||The city breathed its cleanest air so far this year as rising temperatures and wind from the sea cleared up pollution. Mumbai recorded an air quality index (AQI) — pollution measuring indicator — of 115 on Monday, significantly down from 186 on Sunday. The AQI was in the moderate category. Before this, the city’s lowest AQI this year was 156 (moderate) on January 19.AQI is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Of the 10 locations measured, only Andheri recorded poor quality air, with an AQI of 208. Malad recorded an AQI of 173 and Navi Mumbai recorded 157, both in the moderate category.On September 4, 2019, Mumbai recorded its all-time best AQI of 12 since SAFAR began measuring air quality in June 2015. Last year on June 30, the city equalled its best AQI of 12. “Temperatures have been on the rise for some time now, bringing down pollution levels. Clean winds from the ocean have further improved the air quality in Mumbai. It is expected to remain in the moderate category for the next two days,” said a spokesperson for SAFAR. Meanwhile, minimum temperatures increased slightly. At the Colaba station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a minimum temperature of 21.2 degrees Celsius was recorded, up from Sunday’s 20.5 degrees Celsius and a degree above normal. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature was up from Sunday’s 19.4 degrees Celsius to 20.2 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees above normal.The maximum temperature at Colaba was 29.4 degrees Celsius, which was at par with normal. At Santacruz, the maximum temperature was 29.9 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-breathes-cleanest-air-of-the-year-101613414932058.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai duo sets up strawberry farm, officials plan to replicate model||Navi Mumbai residents may not have to travel to Mahabaleshwar to see a strawberry farm anymore as an uncle-nephew duo from Panvel successfully cultivated strawberries in Vavanje village of Panvel taluka. Strawberries grow only at places with cold temperature, and yet Sajjan Pawar, 40, and his nephew Prashant Pawar, 32, decided to try to cultivate it in Panvel. Panvel taluka officials claimed this is a first such experiment in Panvel and could now be replicated in other parts of the taluka. “During a farmer’s exhibition at Khandeshwar in 2019, we saw that farmers from Mahad had cultivated strawberry. We wondered if they can then why can’t we. The climate at both the places are more or less the same,” Prashant said. The uncle-nephew duo purchased 100 saplings and cultivated them in a small area in Vavanje in November 2019. The saplings bore fruits after a month and half. “After the experiment was successful, we decided to try it at a larger scale. So, in 2020, we purchased 1,000 saplings and cultivated them in 714 square metre (sqm) land in December. By February, all the saplings bore fruits which tasted at par with the ones from Mahabaleshwar,” Pawar said. The duo has already started getting orders for strawberries and is selling it locally at ₹250 per kg. They also took part in the state government’s ‘vikel te pikel’ scheme. The duo plans to cultivate strawberries in a much larger patch of land by the end of this year. “Next, we are planning to target at least a five-acre land to cultivate the strawberries,” Prashant said. While Pawar is a resident of Kanpoli village, Prashant stays in Palebudruk in Panvel, and both belong to farming families. “When it comes to vegetables, a little variation in quantity of water doesn’t make any difference. But for strawberries, temperature and quantity of water plays a major role. It is not as easy as growing vegetables. One has to keep in mind the temperature and water the plants accordingly. If it’s cold, then the watering is done in the evening. If the climate is warm, the watering is done in the morning. One has to also see that there are no sun rays directly falling on the crops while watering them,” said Pawar, who is also pursuing diploma in agricultural extension services for input dealer (DAESI) from Khopoli. The biggest challenge to grow the crop in Panvel was the quality of sand. Mahabaleshwar has red sand while, in Panvel, the land has mushy mud. With MIDC area nearby, pollution was another challenge the duo faced. “Even with all the challenges, we managed to grow the crops in an organic way without using any chemicals and fertilisers. We used 25 micron mulching paper that kept the fruits away from the mud so that it doesn’t get spoilt. The paper also helps to keep the plant cool and doesn’t let any other grass grow besides the crop,” Prashant said. Dattatrey Nawale, sub-regional officer, Panvel taluka, who visited the farm, said, “It is the first-ever experiment in Panvel and hence I visited them. The fruit indeed was very sweet and it would be a good initiative if other farmers of Panvel too think of doing the same. Panvel rural area has a lot of barren land which could be utilised for strawberry farming in winters, and to motivate the same, I have written to Raigad collector to suggest a scheme to fit in strawberry cultivation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-duo-sets-up-strawberry-farm-officials-plan-to-replicate-model-101613414811829.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Four minors booked for gang-rape of 13-year-old near Mumbai||Four minors have been booked by the police for allegedly gang-raping a 13-year-old girl in Thane rural. The accused also threatened to kill her parents if she told anyone about the incident. All four accused in the case are minors, said Ganeshpuri police.While the incident took place in July last year, the survivor narrated the ordeal to her family on Sunday. After hearing about it, her father went after one of the accused and was assaulted by him. The father then approached social workers who approached the police, following which a case was registered against the four. The incident took place in July when the minor was returning home after buying some groceries. One of the accused allegedly asked her to go to an old isolated bungalow near the village and then he and three of his friends took turns to rape her. They allegedly threatened that they would kill her father and asked her not to tell anyone about it. A few days later, two of the accused got hold of her, brought her to the bungalow and raped her. A police officer said, “On Sunday, the girl’s father saw one of the accused making obscene gesture towards his daughter and got into a scuffle with him. He approached a social organisation, who took the girl into confidence when she revealed her ordeal. The organisation brought the girl to the police station and the four were booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/four-minors-booked-for-gang-rape-of-13-year-old-near-mumbai-101613414631661.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees rise in Covid cases: ‘No lockdown yet, but keeping watch’||The Maharashtra government is unlikely to impose a fresh lockdown, amid a steady spike in Covid-19 cases, as it continues to monitor the situation. However, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the government may have to take some harsh decisions as people have stopped observing Covid-appropriate behaviour.According to data released by the government on Monday, Maharashtra reported 3,365 new Covid cases, 23 deaths and 3,105 recoveries. In total, India’s worst-affected state has reported 2,067,643 cases, 51,552 deaths and 1,978,708 recoveries. Monday was the sixth consecutive day the state reported more than 3,000 Covid-19 infections (from February 10 to 15, it recorded 3,451; 3,297; 3,670; 3,611; 4,092 and 3,365 cases respectively), alarming authorities as the graph had hit a plateau over the past three months.Meanwhile, Pawar said he will discuss the Covid-19 situation with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government has directed all district collectors and municipal commissioners to strictly follow the 3T principle (testing, tracking and treatment) and increase Covid-19 testing at all places where a spike in cases is seen. Tope ruled out an immediate lockdown in the state, but said the local administration will take measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed by the people at large.According to state officials, several factors, including restarting of local trains for general public, increased mingling among groups and non-compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour are some of the reasons behind rise in daily cases across the state, including Mumbai, in the past five days. About 3.5 million people have been travelling by suburban trains that run in Mumbai and neighbouring areas since local trains were opened for general public with restricted hours on February 1. Besides, there is a spurt in activities as the state government has gradually removed restrictions on various activities, including permission for restaurants and shops to operate till 1am and 11pm respectively. The spike in cases has prompted the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to have a second thought about further unlocking or relaxations in the city, including increasing travel timings of suburban trains for the general public. Civic officials said they would watch the situation for a week and take any further decision on relaxation and unlocking on February 22. The city has been reporting over 500 cases since February 10. On February 15, it reported 493 cases, while on Sunday, the city recorded 645 Covid-19 cases followed by four deaths. Overall, the city has reported 314,569 Covid-19 cases followed by 11,422 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 94% and mortality rate is 3.63%.“People must follow Covid appropriate rules and the authorities should also ensure that they are strictly followed. They will also have to be held accountable if they find any negligence. If this is not done then lockdown is required to be re-imposed to control the situation like it is going on in many western countries. The United Kingdom is experiencing a third lockdown cycle,” Tope told reporters in Aurangabad. He added that lockdown is the last resort if the situation doesn’t improve. Pawar said people have stopped using masks, which is very dangerous. “While touring this morning I saw villagers and people at large were not using masks at all. It is very dangerous and will cost us dearly. Tomorrow (Tuesday), we will be discussing the rise in Covid cases with the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray). Maybe we have to take some harsh decisions,” Pawar told reporters.The increase in cases in Mumbai has come ten days after local trains, considered to be the lifeline of the city, was restarted for the general public from February 1. General public is allowed to travel from the first train of the day up to 7am; 12pm to 4pm and later post 9pm till the last train. On suspending local train services in Mumbai and surrounding cities, Tope said that they have started local train services only recently and that too with staggered timings. They have purposely decided not to keep timings for the common people comfortable only to avoid crowding in trains. “We are monitoring the situation and see no reason to take extreme steps immediately. It is a fact that Covid cases have increased, but they have gone up by not more than 500. It has certainly alarmed us and our focus will be on the preventive measures to bring back the situation under control. Lockdown restrictions and suspending local train services would be the last step in this process,” the health minister said.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “We are not taking any decision for now. We will monitor the situation until February 22 and post this, a decision on further unlocking will be taken.”According to data released by the government on Monday, the state reported 3,365 new Covid cases, 23 died and 3,105 recovered. So far, the state has reported 2,067,643 cases, 51,552 people have died and 1,978,708 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-rise-in-covid-cases-no-lockdown-yet-but-keeping-watch-101613414513350.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body releases frozen ₹350-crore corporators’ funds||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday released ₹350 crore of corporators’ funds which was frozen by the civic body on Friday. The money was part of ₹750 crore funds allotted by the standing committee to corporators to carry out discretionary civil development works in their electoral wards, which was not spent yet. It was frozen after Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Vinod Mishra filed a complaint with the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) last week, alleging misappropriation of a larger part of the funds to buy freebees in Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav’s constituency in Byculla. Mishra had also made a formal complaint with the municipal commissioner last week regarding misappropriate use of corporators’funds.The BJP challenged the administration’s decision to freeze the funds at a press conference held on Monday afternoon at the civic headquarters in Fort. BJP leader Bhalchandra Shirsat said, “The administration cannot freeze funds that have been duly allotted to corporators’ corpus via the standing committee’s approval. Any decision regarding this amount needs to be taken with the standing committee’s approval.”Municipal commissioner IS Chahal confirmed on Monday evening that the funds were released by the administration.The BJP on Monday also filed a first information report (FIR) against Jadhav for using abusive words and threatening violence toward himself and Mishra via a chat on a messaging application that took place on Sunday morning. The party also said that it will file a defamation case against Jadhav for making public allegations regarding Mishra’s involvement in Khichdi scam. Making the chat public, Mishra said, “Jadhav has also threatened to end his life. I have urged the home minister and chief minister to give him due police protection, so he does not harm himself. I will not be held responsible if he does something to himself.”Regarding allegations of the chat, Jadhav denied exchanging such messages with Mishra. He said, “The chat has been falsified.

16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Parking fee hiked by 20% in Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents will now have to shell out more to park their vehicles at the lots under the municipal corporation. Parking fee for four-wheelers has been increased from ₹10 to ₹12, and for two-wheelers, from ₹5 to ₹6. The hike came into force after the parking contractors implemented the annual increment of 20%, as per the agreement signed with the MC.“The new rates will be applicable for the entire year. For one contractor, these would be valid till December 24 this year, and for the other, till January 1, 2022,” said SK Jain, additional commissioner, MC.The hikes comes in the backdrop of the contractors failing to introduce smart features in the parking lots, even as the MC earlier claimed it would begin in a phased manner.“The contractors are in the last stages of implementing smart features in their allotted parking zones. It will take another 15-20 days for becoming fully operational, after which hourly charges will come into force,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/parking-fee-hiked-by-20-in-chandigarh-101613414451857.html
16-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC inches towards pan-city garbage collection||The Chandigarh municipal corporation on Monday inched closer to taking over door-to-door garbage collection across the city with its General House approving terms of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be signed with the cart-based waste lifters.The Door to Door Garbage Collector Society, which represents majority of this unorganised sector in the city, had last week given its consent to the MoU.Most demands of the collectors, including sharing of user charges, life insurance, welfare fund and disbursal of income generated through sale of usable dry waste among them, have been incorporated in the MoU, said mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, who had called a special meeting of the House.However, the demand of some of them to continue with cart-based garbage collection and collection of user charges by them instead of the MC have been rejected and cannot be met, he added, during the debate on the issue.The MC, which took over garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30 on December 22, has so far struggled to implement it properly as most of the door-to-door garbage collectors have stayed away from manning its collection vehicles, as planned earlier.So far, of 1,342 garbage collectors in the city, only 609 have enrolled with the MC and just 147 have started working on its vehicles as helpers and drivers. Not getting adequate number of collectors to drive its vehicles, the MC had to depute its outsourced sanitation workers as drivers. It also failed to pick garbage from the doorsteps as collectors remained non-cooperative.What’s in it for garbage collectorsAs per the approved MoU, waste collectors will work as drivers or sanitation assistants on the MC vehicles. They will provide the list of households covered by them right now and the amount charged. The cumulative amount will become the base amount for their monthly payment from the civic body, with 10% annual hike. Half of the fine collected from residents who fail to segregate waste will also be distributed among the garbage collectors.Those with valid driving licence will be given preference for the posts of driver. The MC will also outsource the work of drivers, and those engaged for the purpose will have to clear a driving test within six months of joining.A welfare fund with a corpus of ₹10 lakh will be formed for the garbage collectors, and they will be given free medical treatment besides protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. If any collector can’t come to work for a long period due to illness or leave, any person from their family can work instead.MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “We will ask sanitary inspectors to get the MoU signed in their areas, which will be done within this week. We already have around 230 drives, and would get more after the House approval to the MoU. The service in southern sectors will also be started in parallel. ”What it means for youTimings of garbage collection will be decided by each area councillor in consultation with RWAs.The user charges will be added to the water bill. Residents who fail to segregate dry and wet waste at source will be fined.A toll-free phone number will be provided for residents to register their complaintsHouse sees heated debate on issueEarlier, there were heated arguments among councillors, even between those from the ruling BJP. Former mayors Rajesh Kalia and Davesh Moudgil sparred over annual increment in payment to collectors. Moudgil supported 10% increase, but insisted that residents shouldn’t be burdened because of it.A high drama took place when leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla called up a complaining resident and put the phone on a microphone during the meeting. After BJP councillors objected to it, the MC commissioner had to intervene and ask Babla to maintain the dignity of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-inches-towards-pan-city-garbage-collection-101613414271737.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Partho Dasgupta rigged ratings in connivance with anchor of news channel: State to HC||While opposing the bail application of Partho Dasgupta, former CEO of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) who is one of the 16 accused named in the television rating points (TRP) manipulation case, the state informed the Bombay high court (HC) that Dasgupta had rigged TV ratings since 2017 in connivance with the anchor of a news channel and had also silenced an employee who had raised objections to the sudden spike in the ratings of an English news channel. The single bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the bail application of Dasgupta who is lodged in Taloja jail, was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Shardul Singh that the police had violated the fundamental rights of Dasgupta by keeping him behind bars even after they filed a charge sheet on January 11. Ponda submitted that as per the charge-sheet, while the role of the other accused in the TRP manipulation case was more serious, they were all out on bail or pre-arrest bail except Dasgupta. Ponda further submitted that the charge-sheet itself admitted a more severe role of another co-accused, Romal Ramgirha, the COO of BARC, but he was granted bail within six days of his arrest. Further, Dasgupta also submitted that as the trial was not going to start soon, keeping him behind bars would affect his health as he suffered from various ailments including spinal problems. Ponda added that the WhatsApp chats with Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami that the charge-sheet referred to were loose talks and hence could not be grounds to keep Dasgupta behind bars. He further said that the chats were from the time when Republic TV had not even started. Thus, in light of the facts, he should be granted bail. Ponda also refuted the allegations made in the charge-sheet of Dasgupta receiving silver ornaments and expensive watches from Goswami for manipulating the TRP and said that there were invoices which proved that Dasgupta had purchased them from various places and had the income tax returns to prove the same. Special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray for the state, however, opposed the application and submitted that though Dasgupta was the CEO and Ramgarhia was in charge of finances, it was Dasgupta who manipulated the ratings. Hiray submitted a statement recorded by the police after the charge-sheet was filed wherein an employee of BARC who was forced to manipulate the ratings said that when she informed Dasgupta and Ramgarhia of the sudden spike in TV ratings she was threatened to comply or face transfer to another department. Hiray further added that though BARC was a unique company and was given the task of providing for TV channels across the country, Dasgupta had misused his powers and position to benefit certain channels. Pointing to the investigation initiated by Mumbai Police, Hiray submitted that BARC had initiated a forensic audit in February 2020 wherein it had come to light that in 2017, the ratings of certain TV channels had shown a sudden spike. Hiray submitted that the statement of the employee corroborated the role of Dasgupta in manipulating the ratings. Hiray then informed the court that the state was in the process of challenging the bail of some of the accused including Ramgarhia and the same would be filed soon.He added that the WhatsApp chats regarding the security of the nation between Dasgupta and Goswami were part of the charge-sheet but were not part of the current investigation.Hiray will continue arguments opposing the bail application on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/partho-dasgupta-rigged-ratings-in-connivance-with-anchor-of-news-channel-state-to-hc-101613414152799.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Delay in fellowships pushes research scholars in science and tech institutes into debt||It has been four months since Kishalay Ghosh, 26, from Hooghly in West Bengal, joined as a research scholar at a research institute funded by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), but is yet to receive his fellowship.Ghosh joined the Tata Memorial Centre Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC) in Kharghar on November 2, 2020. Since then, he has been forced to borrow money from friends and family to meet expenses in the absence of his eligible fellowship dues.Ghosh, like many research scholars, is eligible for the junior research fellowship (JRF) programme of the CSIR which pays over ₹38,000 including housing allowance. “I am up to my eyes in debt. There’s hardly any friend left from whom I haven’t borrowed any money. My father is the only other earning member in the family and he is close to retirement,” said Ghosh. Living in a rented accommodation, his expenses amount to almost ₹12,000 a month. Ghosh’s plight is shared by many research scholars in CSIR-funded institutes across the state who said the disbursal of fellowship amounts was irregular. “The fellowships are an incentive for researchers. But since they are irregular, most of us live in debt. Even when the funds are disbursed, they are spent on paying back loans,” said a JRF scholar at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.CSIR, the apex body that runs the fellowships programme for both junior and senior researchers in science and technology institutes, said the delay in disbursements was a matter of concern. “We at CSIR cannot avoid taking the responsibility of delay in fellowship disbursal. Payments are released only after attendance and claim are certified by the host Institute, which often has a delay rate of two to four months. During the pandemic it went up to four to seven months as well,” said A Chakraborty, head, Human Resource Development Group-CSIR, which handles fellowships.In Ghosh’s case, his fellowship is yet to be activated by CSIR. The host institute took 2.5 months to send his papers and CSIR was responsible for another delay of 1.5 months, said Chakraborty. CSIR releases funds directly into the bank accounts of research scholars in its 703 host institutes. However, funds are released only after receiving approved bills from host institutes. Annually, CSIR spends over ₹500 crore annually towards fellowship schemes. The fellowship schemes provide financial support to scholars for a maximum of 60 months (5 years) for pursuing research work. Every year around 2,500 scholars join various institutes for PhD programmes and around 1,500 complete their term. “We are concerned with the delay and would like to urge scholars to cooperate in sending timely bills from their institutes. For example, for the month of February, only 28 of the 703 institutes have submitted their claim bills on the due date which is 5th of every month,” said Chakraborty. CSIR is currently in the process of building an online fellowship management portal that grants full access to scholars about the status of their fellowship. The portal is likely to be released in three months, said Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delay-in-fellowships-pushes-research-scholars-in-science-and-tech-institutes-into-debt-101613414151683.html

They were identified as Sukhwinder Singh (36), Keval Singh (40), Sukhwinder Singh (32), and Kulvir Singh (27). A video clip, that is now doing the rounds of social media, had purportedly shown one of them being washed away from a cliff on the hydel plant.Patience and hope fast wearing thin, their kin are now camping at Chamoli town, hoping to bring them back—dead or alive. Ajmer Singh, the sarpanch of Purba village, said that all the missing persons were daily wage labourers, who were working at the plant to eke out a living. Bahadur Singh, father of Kulvir Singh, who is in Chamoli with the relatives of other missing men of the village, spoke to Hindustan Times over the phone. “We have been told that my son, along with the other three from our village, was among those labourers who fell off the cliff at the hydel plant,” he said. Bahadur Singh’s younger son Harpal was also present at the spot but miraculously survived.He said that while rescue teams were carrying out search operations in the tunnel, no search has been carried out at the place where the four men are suspected to have been trapped.“It has been nine days to the incident. Though their chances of survival are thin, we cannot return home without receiving some information,” said Bahadur Singh.Meanwhile, those back home are inconsolable. Harjeet Kaur, wife of Sukhwinder Singh, said, “It has been nine days but I still have received no information about my husband.” She says life has played a cruel joke on her and her three children. The condition of Rani Kaur, wife of Keval Singh was no different. She too has three children and said Keval was the only breadwinner of the family.Kulwinder Kaur, wife of Sukhwinder Singh, says she won’t give up hope and is praying for her husband’s safe return. Congress MLA Amrik Singh Dhillon, who had visited the families, assured all possible help to them. “It is saddening that there is still no news about the four persons from Purba village. They were the sole breadwinners of their families. I have collected their details and shared it with the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and sought all possible support for the families,” said Dhillon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ukhand-flash-floods-9-days-on-no-trace-of-four-missing-ludhiana-men-101613414092032.html

He was identified as Moti Lal alias Modi. The addict, Amit Kapoor, 32, of Kanganwal, told the police that he had murdered Lal to seek revenge for an 18-year-old boy, who was allegedly sodomised by Lal. Kapoor said that to teach the 55-year-old a lesson, he, along with the teen boy, hatched a conspiracy and killed him with sharp-edged weapons. The duo had chopped off the head and dumped the body at vacant plot in Kanganwal. Police have recovered the mutilated body, which was in a highly decomposed state, from the spot. Sahnewal station house officer said that Kapoor had confessed to someone about the crime while he was sitting at a tea stall in Kanganwal, under the influence of drugs. Someone at the stall tipped-off the police following which cops arrested Kapoor from the spot and started questioning him. It was then that he revealed where the body had been dumped. Kapoor also told the police that his 18-year-old accomplice had left the city without informing him. On Monday, he had traced the teen to Mandi Gobindgarh but when he reached there, the teen and his friends beat him up.The SHO said the owner of the plot, where the body was found, had installed barbed wires on the boundary, due to which the place rarely had any visitors and so the body had not been discovered for so long.Police have lodged a case of murder against Kapoor and launched a manhunt for his teen accomplice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-on-drugs-ludhiana-man-confesses-murder-arrested-101613414033298.html
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Only 71 health workers in Mumbai get Covid-19 second dose||Only 71 healthcare workers got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Monday – the first day of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) drive for this category. The 71 are among the 1,926 who received the first dose on January 16, the day the first phase of the vaccination drive began. The low number of beneficiaries has been attributed to a technical problem with the Co-WIN portal, due to which all beneficiaries who turned up at the vaccination centres could not be vaccinated. The second dose can be administered after 28 days since the administration of the first dose. Overall, the BMC vaccinated 5,203 people on Monday including those who turned up for the first and second dose, with a turnout of 50%. Of these, 1,593 were health care workers and 3,610 were frontline workers. Four beneficiaries reported minor adverse events following immunization (AEFI) such as dizziness, and were kept under observation for 30 minutes before being discharged So far, the BMC has vaccinated a total of 119,339 healthcare and frontline workers with the first dose, of which 91,627 are healthcare workers and 27,783 are frontline workers. In addition, a total of 71 healthcare workers have been given the second dose. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of BMC’s public health department, said, “There were some issues with the Co-WIN application. It will be streamlined from Tuesday.” In the past few days, the turnout of frontline workers has been better than healthcare workers. On Saturday, 3,864 frontline workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 69%, whereas 2618 healthcare workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 60%. Similarly, on Friday, 3,979 frontline workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 70%, whereas 2,382 healthcare workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 11%. On Thursday, 3,781 frontline workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 67%, and 1,989 healthcare workers were vaccinated with a turnout of 51%. The BMC on Sunday shortlisted 20 private hospitals who will be allowed to start Covid-19 vaccination centres to inoculate their own staff. A training session for staff from these 20 hospitals will be held on Tuesday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of the public health department in BMC, said, “After the training, we will give the go-ahead for private hospitals to vaccinate their own staff. Some may not be able to start the drive on their premises immediately from Wednesday, due to logistics issues.” Presently, BMC has 23 vaccination centres across the city for the drive, which include the temporary jumbo facilities set up at BKC, NESCO in Goregaon, and Dahisar and Mulund jumbo facilities. Dr Sachin Jain, from Hinduja Hospital at Khar, said, “I took the second dose on Monday. In the last one month, I have taken both doses of Covishield, and have not reported any adverse effects. I was having only mild weakness and mild fever after first dose, but nothing further. I urge all our citizens to go and take the vaccine shot when they get the chance as it is completely safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-71-health-workers-in-mumbai-get-covid-19-second-dose-101613414032325.html

Those booked have been identified as Mannu Dubey and his aides Jenta, Nikhil, Vishal and Tarsem Singh. They were booked on the complaint of Gurdass Singh, 23, of Sangrur, who along with a friend Deepak stays on rent at Dubey’s house in Sector 15 for the past one year. After the firing, the Congress leader had accused her tenant and his friends of creating ruckus and opening fire outside her house. Claiming that she had tried to mislead police, Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, said: “Investigations so far have pointed out that shots were fired by Dubey’s group. The person who opened fire has been identified. The accused had even assaulted the tenants. We have got them medically examined.” Police have also recovered empty shells and a live cartridge from the spot.

16-02-2021||Noida||SKM seeks ‘unconditional’ release of activist Disha Ravi, Tikait shies away||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of various farmers’ unions, on Monday demanded an “unconditional release” of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi who was arrested by the Delhi Police from her Bengaluru house on Saturday for her alleged involvement in the ‘toolkit’ case.However, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait stayed away from the controversy, saying he didn’t know about the ‘toolkit’ case.“SKM is deeply concerned and anguished about the brazen misuse of police power by the government in its efforts to weaken the ongoing farmers’ movement. It condemns the arrest of young environmental activist Disha Ravi without due procedures being followed. SKM demands her immediate unconditional release,” the SKM said in a statement issued on Monday.The SKM in a statement on Sunday had “condemned” Ravi’s arrest and said that “she stood in support of the farmers”.However, Tikait, who is also the national spokesperson of BKU, said, “We don’t know why the girl (Ravi) who planted trees has been arrested. I don’t know what toolkit is. Messages nowadays are going to different parts of the world through social media and several arrests are being made. When talks will be held, all issues will be discussed,” Tikait said at the UP Gate on Monday, while reiterating that an inquiry should be taken up into the incident of hoisting of a flag at the Red Fort.Ravi was arrested as she was one of the editors of a toolkit that, according to the police, “indicates a copycat execution of a conspiracy” behind the January 26 violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi.Tikait visits ‘school’ at protest siteMeanwhile, Tikait also donned the role of a teacher when he went to one of the camps at the protest site where children from nearby slums are taught by some volunteers.“Soon after their birth, these children have to hold garbage in hands. It is not their fault but a result of faulty policies. It is unfortunate that they are at the border of Delhi but don’t know the alphabets,” Tikait said.During his interaction with the kids, he also called one of the children to come up and recite the alphabets written over a chart paper hung up as a blackboard.The volunteers teaching the children at the makeshift school said that most of the children belong to ragpickers’ families. “We started the school on January 22, and now we have about 100 children. We will teach them till the agitation goes on, and thereafter we will try that these kids get admission in nearby schools. We will speak to the administration as well,” said Dev Kumar, a volunteer who teaches children at the camp.“Tikait ji also visited our camp and told children about benefits of planting trees and also staying away from cold drinks. He also gave them lessons in moral science and told us to keep up the work we are doing,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/skm-seeks-unconditional-release-of-activist-disha-ravi-tikait-shies-away-101613413431579.html
16-02-2021||Noida||Government wants to prolong agitation, says Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Monday that the central government wants to “prolong the ongoing farmers’ agitation” and hopes “it will die down in the next two months”.His remarks came as the stalemate between the farmers and the central government continues, with no talks held since January 22.Tikait, who was at Uttar Pradesh Gate on Monday, asked the members of the farmers’ committee to make arrangements for summer as small gatherings near the dais would otherwise send wrong signals.“It seems the government wants to stretch the ongoing agitation and hope that it will die down in another two months. They think low gathering means that the agitation is coming to an end. But they should not misunderstand this, it will continue,” Tikait said.He also asked farmers from different regions to be present at the site, according to respective harvesting work.During an all-party meeting on January 30, 2021, ahead of the Budget session on February 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that “the Centre stands by the offer to the farmers by Union agriculture minister Naresh Tomar”. As part of the offer, the government proposed staying the implementation of the three controversial farm laws for one and half years.However, there was violence in Delhi when farmers, many from Uttar Pradesh Gate, carried out a massive tractor rally on Republic Day (January 26). Many farmer leaders including Tikait were also booked by the Delhi Police.“With the present scenario, either the farmers will find a way out, or the government will. We told them to talk to the farmers for a solution. If we hold rallies in other states, questions related to political motives will be raised,” he added.“This agitation will continue, and we know that they (the government) will not understand so easily as they have got votes without even asking. They are asking for money in the name of temples, and we are asking for atta (flour) for our agitation. The temple will be constructed and if they want, they can get it constructed with the help of interest from our pending sugarcane payment which is about ₹12,000 crore,” Tikait said, adding that the fight now is to save their land, and not about any banner or flag (of the farmer unions).He also asked the farmer unions to apply for a 100-kilowatt electricity connection at the protest site, and if it is not provided, generators should be set up. The farmers will continue their protest by running desert coolers during the summer.When India got freedom there were many people who came out of jail when they opted for pardon on promise that they will not be part of any agitation, he said. “But this agitation has no such people. It has people who are fighting for their land and rights. They are protesting so that future generations do not have to hold any agitation,” he added.The farmers have been camping at the protest site near Uttar Pradesh Gate since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of the farm laws, and a new law on minimum support price (MSP).Tikait, who has been spearheading the farmers’ protest at Uttar Pradesh Gate, grew in stature after he broke down in front of media persons on January 28 and made an emotional appeal to the people to bring food and water for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/government-wants-to-prolong-agitation-says-rakesh-tikait-101613413311005.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Five arrested in two murders in Ghazipur, Patparganj: Delhi Police||Police on Monday said they had solved two murder cases reported between Saturday and Sunday from east Delhi’s Ghazipur and Patparganj Industrial Area after arresting five men and apprehending a minor boy.In the Ghazipur case, police have arrested four men and detained a boy while a 50-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his 42-year-old wife using a Rampi, a sharp tool used by cobblers, in Patparganj Industrial Area on Sunday, the police said.Police said the arrested husband suspected his wife, who worked as a domestic help, of having a relationship with her employer. She was murdered in front of her son, who is married, and the employer. The husband fled the crime scene but was caught from near Ghazipur vegetable market on Sunday night itself, said deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav.DCP Yadav said that the woman’s employer had helped her son get an accommodation in his neighbourhood at Ghazipur village after his marriage earlier this month. The woman had also started living with her son and daughter-in-law. But her husband suspected her of having an affair with her employer, the DCP said.On Sunday around 8 am, the woman’s husband came to her son’s home and insisted that she return with him. When she refused, an altercation broke out between them. The woman’s employer tried to pacify the situation by asking her to go to his house and finish her work. “Soon, the husband attacked her with a Rampi on her neck and fled,” added the DCP.In the other case, a 25-year-old man was strangled to death and his head was crushed with a stone allegedly by five persons, including a minor boy, because he had allegedly abused and slapped the boy during an argument in a park on Friday (January 12) in Indirapurm, Ghaziabad. All five have been apprehended in the case, DCP Yadav said.Police said that the body of Aayush (single name) with his head crushed was discovered in bushes at a vacant plot near Ghazipur paper market on Saturday. A murder case was registered and during the investigation the police arrested Kapil after his involvement in the case was established through technical and human intelligence. Kapil’s interrogation led to the arrest of Javedm Rah and Gaurav and the apprehension of the minor boy.During the interrogation, the DCP said, it was revealed that Ayush and the minor boy were friends. On February 2, Ayush had asked him to accompany him to Mussoorie and arrange money for the trip. On February 12, the two met at the Indirapuram park where Ayush told him that his girlfriend will also accompany them. But the boy opposed it and it led to the altercation during which Ayush abused and slapped him, the DCP said.“The boy told his three friends about it and they decided to kill Ayush.

The Ganga water supply will be restored after 15 days,” said Subendhu Chaudhary, UPJN project manager.Noida, which receives around 240-million-litre Ganga water per day, will now have to depend on groundwater. The residents won’t face any problem as they will get adequate drinking water from the groundwater reservoirs, and proper water supply pressure will be maintained in all the sectors, the Noida authority said.“We have adequate resources to continue the water supply,” said RP Singh, senior manager of the Noida authority.Noida needs around 330-million-litre water supply — 240-million-litre from the Ganga, and the remaining is groundwater.Meanwhile, UPJN project manager at Ghaziabad’s Pratap Vihar Reservoir said the groundwater supply has been disrupted for the last two days, as the silt is being cleaned following the Chamoli incident, near Rishi Ganga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganga-water-supply-to-noida-to-be-disrupted-for-15-days-101613413012145.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Families of those arrested for R-Day violence face backlash||Devender Singh, who runs an electrical fittings shop in Nehru Vihar area of north Delhi’s Timarpur, says customers have been avoiding to come to his shop ever since his brother, Satbir, was arrested by the police in connection with the violence during the tractor rally on Republic Day.“Our business is hit because customers have stopped coming to our shop. Our neighbours hardly speak to us. Even our relatives are not supporting us. They feel that my brother’s arrest in the Republic Day violence case has brought shame to our family. They all consider my brother a culprit, even though a court is yet to decide his fate,” says Devender. Satbir was arrested on February 8 in connection with the violence at Burari when hundreds of farmers clashed with the police after deviating from a pre-approved route for a tractor parade, part of the ongoing protest against the three farm laws passed in September.Read more: Farmers, Hindutva, businesses: The trinity of political economyPolice have registered at least 44 cases in connection with the January 26 violence that erupted at the Red Fort, ITO and many other places in the city during the farmers’ tractor rally and the incident of January 29, during which a group of people, claiming to be local residents, reached the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police. More than a dozen farmers and 510 personnel were injured in the two incidents.Till February 13, police arrested 146 people in several cases, 33 of them are Delhi residents. Of these 33, 14 have been arrested for violence at Burari in which many security personnel, including an assistant commandant of central industrial security force (CISF) were injured.Families of many alleged suspects said they were finding it difficult to make ends meet because the person arrested was the only earning member. Many others, like Devender, also claimed that their neighbours and families have ostracized them, fearing harassment by police.Most of the Delhi residents arrested in connection with the January 26 violence come from middle-class families who live in working class neighbourhoods.Read more: 'So much truth': Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter lends support to protesting farmersTwo more Nehru Vihar residents -- Surjeet Singh, a salesman in a footwear shop in Karol Bagh, and Ravi Kumar, a student preparing for staff selection commission (SSC) exams – were also among those arrested in the Burari case. Their families claimed that they were not part of the tractor rally but were caught in the jam caused by the rally, while going to a gurdwara in Chandni Chowk.“We do not belong to a family of farmers and we have no association with the ongoing protest. Since it was my son’s off because of the Republic Day, he left for the gurdwara on a scooter with his friend Ravi. He was not part of the violence. It’s just that they were stuck in a traffic jam,” said Surjeet’s mother Gurpreet Singh, adding that her family depends on his son’s job which he might lose because of the arrest.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “The arrests in the cases are being made after ascertaining the role of the suspects and the evidence collected. Any participant in the unlawful mob breaking law and causing violence is liable for prosecution.”The family of Dharminder Singh Harman admitted that he was part of the protest at Singhu border but clarified that he was not involved in the violence. They said Harman, who was arrested by the crime branch on February 5 in connection with the violence at Red Fort, was running a health camp at the protest site since November.Read more: Punjab civic body polls: Farmers protest against farm laws in Amritsar“Since he too is involved in farming, my husband supported the farmers’ cause. On January 26, he had gone for the tractor rally but caused no violence. Police arrested him just because he was part of the rally,” said Neha, Harman’s wife.A police officer who did not want to be named said, “Most of the arrested persons were seen at multiple locations where violence broke out. Why a west or south Delhi resident was present at the Red Fort with flags on his bike during the rally?”Police have said Harman is associated with the founder of a regional political party that supported last year’s anti-CAA agitation at Shaheen Bagh, an allegation his wife has refuted.The families of the arrested persons are being provided with free legal assistance by a team formed by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).“The FIRs are not being uploaded on the Delhi Police website despite Delhi High Court’s directions. Three-four people got police notice for their presence as witnesses but were arrested after they appeared before the police. The families of those arrested are not being informed by the police about the arrests or the offences they have been booked for,” said advocate Virinder Pal Singh Sandhu from DSGMC’s legal team.Police officers denied the allegations, saying all legal formalities were being followed in all cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/families-of-those-arrested-for-r-day-violence-face-backlash-101613412892018.html
16-02-2021||Noida||Noida: Dense fog in morning gives way to warmer day; air quality improves||A day after slipping into the “severe” category, the air quality of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida improved marginally to “very poor” category on Monday with the pollution board expecting no significant improvement for the few days. Although the region witnessed dense fog in the early morning, rising temperature and wind speeds led to a partial dispersal of pollutants later in the day, said weather experts.While the minimum and maximum temperatures will be around 10 and 30 degrees Celsius respectively for the next few days, the open areas along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and parts of Western Uttar Pradesh may see dense fog in the morning. However, foggy mornings will give way to warmer days along with rising wind speeds.According to the weather experts, while parts of Noida, especially Sector 114, was still suffering from a severe level of pollution, in other parts, a slight rise in the wind speed and higher maximum temperatures have led to an improvement in the level of ventilation leading to better dispersal of pollutants.“The wind speed increased slightly towards the daytime reaching 10kmph on Monday. Though the wind speed was not enough to disperse the current volume of pollutants, the higher mercury helped. The temperatures in the region on Monday were five degrees higher than the season’s average. High temperature also helped with the dispersal of the pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).On Monday, the maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida was recorded at 29.1 degrees Celsius and 11.4 degrees Celsius respectively.“Due to zero wind speed during the early morning, regions of western Uttar Pradesh, including the Agra and Lucknow expressways, may see dense fog during the early morning hours between 4am to 9am,” Srivastava added.He also said that the weather conditions will remain almost the same for the next few days and the pollution levels will not see much improvement either.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday was recorded at 368 (very poor) as against 416 (severe) a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida was recorded at 349 as against 402 a day earlier. Meanwhile, the air quality of Ghaziabad was 369 — the third worst in country — as against 416 a day earlierBetween February 9 and 14, Noida, Greater Noida and Gaziabad have seen some of the worst pollution levels in the country.The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered to be “moderate”, while that between 201 and 300 is considered to be “poor”. The air quality between 301 and 400 is considered a “ very-poor” while the same above 400 is considered “severe”.According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve but likely to remain within the “very poor” category for the next few days.“Surface winds are low and forecasted to improve over the next two days. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. AQI is likely to improve towards the lower end of Very Poor for the next three days,” read the SAFAR statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dense-fog-in-morning-gives-way-to-warmer-day-air-quality-improves-slightly-101613412831527.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Water supply back to normal, says Delhi Jal Board after Chamoli impact||Water supply in parts of south, east and north-east Delhi remained partially affected on Monday as silt and debris from the flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district increased turbidity in the Ganga river forcing Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to operate at reduced capacity.Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in NTU. High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water.DJB vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha on Monday said the water utility has overcome the supply issue. He also visited DJB’s Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plant (WTP) to take stock of the situation. “We treat the raw Ganga water which comes from the Upper Ganga Canal at Muradnagar and provide it to Delhi households. But, due to the calamity in Uttarakhand, the quality of water has worsened. The water which we are getting now is of very poor quality as it has a lot of dirt and other particles. Water quality is measured in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) which touched 8,000, while the permissible limit is 100,” said Chadha.Chadha said the DJB shut down the Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi WTPs. The production capacity of these plants was brought down to combat the situation, he said. These plants together provide around 250 MGD water per day.“Due to high level of dirt in the raw water, supply was affected in areas of south, east and north-east Delhi. He said in Bhagirathi treatment plant, water NTU has been reduced from 8000 to 960 and in Sonia Vihar it has been brought down from 8200 NTU to 1000,” said Chadha.Residents in several areas complained of zero or irregular supply on Monday. These include Greater Kailash-2, Defence Colony, Vigyan Vihar, South Extension-2, Kailash Colony, Jamia Nagar, Panchsheel Enclave, Krishna Nagar, Jafrabad, Seelampur among others.The DJB in a statement said the Bhagirathi water treatment plant (WTP) is now working at 100% and Sonia Vihar at 80% capacity.In many areas, residents had to buy water cans or rely on private tankers to meet the water shortage. RWAs also issued instructions to residents to judiciously use water for a few days due to the crisis.Sanjay Rana, president, Greater Kailash-2 RWA, said there was no prior intimation about the disruption of water supply hence people could not fill their tanks or store water.“There had been no supply of water since Sunday evening. The authorities told us about the water crisis only on Sunday evening, saying that there will be no supply in the evening and next (Monday) morning as well. This sudden situation led to water shortage in almost every household in the area. People had to buy 20-litre water cans to do their daily chores,” Rana said.He added that the DJB officials have assured them that the supply would become normal by Tuesday.Ranjeet Singh, president, Defence Colony RWA, said there was no water supply in the area. “Water supply was impacted in the colony since Sunday evening, and it worsened on Monday morning as there was no supply today. No one got the opportunity to fill their tanks or store extra water as there was no prior intimation,” Singh said.Several areas in east Delhi were also due to the break in supply.Read more: Uttarakhand glacier burst: 4 more bodies of UP residents found, 59 still missingBS Vohra, president of a joint forum of east Delhi RWAs said in some areas such as Vigyan Vihar, Preet Vihar among others there was no water supply on Monday while in certain areas the supply was either for short duration or the quality of water was very bad.“In areas such as Krishna Nagar, Geeta Colony the water was supplied for a shorter duration and also it was very dirty. We could not fill tanks due to dirty water. Through TV and other mediums, we got to know about water crisis in Delhi due to flash floods in Uttarakhand but the DJB did not send an official communication to the RWAs. We are not sure if the supply will be restored by Tuesday,” Vohra said.On the allegations that the DJB did not inform the residents in advance, a DJB spokesperson said, “The information that the water supply will be affected was put out for the knowledge of general public through social media handles. It was tweeted during the day on Sunday by the vice chairperson and most MLAs also sent out messages to RWA groups. ”In north-east Delhi areas such as Jafrabad, Seelampur and Mukundpur, there was no supply on Monday morning while in areas such as Shahdara, Seemapuri, Vishwas Nagar, water was supplied at low pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/normal-water-supply-to-resume-today-says-delhi-jal-board-101613412411000.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Disha Ravi’s arrest an ‘unprecedented attack on democracy’: Delhi CM Kejriwal||A day after Bengaluru-based green activist Disha Ravi, 22, was sent to police custody for five days for allegedly editing and sharing on social media an online “toolkit” related to the farmers’ protests, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called the arrest “an unprecedented attack on democracy”.“Arrest of 21 yr old Disha Ravi is an unprecedented attack on Democracy. Supporting our farmers is not a crime,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday.Later, senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the party demands her immediate release.The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, called the AAP’s defence of Ravi “pathetic”.Ravi, founder of the Indian wing of climate activism group Fridays For Future -- founded by renowned Swedish activist Greta Thunberg -- was arrested by the Delhi Police from Bengaluru on Saturday. Police alleged that she was one of the editors of a toolkit that “indicates a copycat execution of a conspiracy” behind the January 26 violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital.However, the 22-year-old’s arrest was criticised on several quarters -- from academics to activists to civil society members to several political leaders -- and sparked protests in Bengaluru and Mumbai demanding her release.“The AAP believes that this arrest is an extrajudicial abduction. With this arrest, the BJP has made it clear that they are rattled by the voices and the protests against the three farm laws across the country and abroad. Dissent is not equal to sedition. A difference of opinion with the ruling party or with the policies or laws of the government is also not sedition. The BJP is trying to suppress the voice of dissent,” said Chadha, who is also the party’s MLA from Rajendra Nagar.He said the BJP “seems to be setting in motion an undeclared emergency in the country”.“Could the prime minister be pleased to state the exact two lines which Ravi claimed to have edited? Could the government show us just how dangerous was the wording of those two lines that the Delhi Police went all the way to Bengaluru to arrest Ravi. How insidious was the two-line edit that shook the very foundations of our strong democracy? We don’t think that India is so weak,” Chadha said.Chadha also denied that activist and lawyer Nikita Jacob, another person against whom the police issued a non-bailable warrant in connection with the toolkit, is linked with the AAP.“I have not heard of this name before. No person with this name has been a member of the AAP in Mumbai or else where as per my knowledge,” Chadha said.The Delhi BJP, however, slammed the AAP’s support for Ravi, and said: “The day is not far when the AAP may even defend Deep Sidhu.” The reference was to a Punjabi actor-turned-activist who was caught by the Delhi Police for his alleged role in the violence during the tractor rally in the Capital on January 26.Read more: ‘Not subject to removal’: Twitter on Haryana minister Vij’s tweet on Disha Ravi“Every nationalist feels sad to see AAP leader Raghav Chadha’s statement on Ravi’s arrest. It’s pathetic to see the AAP defend misguided youths starting from Umar Khalid to Ravi. It seems the day is not far away when the AAP may defend even Deep Sidhu,” said BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.Tanvir Aijaz, political scientist and professor at Delhi University’s Ramjas College, said the definition of protests, criticism and activism has been largely blurred in the country these days.“These ideas are being mistaken as if there is some kind of attack on the state, whereas in reality, it is the contrary. Activism or dissent is needed to reform the state. Protests help fix accountability. Government is the accountability holder which means it has to ensure nothing untoward happens and people must ensure the establishment is under check from time to time. Activism or protest has been labeled as conspiratorial, but it is good because more the reforms, the better the nation becomes,” said Aijaz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/disha-ravi-s-arrest-an-unprecedented-attack-on-democracy-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101613412350925.html
16-02-2021||Delhi||Housing scheme 2021: DDA gets 26k applications, window set to close today||For its 1,354 flats put on sale under Housing Scheme 2021, mostly in the high income group (HIG) and middle-income group (MIG) categories, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has received 26,365 applications so far.The DDA plans to hold the draw of lots on March 3 and the last date to apply is February 16.A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “We have received 26,365 applications and 15,103 applicants have already made the payment.”The DDA has received over 6,000 applications along with payment for its 1,011 HIG and MIG category flats. A total of 254 HIG flats are located in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini and Dwarka. Apart from that, there are 757 two- and three-bedroom MIG flats located in Dwarka, Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Jahangirpuri and Madipur.It is after nearly a decade that MIG flats in such large numbers have been put on sale in Dwarka, DDA officials said.Apart from the location of these flats, the quality of construction, facilities at the housing complex, two parking slots per flat (in HIG complexes) are a few of the reasons why people are keen on applying for these flats, DDA officials said.Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA officials are optimistic that 254 HIG flats in Jasola will find many takers. The HIG flats (87.9 square metres (sqm) to 177.3 square metres) are priced between ₹69.62 lakh to ₹2.14 crore. “These are spacious flats, located on the Delhi-Noida border and well-connected with the rest of the city via the Metro and other public transport systems. There is a dual piping system as the complex has its own sewage treatment plant. The most important thing is that each flat has two parking slots. The ₹2.14 crore cost is as per the market rate,” said the official quoted above.Spread over 64.04 sqm to 129.98 sqm, the cost of MIG flats varies between ₹40.64 lakh and ₹1.24 crore. Of the 757 flats, 711 are located in Dwarka Sub-City—a planned residential area being developed by the DDA. There are 291 flats for the economically weaker section and 52 in the lower income group category in Dwarka and Rohini.Officials said applications, payments, and possession letters will be processed online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/housing-scheme-2021-applications-close-feb-16-101613412290977.html

However, the grievance was regarding the transport facility and accommodation.The forum in its observation stated that in sum and substance the case of the complainant is that the company did not arrange any vehicle for 11 persons and he had to arrange for a private vehicle and all the travel fare was required to be borne from his pocket.Similarly, with regard to room accommodation at Munnar, it is the grievance of the complainant that he had to pay ₹6,134 extra while leaving the room on December 27, 2019. Thus, in addition to the tour charges already paid to the company , Kulkarni was compelled to incur an additional total expenditure of ₹51,134.Kulkarni demanded a refund of this amount from the company. However, in spite of accepting to refund the amount via their emails dated Jan 11, 2020 and Jan18, 2020, the company had not done anything needful.Thus the complainant has alleged deficiency in service on the part of the company.Kulkarni sought monetary relief of ₹9.55 lakh which includes ₹51,134 towards refund of additional expenditure incurred, an amount of ₹4,500 towards interest on this amount at 18%; an amount of ₹4 lakh by way of compensation towards mental harassment; besides an amount of ₹5 lakh as damages for physical troubles, the forum observed.“On perusal of the complaint, this forum was pleased to admit the present complaint on August 3, 2020, and notices were directed to be issued calling upon the opposite parties to file their written version.

16-02-2021||Pune||Lukewarm response to offline lectures on day 1 of college reopening||After a long gap of 11 months, universities and colleges in Pune restarted offline lectures from Monday after the state government’s nod. Despite the reopening after a long break, a lukewarm response was reported at colleges across the city by the university administration. Some prominent colleges in the city did not reopen doors for students today and won’t restart offline classes until all Covid safety measures are in place. A portion of students are still not willing to join classroom lectures immediately. Ravindra Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College said, “Our online lectures for all graduate and post-graduate courses are underway at the same time we also have a shortage of faculties in various departments and so it won’t be possible for us to immediately start classroom lectures as of now. Initially, we are starting lab practical lectures of third-year students from next week, and then second- and first-year practical will also start. At this time, lectures will be conducted through online mode only. Since the classroom count of students is large it won’t be possible to maintain proper social distancing and other Covid protocols.” According to Pardeshi, another major issue is that hostels in the college housed two to three students in one room before Covid. “Now, we need to be extra cautious with the safety of students and so we have not yet started colleges. We will be trying to open the college campus in a phase-wise manner and not in hurry looking at the safety of students,” added Pardeshi. On Monday, HT visited several prominent colleges in Pune and took a review of students coming to college campus but there was an absence of a large crowd at colleges. The majority of colleges have decided to start offline lectures gradually in a phase-wise manner. The SP College on Tilak Road conducted thermal checks of students at the main gate, while at the Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar students of the chemistry department were seen engaged in lab practical assignments and the campus of Ferguson College or College of Engineering Pune (COEP) hardly saw any students around as the offline classroom lectures have not yet started at these colleges. MM Salunkhe, vice-chancellor, Bharati Vidyapeeth university said, “We have given notices to all our principals to follow guidelines given by state and the Central government related to Covid-19. Also, UGC guidelines are important to reopen college campuses for starting offline lectures, accordingly, now slowly our lectures will start. In some colleges, students have started coming back to college campuses, hostels and on the other hand, our planning of examination for the first semester is going on. If possible, our exams will be conducted next month. Our medical students were already there on campus and worked tirelessly during the lockdown period and still, it is going on.” Meanwhile, to welcome the decision of reopening universities and colleges in Pune, celebrations were done by the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) student volunteers today at the main entrance gate of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the gate and the beats of dhol tasha welcomed students coming to the university campus after a long gap. Nidhi Sain, a student from Modern College, Shivajinagar said, “We are so happy to come back to the college campus and attend lab practicals and lectures now, as earlier in online lectures we used to not understand a lot. Also, there were connectivity issues and physically coming to college, meeting friends and enjoying campus life is something different and cannot be replaced by any online method.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lukewarm-response-to-offline-lectures-on-day-1-of-college-reopening-101613410611471.html

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari instructed the PMC give compensation as instructed by the courts, to sort out the issue at the earliest. The PMC and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will erect the multi-level flyover at ChandanicChowk. Work has been delayed due to land acquisition. PMC claimed that almost 99 percent of the land required has been cleared, with even the defence forces handing over land. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “Almost all the affected landowners gave the nod to hand over the land and they even accepted the compensation. A few persons are in court challenging it. We are trying to negotiate. If not negotiated, PMC will give compensation as instructed by the court.” Local BJP corporator from Bavdhan, Dilip Vede Patil said, “PMC needs to acquire a total of 76 flats. PMC accepted giving cash compensation. Almost all the flat owners accepted the compensation package and only four members approached the court. The issue will get sorted out very soon.” Gadkari recently took a review meeting of the Chandani chowk flyover. Gadkari said that PMC should speed up the acquisition work and ensure that the work is not halted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-flat-owners-oppose-pmc-s-flat-acquisition-to-erect-multi-level-flyover-at-chandani-chowk-101613410552105.html
16-02-2021||Pune||Three booked in Dattanagar firing incident||Three unidentified men travelling on a two-wheeler have been booked for firing a weapon at a shop owner in Dattanagar, Katraj, on Sunday night. The injured man has been identified as Vishal Prahlad Punjabi (32), the owner of the shop located on Dattanagar-Katraj road in the Ambegaon Khurd area of Katraj. The incident happened at 8:50pm on Sunday, when the complainant shop owner of Balaji Trading Company was in his shop. Punjabi sustained a minor wound from the firing and underwent first-aid treatment at Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital on Sunday night, before being discharged. The three men arrived on one motorcycle and entered the shop. Punjabi was in the shop and asked one of them what they were wanted. One of the three then pulled out a weapon from his right pant pocket and shot at Punjabi, according to his complaint to the police. “He stood to ask them what they wanted. The three were standing at varied, but close distances from the counter opposite Punjabi. One of the assailants, who did not fire, was closer to the counter where he was counting money collected for the day. He could have easily pulled out the money if that was their intention. However, one of them fired and the complainant had very luckily, bent down to do something. Had the angle of the weapon been any lower than it was, it would have killed the complainant,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. The complainant then claims to have pulled out the drawer from the shop counter to hit the three men, but they had already fled the spot, according to the police. The incident could have been captured in the CCTV camera inside the shop. However, the CCTV was out of order. Footage from cameras around the spot is blurry. The police are investigating the case from all possible angles including robbery and extortion. However, the sections for these crimes have not been invoked in the case. A case under Sections 307 (attempted murder) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code, along with Section 37(1) with 135 of Maharashtra Police Act has been registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station against the three. Assistant police inspector S Kavthekar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-booked-in-dattanagar-firing-incident-101613410550810.html
