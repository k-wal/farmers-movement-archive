I have no doubt that her decision to join the Met Police in 1971 was a brave one and she would have faced considerable challenges along the way,” said Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball.“As Britain’s and the Met’s first Asian female officer, Karpal paved the way for so many others who have gone into policing since 1971. Fifty years to the day after PC Sandhu joined the Met, I am pleased that we are able to remember her life, her career and the legacy she has left policing,” she said.The National Sikh Police Association UK joined forces with the Met Police Sikh Association for a special virtual event in memory of PC Sandhu on Monday.“Today, together with representatives from the Met’s Sikh Association, Met police officers and staff and the wider Sikh community, we remember Karpal’s special contribution to policing, as the UK’s first female Asian and Sikh police officer,” said Ravjeet Gupta, Chair of the Metropolitan Police Sikh Association.“Karpal was an invaluable ambassador for the Met who helped break down barriers with London’s communities and will always be remembered for being a trailblazer of her time,” said Gupta.PC Sandhu was born to a Sikh family in Zanzibar, East Africa, in 1943 and came to the UK in 1962, where she got a job as a nurse at Chase Farm Hospital.She joined the Met in 1971 at the age of 27, where she served at Hornsey police station before moving to Leyton in east London.“I’m so proud of my mother, and her legacy as the UK’s first female police officer from an Asian and Sikh background. It’s wonderful that 50 years on she is remembered, and is an inspiration to generations of new female police officers joining the Met,” said Romy Sandhu, Karpal Kaur Sandhu’s daughter.At a time when there would have only been about 700 female officers in the Met, she was both the first female Sikh and female South Asian police officer in the UK.Writing in a report at the time, her Chief Superintendent said that she was “proving invaluable with our dealings with the immigrant population and she is also assisting other divisions in this work and also in teaching police officers Asian dialects”. He added that she was “energetic, intelligent and conscientious” and enjoyed playing hockey and driving.The Met Police said that PC Sandhu passed away in “tragic circumstances” in November 1973 and sadly, the force lost a promising officer who had a bright future.Sandhu, aged 30, was killed in an altercation with her husband, who was reportedly opposed to her career choice and was later sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder in 1974.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scotland-yard-celebrates-first-ever-sikh-female-police-officer-101612202308520.html

Now, the background of drivers of all the government, private and public vehicles will be verified and it will make travelling in public transport safer for women.”Women right activists praised the decision, but they said it won’t leave much impact on reducing crime against women.Women rights activist Rolly Shivhare said, “It is good that the state government came up with this decision.

The result will tell us why there was a formation of foam in the water, the report will take at least 15 days to come out,” said Kiran Hasabnis, MPCB, sub-regional officer, Pimpri-Chinchwad. A spot visit from HT on Sunday confirmed the presence of foam in water. “The foam formed by the commercial wastewater chemical or domestic wastewater will be confirmed from the test. Residents continue washing animals in the water near Keju Devi temple,” said Hasabnis. In the past as well there were many incidents when fish were found dead at the Keju Devi temple boat club. “In 2019, we surveyed the complete area by boat, and it was noticed that due to discharge of wastewater in the river the deaths occurred,” added Hasabnis. Social activists and residents blame the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) while MPCB said that the civic body has undertaken some work to stop the waste water entering from various big nullahs in the river. “Sewage water treatment plants have been installed in many places and placing of proper drainage network is also in the process. In October 2020, we filed a case against PCMC at Shivajinagar court and asked them to fix the problem of water pollution in the Pavana river,” added Hasabnis.

01-02-2021||Pune||Pune-based educationalists welcome budget 2021||In a positive development for the education sector, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman added emphasis on the new educational policy while presenting the budget for the year 2021-22 on Monday. Some prominent educationalists from Pune welcomed Sitharaman’s boost to the education sector with an announcement of ₹50,000 crore over the next five years for the National Research Foundation (NRF). Rahul V Karad, managing trustee and executive president, MAEER’s MIT Group of institutions said, “As an educationist, I welcome the budget announced for this year by our FM Nirmala Sitharaman. The budget aims at the overall economical revival with a major thrust on infrastructure, healthcare and agriculture along with other sectors. The announcement about putting up of a central university in Leh to 750 Eklavya Model residential schools in tribal areas and 100 new Sainik schools is definitely a positive move in the right direction. The setting up of National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR) and the emphasis on the development of digital infrastructure of the country for the implementation of NEP 2020 will surely address the challenges institutions are facing in remote learning. Apart from this creating a higher education commission will help streamline the higher education scenario of the country. This year’s budget has taken into account some of the challenges faced by the Indian education sector and presents opportunities that can be turned into strengths to make our nation Atmanirbhar, as India will have the largest working age population in the world by 2030.” Dishan Kamdar, vice Chancellor of Pune based Flame University believes the government’s decision to allocate Rs.50,000 crore over five years will serve as a great shot in the arm for the country’s research ecosystem. “Lack of adequate funding has been a constraint for several higher education institutions and this support will enable the institutions and the faculty to produce high quality, rigorous research output. The creation of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) as an umbrella structure having four separate bodies for standard-setting, accreditation, regulation, and funding under it will bring in synergies across higher education institutions. In addition, a regulatory mechanism to promote academic collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions will help pave the way for Indian higher education institutions to become truly global in the near future,” he said. Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor of Symbiosis International (deemed university) and principal director, Symbiosis said, “The budget announced by the finance minister today especially for the education sector is very welcomed. The National Education Policy rolled out last year and now the focus in the budget is aligned to this policy. ₹50,000 crores for the National Research Foundation is a welcome sign, as these funds will be available to universities to do research which was lacking at Indian universities. This will also help our universities to be listed in the top 100 or 200 universities in the world. The other focus on skill development especially by appending the national apprenticeship programme is also welcomed; this will generate jobs for diploma engineering students because of partnership with the industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punebased-educationalists-welcome-budget-2021-101612195951226.html

However, Nagpur metro which had submitted its phase II proposal got a mention in this year’s central budget. Finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman announced on Monday that Nagpur metro rail project phase II and Nashik metro will get funding of ₹5,976 crore and ₹2,092 crore respectively in the annual budget 2021-22. However, no announcement was made for the Pune metro.Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) managing director Brijesh Dixit, said, “The phase I proposal was submitted a year ago to the central government. After getting instructions from the local body and the state government, we will submit the phase II proposal for Pune metro this year, which would get reflected in the next year’s annual budget.”Dixit said, “It is a proud moment for us as Maha-Metro had proposed the Neo Metro in Nashik. Neo metro concept was introduced by Maha-Metro and it got approval at national level as a new mode of travel.”Dixit said, “Neo metro is a good project for tier 2 and tier 3 cities which have less population and where metro is not feasible. Now, the government is planning to replicate neo-metro model at the national level.”One of the officials from Maha-Metro said on condition of anonymity that Nagpur metro had started its commercial operations and hence, it got earlier permission for phase II. Pune metro is executing its phase first which is in progress. The government has approved one more metro line on PPP basis which is getting executed by PMRDA in between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar. Various other routes are proposed in Pune and they all can go to the central government for phase II very soon.Maharashtra finance minister Ajit Pawar criticised the Union budget and said, “Budgetary provisions were given to Nagpur and Nashik cities considering the elections, but Pune- Nashik railway got no mention.”Commercial operations likely to start by December 2021Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) state president Chandrakant Patil and mayor Murlidhar Mohol held a meeting with Maha-Metro officials on Monday. Patil announced that the metro is likely to start its commercial operations in Pune by December this year. The trial run on Vanaz to Garware College stretch will start by March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/finding-no-place-in-this-year-s-budget-pune-metro-plans-to-submit-extension-proposal-soon-101612195948743.html

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the union budget for the fiscal year 2021–22 in parliament on Monday. After Sitharaman’s speech, MCCIA members and prominent people who attended the viewing session gave their reaction on the budget. “We thank the finance minister for ensuring policy certainty and taxation stability in this budget. That is very important for encouraging the confidence of businesses and the investors. In an environment of consumption, private investment and exports not yet picking up to normal levels, the government had to spend, and we are glad that the expenditure budget is at a high of ₹34.8 lakh crore. It is especially encouraging to see a higher component of it being budgeted for the capital expenditure that delivers multiplier impact for growth,” said Sudhir Mehta, president of MCCIA. “For the tax rates to be stable, it’s important that we have more revenues from divestments and asset monetization. Divestments in PSUs and specifically in PSBs and LIC are very welcome. It will raise resources while helping the sectors become even more efficient. While positive announcements were made for the industries including – FDI ceiling increase in the insurance industry, new parks for the textile industry, more than doubled the budget for MSMEs ministry to support MSMEs with schemes including the ones for credit guarantees and interest rate subventions.” he added. Arun Firodia, chairman of Kinetic Group while welcoming the budget in his reaction said, “There are some welcome features announced by the government like faceless assessment. I would like this to be extended to all permissions and returns required to start a new business and run the business. Digitalization of interaction with government authorities will reduce corruption and improve the ease of doing business. Another welcome announcement is the correction of inverted duty structure. Government has announced its intention to support the electric vehicle industry,” Firodia said, “Our request would be - motor and controller are being imported at nil import duty. Domestically manufactured motor and controller should also be charged the same at nil duty. Similarly, lithium battery cells are charged 5 per cent import duty. The same rate should be allowed for domestically manufactured batteries. Instead of scrappage policy, which would be unwelcome, it may be a better idea to levy a green tax on vehicles that are more than 15 years old. With the high cost of the battery, the electric vehicles are still more expensive than petrol-driven vehicles. My suggestion would be to increase the subsidy from Rs. 10,000 per kWh to Rs. 15,000 per kWh and continue it for the next 5 years. In order to induce people to use electric vehicles, a sizeable number of amenity spaces should be reserved for charging stations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mccia-holds-budget-viewing-session-industrialists-confident-of-growth-stability-101612195948160.html

The Pune police have seen a rise in cases registered by patients admitted at private and government hospitals being duped in a similar manner.The woman received a call on Friday when a relative from Shikrapur was visiting her. Having given birth to twins, the woman was undergoing treatment when she received a call from a mobile number whose details have been submitted to the police.“The number seems local, but due to number port facility, we cannot draw any conclusion until the service provider responds (provides information),” said Ulhas Kadam, inspector (crime) of Samarth police station who is investigating the case.The caller told the woman that he is a doctor at KEM and that her children were in need of an injection that would ensure proper functioning of her premature babies, according to the complaint.The woman was told that the injection costs ₹26,700 and that she will need to send the money using Google Pay attached to the caller’s phone number, according to the police.Dr Madhur Rao, senior deputy medical administrator, KEM Hospital, said that fraudsters are targeting relatives of patients at our hospital which is disturbing. “As soon as we became aware of this happening we immediately informed the cyber crime unit. We have put up notices for all our patients and their relatives reiterating that they should make payments only at the hospital counters. Unfortunately, in this case, a patient’s brother got a call on the landline from a person claiming to be a doctor attached to the hospital. It was only after paying the amount and later inquiring from the treating consultant that it was found that no such request had been made,” Rao said. A case under Section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and Sections 66(c) and 566(d) of Information Technology Act was registered at Samarth police station.Similar cases were registered at Bundgarden and Wanowrie police stations.

AQI in “severe” category affects healthy people and badly impacts those with existing diseases.The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all monitoring stations there.Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida have four such stations while Greater Noida and Faridabad have two stations each, according to the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-turns-severe-in-ghaziabad-very-poor-in-noida-faridabad-101612191825527.html
01-02-2021||Pune||SII awaits Centre’s purchase nod for Covishield vaccine’s second batch||Pune: Pune-based pharma major Serum Institute of India (SII) awaits the purchase order for the second lot of Covishield vaccine. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2021-22 on Monday, said that the country would spend a ₹35 thousand crore for Covid vaccination. Covishield is one of the two vaccines approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation on India for emergency use approval and is being used to vaccinate healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers in the first phase of nationwide Covid-19 vaccination. The first purchase order for Covishield from the government was for 11 million doses which began to be dispatched from January 11 and the vaccine doses were being administered to HCWs beginning January 16. The doses were purchased at ₹210 per dose, including taxes. SII executive director Suresh Jadhav said, “We are yet to get any confirmation on the second lot of the vaccine. In fact, we are even awaiting a nod from the ministry of external affairs to transport the doses out of the country. For every consignment we need the approval of the government and despite having orders in place from other countries, almost 3-4 of our consignments await nod from the government. Currently, we have a stock of about 70 million doses and are mass producing 50 million doses per month as of now.”Commenting on the budget, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer at SII said, “Globally, spending on healthcare infrastructure and vaccine has given countries and their economies the best bang for their buck. Investments in these areas have prevented hospitalisations and resulted in a healthier and more productive workforce, thereby leading to an efficient economy. Therefore, we welcome the FM’s emphasis on healthcare spending and immunisation, especially for Covid-19 and the pneumococcal vaccines as this will help India recover rapidly from the pandemic. Hopefully, this will also encourage more innovation and expansion in the sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sii-awaits-centre-s-purchase-nod-for-covishield-vaccine-s-second-batch-101612190788158.html

The opportunity to soothe the protesting farmers was not utilised properly,” he added. Gill further said ₹40,000 crore for rural infrastructure in 713 districts of the country meant nothing and an announcement for a crop credit of ₹1.68 crore had little value as it was to be given by national bank of agriculture and rural development (NABARD). Senior economist Sardara Singh Johal, who is also chancellor of the Central University, Bathinda, refused to comment. Dean, social sciences, at Punjabi University, Kesar Singh Bhangu, welcomed the announcement for setting up 1,000 more e-national agriculture market (NAM), but said the fate of already functioning electronic mandis was unclear. “The government needs to explain the fate of the electronic mandis, which, I think, are not doing any good,” he said. Head of economics department at Guru Nanak Dev University Neena Malhotra also felt that the government could have done more for the farmers. The government should have spent more on the agriculture sector for the reason that during the lockdown last year, only agriculture sector witnessed a growth while others suffered. She said the Union government has reaffirmed that minimum support price will continue, besides offering credits to farmers. “Looking at the budget highlights, government has made its priorities clear that they want to spend more on infrastructure, railways and health sectors for the benefit of all sections of society in the long run,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agriculture-sector-gets-little-in-union-budget-experts-101612190187998.html

Top BJP leaders in the state said that the party’s national president JP Nadda is expected to launch the first rath yatra on February 6. All five rath yatras have been named parivartan yatras. Union home minister Amit Shah, who had to cancel his two-day visit to the eastern poll-bound state on January 30 and January 31 because of the explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Friday, is also likely to come to Bengal and launch at least two rath yatras next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also likely to come to West Bengal on February 7 to attend a programme in Haldia in east Midnapore. Also Read: Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech underlines govt’s focus on poll-bound states“We are planning to organise five rath yatras in the five organisational zones in West Bengal. Each yatra will run for at least 20-25 days and together cover all the 294 assembly constituencies in February and March,” said a senior BJP leader. The BJP has sought permission from the state secretariat at Nabanna and a letter was sent to the state’s chief secretary on Monday seeking his appointment. “Along with each rath yatra, multiple padyatras will be organised to bolster the campaign ahead of the assembly elections and boost the morale of the party workers and supporters. It will be a mega outreach programme,” said a senior party leader. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-seat legislative assembly. “It is their own party programme and they can do whatever they want after taking the due police permission. But it will fetch them no advantage and they will lose the elections. They will not be able to reach three digits in the elections,” said Saugata Roy Elections can be held in March-April this year and the poll dates can be announced any time in February, according to officials in the poll panel.While the first rath yatra will be launched on February 6 from Nabadwip and will culminate at Barrackpore, the next two will be launched on February 8 from Cooch Behar in north Bengal and Kakdwip in south Bengal. The last two will be launched on February 9 from Jhargram and Tarapith in south Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-plans-to-organise-five-mega-rath-yatras-in-poll-bound-bengal-101612185628858.html

The issue is more acute in the Spiti region. The survey conducted in collaboration with the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Kolkata, concluded that feral dog density was found to be 2.78 individuals per 100 square km on an average ranging from 1.4 to 5.5 individuals in the Lahaul and Pangi landscape. The survey was conducted under United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP’s) SECURE Himalaya Project. Such dogs are reported to be leading to biodiversity loss, depredations of wildlife species, and also competing with large carnivores such as the snow leopard, said principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Archana Sharma. She said globally, few studies were available which documented the impact of feral dogs on wildlife. “In order to understand the distribution pattern, population status, feeding resources and impact in Lahaul-Pangi landscapes, the survey was conducted,” she added. Camera traps, trail sampling used The wildlife department used camera traps and trail sampling to assess the feral population which is threatening the wildlife as well as the livestock in the region. “A multipronged approach of camera trapping, trail sampling, non-invasive genetics and questionnaire survey was used to gather information,” said Dr Lalit Kumar Sharma, scientist, ZSI, Kolkata. Chief conservator of forest (wildlife)-cum-state nodal officer, SECURE Himalaya project, Anil Thakur said according to the ZSI report, the micro-histological analysis of the feral dogs suggested that they feed on species such as marmot, blue sheep and rodents, but their main diet is domestic livestock, which is a matter of great concern. Time for mitigation planningHe said though the population density of feral dogs in the surveyed landscape was not alarming, this was the right time to start a mitigation planning of this imminent threat in these high-range Himalayan ecosystems. “If required, long-term monitoring and more intensive studies will be undertaken to understand possible impact by feral dogs on wildlife using the different monitoring protocols,” he added. Dr Manoj Thakur, state project officer, SECURE Himalaya, said on the basis of findings of this report, the state forest department and UNDP in collaboration with other line departments and local community-based organisations will start the implementation of strategy proposed by ZSI for management under which dog sterilisation and awareness activities on responsible dog ownership will be undertaken on priority this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/feral-dogs-in-hp-s-high-altitude-areas-pose-threat-to-wildlife-livestock-101612177109112.html

Everything was going smoothly for the new CM and his cabinet when a small farmers’ agitation turned big – and in the process cost the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) politically in the 2014 elections. A bunch of farmers from Maval in the western part of Pune district opposed a pipeline project that was to bring water from the Pavana river to neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad, whose civic body was controlled by NCP leader Ajit Pawar. They were already unhappy because their land was taken over for various projects, including industries and the 95-kilometre long expressway, which connects Maharashtra’s two big cities – Pune and Mumbai. Suddenly, the protests turned violent as farmers from Maval attempted to block the Pune-Mumbai expressway that is used by around one lakh vehicles each day on weekends. To quell the protest and clear the expressway, the police department, led by the late RR Patil of the NCP, resorted to firing. Three persons were killed and 10 injured in the police firing. The top police officials like then Pune district superintendent of police Sandeep Karnik argued that force was used in self-defence. His argument then was: “We had no option when protesters gheraoed some police officials and started throwing stones at them.” To be fair to him, some senior police officials along with constables also sustained serious injuries while controlling the protestors. Interesting was the response from Shiv Sena, which was then in opposition and an ally of the BJP. The Sena chief called Congress-NCP government “killer of its own people”. Its member of Parliament Shrirang Barne made the killing of farmers a poll issue and garnered good support from Maval. It’s been 10 years and state politics has seen a major change. BJP, which then was in opposition, is now ruling the country amidst a fresh challenge of the ongoing farm agitation in Delhi. Many have questioned the Delhi police response although a large number of people endorsed the way Republic Day agitation of farmers was handled. There was a strong provocation from farmers, who crossed barricades; changed designated routes; did not follow instructions related to trollies with tractors; and eventually entered the Red Fort, where they were not supposed to. The police, despite incitement, largely exercised restraint and avoided major violence, which could have spiralled quickly and many would have suffered. The Congress, along with other parties like Shiv Sena and NCP, have blamed the BJP for failing to control farmers entering Red Fort, where they hoisted the Khalsa flag. So on one hand, Congress and NCP are currently part of the state government with Shiv Sena, which then called the two parties “killer” in the case of the Maval firing, for police failure to show restraint. The same outfits blame BJP today for its deliberate soft approach to the Delhi agitation. The BJP on the other hand, which was then in opposition in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is now ruling the civic body and wanted to complete the project to meet thirst of people. RR Patil, who served as home minister of Maharashtra, was perhaps right when he once said: “Police are a punching bag - whether they act or not. They only have brickbats to receive.” Patil, who came from rural parts of western Maharashtra and made it big in the city, is no more today to offer his opinion on what happened in Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-famers-protests-a-political-hot-potato-always-too-hot-to-handle-101612177107369.html

He said any action on Usmani will be based on the police findings.Deshmukh was responding to the demand made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of action against Usmani for allegedly saying that the Hindu community had “rotted”, during his address.“We are checking the video recording of the speech made at Elgar Parishad for objectionable comments. Until police have verified the claims, we cannot comment on it,” Deshmukh told reporters on Monday.Addressing a gathering of 500 people at the second edition of the conclave at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch, Usmani allegedly said that the Hindu community has “rotted,” adding, “fourteen-year-old Hafiz Junaid was killed by a mob in a train and no one stopped his attackers. I wonder what they (attackers) do at home after lynching a person. They may have discovered a new way to wash their hands – take bath with some medicine, have food, go for movies, touch the feet of their father and then lynch another person the next day.” BJP state unit spokesperson Keshav Upadhye had asked if chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would take action against Usmani or continue his rhetoric that Shiv Sena has not abandoned Hindutva.“How dare he say the Hindu community has rotted? Will the CM take action against him or continue with his rhetoric that they have not left Hindutva.

Despite that, this is a pro-poor and pro-middle class budget,” he said in Bengaluru on Monday. The union government extended the funding of ₹14,788 crore for phase 2A and 2B of the Bengaluru Metro rail project. “This is the biggest gift to Karnataka from our own finance minister,” Yediyurappa said.Also Read: Budget 2021: Relief for NRIs facing double taxation issue on retirement accountsSitharaman also added that the 278km Bengaluru-Chennai expressway work will be taken up this fiscal. Despite being one of the highest tax contributors to the central coffers, Karnataka has seen a significant amount of revenue loss due to devolution and share in goods and services tax (GST). “Our budget is dependent on how much the Centre gives the state,” said one senior government official, requesting not to be named. The official added that Karnataka has raised the issue of revenue losses with the Centre on all forums and requires capital to fund its schemes and programmes to be proposed in the upcoming budget. Yediyurappa has indicated that the size of the state budget could shrink as a result of Covid-19 and the reduction in funds from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/union-budget-a-catalyst-that-can-revive-economy-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-101612176148053.html

He fell off the running train near Mundikota railway station and was taken to nearby KTS Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.Also read | Groping without skin contact not sexual assault, rules Bombay High CourtIn 2013, Chaube moved the railway claims tribunal at Nagpur. The tribunal accepted that the woman was dependent on the deceased, that the death had occurred in an untoward incident and the deceased had a journey ticket for travel from Nagpur to Tumsar Road. The tribunal, however, dismissed Chaube’s claim mainly on the ground that the ticket was not valid for Janeshwari Express, compelling the woman to move the high court in appeal.The high court accepted her claim after noticing that the victim had boarded a wrong train. “He cannot be branded as an unauthorised passenger merely because he had mistakenly boarded a wrong train,” said justice Prabhudessai while reversing the tribunal order. The judge added that it was an untoward incident, as contemplated under the Railways Act, and “the Tribunal was, therefore, not justified in rejecting the claim solely on the ground that the victim had boarded a wrong train”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/boarding-wrong-train-no-ground-to-deny-railway-accident-claim-bombay-hc-101612166307810.html

Closure of the Ghazipur border, heavy police deployment and checking of vehicles at alternate border points have led to massive traffic snarls and bumper-to-bumper traffic on the roads connecting southern and central Delhi with the eastern parts of the city. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said that apart from the Delhi-Meerut expressway, all the carriageways of NH-9 and NH-24 were closed since Sunday night due to the farmers’ protest. “But as the closure of the roads caused a massive bottleneck, one carriageway on NH-24 going towards Delhi has been opened for traffic. The other roads are still closed. No vehicles are being allowed on these roads for people going towards east Delhi or Ghaziabad,” said DCP Yadav. Also read | DMRC closes gates of Tikri Border, other Metro stationsDelhi Traffic Police officials said that traffic is being diverted on other routes such as Vikas Marg, DND, and those in south and north Delhi. Among the roads that have been witnessing traffic jams are both the carriageways of Road No-56 between Ghazipur and Dilshad Garden via Anand Vihar ISBT, Vikas Marg (both carriageways), Ring Road (towards south Delhi and central Delhi), DND, and Ashram Chowk.As motorists faced inconvenience and complained about the traffic chaos on social media, the Delhi Traffic Police also used the same platform to update people about the traffic diversions and the suggested alternate routes. According to traffic police officials, heavy traffic was witnessed at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad) borders such as EDM Mall, Maharajpur, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Kondli and Loni borders as vehicles were diverted to these routes because of the closure of the UP Gate border where farmers are protesting against the three farm laws. “There have been inputs that farmers may try to enter Delhi and cause disruption. They had earlier given a call to reach Parliament on February 1 during the budget session. Although they postponed this march, we are not taking chances now after how they resorted to violence on January 26,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. According to the officer, the decision on opening other roads will be taken later in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-traffic-snarls-in-delhi-as-many-border-points-remain-closed-101612164208425.html

01-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt rejigs finance dept weeks ahead of state budget||The Delhi government has restructured its finance department to improve coordination and prevent overlap of work, senior government officials said on Sunday.The government has now compartmentalised the department into six divisions within it - administration, human resource, state resources, budget, expenditure, and policy, and appointed in-charges for each.The reorganisation comes while the finance department has started the process of preparing Delhi’s 2021-22 budget, which is expected to be tabled by the end of February.March, before the next fiscal begins, will mark a year since the Covid-19 pandemic first hit the Capital, pushing its revenue down nearly 30% even after the lockdown, according to government data.Prior to the reorganising order issued by state finance secretary Sandeep Kumar dated January 11, 2021, Delhi government’s finance department broadly had only four branches — accounts, budget, expenditure and administration.Following this reorganisation, a second order was issued on January 12 wherein the government defined which officer would be in-charge of each division. The second order stated that while each of the six branches will have a “division in-charge”, each will also have a “controlling officer” — the two special secretaries of the finance department — to oversee all work and fix accountability.“In any government, officers keep getting transferred. There have been major confusions and work overlap, because officers never had clearly defined roles or scope within the finance department. Many times, a file would keep shifting from one table to another even within the same department. So, with these two orders now, the job roles of each officer and their workflow has been defined clearly,” said a senior finance officer on condition of anonymity.A senior official in Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said such “reorganisations” are being considered for other departments of the Delhi government as well.“A similar restructure is being worked on in the government’s grievance redressal cell, and a similar plan is being explored in the general administration department as well,” the officer said.As the process to draw up the year’s budget begins, the finance department has asked all departments to submit revised estimates and outline additional funds they need, on the basis of the projects being worked on.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, is likely to convene his first Delhi budget-related meeting this week.Senior officials said the fund allocated for Covid-19 which in last year’s budget was just ₹50 crore, is going to be increased this time.Another big ticket scheme that will be repackaged and announced in the budget will be health cards for all Delhi residents.Health sector is likely to get one of the highest share of funds, which some senior officials said could be even more than the education sector this time.As for the Union budget, which will be presented on Monday, the Delhi government has demanded that the national capital be treated at par with the Union territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir regarding its share of central taxes and central assistance to UTs, and the Disaster Response Fund. It has also asked the Central government for additional funds to ease the financial crunch being faced by the three municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-rejigs-finance-dept-weeks-ahead-of-state-budget-101612155680566.html

In an order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, the DDMA relaxed the cap on the number of guests to now allow up to 200 persons in banquet halls or closed spaces for weddings. Apart from weddings, the DDMA has also allowed similar gatherings of up to 200 people in closed spaces for funerals or any other congregations of social, religious, sports, entertainment or cultural nature.The DDMA also issued a set of standard operating procedure (SOP) for weddings and other forms of gatherings in the city. In closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 200 persons. In open spaces or grounds, the number of permissible persons will depend on the area of the venue.The order implied that if someone is planning a bigger wedding or any event with more than 200 persons, then choosing an open space would be a better option since there is no specific cap on the number of persons mentioned in the document. Wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitiser will be mandatory, it stated. The SOP stated that organisers should also promote simple public health measures at the events to prevent the spread of Covid-19.All public utility areas, such as food stalls and stage will have to be sanitised prior to the event. Common bins for disposal of face masks, multiple hand wash facilities, separate entry and exit gates, and circulation of outdoor air should be increased as much as possible, the order said. While only asymptomatic persons will be allowed, the rules also stated that entry of guests will have to be regulated at the venue to ensure it does not exceed the upper limit at any time. For closed spaces, the air-conditioners should be set at temperature of 24-30 degree Celsius with a relative humidity of 40-70%, said the document. If someone falls ill, then the guest will have to be immediately isolated and be taken to the nearest medical facility or the district officials should be contacted. Ramesh Dang, president of Delhi banquet federation, said the relaxation will give a much needed boost to their business. “We already have several bookings. With the relaxation in guest numbers, we hope our bookings will increase. The decision has come a bit late as it’s already over a month since the wedding season started. But, thankfully, now we will not lose bookings for such events to the neighbouring cities of Gurugram and Noida where more guests have been allowed for a while now,” he said. On Sunday, the DDMA also allowed cinema halls to operate to full capacity and permitted swimming pools to be opened to the general public. It also allowed organising of trade exhibitions and sports events in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-allows-200-guests-at-weddings-in-closed-halls-no-limit-on-open-spaces-101612151307025.html

01-02-2021||Delhi||Day after cold wave, Delhi wakes up to fog; mercury may rest at 5°C||Delhi woke up to a foggy morning on Monday with the minimum temperature likely to reach 5 degree Celsius (°C) a day after the cold wave. On Sunday, the minimum temperature had dropped to 3.1°C which is 5°C below normal. It was the fourth cold wave day in Delhi in a week. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has also forecast that a fresh Western Disturbance is expected to pass over Delhi-NCR, causing thunderstorm and light rain over the region on February 4 and 5. Delhi also recorded seven cold wave days in January this year, which is the maximum for the month since 2008, as per IMD recordings. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said 12 cold wave days were recorded in January 2008. The IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature is recorded below 10°C and the deviation from normal is of four degrees or above. Also read | Widespread rain, thunderstorms likely over NW India this week“Only one cold wave day each was recorded in 2019 and 2020,” Srivastava said, adding that the Capital had recorded six cold wave days in January 2013. He said the increase in the number of cold wave days this month was caused because only one Western Disturbance affected the plains of northwest India this year, leading to more cloudless nights and low temperatures. The northwesterly winds from the snow-clad regions in the Himalayas blowing into Delhi also kept the temperatures low, he said. “Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, warming the ground. The minimum temperature falls in the absence of a cloud cover,” he said. Meanwhile, air quality index (AQI) dropped to very poor category on Monday morning. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that the average hourly AQI was 316 at 7am.

01-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local train services resume for all with timing restrictions||Local train services in the Mumbai region resumed for the general public from Monday. The announcement in this regard was made by Union railways minister Piyush Goyal after the Maharashtra government proposed to resume the services for all commuters.Travel by local trains, lifeline for millions of people living in Mumbai and surrounding satellite towns, was severely restricted after the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.As suburban trains are the lifeline for Mumbaikars, there was a growing demand to resume services for all. The government took a measured approach to reopen the services as the state has been hit the worst by the Covid-19 pandemic. In phased unlocking, the government allowed emergency staff, teaching, non-teaching staff, practising lawyers, women passengers, disabled people to travel by local trains. But so far, it was not open for all.Goyal had informed on Friday that local trains will be available in three time slots - from the start of the day's services to 7am; 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm; and 9:00 pm to the end of the day.As per the instructions of the Maharashtra government, between 7:00 am to 12:00 pm and from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm only those engaged in essential services will be allowed to travel, the railway minister said."I urge all of you to follow all the necessary rules and guidelines related to coronavirus during the journey. Any kind of negligence can become a problem for us and others as well. If you will be safe, then everyone traveling with you will be safe," Goyal said.The services of the local trains were resumed for the emergency and essential services staff in June last year. Later on, the authorities permitted women to travel in locals during the non-peak hours.Before the pandemic struck, the Central Railway was operating 1,774 suburban services daily, while the Western Railway operated 1,367 services.Currently, the two railway authorities are operating 2,985 services, about 95 per cent of the total 3,141 services, on Mumbai's suburban network. Of these, 204 special suburban services were added on Friday morning.The state government said in its circular about local trains that it will request all establishments to stagger their work schedule so that employees can benefit from the new schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-train-services-resume-for-all-with-timing-restrictions-101612144624302.html
01-02-2021||Bangalore||Amid rumblings, 15 Karnataka BJP MLAs to meet party brass in Capital||Around 15 key Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators from Karnataka are likely to meet the party’s top brass in New Delhi in the first week of February to discuss changes in the functioning of the state government, ways to develop a second rung of leaders and end family-based politics, among other issues, three people aware of the development said.The legislators, who form an important part of the ruling party, have already held at least two rounds of meetings with party seniors. They maintain changes are required to strengthen the Karnataka unit of party and rectify problems ahead of the 2023 state elections.“We do not have any demands for ministerial berths...we are not going there to complain about the chief minister or his family. We want to suggest how to bring the Narendra Modi model of government here as well which is not the case right now,” said one three-time legislator, requesting anonymity.The legislators are likely to meet BJP national president JP Nadda and general secretary (organisation), BL Santosh, among other leaders.The meetings come after a cabinet expansion and portfolio reshuffle carried out by chief minister BS Yediyurappa led to protests and criticism by those who were left out of the exercise. The 77-year-old politician is trying to douse one crisis after another to retain power.Also read: Vaccination rate best in world in 1st 15 days, says PM ModiWith just two years to go before the elections, the persistent rattle, lack of ideology-based schemes, charges of corruption and factionalism within the government has spooked core party members, who are apprehensive of the impact of such developments on the party’s prospects.“There is no social or regional equity in the cabinet and we want to seek equal opportunities for all workers,” said a second leader who too did not want to be named.A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University, said the group of legislators meeting the central leadership of the BJP clearly are not in favour of the chief minister.“The BJP is dependent on a powerful bunch of people (turncoats) and any government that has no control over its MLAs cannot run according to party principles or the will of the chief minister,” Narayana said.V Sunil Kumar, the BJP’s chief whip and legislator from Karkala, sent a letter to the state president on December 1 to convene a meeting of all legislators after allegations that the CM was focusing on turncoats ahead of the cabinet expansion.Yediyurappa ceded to dissent from within a section of new entrants, leaving him vulnerable to “blackmail”, the party legislators cited above said.They alleged that Yediyurappa had sidelined the old guard and prioritised turncoats whom he continues to reward for helping bring down the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition in 2019 and put him in power.“The problem is that BJP was not given an absolute majority in the previous elections and those legislators who rejected the Congress and came to our party have to be placated...,” KS Eshwarappa, the rural development and panchayat raj minister said.The government is also under pressure from the opposition over its alleged non-performance, inadequate flood relief work, farm laws, amendments to industrial and labour laws and the resurfacing of corruption charges against the government.“The government itself was formed on unethical lines with money and blackmail and hence their foundation is weak....The state is suffering and limping along,” said Dinesh Gundu Rao, former Congress state president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/amid-rumblings-15-karnataka-bjp-mlas-to-meet-party-brass-in-capital-101612143045051.html

01-02-2021||Bhopal||MP plans to rent out space in mandis to private sector||The Madhya Pradesh government plans to enlist the private sector to develop shopping complexes, medical clinics, petrol pumps, and fertilizer and seed centres in the government-run markets where farmers used to sell their produce, a senior official said.The Madhya Pradesh State Agricultural Marketing Board suffered a dip in revenue to ₹132 crore in the three months ended December from ₹256 crore in the same period last year after the Centre in September passed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020 that allowed the sale of agricultural produce outside government-run mandis (markets).The mandis record highest revenue during harvest months of April to June and from October to December. There are 259 such mandis and 298 sub-mandis in Madhya Pradesh.“The tax on sale of produce in agriculture markets has been reduced and, according to the new farm law, farmers are free to sell their crop outside [government-run] markets so there is no chance of revival of 259 mandis in the future,” said a board official who spoke on condition of anonymity.He said the state planned to enlist private entities and offer them land in markets to develop retail shopping complexes, petrol pumps, fertilizer and seed centres and so on. “Similarly, the government will give some area to NGOs [non-government organisations] to run medical clinics for farmers,” he said.Another official, who also requested anonymity, said the objective is to motivate farmers to keep coming to mandis. “Services to farmers such as buying seeds and health goods will be provided at subsidised rates through a smart card to be issued by farmers’ welfare and agriculture development department,” the second official said.On the proposal to allow petrol pumps inside mandis, the officials said it would be a viable option because most agricultural markets are on the highways or close by and they would help government earn revenue.Reacting to the proposal, MP Mandi Board Association president BB Faujdar said: “The government is heading towards privatization of Mandis. This plan might be feasible for category A Mandis, which are bigger in size, but what about small grain mandis which are running on government land on lease or rent? This means the government will close small mandis.”Farmers are not enthused by the plan. A farm leader from Sehore, Bhagwan Meena, said: “It is good that the government is thinking about revamping mandis but this is foolish that farmers will go to mandis for shopping. Farmers have no problem in selling their crops in mandis, but it’s traders who don’t want to come to the mandis to purchase crops. I don’t think this plan will work.”Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Ajay Singh Yadav said the government was trying to privatize the mandis.“This model is not to revive the mandis, but this is the first step towards privatization of mandis. We will oppose this move,” said Yadav.Farmers’ welfare and agricultural development minister Kamal Patel said: “If farmers are getting benefit from the new farm law, we have made a plan of inviting businessmen to revive mandis in MP. We are renting space, not whole mandis. The retail shops will be opened in the mandis and farmers will get everything from a needle to tractor and i.e., at subsidized rate like army men, who purchase things from the army canteens at much lower rates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-plans-to-rent-out-space-in-mandis-to-private-sector-101612141028493.html

01-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata will be left alone by election time, says Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee would be left alone in the Trinamool Congress by the time the state polls are held, even as the ruling party accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of insulting the national anthem during its rally.“The way leaders of the Trinamool Congress, CPI(M) and Congress are joining the BJP in large numbers, by the time the election approaches, Mamata Banerjee will not be able to find anyone behind her when she looks back. There would be none to support you,” the senior BJP leader said addressing a rally in south Bengal’s Howrah district virtually.On Saturday, five Trinamool Congress rebels joined the BJP in the presence of Shah in Delhi. The leaders included former minister and Trinamool heavyweight Rajib Banerjee.The development came close on the heels of other resignations from the party. In December last year, senior leader Suvendu Adhikari quit the Trinamool Congress to join the BJP.Watch: Mamata Banerjee will be left all alone, says Amit ShahSenior BJP leaders hinted that more Trinamool leaders are likely to join the BJP over the next few days. Former TMC leader Adhikari said that the BJP will wipe out the ruling party from its bastions. “Between February 2 and February 20, we will clear Kolkata and South 24 Parganas and there would be no leaders left in the TMC,” said Adhikari at the rally on Sunday.Reacting to the Trinamool Congress rebels joining the BJP, party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: “These leaders have enjoyed every privilege and enjoyed all facilities over the past 10 years. Now that elections are drawing nearer, suddenly their conscience has surfaced and they are leaving the TMC, bringing all sorts of wild and baseless allegations. Where was their conscience all these years.”Shah, who cancelled his two-day trip to Bengal in the wake of the ongoing farmers’ protests in New Delhi and a low-intensity blast in the national capital on Friday, said that the condition of West Bengal has deteriorated under the Trinamool government.“In the hands of Mamata Banerjee, Bengal has deteriorated further from where the communists had left. You have pushed Bengal backwards in every sphere instead of taking it forward. Hence a wave of change is visible in Bengal today and Didi won’t be able to stop the wave,” Shah said.Accusing the Mamata Banerjee-led government of corruption, Union minister Smriti Irani, who addressed the rally in Howrah, said: “No patriotic person would want to stay in a political party which insults the slogan of Jai Shri Ram.”Irani was referring to Banerjee’s refusal to address an event organised to mark the 124th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in Kolkata earlier this month after some BJP supporters raised slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi just before the CM was to begin her speech.The Trinamool Congress, meanwhile, said that the Centre’s ruling party was not aware of the ground realities of the state. “The BJP will not get more than 99 assembly seats in the coming elections. The home minister, instead of speaking on important issues like internal security of the country and infiltrations, is levelling baseless allegations and attacking the chief minister’s nephew. He is not aware of the ground realities of Bengal,” Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said.A controversy has erupted in the state with the chief minister’s nephew and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee accusing the BJP of insulting the national anthem by singing it incorrectly at Sunday’s rally.“Those preaching about Patriotism & Nationalism can’t even sing our National Anthem correctly. This is the party which claims to uphold India’s honour and pride! SHAMEFUL! Will @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India apologise for this “Anti-National” Act? #BJPInsultsNationalAnthem,” he tweeted, along with a video of BJP leaders singing the national anthem at the rally in Howarh’s Dumurjala.The Left front in the state also hit out at the BJP after the incident. “I had once challenged BJP parliamentarians during the UPA-I tenure. I had said in Parliament that if any of them (BJP leaders) can sing the first eight lines of Vande Mataram, I would resign. There was silence for two minutes. None accepted the challenge,” said Md Salim, leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist).The West Bengal Congress Committee tweeted: “#WrongNationalAnthem On the 46th second of the video “janganamangal dayak” was sung as “janganamangal adhinayak” in BJP’s party hopping meet in Howrah today. What action to be taken against this insult to the national anthem? @INCIndia @adhirrcinc @JitinPrasada.”The BJP, however, refuted the allegations. “There were two Union ministers, at least three former ministers who were earlier in the TMC, several eminent personalities. No one would believe that all of them together sang the National Anthem wrongly. The TMC is doing politics with the National Anthem as it had earlier done with the name of Lord Ram and Netaji. People won’t accept such politics,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state.The state is due to go to the polls before May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-will-be-left-alone-by-election-time-says-shah-101612128326577.html

A list of Covid-19 Task Groups along with contact numbers department wise is attached,” the notice read.Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House college in North Campus, said that all the SoPs will be followed and only students of Science courses and those in Geography (Hons) will be coming for laboratory work. “Only 12 third-year students, having practical components in their courses, requested to come back to the hostel. They are expected to come later this week. Only one person will be allowed to stay in one room,” she said.In November, the varsity had allowed postgraduate students of Science courses and MPhil and PhD scholars to return to the colleges for practical work. For graduate students, the university had been shut since March last year in view of the pandemic.DU’s official spokesperson Balaram Pani, who is also the principal of Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, said the college has sanitised all classrooms and laboratories. “We will follow all SoPs... and allow 10 students in a laboratory at a time,” he said.However, some teachers raised concern over the decision to make it compulsory for the staff to attend physical classes.Abha Dev Habib, member of DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA), said: “There is no point calling all teachers to college. Many of the colleges don’t have a proper internet connection. How will teachers manage to take classes in such a situation?” In its order, the university had said colleges can schedule the timings of the staff members in a staggered manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/colleges-reopen-today-for-final-year-students-101612128018378.html

At Euro School, principal Jyotsna Mayadas said they are planning for partially reopening after receiving an official directive from the government. “We have done all the planning related to the school reopening. We have installed battery-operated sprayers on our school buses to ensure thorough sanitisation. Attendants have been trained to conduct temperature checks for all on-board. Children will sit at a distance and there will be a cap on the total number of students in a classroom to ensure physical distancing. The common areas have floor markings to ensure distance is maintained among students and staff at all times.”At Ryan International School in Sanpada, only half the strength of a class would be called to the school. “We have currently planned to continue with our online schooling. Once the school reopens we will have to maintain social distancing and to allow only one student in each bench, we will have to call only half the number of students. The others can attend the classroom virtually,” said school principal Muriel Fernandes.Schools in the rural areas of Thane district had reopened on January 27. They have been following social distancing rules and ensuring that each student’s temperature is checked. Teachers had also been asked to get themselves tested for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/awaiting-state-nod-thane-schools-prep-to-restart-in-safe-mode-101612122325577.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||45th Raising Day: ₹1,500-crore contraband seized by Indian Coast Guard in 2020||During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) claims to have seized contraband worth ₹1,500 crore that was being smuggled into the country through the coastline. The ICG was able to intercept more than 10 foreign fishing boats with 80 miscreants illegally operating in the Indian exclusive economic zone (EEZ). After nabbing the suspects, they were handed over to the local police station for further legal action, said an ICG officer. In 2020, 11 cyclones hit the Indian coastline and the ICG conducted rescue operations and saved the lives of around 40,000 fishermen by escorting them back to shore. During the pandemic, patrolling was round the clock and fishing boat checks were conducted, said the officer. The ICG will be celebrating its 45th Raising Day on February 1. In the last 44 years, the ICG has grown into a formidable force, with 156 ships and 62 aircraft, and is likely to achieve targeted force levels of 200 surface platforms and 80 aircraft by 2025. The Coast Guard patrols the distance between the shore and 12 to 200 nautical miles in the sea. ICG is the fourth largest coast guard in the world and plays a very important role in securing coasts and enforcing regulations within the maritime zones of India.In the last 44 years, the ICG has saved over 10,000 lives and apprehended around 14,000 miscreants since its inception in 1977. On average, the Coast Guard saves a life every two days at sea, the ICG officer mentioned in a press note released ahead of Raising Day.“During the pandemic, we maintained a round-the-clock vigil in the exclusive economic zone, by deploying around 50 ships and 12 aircraft daily. Due to the vigil, we managed to seize contraband worth about ₹1,500 crore and apprehend more than 10 foreign fishing boats with 80 miscreants illegally operating in the Indian EEZ in 2020,” said an ICG spokesperson. Last year in September, the Indian Coast Guard doused a fire onboard the 333-metre-long carrier motor tanker New Diamond off the Sri Lanka coast, which was carrying 3 lakh metric tonnes of crude oil. The ICG averted a major ecological disaster and rescued 23 crew members of the tanker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/45th-raising-day-1-500-crore-contraband-seized-by-indian-coast-guard-in-2020-101612122145694.html

Two researchers from the institute — PhD student Kushal Tibrewal and professor Chandra Venkataraman— set out to assess the benefits (climate co-benefits) of air quality and clean energy policies in the country using multiple metrics such as the global warming and temperature change potentials. Their paper, ‘Climate co-benefits of air quality and clean energy policy in India’, was published in the Nature Sustainability journal on December 14 last year. “We assess climate co-benefits of policies addressing sustainable development goals, specifically air quality and residential clean energy access, to identify which of these might yield significant climate co-benefits and, therefore, be candidates to integrate into the country’s climate action plan,” said Venkataraman, co-author of the study and professor in the department of chemical engineering and associate faculty in the interdisciplinary programme in climate studies at IIT-B. The researchers found that policies on residential clean energy and air pollution regulation by curbing brick production and burning of agricultural residue have greater benefits than the policies on curbing emissions from industries and transportation. “We found residential clean energy programmes, specifically the adoption of liquefied petroleum gas cook stoves and household electrification, deliver significant reductions in emissions of warming short-lived climate forcers (wSLCFs or substances in the air that have shorter lifetime in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide) and related carbon dioxide emissions. However, only specific air quality programmes yield reduction in emissions of wSLCFs,” Venkataraman added. For example, emissions control standards related to sulphur dioxide in electricity generation lead to reduction in sulphate particles. However, since sulphate particles are cooling agents in the atmosphere, their reduction can lead to warming. On the other hand, emission standards in sectors like fired brick production and curbs on agricultural residue burning can significantly reduce emissions of wSLCFs. Integrating these policies can improve emission control, said the researchers. Traditionally the approach towards climate policies has been to look at emissions from electricity generation, transportation and industries separately. “The measures identified in the study are simultaneously linked to improving human health and food security, along with upgrading infrastructure and promoting sustainable cities and communities. Integrating these interventions into national climate policies can bring them under a more stringent surveillance,” she said. “The divergence of the implications of some of the policies focusing on climate mitigation (long-term) and air quality does present a challenge for an economy like India. However, the focus of policy makers must definitely be on improving air quality in the near to medium term as the implications for health of the citizens is long-term and cumulative. The slow pace of roll out of the pollution control retrofits in power plants and the increasing prices of LPG in the post-pandemic period suggests that air quality has been accorded a lower priority,” Karthik Ganesan, fellow, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), who was not a part of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/integrating-air-quality-clean-energy-policies-can-cut-emissions-iit-bombay-scientists-101612122085738.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccination: Mumbai’s average turnout is 71%||The city has seen an average turnout of 71.5% at its Covid-19 vaccination centres over the past nine inoculation days — 37,731 health workers of the targeted 52,714 beneficiaries have received their first vaccine shots since January 19, when the drive resumed.On January 16 (day one of the vaccination drive), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) vaccinated 1,926 health workers, but as the CoWIN app, an automated system developed by the Centre to monitor and track the inoculation process, developed glitches, the drive was put on hold.This is the civic body’s phase one of the drive, meant for 125,000 registered health workers.Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of BMC, said, “To increase the turnout for vaccination, BMC on Saturday held a massive walk-in drive. Any health worker, who had already registered for vaccination, was allowed to walk into any of our 12 vaccination centres. This drive was very successful as we vaccinated the highest number of people so far on Saturday.”On Saturday, BMC vaccinated 6,351 people — an 80% turnout. On Friday, it vaccinated 5,510 people — a 72% turnout; the highest turnout was on January 22, at 92%, when BMC vaccinated 3,539 health workers, followed by January 23’s 90% turnout when BMC vaccinated 4,374 beneficiaries.The civic body has been facing challenges in communicating the date and time of vaccination to beneficiaries. A senior civic officer said, “We have received many complaints from beneficiaries that they did not receive the automated message, or received it late, after the drive for the day was completed, or even the next day. Some beneficiaries are directly receiving messages asking for feedback of their vaccination dose, even though they were not vaccinated as they did not know their turn had come.”Dr Gomare said, “BMC is now doing double work. We are calling health workers from the control rooms set up at the wards, informing them to come in for vaccination. We are not relying on the automated message system. Daily reports of such complaints are being sent to the government.”The civic body also increased the number of vaccination centres to 12 from 11 on January 29, and to 11 from 10 on January 27, to scale its vaccination capacity. In the coming days, BMC will also open vaccination centres at Jumbo facilities in Dahisar, Mulund, and Richarson and Cruddas (RC) in Byculla. The other centres are the four major hospitals — King Edward Memorial Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper hospital and Sion Hospital; four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha at Bandra, V N Desai at Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital, Kandivali; the Covid facility at Bandra Kurla Complex; and the state-run JJ Hospital in South Mumbai, NESCO in Goregaon, and Seven Hills hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-mumbai-s-average-turnout-is-71-101612122030450.html

This year however, as schools in the city are closed from the past 10 months owing to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, they cannot hold the mock tests and guidance sessions within their premises. This situation left students and parents anxious and schools in a fix. The institutes did not know how to navigate the situation in the beginning. Gradually, many of them found a way around. From introducing a drop box to teaching students in gardens and at their homes, schools and colleges are doing it all to ensure that the board exams, scheduled for April-May this year, go smoothly for the students. At VPM’s Vidya Mandir High School, Dahisar, parents can drop-in solved prelim papers into the drop boxes on designated days. The teachers then check the papers and drop them back, from where the parents can pick up the sheets. “Every year, we conduct practice tests and prelims after the syllabus is over. This year, however, it was not possible to do so due to the lockdown. Hence, we came up with the idea of a drop box. We send papers to students as per the timetable on the Google Classroom created for them and they have to solve the questions within the time given. Parents can then drop the papers in sealed envelopes on the given dates,” said Kshama Valanjoo, assistant headmistress of the school. A Borivli school and junior college received several requests from parents for conducting practice exams at the institute. But with the local authorities not allowing institutes to reopen, the school was unable to call students despite parents’ consent. “We have now made groups of 10 students and have asked them to come to a nearby garden where we gave them the papers. They then solve the paper there and our teachers guide them in person,” said a teacher from the school. KVK School in Ghatkopar used a question paper generator app to digitally create and send papers to students. “Students can submit solved papers in the school and those who are not in the city can post three papers together. We will conduct prelims in the same fashion. A lot of our students cannot afford tuitions, hence we have to help them in all ways possible,” said school principal Jagdish Indalkar. Teachers are also providing guidance lectures and special coaching to weak students. “We have made groups of students and have assigned a teacher to help students solve their queries and guide them from time to time,” said Valanjoo. Prominent junior colleges said that they were still using the online medium for tests on which a large number of students are enrolled. Satram Verhani, vice-principal of CHM College at Ulhasnagar, said that as colleges have a large number of students, it is a challenge to collect physical answer sheets. “We have around 2,200 students and hence we conducted only periodic tests [online] so far. If physical schools and colleges are allowed to partially reopen in the coming days, we will consider some offline options too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-schools-go-extra-mile-for-class-10-12-students-ahead-of-board-exams-101612121426611.html
01-02-2021||Chandigarh||Kalka MLA’s hasty suspension is condemnable: Kumari Selja||Haryana Congress Committee president Kumari Selja has raised questions over the disqualification of Pradeep Chaudhary, Congress MLA from the Kalka assembly segment, soon after he was convicted by a court in Himachal Pradesh’s Nalagarh.Selja, who was visiting Karnal, alleged that Haryana speaker Gian Chand Gupta had taken the decision hastily: “The speaker did not even allow Chaudhary to present his stand before the disqualification, which is condemnable. We respect the orders of the honourable court, but the decision of the speaker is surprising and taken in a hurry.”A Himachal Pradesh court had convicted and sentenced Chaudhary to three years in jail in a 2011 rioting case on Thursday. Legal experts say his membership can be restored if the high court (HC) stays his conviction.On the ongoing farmers’ agitation and violence in Delhi , Selja said the government had adopted cheap tactics to suppress this agitation but had failed as the farmers were united .She said that violence in Delhi was the government’s failure. “The administration misled the farmers and they were not given the proper routes promised to them. The farmers had been protesting for the last two months, but the government did not pay any attention to them and tried to create a rift among farmers,” she said, adding that the Congress will take out a peace march in every block of the state in support of ongoing farmers’ agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kalka-mla-s-hasty-suspension-is-condemnable-kumari-selja-101612121064899.html
01-02-2021||Other||Mohali MC polls: BJP candidates campaigning without party symbol||Even though Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) has officially released the list of 29 names for municipal corporation elections, but most of the candidates are campaigning without the party symbol. They have put up banners and posters without the symbol and photographs of any senior party leaders.With Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) snapping ties with the BJP last year due to the contentious agriculture laws, the BJP has decided to contest alone on all 50 seats. In the last MC elections held in 2015, out of total 50 seats, BJP in alliance got 18 seats, but they contested only on 11 seats for the lack of adequate candidates and won only 6 seats.Rakhi Pathak, president of BJP Mahila Morcha in Mohali contesting from ward number 31 has not put any symbol or photograph of any senior leaders on her posters/banners. She said, “I am a little busy filling my nomination papers, will include the party symbol after my nomination.”Mohali BJP secretary and spokesperson Ashok Jha, who is also contesting elections said, “My banners do have the party symbol, except the ones which were damaged by some miscreants at a few places. We are well placed to win the elections.”Another former BJP councillor, Bobby Kamboj, who was denied the party ticket this time, said, “I appeal all the BJP candidates to surrender their party tickets for farmers, who lost their lives during the protest in Delhi. I support the farmer’s agitation. I will contest the elections independently from ward number 27. It is for sure that all 50 BJP candidates will forfeit their security.”BJP’s state executive member Sukhwinder Singh Goldy said the candidates will put the symbol and photographs on their banners once they file the nominations.Local MLA and cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said BJP will be completely wiped out in the MC elections from Mohali. “There is a strong undercurrent against the saffron party over the farm laws. People have made up their minds to elect Congress,” he said.The municipal body is elected for a period of five years and its previous term ended on April 26 last year. In the last term, Congress had 14 councillors and the SAD-BJP won 23 seats. The Azad group, which was led by former mayor Kulwant Singh won 10 seats and two seats were bagged by independent councillors. In the 2015 elections, 27 councillors, including 10 from Azad group, 14 Congress and two independents, had elected Kulwant as the mayor, but later in August 2017, he joined SAD.20 names released for Kharar civic pollsBJP Punjab state president Ashwani Sharma on Sunday gave his nod to 20 candidates for the Kharar municipal council elections scheduled on February 14. The decision in this regard was taken after a meeting of the State Election Committee (SEC) held under the leadership of Sharma. Kharar election in-charge Vineet Joshi said BJP had announced 20 of the 27 candidates and the remaining will be announced soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-mc-polls-bjp-candidates-campaigning-without-party-symbol-101612120946263.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||DU set to reopen, students scout for PGs, rent accommodations||Delhi University has finally decided to reopen its campus, from February 1, to those final year students who require practical classes in labs, while ensuring all precautions like social distancing are followed amid the pandemic. Professor Rajeev Gupta, Dean, Students Welfare, DU, said, “Campus is opening up for final year students who require a some component of practical lab work in their course. The colleges won’t be hosting any theory classes, and those classes will all continue to be conducted online.” And this has encouraged many students to check out places near their colleges, to enquire and plan their accommodation in PGs as they brace themselves for an offline campus experience. “The biggest challenge for a student studying in DU, who isn’t a day scholar, is accommodation. As DU has started opening up its campus bit by bit, freshers like me have started our preparations like searching for a budget friendly accommodation. I’ve found out that Satyaniketan is a hub for PGs and the range for fee is from six thousand to fifteen thousand. I’m also exploring the option of rented flats because the food in PGs is not that good at times,” says Manish Mourya, a student of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College.Some freshers have reached out to senior students to seek guidance in choosing the right accommodation for themselves. And a few seniors have voluntarily come forward to help these students find a suitable accommodation without having to pay brokerage. “The lure for the offline campus experience is clear by the number of calls we are getting in a day from freshers who have started searching for PGs in Delhi. We are getting somewhere between 15 to 20 calls per day from students asking about available accommodations. I offered to help my juniors so that they can find the perfect home away from home for themselves, that too without having to pay the brokerage. Most of us all still going through a financial crises due to the pandemic, and seeing my juniors face financial challenges motivated me to help them find a safe, secure and healthy environment to live. This is the least I can do to help students,” says Vishwesh Tiwari, a student of Sri Aurobindo College. PG owners in and around the campus confirm the increase in footfall of students who are coming to see the flats and bargain the rent. “Students have started visiting the PGs to see whether the place is sanitised or not, what’s the rent, and even enquire about the plans to maintain social distancing between the residents. A lot of students are also asking if the popular hang out zones like Majnu ka Tilla are open to visit now,” says Rakesh Bhasin, owner of a PG near North Campus.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-set-to-reopen-students-scout-for-pgs-rent-accommodations-101612120826793.html

The police said the accused, Brijesh Kumar Singh, committed the crime because he wanted to keep his job at the site secured. Singh has been arrested for murder and the police were recording the statements of the accused and two other security guards at the time of going to press. According to Worli police, Singh and the victim, 50-year-old Dayashankar Jaiswar, were hired as security guards for Rs25,000 per month each at the construction site in AK Ahire Marg. The officers said that when the duo were at the site for the night shift on Saturday, Singh confronted Jaiswar and accused him of conspiring with two other guards to get him transferred to a site with a lower salary. Jaiswar denied the allegations but an argument ensued between the two men which turned violent in no time. Singh then picked up a hammer and clobbered Jaiswar on his head with it to secure his job, said the police. Two other security guards who were asleep in the nearby cabin woke up after hearing Jaiswar’s screams. When they reached the spot, Singh told them that when he went to the washroom, three men entered the site after jumping the boundary wall and killed Jaiswar when he tried to prevent them from coming to the site. Singh and the other two security guards called their supervisor, who informed the police about the incident. “We reached the construction site and rushed Jaiswar to KEM (King Edward Memorial) Hospital, but he was declared dead on arrival,” said a police officer. The police then registered a case against three unidentified accused. However, during investigation they discovered that there was so sign of any intruder at the site during the murder. “We then detained Singh and questioned him, following which he confessed to murdering Jaiswar with a hammer to secure his well-paid job,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guard-kills-colleague-with-hammer-in-mumbai-to-avoid-transfer-101612120405573.html

The petitions were filed after MSEDCL refused to appoint Maratha community members in the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category for 400 vacant posts. The petitioners who were previously covered by the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) reservation approached HC seeking directions to be considered for EWS reservation as they were eligible to apply under the quota. On January 29, a division bench of justice KK Tated and justice NR Borkar, who were hearing a bunch of petitions filed by various members of the Maratha community, was informed by their lawyers that their clients were aspiring to get a job in MSEDCL pursuant to its advertisement for Kendra Sahayak post which was issued in July 2019. The advocates informed that after HC had upheld SEBC reservation, the petitioners had applied for the said quota in the job. However, after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of SEBC reservation last year in October, their applications were considered to be from the open category. In an earlier hearing, the counsel for one of the petitioners, advocate Satish Talekar, said though the aspirants could not benefit from SEBC reservation owing to the SC stay, members from the community who are from financially weaker backgrounds could avail EWS quota and hence, applied for it. However, the authorities refused to grant them EWS certificate and hence, MSEDCL did not consider their applications under the quota. The court then asked the officials concerned the reason behind denying the EWS certificates. On January 29, Talekar informed the court that the state had issued a circular on December 23, 2020, clarifying that Maratha community members from the financially weak category could avail benefits under EWS quota, and on producing a receipt of the same, such persons should be considered by MSEDCL. Talekar sought HC’s directions to MSEDCL to revise the existing merit list as the current petitioners names would also have to be featured in it. However, other applicants under EWS category opposed the petitions stating that if the Maratha petitioners are included in the list, it will prejudice their chances of getting appointed. The bench was then informed by MSEDCL that apart from the bunch of petitions and intervention applications before it, there were many similar petitions before the Nagpur and Aurangabad bench of HC too. After hearing the submissions, the court directed MSEDCL to seek clubbing of all the petitions so they may be heard at the principal seat in Mumbai and posted the hearing for the first week of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/msedcl-jobs-bombay-hc-to-decide-on-new-merit-list-to-include-marathas-101612119929116.html

According to the BJP, Usmani allegedly made defamatory remarks while addressing a gathering of 500 people at the second edition of the conclave at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch. BJP’s state unit spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would either take action against Usmani or continue his rhetoric that his party Shiv Sena has not left Hindutva. “Will the CM take action against him or continue with his rhetoric that they have not left Hindutva. State home minister Anil Deshmukh should take action against him,” Upadhye said objecting to Usmani’s comment.The Elgar Parishad conclave was organised by Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella organisation of 250 Dalit organisations. The Elgar Parishad conclave was first held in 2018 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bhima-Koregaon of 1818. The conclave was followed by violent clashes at Bhima-Koregaon village, which is located 35km from Pune city. According to the Dalit narrative, the 1818 battle is the victory over casteism, as the British Army, comprising a large contingent of Dalit Mahar soldiers, had defeated the forces of the Peshwa at Bhima Koregaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/act-against-sharjeel-usmani-for-defaming-hindu-community-bjp-to-maharashtra-govt-101612119205552.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra recorded 92,177 Covid-19 cases in January, shows state data||Maharashtra recorded 2,585 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, pushing the case count 2,026,399. It has been 329 days since the first case was detected in the state on March 9 last year. Death toll reached 51,062 as 40 casualties were reported on Sunday. A comparative analysis of the figures of the past two months indicates a decline in daily cases with 92,177 cases registered in January, which is much less than December and November where 120,664 and 143,262 cases were recorded respectively, according to the figures provided by the state health department.Of the fatalities recorded on Sunday, 15 occurred in the past 48 hours, nine in the past week while the rest are from the period before last week.Though fresh cases have hit a plateau in the past few months, the state still has 45,071 active cases, which means these many patients are still taking treatment at various hospitals and facilities across Maharashtra. Despite the number of new cases not rising, cases are also not coming down as expected. Experts are not comfortable with the overall progress, saying that the state is still in a dangerous situation as cases are not going down. They further warned that this situation may change for the worse as people have become careless about following Covid-appropriate behaviour.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said the picture is hopeful but no decline in cases also indicates that the state is yet to come out of danger. “Daily cases are hovering close to 3,000 since the past many days. The picture is hopeful. However, it also shows that we are still in a danger zone because the virus activity is stabilised, but cases are not reducing. We were expecting a decline and would be out of danger only if it starts happening,” Dr Salunkhe said.He said the people are not maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour, which is a matter of concern. “Covid-appropriate behaviour is needed much more now, because we have removed most of the restrictions. From Monday, local train services will resume for the general public. Countries such as Brazil and other European countries where people became complacent are again in lockdown. We are fortunate that we do not have the danger of mutation as of now, but if the situation goes otherwise then we will have to bring back restrictions,” he said.Mumbai clocked 483 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking case count to 308,975. Active cases stood at 5,800. There were seven deaths reported, pushing the toll in the city to 11,352.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-recorded-92-177-covid-19-cases-in-january-shows-state-data-101612119145605.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||42-year-old Mumbaiite helps patients find way around Sir JJ Hospital||One of the oldest and most prominent government hospitals of Mumbai, Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy (JJ) Hospital at Byculla, sees the footfall of thousands on a daily basis. Here, patients and their relatives are seen manoeuvring their way to reach the right counter after approaching the wrong one. There are also instances of patients leaving without seeing the doctor for lack of some document. The hospital is spread over 43 acres and sees a footfall of up to 5,000 outpatients and 300 admissions on a daily basis as opposed to its capacity of handling 1,352 patients.The overburdened staff at the state-run hospital, where patients come from all corners of Maharashtra, hardly have time to guide the ones who are unable to find their way around the hospital. There have been instances of arguments and fights between patients’ relatives and hospital staffers due to lack of communication.In view of this, 42-year-old Abubaker Qadri, whom the hospital staff call a good Samaritan, has been proactively helping underprivileged or illiterate walk-in patients over the past decade.Qadri, who lives in Pydhonie which is a kilometre away from the hospital, is a regular at Sir JJ Hospital and is often seen holding a bunch of documents along with files of several patients, moving from one department to another. He is known for helping underprivileged patients deal with hospital management for over 10 years, acting as a mediator, and helping them fill out registration forms, enrolling them in available government health schemes, solving issues between staff and patients, and even pulling appointments with doctors.He provides this help free of charge and earns his livelihood through a small side printing business which he runs early in the morning. His wife is a teacher at a private school. The couple collectively earn up to ₹50,000 each month.When asked what motivated him to start helping out patients, he said, “Having spent my teenage years around this hospital, I have witnessed tragic accidents and the hassle that patients and their relatives go through. In 2010, a friend had asked me to help with someone’s admission at the hospital. That was when I saw how clueless patients had to run from one counter to another due to a single mistake in their documentation.”Since then, Qadri continued helping patients in his free time. “I only help those who come through referral. I attend to 10-15 different cases on a daily basis. My family and my mentor Ali Bhai have been my guiding lights,” he said.Answering to why he continues to help people despite no payback, he said, “Allah has given me enough and he has given me an opportunity to help the ones in need; why should I waste it? I don’t need people’s money; their blessings are my reward.” Dr TP Lahane, director of state Directorate for Medical Education and Research (DMER) and former dean of Sir JJ Hospital, said, “Abu(baker) is a good soul. He has helped with a lot of law-and-order situations in the hospital and is always there for the needy.”Qadri spends around six to seven hours a day doing this work, and despite the Covid-19 pandemic, he did not stop. Instead, he crowdfunded and arranged meals for 600 patients at the hospital on a daily basis for three months since the lockdown was announced. One of the senior most health officials at the hospital said, “Abu has been a crucial part of our hospital administration. He has arranged food for patients throughout the lockdown and has earned enormous trust of our staff, which is why all issues of his patients are solved immediately.”Qadri said, “I wish to continue doing this for as long as I can. I think there is a need for more volunteers who are trustworthy and can help the patients without ill-treating them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/42yearold-mumbaiite-helps-patients-find-way-around-sir-jj-hospital-101612118785657.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Arriving after 314 days: Local trains in Mumbai for all commuters||After a gap of 314 days, all Mumbaiites will finally be able to travel by local trains, the city’s lifeline, although in restricted time slots, from Monday. Commuters from across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) can use train services from the day’s first local train service till 7am. In the afternoon, between 12pm and 4pm, and later from 9pm till the last local train service. It also means they will not be able to travel between 7am and 12noon and between 4pm and 9pm, considered peak travel hours. Those found travelling without wearing a face mask will be fined ₹200, Government Railway Police (GRP) officials said. “GRP commissioner Ravindra Sengaokar has told officials to penalise the commuters ₹200 each, even if the commuter is carrying a mask but not wearing it, in order to ensure safety of all commuters,” said a senior GRP official, wishing not to be named. In order to control crowds and provide easy access to passengers, the Central and the Western Railway will deploy Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel at the entrance and exit of the railway stations along with the railway platforms. All entry and exit points, railway booking offices, Automated Ticket Vending Machines (ATVM), escalators and lifts on the suburban railway stations will be opened for passengers as a measure to avoid crowding. Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTV) on platforms of suburban railway stations will be used to monitor passenger movements, officials said. “We will carry out random checking of tickets to ensure that people are travelling as per the time scheduled for them. More staff will be deployed in sensitive areas. Local trains are being sanitised regularly,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway. Earlier, the suburban railway stations had restricted entry and exit points, along with a limited number of escalators and lifts. The railways will deploy its commercial staff to check passengers, who are not wearing facial masks. “We will be opening up facilities for all passengers. Booking offices, entry and exit points and ATVM machines will be opened. We are operating local trains at 95% of its capacity,” said Sutar. The suburban train services for the general public were suspended on March 23, 2020. Later, the services resumed for employees working in essential care, cancer patients and specially-abled commuters. Women and lawyers were also allowed to travel on local trains for a stipulated time. The Maharashtra government on Friday announced the decision of resumption of local train services from February 1. Currently, the Central Railway operates 1,685 local train services, while the Western Railway operates 1,300 local train services. Before the lockdown, the Central Railway was operating 1,774 train services and the Western Railway 1,367. Local train services are likely to be introduced at 100% capacity. The railway authorities will be studying the increase in the number of passengers. Passenger associations said the restricted time period could lead to an increase in crowding. “It is a good move that train services will resume for passengers. However, the time period should be changed and extended. Staggered office timings should be implemented. Essential workers should not be allowed during the time when general public are allowed,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arriving-after-314-days-local-trains-in-mumbai-for-all-commuters-101612118726083.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Wedding planning 101||What’s the one thing that two people who are about to get hitched should talk about but never do? Financial planning. Here’s how to have that conversation.Loans and assetsIt’s not enough to know each other’s incomes before getting hitched. You must also be aware of each others’ loans and liabilities, whether personal, home or education and those that are in process of being repaid. Credit card debt and any consequent penalty would also take a toll on your earnings; considering banks these share details of borrowers rather actively, it makes sense to discuss current loans and their repayment status.Short-term and long-term goalsA foreign trip for honeymoon involves substantial expenditure, so you’ll need some short-term financial planning. It would also help to plan such a huge spending together. Financial goals depend on one’s risk aptitude, and that differs from person to person. Couples must sit together and discuss possible investment options, contributions that each would make to their shared goals and the kind of instruments they would want to invest in.Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra, financial services marketplace said, “Both partners should be transparent about their present incomes and their outlook towards savings, expenses and also risk appetite. The portfolio should comprise a mix of fixed income instruments, equity and debt funds, preferably mutual fund SIPs involving blue chips, multi-cap and hybrid schemes for different life stages.” “Since life is an evolving panorama with unplanned outcomes, an annual review and rebalance of portfolio is essential. When nearing your goals, remember to cut down on risky propositions,” he added.Regular expensesCouples often accuse each other of spendthrift behaviour. One way to tackle this is to budget your combined take-home money in such a way that there is enough left to pay off common expenses including grocery bills, utility payments, rent, insurance premiums and loan repayments in the beginning and added disbursal on child support later. Depending on the disposable income, couples can choose to retain their individual savings accounts or opt for a joint savings account in a bank. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com, an online market place for financial products, said, “Marriage involves not just building a life between you and your spouse, but also about shouldering responsibilities for both your families. Unless you are honest and open about financial matters, you will find it difficult to meet your individual and couple goals... Discuss openly where you stand in terms of assets, liabilities, income, loans, etc. and where you want to go from there. Together, you could chip away at any liabilities at hand, fulfil your aspirations, and handle your responsibilities with ease.”Insurance is a mustThe importance of insurance is known to many, though very few secure themselves through it. Loans incur liabilities. The sudden death of one partner can leave the other with a host of responsibilities and liabilities. A good way to tackle this is for couples to buy life insurance policies equivalent to the loans that they have borrowed, so as to ensure timely and complete loan repayment with the insurance amount.Pankaj Verma, Head-Underwriting, SBI General Insurance, a joint venture general insurance company, said, “A comprehensive health insurance plan is now more essential than ever before. It covers the risk of saving you and your family from sudden financial burdens due to any unforeseen medical emergency by providing maximum coverage flexibility and convenience in the long term. Such plans provide extensive coverage, including hospitalisation, OPD consultations, daycare treatment, and so on. Apart from these core benefits, health Insurance comes with a key benefit of helping save tax under section 80D of the Income Tax law.”Retirement planningIt seems awkward to discuss retirement even before the wedding. But, as we’ve said often enough, planning isn’t fixed in stone — start and revisit, but start you must. “A prudent investment strategy includes a systematic and diversified investment in long-term saving instruments, which also provides tax benefits,” said Akhil Chandna, associate partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, an integrated Assurance, Tax and Advisory firm. “Some of the good long-term investment options include investment in infrastructure bonds, National Pension Scheme, equity-linked tax saving instruments and tax-saving FDs. Buying Unit Linked Insurance Plan is another good long-term investment option wherein flexibility has been provided to switch between equity and debt,” he added.Just remember to plan your retirement ages in alignment with the maturation of these saving instruments.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-wedding-planning-101-101612118545585.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||BDS admissions: 30 seats vacant after 8th round in Maharashtra institutes||After eighth round of admission, around 30 seats in state government dental institutes remain vacant. According to the state common entrance test (CET) cell, this is the first time when eight rounds of common admissions for seats in four government-run dental colleges were conducted.“This year due to the delay in admissions, the Dental Council of India announced that BDS admissions will continue till January 31, therefore we added more mop-up rounds. Never before have we conducted these many rounds of admission,” said an official from the CET cell. He added that a final list of vacant seats across state institutes will be released soon for the benefit of students.After completing two common admission rounds, the state CET cell has conducted six stray vacancy rounds to fill up the vacant seats in dental colleges.While admissions to MBBS courses ended on January 15, the dental council realised that the vast number of vacant seats in central institutes across the country needs to be filled, therefore the council extended the admission deadline by two weeks for BDS alone. According to information shared by the Maharashtra CET cell, 35% seats were left vacant across government and private dental colleges this year after five rounds of admissions.Experts have once again reiterated on the need for spot admission, instead of common admission round to fill remaining vacant seats. “Stray vacancy rounds are being conducted based on application forms submitted at the beginning of the admissions season. A large number of these students have already confirmed admissions elsewhere and have not cancelled their admission forms. The state should now allow spot admissions and to approach institutes directly for a seat,” said Muzaffar Khan, a Thane-based medical education counsellor.In the first week of January, the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS) had revealed 163% increase in seat vacancy in the management and NRI quotas of deemed dental institutes in Maharashtra, compared to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bds-admissions-30-seats-vacant-after-8th-round-in-maharashtra-institutes-101612118185451.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Submit status of anti-human trafficking units: Bombay HC to Maharashtra government||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state and Central government to provide details of the anti-human trafficking units (AHTUs) set up in Maharashtra and what measures have been taken to ensure that the law is being implemented in letter and spirit. The state and Centre have been asked to respond by February 17.On January 27, a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Rescue Foundation, an NGO working to rehabilitate victims of human trafficking, was informed by advocate Chetan Mali that the PIL was seeking implementation of the amended Anti-Human Trafficking Law, and though there was a scheme for setting up AHTUs in every district, the state government had set up the units at only 12 of the 36 districts, which were insufficient. Mali submitted that the NGO sought directions to the authorities to form AHTUs in every district and further assign the investigation of all cases of human trafficking for sexual exploitation to be conducted by the anti-human trafficking unit only.In an earlier hearing, the state government had submitted that it was keen to coordinate with other states to strengthen inter-state cooperation on rescue, rehabilitation, safe return, transfer, reintegration of victims of trafficking and prosecution of offenders. The state had further submitted that apart from the existing 12 AHTUs in Mumbai, Thane Rural, Thane City, Pune, Sangli, Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Navi Mumbai, Solapur City, Beed, Kolhapur and Yavatmal, it was in the process of setting up another 24 AHTUs to cover the remainder of Maharashtra. When asked as to the status of the state government’s proposal to the Centre, advocate DP Singh sought time to obtain instructions, which the court accepted. While asking the state to file an affidavit on the status of the 24 AHTUs being set up, the bench also directed the Centre to apprise it of the status of the state government’s proposal and posted further hearing of the PIL for February 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/submit-status-of-anti-human-trafficking-units-bombay-hc-to-maharashtra-government-101612118125375.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt may reopen colleges soon; Samant meets Koshyari after criticism||The state government is likely to restart offline lectures in colleges and universities soon, said Uday Samant, higher and technical education minister on Sunday, after meeting the Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Samant has also called a meeting of vice-chancellors of the universities on Monday to discuss the issue in detail.On Friday, Koshyari, who is also the chancellor of all the universities in the state, had called a meeting of all the vice-chancellors to review annual audit, filling up vacant posts and preparations of the universities for starting physical classes. The vice-chancellors, in the meeting, demanded restarting of physical classes of colleges and universities without any delay. The Governor also voiced the same opinion and said that allowing physical classes for schools and not allowing offline classes college and universities is contradictory.“I came to know through newspapers about reopening of Class 5 to 8 in schools across the state, hence not allowing physical classes at colleges and universities looks contradictory. Universities have already started their academic year and their online lectures are also going on. Since the Covid-19 pandemic has come under control, the universities should consider resuming physical classes at colleges. They can conduct classes in shifts,” the Governor had said in the meeting on Friday.He also said the universities should take initiative about resuming classes given the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for restarting colleges.The government has allowed physical classes for students between Class 5 and Class 12 in phases, except in Mumbai.Samant, following a meeting with the Governor, said, “I have convened a meeting with all vice-chancellors on Monday. It is in the backdrop of the demand they made [to restart colleges] with the Governor. The chief minister will be given the report of the meeting tomorrow [Monday] itself. One thing is certain that it is now time to reopen colleges and we are taking the steps in this regard.”Once the decision to reopen colleges is formally announced, the department will issue a standard operating procedure (SOP) for students and the teaching, non-teaching staff at the institutions, state officials said. The official said that local district or municipal authorities can decide whether to reopen offline lectures in colleges in their jurisdiction, based on the Covid-19 situation in respective cities and districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-may-reopen-colleges-soon-samant-meets-koshyari-after-criticism-101612117945460.html
01-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s private hospitals to be inspected ahead of starting Covid-19 vaccination drives||As the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gears up for the second phase of the mass immunisation programme, around 100 private hospitals have already submitted their details for permission to inoculate beneficiaries on their premises. The civic body will soon start to inspect the shortlisted hospitals. Last week, the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a trust of private hospitals, approached the civic body seeking permission to allow them to vaccinate beneficiaries. Following this, the BMC sent them a form—‘Private Hospital Covid-19 vaccination preparedness checklist’ – asking them to upload data about their infrastructure. Most major private hospitals namely Bombay Hospital, Hinduja, Hiranandani, Lilavati, among others, have submitted their details. “We have got around 100 names on the list, but many haven’t submitted all details. So, currently, we are auditing the list and scratching off the names of the hospitals who haven’t answered all queries,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Following this, the BMC will inspect the shortlisted hospitals for infrastructure. “Until the hospitals fulfil the criteria enlisted by the Central government, they will not be allowed to vaccinate people in the second phase,” said Kakani. The form has 15 questionnaires, including questions such as “Are there three designated rooms for waiting, vaccination and observation?’; ‘Well ventilated injection room available?’; ‘AEFI management faculty (ICU) available?’;’Availability of injection waste disposal bag/container at the session site’; ‘Good network availability for use of CoWIN app’; ‘Covid IEC display boards available at waiting rooms’, among others. “We are ready to facilitate the Covid-19 vaccination process at our hospital, for which we have already submitted the requisite form. We will train our staff as per the guidelines laid down by the government,” said Dr Manish Gupta, medical director at LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. After the selection process, the BMC will issue guidelines for private hospitals for the immunisation programme. “Any private hospital with the required infrastructure can apply online,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital and member of AOH. Following the instructions of the Central government, the BMC has decided to start vaccinating frontline workers from the first week of February, along with the healthcare workers (HCWs). On Monday, they will conduct its dry run and on Tuesday, the Co-WIN app will be activated to send messages to the registered FLWs. To facilitate the plan, the BMC will start vaccination centres at peripheral hospitals and other jumbo centres to attain the daily target of 10,000 vaccinations. “The BMC needs huge infrastructure to vaccinate its population of 20,000,000. It is essential to include private hospitals. We are hopeful that we will get an approval soon,” said Dr Bhansali. Submit details about deep freezers for vaccine: BMC to hospitalsAs a preparatory measure, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has asked private hospitals to submit details in the preparedness form if they have deep freezers in their cold storage facility which can be used to store Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in future.In the form, under point number 4 titled adequate cold chain availability, BMC has sought information about two types of refrigerators — deep freezers with capacity to store at -20 to -70 degrees and ice-lined refrigerators.The mention of deep freezer in the form has raised eyebrows among doctors. When asked about it, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “At present, both Covaxin and Covishield require ice-lined refrigerators (2-8 degrees). But, we need to be ready if, in future, we are asked to provide Pfizer vaccine which requires deep freezers. So, to keep the list handy, we have asked doctors to mention it if they have such freezers.”Pfizer’s vaccine has been developed in collaboration with Germany’s BioNTech SE. According to its official website, it is more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-private-hospitals-to-be-inspected-ahead-of-starting-covid-19-vaccination-drives-101612117825517.html

01-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi had seven cold wave days in January this year, maximum since 2008||Delhi recorded seven ‘cold wave’ days in January this year, the maximum for the month since 2008, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings showed on Sunday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the number of cold wave days in January this year was the highest since 2008 — when 12 cold wave days were recorded.“This time in January we had seven cold wave days and in 2008, we had recorded 12 cold wave days in January. Only one cold wave day each was recorded in 2019 and 2020,” Srivastava said.The city had recorded six cold wave days in the January of 2013.The IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature is recorded below 10 degrees Celsius and the deviation from normal is four degrees or above.Srivastava said the increase in the number of cold wave days this month was caused because only one western disturbance affected the plains of northwest India this year, which led to more cloudless nights and low temperatures. The northwesterly winds from the snow-clad regions in the Himalayas blowing into Delhi also kept the temperatures low, he said.Also read: Srinagar records lowest temperature in last 30 yrs“Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, warming the ground. The minimum temperature falls in the absence of a cloud cover,” Srivastava explained.A cold wave swept the national capital on Sunday morning as well, with the minimum temperature dipping to 3.1 degrees Celsius. This is the fourth cold wave day in Delhi in a week. As the day progressed, however, the temperatures rose, with the maximum temperature of the city to reach and settling at 25 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.The IMD has also forecasted that a fresh western disturbance is expected to pass over Delhi-NCR, which will result in thunderstorm and light rain over the region on February 4 and February 5.Meanwhile, as the day time temperature improved, pollution levels also subsided on Sunday, with the air quality index (AQI) reaching the ‘poor’ category.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that the overall AQI on Sunday was 289, in the ‘poor’ zone. On Saturday, the average AQI was 309, considered to be in the ‘very poor’ zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-had-seven-cold-wave-days-in-january-this-year-maximum-since-2008-101612117524725.html

01-02-2021||Delhi||BJP trying to use Kejriwal’s popularity to garner support for farm laws: Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia on Sunday threatened to take legal action against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for sharing a doctored video of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on a social media platform to claim that the CM praised the three farm laws.BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra tweeted an edited 18-second clip of Kejriwal on Saturday, which the AAP described as a desperate attempt to ride the credibility of Kejriwal to garner support on the farm laws.“Yesterday (Saturday), the BJP had tweeted a video claiming that Kejriwal in an interview has supported the three farm laws. This doctored video was created by selectively editing a long interview of the Delhi CM and placing fake bytes in some places,” Sisodia said at a press conference. In the original video, Kejriwal criticised the three farm laws.The tweet was labelled as manipulated media by Twitter, described by the micro-blogging site as content which “has been substantially edited in a manner that fundamentally alters its composition, sequence, timing, or framing”.Sambit Patra did not respond to calls and messages for a comment on the matter.Thousands of farmers have been protesting for over two months on Delhi’s borders against the three new farm laws passed by the Parliament in September that see to open up agricultural trade. The Aam Aadmi Party has pledged support to the farmers and appealed to the Centre to repeal the laws.Addressing the press conference at AAP’s office in ITO, Sisodia alleged that the violence on Republic Day (January 26) during a tractor parade by the farmers was a “well-planned conspiracy hatched by the BJP”. He added that both the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have lost credibility because of the Central government’s refusal to repeal the three laws, and their inability to convince people about the benefits of these legislations.Earlier on Sunday, Kejriwal reiterated his support to protesting farmers and said he will offer all possible help to them.Also read: Police cut off Singhu border from CapitalResponding to a tweet by farmer leader Naresh Tikait, thanking the CM for providing basic facilities at the Gazipur protest site, Kejriwal tweeted, “Naresh ji. You people are struggling so much. I will help in every way through my party and my government.”Sisodia said the BJP, having lost the trust of the people, was resorting to malign the image of Kejriwal “who is the only leader with credibility among masses”. The original video of the interview was also played during the press conference.“Today, the BJP’s credibility is at an all-time low. The lack of trust for the BJP and the Central government over the farm laws is so much that the saffron party is now doctoring Kejriwal’s statements to protect their image and convince people about the farm laws. PM Modi has enumerated the benefits of the farm laws on several occasions, but farmers have understood that they are only being cheated,” the senior AAP leader said.Sisodia also said when the BJP couldn’t explain the farm laws to the farmers, it started branding them as “traitors” and “Khalistanis”.“Then BJP conducted a sponsored protest at the Red Fort and disrespected the national flag. Now, Indian public has understood the BJP’s ill intentions and they do not believe in conspiracies. The BJP sent their goons to the Ghazipur border who attacked the farmers and their leader Rakesh Tikait. BJP sent their goons to Singhu border where they disrespected the Sikh community by throwing their turbans and attacking protesting farmers. They tried to portray it as an attack by the locals, but thankfully the Indian public saw through this and understood the BJP’s tactics,” he said.The Delhi unit of the BJP said Sisodia was levelling “baseless allegations” that the BJP had planned the January 26 violence.“Sisodia, like his party colleagues, has levelled allegations against the BJP and raised questions on the credibility of the Central government without any basis. In fact, farmer leaders including Rakesh Tikait have today expressed willingness to talk to PM Modi,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjptrying-to-use-kejriwal-s-popularity-to-garner-support-for-farm-laws-sisodia-101612117465820.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Banquet owners want cap on number of guests to be lifted||Banquet and tent house associations in the city have appealed to the Delhi government to increase the number of people allowed at gatherings from 50 to at least 200 or more, citing the fact that the Covid situation in the national capital has been brought under control for now.The banquet owners have said that their businesses have been severely affected due to the restrictions, which were imposed in November last year as the number of Covid-19 cases surged in the city.In November last year, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had put a cap on the number of guests at weddings and other events at 50. This was done days after the Delhi government had allowed 200 people in social events.As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the Centre on Sunday, cinema halls have been allowed to function with 100% seating capacity, if they maintain adequate physical distance in auditoriums and common areas.Members of various banquet associations recently met urban development and health minister Satyendar Jain iand appealed to him to look into their plight. Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi, said, “We have requested the state government to remove the cap on the number of guests now that the Centre has further eased its guidelines. Cinema halls have been allowed to operate on 100% capacity. We should also be allowed to do so too. The Covid situation in the city is now under control.”Banquet and tent house owners say that they are bleeding money with Delhiites opting for outstation venues due to the restrictions. Puneesh Khanna, owner of Lavanya banquet on GT Karnal Road, said, “We are not getting many bookings as 50 guests is too less a number. We have lost around 65% of the business. It has become difficult to sustain.”Banquet owners said that the industry has suffered huge losses due to the cap on number of guests.Pankaj Shokeen, president of Delhi Tent house owners’ association, said, “The government must step in and help businesses now. The present restrictions has made it difficult for us to sustain our businesses. We have written to the chief minister and deputy chief minister in this regard.”The Delhi government spokesperson could not be contacted for a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/banquet-owners-want-cap-on-number-of-guests-to-be-lifted-101612117465260.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||ASI files FIR in Red Fort violence, crime branch to probe the case||At 12.10pm on Tuesday, when Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials and CISF personnel were receiving the tableaux coming from the Republic Day Parade, the first group of about 200 protesters and 25 tractors tried to push their way into the Red Fort through the Lahori Gate, according to the first information report (FIR) filed by the ASI on Saturday in connection with the vandalism at the monument on January 26.On Tuesday, several groups among thousands of farmers who were camping at Delhi’s border demanding withdrawal of three new farm laws, arrived at the Red Fort without warning and in violation of the terms of their tractor rally, and clashed with police. They also allegedly inflicted extensive damage at the monument. Union tourism and culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel visited the fort on Wednesday along with the ASI director general and directed registration of an FIR.HT has seen the FIR filed by the Superintending Archaeologist of India. The FIR has been transferred to the crime branch for investigation. This was the second case filed in the incident at Red Fort, the first one was filed by the police.The FIR details the siege by the protesters, damage to the property and the response by the security forces at the Unesco World Heritage Site.According to the FIR, between 12.10pm and 1.10pm, about 300 protesters and 25 tractors tried to enter the fort thrice through the Lahori Gate but teams of Delhi police and CISF neutralised them by locking the gate.Around 1 pm, large groups of protesters on motorcycles and tractors started coming to Red Fort from the Subhash Marg. “…They then joined the mob gathered there and forced open the gate. The security personnel were completely outnumbered,” the FIR read, adding that the mob then damaged the ticket counter, door metal frame detector, and the baggage scanners.Also read: Similarities between probes into the Delhi riots, R-Day violenceThe ASI said that the mob then turned towards Lahori gate entrance, which had been “firmly secured with an iron chain and lock”.“The mob climbed over this iron door, jumped inside, and broke the chain lock with the help of iron tools they were carrying…the security personnel could not resist the mob. While doing so they broke the inner gate…Once inside a section of the mob broke the electrical fittings and the stone casing around them. A bus placed as a barricade by the CISF was also damaged,” reads the FIR.The ASI official said that three tractors managed to reach inside the fort. “…A section of the mob then charged towards the ramparts and forcefully hoisted a flag on the pole where the Prime Minister hoists the flag on Independence Day,” the FIR read.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said they have identified a man named Jugraj Singh from Tarn Taran in Punjab as the one who hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at the fort’s ramparts. Investigators are identifying protesters from 1500 video clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/asi-files-fir-in-red-fort-violence-crime-branch-to-probe-the-case-101612117347073.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||The many similarities between probes into the Delhi riots, R-Day violence||As part of its case that the violence that erupted during the tractor rally by protesting farmers on Republic Day was a “pre-planned conspiracy” and not a spontaneous outburst, Delhi Police’s special cell has started probing the role played by many farmers’ leaders in the agitation against three laws passed in September to open up agriculture..Some facets such as the line of investigation, motive, the officers leading it, and the circumstances leading to the violence are strikingly similar to the probe the police launched after the Delhi riots in February 2020.At least 53 persons died, 627 were injured in the violence that started as clashes between protestors against and for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and took a communal turn.With the Delhi riots investigation almost complete -- the police have filed charge sheets in all the cases and the cases are in court -- the officers and the units probing the 38 cases connected to Tuesday’s violence are also the same.Deputy commissioners of police from the crime branch and special cell – Joy Tirkey and Pramod Kuswah – who had led the riots probe are investigating Tuesday’s violence too.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong route In the Delhi riots, 698 cases of rioting and violence were probed by local police, the crime branch probed 57 cases (all 53 murders and a few cases of heinous rioting) and the special cell investigated one case of an alleged conspiracy behind the violence.In the Delhi Republic Day violence, of the 38 cases, 28 are of rioting and vandalism, which are being probed by the local police; ten cases in which the most violence took place, such as the incidents in Red Fort and the Income Tax Office area, are with the crime branch, and the one case of the alleged conspiracy is with the special cell.In both the special cell cases of the riots and Tuesday’s violence, the cases have been registered under stringent sections of the sedition law and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention_ Act).There is another similarity. In the Delhi riots case, the accused were some prominent Anti-CAA protesters who were on the streets in the weeks leading to the riots. In the riots charge sheets, police linked the role of the accused right from December 2019, when the citizenship law was passed.In Tuesday’s violence, the police are probing the role of prominent faces of the farmers’ protest – leaders such as Darshan Lal, Rakesh Tikait and Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu -- from September, when the three farm laws were passed by Parliament.The motive behind the pre-planned violence, according to a Delhi police statement on Thursday, was also similar to what police had said was the one for the Delhi riots.In the statement, the police said its preliminary assessment suggested that there was a “pre-conceived and well-coordinated plan” to engage in violence and “create an international embarrassment for the government on the occasion of Republic Day.”Similarly, police in their charge sheets filed in the riots cases said that the violence in northeast Delhi in February 2020 had been planned to coincide with then US President Donald Trump’s official visit to India to create an international embarrassment for India and defame the country.Arrested suspects such as former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid and student activist Devangana Kalita, currently in jail, have denied the allegations.On Friday afternoon, Delhi police issued a public notice asking journalists and citizens to come forward and submit statements or videos of the Republic Day violence. It was similar to the notice the police issued in the aftermath of the February 2020 riots.Also read: Thousands converge in western UP farmers' stirPolice had on March 11 issued a similar notice seeking videos of the riots, apart from many other types of evidence such as statements of protected witnesses and WhatsApp chat records.A Delhi police officer, privy to the investigation of the Republic Day violence. said on condition of anonymity: “Like the CAA protests, the mobilization at the anti-CAA protest sites happened over WhatsApp messages. Provocative statements were made at those sites after which the riots happened. In the farmers’ protest too, we have many people who heard the farmer leaders making such statements. In the riots cases, many protected witnesses had heard the accused persons making such provocative speeches. Such witnesses will be an important part of the investigation.”Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava had on Wednesday evening said that a night before the violence, police had an inkling that “aggressive and militant people” were taking control of the stage at the protest sites and giving provocative speeches. The top cop did not specify how police had the inkling or who had witnessed or heard the provocative speeches.A second Delhi police officer, not directly connected with the investigation of the violence, said: “Boss (Commissioner) did not specify who had heard or seen those leaders. Maybe it could be the police personnel at the protest sites, insiders from the intelligence wing, or insiders who work for the police and help pass on information. If police manage to get such witnesses, get their statements recorded before a judge, then it is crucial evidence in this case too.”Last week, the farmers’ leaders had caught a man and accused him of being a mole planted by the Haryana police.There is a coincidence too.On Friday afternoon, when a clash between two groups of protesters -- farmers and those protesting against the farmers -- led to stone-throwing and clashes -- many residents of villages around the Singhu border said they were reminded of the evening before the Delhi 2020 riots, when two groups of protesters -- one supporting the Citizenship law and those against it -- had clashed below the Jafrabad metro station. This clash was the start of Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-many-similarities-between-probes-into-the-delhi-riots-r-day-violence-101612117345393.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||PWD begins work on Ashram flyover extension, traffic snarls may worsen||Traffic snarls at Ashram Chowk, Delhi’s biggest choke point, are expected to further worsen with the Public Works Department (PWD) beginning construction work on its project to extend the Ashram flyover up to Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway.Prolonged and haphazard construction, poor site management and extension of barricades for building a 750-metre underpass, connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and the Ashram Chowk, have turned Ashram into a commuter’s nightmare.Work on the flyover will worsen snarls on the Ring Road at Maharani Bagh and Kilokari, both about 150 metres away from the main Ashram intersection even as the PWD has asked the traffic department to chalk out a diversion for hundreds of thousands of vehicles which cross the stretch every day.Both the underpass and the flyover extension projects are aimed at decongesting Ashram Chowk where vehicles are seen waiting for hours in traffic jams even during non-peak hours.According to PWD officials, works such as shifting of utilities, creation of foundation to erect columns near DND, widening of road by removing pavements among others, have begun on the stretch between Maharani Bagh and the DND flyway in south Delhi. The project entails construction of a six-lane flyover from Ashram to DND with ramps for traffic from Sarai Kale Khan.The flyover extension project aims to provide relief to daily commuters from traffic congestion by facilitating signal-free movement till Lajpat Nagar for motorists coming from Noida and till Noida and Sarai Kale Khan for commuters coming from Lajpat Nagar side.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong routeThe proposal for extension of the flyover was approved by the Delhi Cabinet in November 2019 and its foundation stone was laid by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in December 2019 but the work could not start due to coronavirus lockdown.A senior PWD official, who requested not to be named, said work was to be started in 2020 only but the tendering process got delayed because of the nationwide lockdown. The official said even after the contract was allotted in June 2020, work could not start due to various reasons, including lack of workforce and shortage of material.The official said preparatory works such as site planning, ground layout plan installation of signage indicating about the project etc had started after October. “Last month, we have started construction work. We are currently widening the road near Maharani Bagh and Kilokri by breaking footpaths to create additional space for traffic. We will barricade some portion of the main road space for construction of the flyover,” the official said.According to the plan, the existing Ashram flyover will be extended by constructing 1.2-km-long six lane elevated road which will touch down where DND starts. Near DND the elevated road will split into two wings -- one towards the flyway and the other will go in the direction of Sarai Kale Khan.“The construction of the flyover is likely to be completed in one-and-a-half years. Our priority is to carry out the work in such a way that motorists have to undergo minimum inconvenience,” another PWD official said.Commuters are wary of another construction beginning near Ashram Chowk. “Traffic movement is already a mess in this part of the city and now, with the construction of the flyover beginning, it will turn worse further. The authorities should have waited a few more months more and started construction after completion of the Ashram underpass,” Kartik Kumar, a commuter and a resident of Maharani Bagh, said.Also read: PM Modi says saddened by insult to Tricolour on R-DayS Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute, said the project will decongest the stretch between Lajpat Nagar and DND point.“During peak hours, massive traffic jams are common on Ashram flyover, especially on the carriageway towards Sarai Kale Khan. The extension of the existing flyover will give a signal free ride to commuters towards Noida and Sarai Kale Khan. It will also help in the movement of local traffic of Kilokri and Maharani Bagh below the flyover,” Velmurugan said.The scientist added that the PWD should have made special arrangements such as additional workforce to make up for the time loss and start the construction work early.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pwd-begins-work-on-ashram-flyover-extension-traffic-snarls-may-worsen-101612117344785.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers leaders take steps to ‘revive’ agitation||Farmer groups leading the protests against the three contentious farm laws have taken several measures to keep the agitation going after the tractor parade on Republic Day ended in violence. These include district and village-level ‘mahapanchayat’, door-to-door visits, announcements in every lane and street, appeals from the loudspeakers at temples, mosques and gurdwaras and WhatsApp groups to disseminate information and curb rumours.The measures, farm leaders said, will help “revive” the protest, which met a rude jolt after the Republic Day incident.Several farmer groups joined the protesters at Ghazipur on Sunday where the Ghaziabad administration served an eviction notice to the protesters on Thursday. People from all age groups were seen arriving in the hundreds in convoys of cars and tractors throughout the day despite police blocking many routes leading to the site.Among them was Ranveer Rathi, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar who had arrived at the protest site after attending a mahapanchayat organised to garner support for Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) leader Rakesh Tikait. “I have come here with a group of hundred farmers and a sea of people is on their way to the Delhi-UP border to avenge the tears of Rakesh Tikait… And, this time it’s a matter of farmers’ pride now. We are making sure that at least one person from each and every family in our village should come here and tell the government that they can’t pressure us to vacate this protest site. It is our home now,” he said.Also read: Punjab CM calls all-party meet tomorrow over farmers’ stirOn Thursday, Rakesh Tikait burst into tears while speaking to the media and accused the Centre of hatching conspiracy against the agitating farmers at the Delhi borders.Like Rathi, many others have arrived to support the movement after attending panchayats being organised in their villages. Vinod Gujjar, a farmer from Saharanpur, said that they are also organising door-to-door campaigns in their villages to mobilise maximum people. “We have divided farmers into small groups and assigned them to work to create awareness among farmers back home. With mics and speakers, they are going street-to-street, making announcements inviting farmers to the border. This is the time to show our unity,” he said.A large section of protesters, who have arrived in the last three days, are young. Robin, 26, who has come from Baghpat said, “I can’t forget the day when my uncle’s body arrived wrapped in a Tricolour from Kashmir a few years back. And they call us “anti-nationals”. The government had conspired the January 26 incident to break our protest but it has fallen into its own trap. Our movement is now stronger like never before.”Those who arrived on Sunday were also seen bringing food, water, ropes, and tents with them. Many new langars also sprung up at the protest site on Sunday. Puran Singh, who belongs to Udhham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, said, “We have called five more cooks from our village to prepare langar since we have more people to feed .”With mobile internet connection continuing to remain weak at the protest site on Sunday, many protesters were seen walking miles in search of a network. Braham Chaudhary, a farmer from Meerut, said, “We have created WhatsApp groups to send correct real time information to our people back home. We can’t let them get wrong information from social media and get disheartened. We will have to keep them motivated.”Hukle Chawdhary, who claimed to be over 100 years old, from Loni district remained a centre of attraction at the protest site on Sunday. “I have not worked in the fields throughout my life to see my fellow farmer brother breaking down like that… Ab ladai aar-paar ki hai,” he said.‘100 missing’Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders on Sunday said over 100 persons were missing after the Republic Day tractor rally. Even as 84 persons were arrested in connection with the violence, farmers alleged that many other protesters have been “illegally detained” by the police and information about them is not being shared with their families or the leaders.Special commissioner of police (crime) Praveer Ranjan said, “These allegations are not true. The details of every person arrested so far in the violence are available.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-leaders-take-steps-to-revive-agitation-101612117284749.html
01-02-2021||Delhi||Fresh fervour at Tikri, even as protesters keep watch for trouble||From early Sunday morning, dozens of tractors, trucks and buses lined up on the Haryana side of the Tikri border, unloading scores of supporters, mostly women, who came in to join the protesters in the Capital.Hundreds walked several kilometres to reach the protest site, singing folk songs, waving the tricolour and raising slogans to encourage the movement, which gained fresh impetus a few days ago, even as it looked like petering out after the violence in Delhi on Republic Day.However, the renewed show of support, mostly from villages in Haryana and Punjab, was tinged with tension, with farmer leaders on stage imploring participants to avoid crossing over to the Capital’s side of the border, as news began to spread of Delhi Police making arrests in connection with the January 26 clashes, when the protesters’ tractor rally descended into chaos, culminating in several farmers storming the Red Fort.“We request our farmer brothers to stay at the protest site and not cross over to Delhi. Many of our supporters have been arrested by the police blaming them falsely of inciting violence on January 26. We know our demands are valid and we will win this battle,” said Chaudhary Raman Singh Pradhan, a member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a farmers’ union.Chandra Devi, 72, who reached the Tikri protest site on Sunday afternoon from Sundarpur in Haryana, said eight of her family members have been protesting against the three farm laws at Delhi’s borders for over a month. On Sunday, three women and eight children from her family also joined in.Also read: Police cut off Singhu border from Capital“Mothers from Haryana and Punjab have been sending their sons to fight for the country [in the armed forces] for years. We do not need to prove our patriotism and dedication for our country to this government or to anyone,” she said.Phoolvanti Devi, 88, from Bahadurgarh, said if the farmers had to cause unrest in Delhi, they would not have waited two months.“From teenagers to senior citizens, people across ages have been camping here for over two months. Why would we cause unrest now? If they agree to our demands and repeal the three farm laws, all of these borders will be empty the very next day. In our village, if children get stubborn and throw tantrums, mothers box their ears and punish them — this government also needs that,” said Phoolvanti.Protesters at the site have also stepped up vigil since Friday, after a group claiming to be “local residents” gathered near the protest site, demanding that the farmers be evicted. They have been taking turns to guard the entry to the main stage area throughout the day.“They said they [Friday’s counter-protesters] are locals, but how is it possible that all these locals from around Tikri, Ghazipur and Singhu suddenly decided to gather with the demand of evicting the protestors on the same day. It is clear this was organised by forces that do not want the farmers to continue their protests,” said Chaudhary Rohtas Singh, a farmer who joined the protests on Saturday from Sirsa in Haryana.Singh said that after watching Bharatiya Kisan Union (BJU) leader Rakesh Tikait break down before the media on Friday, he decided to take a bus to Delhi.“My mother saw the television and cried and said ‘Beta, kisan toh haar gaya’ (Farmers have lost). I told my mother we will not allow that to happen and took the bus the next morning,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-fervour-at-tikri-even-as-protesters-keep-watch-for-trouble-101612117104866.html
01-02-2021||Chandigarh||Apni Mandis to return in Chandigarh on Feb 1||Residents’ long wait for easy access to vegetables and fruits will end on Monday with apni mandis returning to the city after a hiatus of 10 months.The local vegetable markets were shut down in March 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and will now resume after a decision by UT administrator and Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore at the war room meeting on January 25.“Vegetable and fruit sellers will have to maintain a minimum distance of two metres from each other and wear masks. Only farmers registered with the Punjab Mandi Board will be allowed to set stalls at the mandi after presenting their registration card,” said mandi supervisor for Chandigarh, Satish Kumar. There will be no cap on the number of visitors at a mandi, as long as the Covid protocols, including social distancing and wearing masks, are maintained.Officials of the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) confirmed that the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (MC) had written to them to start the mandi from Monday. PMB auction recorder Harpreet Singh said the decision had brought huge relief to farmers, who sold their produce directly to the public.MC staff have been preparing the original mandi sites by sanitising them. “For all these months, roadside vendors had been overcharging residents because they had no other choice. Reopening of apni mandis will help keep the price of vegetables and fruits in check. We urge residents to follow the Covid safety protocols so that the mandis can function smoothly,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman of the Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED).Weekly timetableMonday: Sector 45Tuesday: Dhanas and Sector 29Wednesday: Sector 40 and Sector 15Thursday: Ram Darbar and Sector 56Friday: Sector 46Saturday: Sector 43 and Sector 49Sunday: Sector 34 and Dadumajra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apni-mandis-to-return-in-chandigarh-on-feb-1-101612106965235.html
