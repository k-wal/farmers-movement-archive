Sumit Kumar and Ankit, of Nindana village, were grievously injured and are undergoing treatment at the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak.Sunny Loura, spokesman of the Rohtak police, said the incident took place when four persons, two of whom were identified as Kapil and Dhila, reached the room where Ankush and three others were sitting.“They opened fire at the victims. Two persons were killed on the spot. This is a case of gang war and both parties have some old enmity. We have registered a case of murder under the IPC against Kapil, Dhila and two others and an investigation has been initiated,” the spokesman added.14 murder in Rohtak so far this yearRohtak has seen a steep rise in crime, particularly murders.

27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Celebs have greater responsibility of choosing their words in public: HC on Yuvraj’s plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that celebrities have greater responsibility in using a term in public or social media platforms as the same can be misinterpreted.The HC bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh, in its order on the plea of former cricket Yuvraj Singh, observed that Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention and Atrocities) Act, 1989, was enacted to safeguard the interests of a section of society that has been known to be oppressed since ages.“Naturally any violation of the provisions of the said Act have to be dealt with strictly to try and ensure that a sense of well being is instilled in such sections of society, towards which every person, and celebrities in particular, should be careful in the usage of any term which can be misinterpreted,” the bench observed in its order released on Saturday.It was on Thursday that the HC had asked the Haryana Police to not take any coercive action against the former cricketer in the criminal case registered in Hisar district. The FIR was registered on complaint of one Rajat Kalsan, of Hansi, under Sections 153A (promoting enmity) and 153B (assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code and under the SC/ST Act.The FIR was registered on February 14, eight months after Yuvraj Singh had apologised for the “unintentional remarks” made during an Instagram live video in April 2020. The former cricketer is seeking quashing of the FIR.Earlier, the complainant’s counsel had told court that the former cricketer, being a celebrity, has crores of followers on social media and the chat in question would have been followed by all of them, as also by the followers of his celebrity friends with whom he was in conversation.Yuvraj had argued that the person in reference, to whom the alleged casteist remarks are stated to have been made, does not belong to a scheduled caste. He said that the statement was made in context of somebody being in an inebriated condition.The court further observed that the term in question is being subjected to two interpretations - as to whether it was used against any particular community or in reference to a person in an inebriated condition, with the person concerned admittedly not belonging to any scheduled caste, which the court would have to adjudicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/celebs-have-greater-responsibility-of-choosing-their-words-in-public-hc-on-yuvraj-s-plea-101614450430195.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 impact: Social sciences students stare at bleak placement season||Students from social sciences courses in the city are facing a bleak placement season this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai did not hold the placement week, which is a central process for recruitment of students, this year. However, the placement drive is taking place online at the convenience of recruiters, said Asha Banu, dean of student affairs, TISS, who looks after placements.“Earlier, recruiters would give us a commitment that they would visit the campus for placements on a certain date. This year, however, everything seems to be in flux as recruiters decide their priorities,” said Banu. This year, many recruiters have decided to take in students through off-campus placement or online mode.A student of TISS, on the condition of anonymity, said, “One of the primary attractions for recruiters at TISS is the field action project that all students do. This is one place where they can find students with previous experience on field. This year that has been an issue with recruiters.”Field Action Projects (FAP) are undertaken by students of TISS every year where they demonstrate new interventions; respond to new needs and changing social realities; provide field experience and training to students and faculty members; evolve new strategies for intervention; and develop indigenous data base literature for training. However, owing to Covid-19, students have been asked to engage in an FAP in their hometowns.At the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), humanities students also participate in the central placement drive. However, students said that not many are placed through the drive. “While some MPhil students are able to get placements, most PhD researchers apply for postdoc positions,” said a second-year humanities student from IIT-B.The institute recently tweaked its policy allowing its own PhD holders to apply for positions as post-doctoral fellows at the institute. Earlier, PhD scholars from the institute were not allowed to apply for post-doctoral positions.An official from the institute said the decision to tweak this policy was based on the fact that candidates from outside the institute could not join owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, sources said this could be because not many PhD scholars are able to secure a post-doctoral position in another institute. “For humanities students, the situation is tougher. With fund cuts in most central universities, the number of post-doctoral positions has reduced. Covid-19 has further reduced our chances of job prospects,” said the student.Shantanu Rooj, founder and chief executive officer of recruiting consultancy TeamLease Edtech, said, “The impact of Covid-19 has been different for different courses. Courses such as political sciences, economics and psychology saw an uptick in job prospects as organisations are now looking for data interpreters and social scientists. However, on the other hand, courses that require field work such as geography, history and social work have seen a downward trend.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-impact-social-sciences-students-stare-at-bleak-placement-season-101614450310800.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 YouTubers held for uploading obscene videos, molesting girls||City cyber police has arrested three YouTubers for allegedly creating obscene and vulgar prank videos in public places in Mumbai. They would allegedly rope in young girls, including minors, under the pretext of shooting prank videos and offer them money. But during shooting, they would touch the girls inappropriately in public and molest them. Based on the complaint of some of the girls, police arrested the trio — Mukesh Fulchand Gupta, 29; Prince Kumar Raju Sao, 23; and Jitendra Baichetram Gupta, 25. Mukesh is a Thane resident while other two are residents of Kurar. Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police (crime), said the three accused would lure young girls and women to act in their prank videos for money. Thereafter, the accused would shoot the videos in public places such as Juhu beach, Gorai beach, Aksa beach, BMC gardens, etc. Under the pretext of shooting the prank videos, they would touch private parts of the girls and use vulgar language, the senior IPS officer added.At least five girls, including a minor, have approached the police complaining that they were molested under the pretext of shooting prank videos. On the basis of their complaint, the police registered a criminal case against the accused and arrested them.“The accused Mukesh, who secured 98.5% in 2008 SSC exams, is the main brain behind the obscene prank video racket. The other two used to assist him. Mukesh and his two aides were running more than 17 YouTube channels and Facebook pages. The group has earned about ₹2 crore through these activities,” said Bharambe.Dr Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber), said, “The group uploaded more than 300 such obscene prank videos which have over 150 million views on social media sites. Their channels and pages have more than 20 million subscribers.” “The accused very well knew that obscenity and vulgarity attracts huge number of viewers on social media platforms, hence they were shooting obscene videos under the pretext of pranks videos. And for that, they exploited girls and made money,” said Nitin Jadhav, assistant inspector of cyber police station.Some of the girls had requested the accused to take their videos down from internet, but the accused would extort money from them by threatening to defame them.“ Mukesh takes tuitions of school kids. We are checking if he has targeted any girl students from the tuition class,” the DCP said. “The accused have been booked under sections 292, 294, 509, 34 of Indian Penal Code, 67 and 67B of Information Technology Act, 8, 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act and Indecent Representation of Women’s (Prevention) Act for obscene act in public, molestation, molesting minor girls, using electronic devices to broadcast obscene content,” said inspector Mousami Patil of cyber police station who is investigating officer of the case. “There are similar groups operating in Delhi and Jharkhand,” DCP Karandikar said.Joint commissioner Bharambe appealed to citizens to keep an eye on their children and stop them from becoming part of such pranks videos so that they can be prevented from such abuse.“We have also written to YouTube and other social media service providers to take down the obscene videos from internet,” Bharambhe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-3-youtubers-held-for-uploading-obscene-videos-molesting-girls-101614450191666.html

ACB said that Wagh, while serving at the state-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Parel, as a medical records librarian, amassed assets worth ₹2.18 crore, which is 90% more than his legitimate sources of income. Chitra Wagh, who had left Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 2019 to join BJP, has termed the development a “witch-hunt” by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government (comprising NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress) because she has been demanding action against a Sena minister in the suicide case of a TikTok star. “My husband is not guilty. The main accused in the case has been spared and my husband is being targeted instead,” she alleged. However, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant in a tweet has claimed that the open inquiry against Kishore Wagh had started in 2016, when BJP-Sena government was in power. “Had Chitratai not entered BJP, the [Devendra] Fadnavis government would have registered an offence back then. It was only because of the inordinate delay on the part of the then BJP government and later the Covid-19 pandemic that the registration of an FIR (first information report) was delayed,” read Sawant’s tweet. According to the ACB’s FIR (of which HT as a copy), Kishore Wagh had been arrested by the agency in 2016 for his alleged role in accepting a bribe of ₹4 lakh from the brother of a patient who had died at the Parel hospital. Following this, Kishore Wagh, the hospital’s medical superintendent Gajanan Bhagat and another person, Sandesh Kambale, had been arrested. ACB officers had then searched Kishore Wagh’s house located at the hospital’s staff quarters, where Chitra Wagh and their son Aditya lived and had seized incriminating documents, the agency claimed. Following this, senior ACB officers had ordered an open inquiry against Kishore Wagh, who is under suspension from the hospital since his arrest in 2016. During inquiry, ACB officials analysed Kishore Wagh’s income and ancestral property from December 1, 2006, to July 5, 2016, to investigate the alleged illegal income growth. “The open inquiry found that Kishore Wagh had not disclosed information about his assets to the government. He also did not take permission from the officials concerned before going abroad. He had also failed to disclose the details of withdrawals, purchase and deposits in his bank account when ACB had written te to him seeking the same,” stated assistant commissioner of police (ACB) Navnath Jagtap, the complainant, in the FIR. The inquiry concluded that between December 1, 2006, and July 5, 2016, Kishore Wagh amassed assets worth ₹2.18 crore, which is 90% excess to his known source of Income. These assets are located in Nashik, Mumbai and Pune, the FIR stated. Kishore Wagh has been booked under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-bjp-leader-chitra-wagh-s-kin-booked-by-acb-in-assets-case-101614450190082.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses 6-year-old’s custody to his ‘poor’ biological parents||In an important ruling, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday upheld a family court order, refusing to grant custody of a six-year-old boy to his poor biological parents, observing that the interests of the child will be best served by continuing him with his rich adoptive parents, a childless couple from Nagpur.The division bench comprising justice AS Chandurkar and justice NB Suryawanshi said there was sufficient evidence on record to prove that the adoptive parents were in a better position to take care of the welfare of the child.“They (adoptive parents) are taking care of his health, education, intellectual development and are giving him, favourable surroundings and they are imbibing moral and physical values in the child,” said the bench. “In our considered opinion, they are in a better position to look after the moral and physical welfare and the future of the child.”The observation came in the view of the fact that the adoptive parents belonged to a business family and the adoptive mother was a practising doctor, whereas the biological father, an autorickshaw driver lacked a steady source of income and his financial condition did not appear to be sound.Besides, HC noted, the auto-driver was married and having two children, and the child in question was born out of his extra-marital relationship with another woman, who later joined his family and also delivered another girl child. The boy was born on August 30, 2014, at a private hospital in Nagpur and the next day the child and his mother were discharged from the hospital. The father of the unwed mother, however, could not take his daughter and her illegitimate child to his home because of social constraints, his daughter being an unwed mother.Five days after the delivery, the newborn was diagnosed with jaundice. The helpless father of the unwed mother then decided to hand over the child to the childless married son of his employer, a cloth store owner. In February 2015, the unwed mother again came in contact with the auto driver when she stepped out for medical treatment. She then joined his company and started demanding custody of the 6-year-old. After the adoptive parents refused to part with custody of the child, in May 2015, they moved the family court at Nagpur seeking custody of the child on the ground of being his biological parents and contending that adoption was alien to Islamic Law.The adoptive parents also filed a counter-petition for their appointment as guardians of the child.Two years later the family court rejected the claim of the biological parents and appointed the adoptive parents as guardians of the child. The biological parents had then moved HC in an appeal against the family court order.HC on Friday dismissed the appeal primarily because the auto driver lacked steady and regular income and had the responsibility to maintain two wives and three children. Besides, he was residing in a tin-shed house.While dismissing the appeal, HC also took into consideration that the child was handed over to the adoptive parents from the 5th day of his birth and since then the child was nurtured and brought up by them. “The child is now six years of age and naturally he is mentally and emotionally attached to them (adoptive parents). The child has developed a bond with them,” said HC. “They both appear to be in a position to look after the child and to provide adequate facilities to him in a proper and congenial manner,” said the bench. “In case the child’s custody is handed over to biological parents, it would cause emotional turmoil to the child. He will be uprooted from the present family and the surroundings in which he is brought up and will be required to go in alien surroundings and circumstances, in which it would be difficult for him to adjust,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-6-year-old-s-custody-to-his-poor-biological-parents-101614450130534.html

The tentative deadline to start these boating services is June-end.According to MTDC officials, they have sought permission from the BMC to start the safari, for which, the boats will be operated by the MTDC. The tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray has held two review meetings in the last two weeks.The plan is to have barges that will allow citizens to sail around Powai lake that is home to several crocodiles. The boats will be purchased and operated by the MTDC, said the officials.Powai lake is maintained by the BMC to supply non-potable water to industries since the water in it is not potable.Ashutosh Salil, managing director of the MTDC said, “Discussion for starting such services has been initiated with the BMC. We have already sought their permission. The plan is to start boating to conduct a crocodile safari by June end. We are yet to work on the fare structure and other minute details. But the boats will be like a barge considering the safety of visitors.”The BMC also has plans to beautify the area around Powai lake that includes the walking pathway, garden area etc.The civic body said it is working on several plans to restore the lake from pollutants and preserve it, as the lake has rich marine biodiversity and rare species of crocodiles. It had in the past also received money from the Centre under the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-Systems to preserve the lake, but its initiatives have been put on hold owing to the construction of the Metro-6 corridor which passes from near the lake.The MTDC on similar lines in the coming months is also planning to make BMC owned guest houses near Tansa, Modak Sagar and Vihar lakes available for the general public. This is a bid to boost tourism and the local economy. The guest houses at these dams that supply drinking water to Mumbai are until now only used by state officials or guests of the government.Officials of the BMC did not want to speak on the issue at this juncture. Meanwhile, back in July 2019, the BMC had shot down a proposal by local Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator to introduce water sports such as scuba diving, water aerobics, water polo and boat racing at Powai lake. The proposal was rejected citing the presence of crocodiles in the lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mtdc-plans-crocodile-safari-in-powai-lake-seeks-mumbai-civic-body-nod-101614450070273.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Experts condemn appointment of RSS affiliate for implementation of NEP||Scientists and researchers from various institutes have raised objections over the decision of the ministry of education to appoint Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal to a Niti Aayog committee for implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP).Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal, which is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), has been appointed by the ministry of education to a coordination committee for the implementation of the new NEP. It has now been conducting a host of webinars along with the Niti Aayog on implementation of the NEP at universities.Researchers, scholars, students and scientists from leading science and technology institutes, however, have opposed the ministry’s decision to entrust non-state dubious organisations the task of implementing the provisions of NEP. They have warned the government of the dangerous consequences of this decision.The Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), a voluntary organisation working towards the cause of science, culture and scientific outlook released a statement on Friday. “We are deeply shocked to learn that such an important task, which is supposed to be shouldered by government agencies with eminent educationists’ help, has been delegated to a private organisation with no proven track record of academic excellence. We anticipate that the exercise aims at pushing a specific agenda to mould the country’s educational edifice in a direction that would go against the scientific, secular and democratic ethos that are the hallmarks of any modern education system,” said the statement.The BSS has claimed that institutes such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NIT) and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) have been directed by the ministry of education to ‘voluntarily’ participate in the events to be conducted by Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal.“The government has no right to disburse public funds to foster the questionable activities of such dubious organisations,” said Soumitro Banerjee, general secretary of BSS and professor in the physical sciences department of IISER Kolkata.“Involving non-state actors in higher education is not new and wrong per se. However, there are always some concerns about the procedures of delegation, regulation, and accountability. Government and institutions of eminence should be discrete in choosing the non-state actors for implementing the provisions of NEP 2020,” said a research scholar from IIT-Bombay, on the condition of anonymity.While condemning the private organisations’ ‘intrusion with a definite educational planning and implementation agenda’, the BSS has demanded that scientists and educationists be involved in helping the government with the task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/experts-condemn-appointment-of-rss-affiliate-for-implementation-of-nep-101614449949541.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC files police complaint against 3 more marriage halls for flouting Covid-19 rules||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday night lodged a police complaint against three more marriage halls in the Bandra area for flouting Covid-19 rules. The halls are accused of hosting over 200 people when only 50 persons per ceremony are allowed, not wearing face masks, and not maintaining social distancing. The first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Vakola police station by the health department of the H/East ward under sections 188 and 269 of the Indian Penal Code, which prescribes punishment of up to six months of imprisonment, or a fine, or both.The Yashodhan Marriage Hall, the Gurunanak Hall, and Noor Marriage Hall are all located on CST Road in Kalina. During a surprise inspection, health department officials found all three marriage halls hosting over 200 to 300 people at a wedding ceremony, many of whom were not wearing face masks, and social distancing was not maintained.Over the past week, BMC has been cracking down heavily on banquet and marriage halls hosting wedding ceremonies, and on restaurants, bars, pubs, and malls in the city. A senior civic official said, “All ward officials have been instructed to make a list of all bookings in marriage halls for the next few months, and to conduct surprise inspections to ensure Covid-19 rules are followed. If they are found to be flouting rules, action will be taken as per the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.”Two weeks ago, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed the BMC to conduct surprise inspections at these venues. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also asked BMC in a review meeting taken earlier this week, to strengthen action against venues flouting Covid-19 rules, in light of the spurt in cases in the past week.Since the beginning of the lockdown, BMC has fined 1,676,640 people for not wearing face masks in public places and at gatherings, and have collected ₹338,935,600 in fine ( ₹200 per case). Of these, in the past two days, 15,283 people were fined and a total of ₹3,056,600 was collected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-files-police-complaint-against-3-more-marriage-halls-for-flouting-covid-19-rules-101614449890177.html
27-02-2021||Other||Pune woman’s suicide: Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod could be on his way out||Mumbai Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod, who is facing allegations in a suicide case, could be on his way out.A senior Shiv Sena functionary said that chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has made up his mind to take action against Rathod and an announcement on his resignation could be made before the budget session of the state legislature that begins on Monday.“CM is likely to ask Rathod to step down pending an inquiry into the case. Though several Sena ministers are of the opinion that Rathod shouldn’t be dropped till the ongoing police probe is completed, Thackeray wants his scalp as the issue has become a major embarrassment for him as well as MVA (Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) government,” the leader said, adding, “he is also irked with the show of strength put up by Rathod on Tuesday.”Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has intensified the attack on the government over the issue. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Saturday announced that party legislators will not allow the functioning of the budget session in Mumbai.“If Rathod is not asked to resign before Monday and if Thackeray does not come clear on this case, we will not let the legislature function,” Patil said while addressing media persons.Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut on Saturday had indicated that Rathod could be on his way out.“He [Thackeray] has not shut his eyes. CM is watching what is happening and he will take the right decision at an appropriate time. The victim’s family will get justice,” said Raut.Rathod, who handles the forest portfolio in Thackeray’s cabinet, is linked to the February 8 suicide case of a 23-year-old Pune woman. BJP alleged that the woman was in a relationship with Rathod and he should be booked in the case. Several audio clips related to the woman have gone viral in the past few days. BJP has alleged that one of the persons in an audio clip is Rathod. The minister has insisted that he is not guilty and that the truth would come out during the police investigation.BJP leader Chitra Wagh on Saturday questioned Thackeray over his silence on the issue.“You would have torn him apart had you not been on the CM’s chair. I heard there is pressure on you to not sack Rathod,” alleged Wagh, adding that MVA parties (Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress) were shielding a minister who should be booked in the case.While addressing a press conference, Wagh alleged that the case is not being investigated thoroughly. She further said that the Maharashtra government is shielding Rathod.“Despite substantial proof against him [Rathod], no action has been taken against him. In fact, the police have not even registered a first information report in this case. There are 45 missed calls in Rathod’s name on the victim’s phone,” Wagh said.On Tuesday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had met Thackeray over the issue. According to party insiders, Pawar advised Thackeray to drop Rathod, as the issue was damaging the reputation of MVA government. However, Thackeray was hesitant to do so as several Sena ministers had opposed action against Rathod. They pointed out that NCP had not sacked party minister Dhananjay Munde when he was accused of rape by the sister of a woman he was in a relationship with. Munde, the social justice minister in Thackeray’s cabinet, ducked the action against him as the woman later retracted her statement. “The ministers also pointed out that none of BJP ministers, except Eknath Khadse, were sacked, even though serious allegations were made against them during BJP-led government in the state between 2014 and 2019,” said a top Sena leader. However, the details of the case that are now in public domain have already become embarrassing for the MVA and Thackeray is under tremendous pressure to drop Rathod, he added.After his name cropped up in the case, Rathod made it further difficult for his party. He went missing and then resurfaced after 15 days on Tuesday at a place of religious significance for his community at Washim in Vidarbha region. His supporters staged a show of strength with hundreds of people from his Banjara community came to extend their support for him, in violation of Covid-19 social distancing norms.This irked Thackeray, who directed chief secretary Sanjay Kumar to conduct a probe through local administration and fix the responsibility on the guilty.“CM is unhappy over the violation of Covid-19 norms in the current situation. He will take action,”Raut said.Meanwhile, activists of BJP’s women’s wing staged demonstrations across the state, demanding action against Rathod. According to Patil, agitations were held at 100 places in the state and they would continue till Rathod is sacked and case is filed against him. The party’s youth wing will stage protests on March 3, followed by demonstrations by the other backward classes (OBC) cell, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-woman-s-suicide-shiv-sena-minister-sanjay-rathod-could-be-on-his-way-out-101614449590174.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two acquitted of molesting minor girl||A 21-year-old Thane resident and his friend were recently acquitted of charges for molesting a 13-year-old girl in an amusement park in November 2017, based on a conversation between the two on a social networking site. The minor had alleged that the incident took place when she had gone to an amusement park in a school picnic on November 20, 2017. She claimed that when she was waiting for her friends, two men — Bharat Nadar, 21, and Afroz Shaikh, 24 — caught hold of her. Nadar allegedly tried to hug her while Shaikh pushed her towards Nadar.After hearing her scream, teachers came to her rescue. The principal then alerted the police, following which the accused were booked for molestation.During trial, Nadar examined himself as a defence witness and claimed that the minor and he knew each other since 2015. He further said that when her family members learnt about it, her brother had assaulted her. Nadar presented details of their chat on a social networking site as an evidence to prove that the two knew each other and that the girl liked him. He also said the girl had called him at the park to meet her. He also submitted call records to the court.He alleged that the two were taking pictures when a teacher caught hold of them and a false story was created. He also claimed that both he and his friend were beaten up by the teachers.After considering this, the court acquitted the two and observed, “The accused Bharat had proved that he was in contact with girl and she used to send him messages from the Facebook account of her mother and she also used to call him from the mobile of her friend. No doubt, the girl has denied all these contentions of the accused in her cross examination. However, accused Bharat Nadar has specifically proved it by giving evidence on oath. So, it creates doubt about story of prosecution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-two-acquitted-of-molesting-minor-girl-101614448929925.html

This phase will include people ageing 60 years and above and those in the 45-59-year age group with serious co-morbidities.The earliest slots of vaccination are available from March 2, depending on when the CoWIN 2.0 portal goes live, said health officials on Saturday.It will take a minimum of 24 hours to get a person inoculated after the registration once the portal goes live.“We may have a dry run on Sunday before the CoWIN 2.0 portal goes live. The dry run planned for Saturday did not take place because of technical issues,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar.Also read: Fake Co-Win site surfaces as Centre is all set to open registration for vaccinesThe government has fixed a price of ₹250 per dose for those inoculating at private health facilities, while the vaccine will be administered free of cost at public health facilities.“Those who want to be vaccinated at private centres have to pay an administrative charge of ₹100 in addition to the vaccine cost of ₹150 per dose,” he added.Any complaint about a private health centre overcharging people for vaccination can be registered on 104. The government will then initiate action to disempanel the facility from the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), also referred to as the Ayushman Bharat, or the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) — the two benchmarks for private facilities to be enrolled as a session site (vaccination centre).The government has made Aadhaar and mobile number mandatory for vaccination as it would be based on the one-time password (OTP).“We shall not allow any other government identity other than Aadhaar barring exceptional cases. One mobile number can be used to register a maximum of four family members, provided some of the mandatory fields, other than the name of father, husband and address, were different,” said Kumar.The state health department has identified 750 health facilities, including 50 private centres for the first day of the upcoming phase of vaccination. Bihar has a total of 258 private facilities which qualify as vaccination centres.“To begin with, we will have at least one private centre per district (Bihar has 38 districts) and nine in Patna. We plan to scale up the number of facilities to 1,000 by March 15 and have 1,200 centres between March 16 and 31. We further plan to get the number up to 1,500 between April 1 and 15 and eventually up to 1,600 between April 16 and 30, depending upon the response of the people,” added Kumar.A person seeking to enrol for vaccination, either through the CoWIN portal or the Ayushman Bharat app, will have the option to choose the date and time slot for vaccination at a convenient centre. They will, however, have no choice to choose from the two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin which are approved by the Drug Controller General of India.Those who fail to turn up for vaccination after registration will have the option to re-register after cancelling the previous registration. This also means that one person will not be able to simultaneously enrol at different centres.Beneficiaries will also have the option to choose a different session site for the second dose of the two-dose vaccination cycle after 28 days of the first shot - taking the first dose at a private centre and the second dose at a public facility.Healthcare workers and frontline workers, who comprise the priority group, will have to pay the requisite fee of ₹250 per dose of vaccination if they wanted to get themselves vaccinated at a private health facility after March 1, said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar.“We have vaccinated 85 per cent of healthcare workers (HCWs) while the exercise of administering the first dose of vaccine to frontline workers (FLWs) will end on March 6. They will now have to pay for the vaccine if they want to get themselves inoculated at a private facility after March 1,” said Kumar.Bihar has registered 4.68 lakh HCWs and 2.71 lakh FLWs. Of them, 3,99,831 HCWs had taken the first dose and 79,212 the second dose of vaccine. In the case of FLWs, 1,60,496 had taken the first dose. Bihar has so far received 23,33,880 doses of the vaccine of which 6,64,650 had been consumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-begin-registration-for-3rd-phase-covid-19-vaccination-from-march-1-101614448747360.html
27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Navigating loneliness in life’s twilight||It is man’s nature to be gregarious. We live in a family and community and have friends. However, how intense our relationship is with our friends and relatives is a matter of individual choice. Living alone is like solitary confinement, which is nothing short of punishment.I grew up in a well-knit family and my circle of friends burgeoned through school, college and professional training, and after retirement an altogether new group of locals became part of my life. At the end of the day, a few close friends are what matter the most. When one is alone or feeling low, one can always approach a friend, who not only listens to you but also boosts your morale by providing the right counselling. Thus, our life has a strong mooring in society.Life in Canada: A double-edged swordAt the age of 76, I decided to move to Canada to join our son and his family. While I am fortunate to have a loving family, a lavish lifestyle, best of food and clothes and top-of-the-line cars, living abroad has so many other benefits such as no pollution, non-adulterated food and availability of a wide variety of food and fruits. The roads are well maintained, and traffic is extremely disciplined, which makes driving a safe and enjoyable experience. Wherever I go, be it a store, an office, bank or clinic, the customer service is par excellence. Healthcare is of superior quality. Though the weather is cold for us, houses and commercial establishments are temperature controlled in both winter and summer.Despite all the merits, I don’t have any friends here. Furthermore, socialising has been temporarily suspended because of Covid-19. I feel all the more isolated as I cannot go anywhere. However, things are bound to gradually open up. Having spent three-quarters of my life in India, adapting to a new lifestyle and change of environment is challenging.Difficulty in making new friendsI tried to catch up with a couple of old acquaintances here but did not get a very encouraging response. After all, friendships cannot be forged overnight and have to be nurtured for years. Most people here are from rural areas of Punjab and are neither likeminded nor educated.How much television can one watch or waste time on social media? Not being free to go out to visit a friend or relative gives me a feeling of helplessness. I miss the unbridled freedom of getting into my own car and going wherever I want. I miss going to the bank, grocer, mechanic, cobbler, chemist, milk vendor and other places, which kept me usefully occupied. Life back in India had some purpose and direction. In Canada, I have no regular activity. My existence seems aimless and rudderless, which I fear will age me faster.Physical comforts and luxuries give us temporary satisfaction but food for soul and mind is also very essential. Mental wellbeing comes from a conducive environment and immediate company, which I crave. I feel a vacuum within me, and I am torn apart in this turmoil, unable to fathom which is a better world for me to live in at twilight of my life!(The writer is retired wing commander who is currently based in Canada)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navigating-loneliness-in-life-s-twilight-101614448690026.html

27-02-2021||City||Bhubaneswar hottest city in India for 4th day in a row||For the fourth day in a row, Bhubaneswar continued to be the hottest city in India as it recorded a maximum day temperature of 40.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday. The city set a new record of the daily highest maximum temperature in February in the last 5 years."Temperature in Bhubaneswar and few other places in Odisha is likely to rise by 5 degrees Celsius in next 2-3 days. The reason for rise in temperature is the lack of moisture in the middle and upper atmosphere and less humidity in the lower atmosphere. Solar radiation is hitting the ground more effectively. People need to take precautionary measures while going out after 11 am," said HR Biswas, regional director of Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar.On Wednesday, Bhubaneswar recorded 38 degrees Celsius, the highest in India while on Thursday and Friday it recorded 39.4 and 40.4 degrees Celsius respectively, against the highest in the country.The highest temperature of Bhubaneswar in February was recorded in 1963 when the mercury climbed to 42.7 degrees Celsius.Also read: Fake Co-Win site surfaces as Centre is all set to open registration for vaccinesThe state government has already rescheduled classes for 9-12 to morning hours from March 1 due to the rising temperature.In 2019, a study conducted by the Climate Impact Lab in collaboration with the Tata Centre for Development at the University of Chicago predicted that the number of extremely hot days in Odisha would increase by 30 times from 1.62 in 2010 to 48.05 by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at current rates till the end of the century.The study, the first in a series of findings estimating the human and economic costs of climate change and weather shocks in India, predicted that Odisha is likely to see a 3.32°C rise in average summer temperature from 28.87°C in 2010 to 32.19°C by 2100. "It is far higher than the national average increase from about 24°C to about 28°C by the end of the century," said Amir Jina, assistant professor at the Harris Public Policy and researcher at the Climate Impact Lab.Another study on changing trends of temperature in Bhubaneswar by Binodini Majhi and Krishna Chandra Rath in 2018 found that mean of monthly maximum temperature in Bhubaneswar between 1970 and 2015 increased at a faster rate than the average temperature and minimum temperature. The analysis found that monthly mean temperature has positively increased for all months in 45 years. The highest increase in temperature occurred in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhubaneswar-hottest-city-in-india-for-4th-day-in-a-row-101614448278188.html
27-02-2021||Noida||GB Nagar records Covid-19 cases in double digits after 21 days||NOIDA: With 11 Covid-19 cases on Friday, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded positive cases in double digits after 21 days, according to the state government’s Covid bulletin. In the last three days, the district has reported 25 positive cases, including six new cases on Saturday.With 65 active cases till Saturday, GB Nagar has climbed to sixth position in the state in terms of active cases.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said it appears that the Covid-19 curve in the district is going down significantly. “With 25,348 infected people already cured out of 25,504 total cases, the recovery rate of the district has gone up to 99.38% now. Even the case fatality rate is 0.35%, which is much better than state’s CFR of 1.44%. But, since the infection has still a fluctuating trend, we need to observe the curve,” he said. The DM further said that the district health officials are keeping a constant vigil on proper surveillance and testing. “People should continue wearing masks for at least a year and not ignore the initial symptoms of the disease. The vaccination has begun, but it doesn’t mean that one should ignore the social distancing rules. We need to take the virus seriously,” he said. Echoing similar views, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that the disease will not vanish until the last man is inoculated. “What we need to focus on is social distancing behaviour. People should continue following it and those having any symptoms should isolate themselves,” he said. On Friday, the Uttar Pradesh government had directed the district officials to conduct rapid antigen tests for all people arriving in the state from Maharashtra and Kerala through air, train or road routes. The state health department has made a week-long quarantine mandatory for symptomatic persons arriving from these two states even if they are found negative in the RT-PCR test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-records-covid-19-cases-in-double-digits-after-21-days-101614448509434.html

27-02-2021||Noida||Hapur gang-rape: Gang leader habitual offender, say cops||Soon after the arrest of the three suspects in the Hapur gang-rape case, the police said the modus-operandi was similar to the a few that were committed in the past – a gang would pick up victims from the Lal Kuan intersection at night, overpower them, take them to an isolated place, rob and then release them.“They made sure that they did not injure their victims, so that the matter does not reach the police. They even offered victims money to travel back to Lal Kuan. In this gang-rape case they offered her a pack of biscuits and hailed an auto-rickshaw for her,” said a Hapur police officer, who did not wish to be named.Late on February 24, a 30-year-old woman hired an auto-rickshaw from Lal Kuan to her home in Greater Noida but the driver and two other men posing as passengers allegedly took her to Hapur’s Galand instead where they raped and robbed her before letting her go. She then approached the police.The prime suspect is 26-year-old Ankit who was arrested along with 25-year-old Mohammad Aquil and 22-year-old Akash Singh.Police said the Ghaziabad police had arrested Ankit in 2013 for allegedly kidnapping and raping a 20-year-old. He allegedly confessed to the Hapur gang-rape, and also of committing a similar crime over a month ago near Galand, but the survivor in the case did not approach the police.“We suspect that they may have committed similar crimes earlier. We will question them more,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (Hapur).Police said the suspects allegedly operated from the Lal Kuan intersection on NH-9 where they found “easy targets”, such as people who wanted to go to Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar or Hapur.The scene of the February 24 crime at Galand was about 20km from Lal Kuan on NH-9 and a large part of the route through Kavi Nagar and Masuri police station areas in Ghaziabad district.Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (Ghaziabad) did not respond to repeated calls.“So far, no other victim has approached us with a complaint. If anyone has fallen victim to the gang, they should come forward and register their complaint. Their identities will be kept confidential. The SHO of Masuri police station was suspended as he did not inform senior officers when the woman approached him on the night of February 24. We got the information of the incident about 26 hours later, through the media,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural) – Ghaziabad.The 30-year-old had approached the Masuri police station around 11.30pm while her case came to the knowledge of the Hapur police around 3.30pm the next day.Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1), said more personnel will be deployed and it will be ensured that auto-rickshaws plying illegally from Hapur are fined and seized. “We will inquire more about the getting details of the suspects from Hapur police. We along with the traffic police officials will ensure that autos from Hapur are checked and safety of women will be ensured,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/hapur-gang-rape-gang-leader-habitual-offender-say-cops-101614448389519.html
27-02-2021||Noida||Political parties using farmers’ protest to hold rallies, says BKU leader Rakesh Tikait||Ghaziabad: The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Saturday said at UP-Gate that none of the political parties have the “courage” to take out rallies on their own and have to invoke the farmers’ protest for holding meetings. Tikait has been holding different rallies and panchayats in different states around the national Capital. He was at UP Gate addressing farmers on the future course of agitation.“They will have to invoke the name of farmers. Paap kiya hai sab ne (all have committed sin). They will have hold their meetings (rallies) on the name of farmers. Parties forming governments will have to become the face of farmers and have to work for the cause of farmers. They will have to include farmers in their manifestoes. Otherwise, we will not sit quite as farmers have become aware. We will go across the country,” Tikait said Off late, many political parties have held rallies and others have proposed their rallies, particularly in UP ahead of upcoming panchayat elections in the state. Tikait so far has conducted various rallies to garner support in states like Haryana, Rajasthan and UP. The BKU has also released his schedule of rallies for the month of March. The schedule includes his rallies in states like UP, Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Telengana, Madhya Pradesh and even Udham Singh district in Uttarakhand from February 28 to March 22. The list, however, does not include West Bengal and Assam. He had said that farmers will go to poll-bound states of West Bengal and Assam as farmers there are also not getting the proper price of their crop. The Election Commission Friday evening announced the schedule of election dates for Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry. The poll bound West Bengal is scheduled to hold elections in eight phases starting March 27 to April 29. “Some of our people will be going to West Bengal on March 15-16 and hold some conferences. Thereafter, we will also go. Its not like we will not go West Bengal and Assam. We will go there as farmers in those states are not getting proper price. I will also remain present at UP Gate and the agitation will go on as usual. There will be no shortage of gathering here. People take this agitation forward. Our agitation will continue till 2024,” Tikait said. “If the government doesn’t talk to us, we have plans to go to different states across the country and meet farmers. I say that the agitations will be taken to other states in order to enforce government policies. Our point is to raise issues of farmers and not to get involved in any politics during elections, but farmers’ issues are our priority,” Tikait added. He also said that haystack chopping machines will also be installed at various borders and depending on the direction of air and thereafter particles of haystack will go to Delhi. “Our call to Parliament will be taken up by our core-committee at Singhu Border,” he added further. The farmers are camping at the UP-Gate since November 28, 2020 and demanding repeal of three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. The last talks between the farmers’ unions and the government were held on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/political-parties-using-farmers-protest-to-hold-rallies-says-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614448329428.html
27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Poetics of protest - then and now||A poem from the north-east defines the very spirit and soul of ‘poetry as protest’ as we see it unfold over thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent, which has a long history of difference and dissent. A glimpse of the poem before one goes to the poet: Do not ask me how I have been/ After all I am not alone/ For, even after the last supper/ I have’nt bid adieu/ Nor could I take my leave/ I haven’t laughed since Auschwitz/ Nor cried either...These lines by Assam’s most cherished living poet Nilmony Phukan in one fine sweep, using minimal words, takes the reader through a vast canvas of collective experience from the crucifixion of Christ and the tyranny of the notorious Auschwitz concentration camps of Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II where millions met their end. This poem is a window, through which one looks at the long history of protest poetry in the Indian sub-continent in varied tones and tenors to define aesthetics of a culture that has always looked up at the rebels, the poets and the lovers as prophets of the humankind.Rhythms of resistance Poetry has always provided rhythms of resistance all over the world and more so in the ancient civilisation of the Indian subcontinent, which has seen thousands of years of poetic resistance, which travels through literature in myriad languages as well as the robust oral culture.This poetic practice begins with the ancient era, moves through the medieval times and is prominently present even now when the popular perception of the poet as a hero is considered lost. The subcontinent, with its plural tradition and sensibilities, has never shied away from differences and arguments. Examples of poetic dissent are to be found in Vedic hymns and verses of the early classical poets and in the Bhakti cult with Kabir and Guru Nanak becoming voices of new thought. Voices of women too have been prominent in different ages from Akka Mahadevi to Lal Ded and Mirabai. Sufi Islam as it evolved in India and the rest of South India saw great Sufi poets such as Amir Khusro, Dara Shikoh, Sheikh Farid and Bulleh Shah. Songs and poems of protest were a celebratory part of the freedom struggle in India. Today, poetry has accompanied all people’s movements, be it poets calling for a more humane order, words uttered against war or women claiming half the sky.Liberating power of words Recent times have seen words exercising their power to liberate and take people away from fear to freedom of expression. Once again, the verses of radical poets of the 20th century such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi and their ilk were evoked. At times it led to many muddles such as the half-baked interpretation of the classic poet Faiz as was the case with his poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’. Those not well-versed with poetry raised alarm when students recited the famous poem in IIT Kanpur, taking it to be anti-Hindu and communal whereas it was a protest poem written many decades ago against the dictatorial regime in Pakistan.In these times, we have also seen young poets rising from among engineers and technocrats. Pertinent were the poems of Hussain Haidry who took upon himself to give a brilliant description of the Hindustani Muslim. And of course, Aamir Aziz who came out with a heartfelt poem after the crushing of the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Shaheen Bagh. An English translation of Aziz’s poem Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega was recited by none other than Pink Floyd’s co-founder and guitarist Roger Waters making international news with the young poet’s powerful words: You write jokes in courts/ We will write justice on the walls.So, let no one mock the mad man, the lover or the poet for it is such passion that is woven into words to make a change for the better. Poetry is certainly not a leisure nor a luxury but a medium for resisting oppression and injustice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-poetics-of-protest-then-and-now-101614448209968.html

The man’s friend was also arrested over his alleged involvement while the contract killer hired is on the run.The prime suspect, identified as Ajay Yadav, is an MBA and a senior marketing representative with a pharma company in Ghaziabad. His 37-year-old friend Ram Prakash is a resident of Vijay Nagar. Prakash allegedly roped in contract killer Gajraj Singh, a native of Vijay Nagar, in a plan to kill Yadav’s wife, police said.“They hired Singh for killing Yadav’s wife and child by staging a road accident and offered ₹10 lakh to the contract killer. Yadav had taken an insurance in the name of his wife in 2020. She had no details with her.... Contract killer Singh followed the woman outside her house several times, but she was her with her child,” said Ajay Kumar Singh, SHO, Kavi Nagar police station.Police have arrested Yadav and Prakash. The contract killer, who is on the run, had a change of heart when he saw the woman with the child, and narrated to her the conspiracy hatched by her husband, police said.“Singh decided not to kill the mother-child duo after he had a change of heart. On Thursday (February 25), he visited the woman’s house and told her the murder conspiracy hatched by her husband. Initially, she did not believe him, but he showed her a recorded conversation and videos. She then approached the police, and an FIR was registered,” he added.An FIR was registered against the three suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 115 (abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life).“During interrogation, Yadav did not reveal much about the reason behind his attempt to kill his wife,” the SHO added.The couple had a love marriage five years ago, and lives in Mahendra Enclave near Shastri Nagar in Ghaziabad. The woman, a native of Bihar, earlier worked at an electronics company in Ghaziabad and met Yadav when she had gone to find a rented accommodation in Mahendra Enclave. Police sources said Yadav allegedly had an extramarital affair and “his family was annoyed with his wife as her parents did not give much dowry at the time of marriage”.The two suspects were arrested while they were going to meet Singh to provide him with weapons and cartridges so he could take another shot at killing Yadav’s wife. Both of them were arrested from a marriage hall near Diamond Flyover in Kavi Nagar on Friday evening, police said.“The contract killer is absconding, and police teams are trying to trace him at the earliest. The woman’s husband and his friend were arrested,” said circle officer (city 2) Awaneesh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/after-change-of-heart-contract-killer-tells-ghaziabad-woman-plot-of-her-murder-husband-arrested-101614447909400.html

The police have registered a case and launched an investigation.The landowner, Sanjeev Sharma, is a homeopathic doctor, and also runs a chemist shop in Jagat Farms, he said. He owns the apartment complex building where he lives in one of the units and leases out the others, he added.

27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Masked conversations can be more revealing||To the discerning and observant individual, even a masked visage can convey a lot. In fact, the eyes have never had it so good (pun unintended)! After all, the eyes are the only visible expressionists of a persona which is hidden by the ubiquitous mask.The eyes of people who frequently smile, tend to light up freely whenever they do, even under a mask. But those who are loath to show their teeth even in normal times, are also the ones whose eyes appear dull under the mask.Everything depends, of course, on the inner citadel, the inner pitch, the inner environs that a human being carries within.The eyes could either be dancing around animatedly or sparkless and placid, easily indicating the state of mind of the masked one, unless he or she is ailing.Some people actually look better with a mask on. No offence meant. Their eyes are obviously their best facial feature. In fact, with their wrinkles and other ravages of time hidden away under a mask, several individuals look much younger with a mask on, than they actually are.Moustachioed and bearded men have suffered a great deal though. Months of being masked have left some of us utterly bereft of our usual auras. The hint of well-groomed hair on a man’s face can set some people’s pulses racing and other people’s hearts pounding. Quite the opposite may also happen, of course!It is in a longish conversation or interview that the full impact of a mask can be felt, though. The wearer tries his best to make an impact with words, hand movements and even body language, but without the inborn gift of facial expression, every individual may struggle to be the person he usually is.A masked conversation is much like an interaction on the phone, therefore, with the smile and the frown totally missing from the scene. The smell of coffee might do the trick at times, to kindle interest in what the other is saying, especially since the act of sipping coffee involves the uncovering of the lips at least.Several people wear invisible masks all their lives, of course. It is difficult to penetrate their minds and discover what they really mean when they say something. Many mothers suffer a great deal, for instance, but hardly let their little ones know what they are going through. The forced façade of happiness which some of them have to maintain is almost impossible to uncover. Their innermost angst is seldom on display.The voice is an amazing indicator of a human being’s mood, though. A quivering voice or a testy tone can give away hidden moods or feelings much more readily than a well-guarded facial veneer. The perceptive individual will therefore latch onto the faintest deviation from a normal tone to understand what a close one is going through. Men probably have a lot to learn from women in this regard. A lady can often see through a lot of intangible layers with consummate ease. Men usually fail to recognise such signs and would do well to be more watchful, especially where their partners’ moods are concerned. Even the recent expedition to planet Mars has not provided any answers to this imbalance, though we men have been alleged to belong to that land!Emotional intelligence undoubtedly plays a key role in understanding other people, mask or no mask. Those who are empathetic towards others and seldom bask in egotism are the ones who prove to be good company. Their levels of understanding the need for what to say, when and how, are much superior to those whose emotional quotient tends to be low.The times that we live in are multi-layered and multifaceted. In any case, no one, but a true saint, can claim to have unmasked the secrets of the universe. Some masks will stay on forever-more, it seems, even when pandemic necessitated cloth coverings have long been consigned to the waste bins en masse.American author, Lisa Mangum, said somewhat mysteriously that the best way to show our true selves is by wearing a mask. Be that as it may, a discerning individual can perhaps see through most masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-masked-conversations-can-be-more-revealing-101614447671587.html
27-02-2021||Noida||Prostitution ring running from guest house busted in Noida, seven nabbed||Noida: Seven men, including three customers, were arrested on Saturday for allegedly running a prostitution ring from a guest house in Noida’s Sector 12. Three women and a minor girl were rescued from the guest house, police said.According to police, a raid was conducted around 1.30pm at the guest house in block 1 of Sector 12 following a tip-off. “It is a three-storey house which was converted to a guest house by the tenant, Vishal. He was initially running a hotel, but then started renting out rooms by hour. The prostitution ring was being run since September last year,” said a senior police official.Following the raid, seven men, including Vishal, were taken into custody from the spot, police said, adding that the suspects were aware of the whole operation.“There were three women and a minor girl at the guest house,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police are questioning the women for further information about the operation after which they will be sent to a rehabilitation centre, said the senior police official, adding that some used and unused contraceptives and liquor bottles were also recovered from the spot.“One of the guests had been staying there for the past 10 days. The minor girl had been brought from Bihar by a man, Rajan, on the pretext of getting her a job and then marrying her almost two months ago. Two women are from West Bengal while the fourth is also from Bihar. We have inputs that other women were also being brought to the establishment, and in some cases illicit activities were being done at other places as well depending on the demand,” said the official.Police said that most customers came in through online advertisements and word of mouth. Other suspects are being traced while a search is on for other women being forced to work there, said police.Singh said that the suspects are being booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and under the anti-human trafficking Act. “All necessary actions are being taken. The suspects are being questioned and will then be produced before a magistrate,” said the additional DCP.This is the third prostitution ring to be busted by the Noida police this month. On February 16, five persons, including a couple and three women, had been arrested for allegedly running a prostitution ring on the pretext of providing escort services and then robbing their customers. On February 3, 12 spas in a mall in Sector 18 were raided by the Noida police, of which one was found to be allegedly engaged in nefarious activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/prostitution-ring-running-from-guest-house-busted-in-noida-seven-nabbed-101614447669334.html
27-02-2021||Noida||One more arrested in dry fruits fraud||: Police on Friday night arrested one more suspect of a gang involved in duping dry fruits traders. With this, five people have been arrested in the case in the past two months, police said.The suspect, identified as Sattan Yadav, is a close associate of the three masterminds in the dry fruits fraud which came to fore in December last year, police said. According to police, Yadav, a native of Hapur, had a reward of ₹25,000 on his arrest.Four people, including Mohit Goel, had been arrested by Sector 58 police in January in the case. Goel is also the alleged mastermind of the 2017 Freedom 251 Ringing Bells scam, in which victims were offered smartphones at ₹251. He was arrested on January 11, along with an accomplice, for allegedly duping wholesalers by quoting higher prices for dry fruits and spices and then defaulting on payments. A case was registered at Sector 58 police station in December last year. “Yadav was involved in the financial dealings of the company. He was wanted in the case,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police officials said that Yadav was well aware of the fraud being done in the name of providing wholesale licences to dry fruit sellers. Yadav was nabbed from near a park in Sector 62 following a tip-off, police said, adding that he was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.One of the masterminds has a stay order from the court in this case, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/one-more-arrested-in-dry-fruits-fraud-101614447609321.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi gears up for bypolls in five municipal wards on Sunday||The stage is set for bypolls in five municipal wards in Delhi on Sunday with all three main contenders -- the Aam Aadmi Party, BJP and the Congress -- exuding confidence of emerging victorious.The bypolls are being seen as the semifinal ahead of the civic body elections for 272 wards of three municipal corporations in early 2022.According to the State Election Commission, around 2.42 lakh people are eligible to cast their votes in these municipal wards -- Rohini-C, Shalimar Bagh (North), Trilokpuri, Kalyanpuri and Chauan Banger.Voting will be held from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm. The results will be announced on March 3, officials said, adding that there are 327 polling stations. Twenty-six candidates are contesting the elections.Officials said that Covid-19 patients can vote during the last hour of polling following laid down guidelines.The AAP has claimed that it will make a clean sweep in the bypoll as Chief Minister Arvind Kerjiwal had recently asserted that the party can challenge the BJP while terming the Congress its "B team".The main candidates in the by-elections are Dhirendra from the Aam Aadmi Party, Siyaram Kanojia from the BJP and Dharampal Maurya from the Congress in the Kalyanpuri ward.Vijay Kumar from the AAP, Om Prakash Gugarwal from the BJP and Bal Kishan are contesting from Trilokpuri ward.Former AAP MLA Haji Ishraq Khan is pitted against Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad of the Congress and Nazir Ansari of the BJP from Chauhan Bamgar ward.These three wards are under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. The AAP held these wards which were vacated after sitting councillors contested the assembly polls last year and became MLAs.From the Shalimarbagh North ward that fell vacant after the death of BJP councillor, the contest is between Surbhi Jaju of the BJP, Sunita Mishra of the AAP and Mamta of the Congress.The Rohini-C ward will witness a keen contest among former Bawana MLA Ramchandra of the AAP, Rajesh Goyal of the BJP and Mewati Barwala of the Congress.The AAP and the BJP have been attacking each other over a range of issues, including corruption, during the campaigning.Earlier this week, senior AAP leader Raghav Chadha had alleged that the BJP, ruling the three municipal corporations, has turned the city into a "heap of garbage".Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said that the party will win all the five wards.The Congress leaders have already appealed to Delhiites to vote for the party candidates in the by-elections.Earlier in the day, the State Election Commission issued a show-cause notice to Principal Secretary (Revenue) Sanjeev Khirwar and two officers of the Directorate of Information and Publicity (DIP) seeking their reply on an advertisement on 20 per cent reduction in circle rates in the city.In the notice issued to Khirwar, DIP secretary Padmini Singla and director Manoj Kumar Dwivedi, the Commission said that, prima facie, the advertisement violates the model code of conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gears-up-for-bypolls-in-five-municipal-wards-on-sunday-101614447210042.html
27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Sweet, Semul spring||Tricity denizens are bitterly complaining about a prickly-warm February but birds, bees, deer and bats are relishing the early blooming of the queen of the jungle – the Semul (silk cotton) tree.The Semul stands out like a warm and welcoming lantern in a hard jungle where nectar and sweet flowers devoid of protective thorns are an exception. An astonishing array of birds flock to the Semul to sip nectar while bees and insects can’t seem to get enough of the sweetness of a Semul spring.On a brooding night, fruit bats clamber aboard Semul blooms like phantoms to nibble at its sugary, succulent petals and relish its nectar. Fallen Semul flowers are gobbled up by wandering deer and antelopes with childlike joy, as if free gulab jamuns were being distributed under a populist scheme!Sanjeev Iddalgi, general manager (manufacturing) with the Dabur factory at Baddi, went the extra mile to procure exquisite pictures of birds on Semul flowers. In his pictures taken at Bhoj Nagar, the largeness of the Valentine flower emulates the tree’s big and giving heart. The blooms dwarf the winged lovers of Semul perched over its beckoning bowls, which are cast in tints of waning vermilion. “I reached early morning as most birds feed then and the light is soft for a great photograph. The birds were so engrossed in Semul flowers that they were hardly disturbed by the photographers’ clicking. They seemed drunk on nectar; the tree was a tavern of nature’s intoxicating offers,” Iddalgi told this writer.One is tempted here to gently pollinate Khalil Gibran’s lines and create a variant theme: For the bird, the Semul is a fountain of life. And to the Semul, a bird is a messenger of love. And to both, the giving and receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.Tenderness in loveFor a wandering soul, a wondering eye and a wonderful open heart Sukhna Lake presents so much more than just migratory birds. A very touching and moving picture of a mother monkey with her young one at the regulator end was captured by a roving bird photographer, whose sensitivity to his subjects, be birds or anything else constrains him from venturing too close and causing disturbance. Lalit Mohan Bansal, a subdivisional engineer (SDE) with the Chandigarh engineering department, who is tasked with catering to the irrigation and drinking water needs of peripheral villages, was indulging in his hobby of photographing birds when this moment of maternal bliss tugged at his heart strings.Arguably, the most unconditional and purest love, Bansal titled his photograph with the words: “Motherhood — all love begins and ends there.” Bansal’s perspective was a refreshing, deeply empathetic one, and a departure from how humans tend to perceive monkeys as a source of fear because they can attack or vandalise our homes. But monkeys are creatures of intelligence and brimming emotions.“Meri duniya hai maa tera aanchal...the baby was feeling totally secure in his/her mother’s tender embrace. The baby did not feel there was any threat in the environment around him/her. However, the mother was very much aware that humans or dogs could endanger her baby. So, she blended her loving absorption with a roving, darting eye, much like security personnel guarding VVIPs,” Bansal told this writer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzzsweet-semul-spring-101614447312294.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Higher Covid-19 positive test reports in private labs than in government labs||Private labs in Maharashtra have turned in more positive reports despite state-run ones carrying out a higher number of Covid-19 tests amid the outbreak, as per data compiled by the state health department.The positivity rate of private labs was 18.76 per cent compared to 12.61 per cent for government ones, with a possible reason being the former deploying more rapid antigen test kits, a senior official said."The idea was if an antigen tests returns positive, then the person can be subjected to an RT-PCR test for confirmation. Rapid antigen tests served as a quick mass surveillance tool to detect those who are possibly infected," he explained.Data compiled by the department showed that 60 per cent of the total testing in the state, which stands at 1,61,99,818 as on Saturday, was as per the RT-PCR method."The overall positivity rate in the state now is 13.25 per cent," he added.Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the state government, "Every rapid test that is positive should be followed by an RT-PCR test. It is standard procedure. There are chances of some lapses, but it was largely followed across the state."The number of tests per day in the state has increased from 35,000 to 80,000 since February 14 due to a spike in cases in some districts, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-more-positive-test-reports-in-private-labs-than-in-government-labs-101614446368841.html
27-02-2021||City||Odisha CM tables resolution on development of corridor around Puri temple||Days after the BJD and the BJP sparred on draft heritage bylaws on the 12th century Jagannath temple of Puri, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Saturday presented a resolution in the state assembly on the ₹3,200 crore Shrimandira Parikarama Plan calling Lord Jagannath the symbol of Odia esteem and pride.“The greatest identity of Odia community is Lord Jagannath. Our history, culture, tradition and belief system are all centred on the Almighty. He is the symbol of Odia esteem and pride. Visiting the Jagannath Temple once in a lifetime and getting a glimpse of the Lord is the only prayer of millions of devotees. All devotees, who come to the Jagannath temple in Puri to see the Lord, have a desire in their hearts to behold the deities in a calm, beautiful and spiritual environment. It is the responsibility of all of us to come back with a divine feeling,” said Patnaik as opposition Congress and BJP welcomed the resolution for the development of the temple.Also read: On Balakot anniv, IAF video shows jets bombing target with Spice 2000 bombsAs per the Shrimandira Parikarama Plan, the entire area within 75-metres around the Jagannath Temple will be transformed into a heritage corridor to attract devotees from across the world.As per the Srimandir Parikrama project heritage, as many as 22 projects will be executed in three phases within a couple of years. The area around the temple would be divided into 9 zones.A 7-metre green buffer zone adjacent to the Meghanad wall would come up followed by a 10-metre-long Antar Parikrama which will be used for the ceremonial procession of the deities. Besides, there will also be an 8-metre-long outer pradikshyan for devotees and a 10-metre public conveyance zone having restrooms, drinking water fountain, information-cum-donation kiosks and shelter pavilions.There is also a provision of a 5-metre service lane for the maintenance of the corridor, a 4.5-metre dedicated shuttle-cum-emergency lane, a 7.5-metre mixed traffic lane to aid the movement of vehicles around the corridor and a seven-metre wide shaded footpath with trees.The eastern plaza of the corridor is proposed as a large open space.A reception centre with a capacity to house 6,000 devotees and a cloakroom facility for 4,000 families is also planned. The mutts will be developed in Kalingan style architecture. Around 15.65 acres of land has been acquired for the heritage corridor.Calling the Jagannath temple as a centre of Odisha's spiritual heritage, CM Patnaik said the state has inherited from generation to generation. "We have preserved this priceless treasure for our future descendants in the legacy. We have to look into the Shrimandira Parikrama Plan with this spirit and make it happen with collective efforts. We need to take a vow to complete the Shrimandira Parikrama Plan with dedication at the earliest. To give a chance to all Odias and devotees of Lord Jagannath who want to contribute to this sacred act.”Patnaik said three objectives were considered for Srimandir Parikrama Yojana that were recommended by justice BP Das Committee. The recommendations were — safety of Srimandir, safety of millions of devotees visiting the temple for darshan of deities and creation of a spiritual atmosphere for devotees.The resolution for the Jagannath temple comes in the backdrop of the draft heritage bylaw for Jagannath temple issued by the National Monument Authority kicking up a political storm last month with the BJD alleging that it would affect the proposed development plan of the area around the shrine. Following appeals from the BJD and the BJP, the NMA, earlier this month, withdrew the bylaws that would have stopped any new construction within 100-metre radius of the temple. The NMA also put on hold two other draft bylaws for Ananta Basudeva temple and Brahmeswar temple in Bhubaneswar that would have affected the development of the area around the 11th century Lingaraj temple."Instead of pitching Jagannath temple as a symbol of Odia pride and esteem and bring religion into state's political discourse, the BJD would do well by focussing on real issues like paddy procurement and unemployment plaguing the state. In Bengal, the BJP got an entry as Mamata Banerjee wanted to appease Muslims by reading Namaaz. The soft Hindutva line to counter the BJP would not work and the BJD should realise that," said Ali Kishore Patnaik, state secretary of CPI(M).BJP MP from Bhubaneswar, Aparajita Sarangi, said the development of the Jagannath temple should be done as per the NMA and ASI guidelines."As per the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (or AMASR Act) 1958, no new works can be undertaken in the prohibited area within 100 metres radius of the Srimandir. However, various heritage monuments under the 75 metres of the temple, were demolished in the name of beautification and development. On behalf of the people of Odisha, I want to ask the State government whether detailed mapping was conducted before razing the mutts. Most importantly, whether the permission of the National Monument Authority (NMA) and the ASI was taken before razing them,” she stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-cm-tables-resolution-on-development-of-corridor-around-puri-temple-101614443972829.html

The new cases were reported in three clusters at Agragami College, Sambharam College and residents of Purva Venezia apartment, officials said.Talking to the media, BBMP commissioner N Manjunath said that those who arrived from neighbouring states of Kerala and Maharashtra resulted in new clusters. "New clusters have emerged. We are surrounded by Kerala and Maharashtra where cases are rising. Most people coming from here are students, they have been tested and isolated,” he said.Manjunath added that the city administration has intensified tracking and isolating those arriving from these states. The BBMP commissioner said that the emergence of the new clusters is the results of the elaborate testing conducted by the administration in the past few days across educational institutions with a large population of students from Kerala and Maharashtra. He added that around 18,000 nursing students from Kerala are studying across different colleges in the city.Also read: On Balakot anniv, IAF video shows jets bombing target with Spice 2000 bombsOn Saturday, the state reported 523 new cases. Out of these, 329 cases were reported in Bengaluru city.Karnataka government has imposed travel restrictions on passengers coming from Kerala and Maharashtra. The decision was taken that all passengers from these two states should produce a Covid-19 negative test report before entering the state.However, on Tuesday, the district administration of Dakshina Kannada district, which neighbours Kerala, temporarily suspended the decision following protests. Officials said that vehicles and passengers will be allowed to enter Karnataka without a test report until further notice. This decision is expected to be reviewed in the coming days.Three new Covid-19 clusters, all in the Yelahanka zone, with a total of 19 positive cases were detected in Bengaluru on Friday.

27-02-2021||Jaipur||Gehlot, Pilot hit out at farm laws ahead of Rajasthan bypolls||Putting up a united show ahead of the bypolls in Rajasthan, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot hit out at the Centre’s three farm laws while addressing two kisan mahapanchayats at Shri Dungargarh in Bikaner and Matrikundiya in Chittorgarh on Saturday.The two Congress leaders shared a helicopter for the first time after more than a year as they flew to address the two kisan mahapanchayats.“Protest and agitation are ornaments of democracy but the Central government is stubborn and not ready to listen to the farmers who are sitting on protest in extreme weather condition for the last 90 days,” Gehlot said at Shri Dungargarh.“Journalists, activists are being arrested. A 21-year-old girl was arrested in Bangalore. We have seen many governments but this is happening for the first time. Governments are not meant to be stubborn.”Also read: On Balakot anniv, IAF video shows jets bombing target with Spice 2000 bombsTaking a jibe at former CM Vasundhara Raje, Gehlot said, “More than 80 people were killed in firings during protests, including the Gurjar agitation. But in our tenure, not a single baton charge took place during protests. Our ministers went to the platform to talk to them and resolve their issues.”He said his government bought a bill to counter the three farms laws but they are awaiting the Governor’s nod. “One can understand under how much pressure he must be. The government can easily resolve the farmers’ issue by taking back the laws. The Centre should bring in new laws,” Gehlot said.“We are with the farmers. In the recent state budget, we announced a separate budget for farmers from next year. We announced to give ₹1,000 per month to farmers. We waived farmers’ loan of ₹8,000 crore.”Gehlot appealed to people to vote for the development works done by his party. “Your blessings should continuously shower on us. Four bypolls are coming soon. Nobody thought that four MLAs will leave us like that. If you help us win the bypolls, then our government will be more strengthened.”The bypolls are scheduled in Sujangarh, Rajsamand, Sahada and Vallabhgarh as four MLAs passed away between October 2020 and January 2021. In at least two of these seats, the Gujjars have a significant presence, making it difficult for the Congress to sideline Pilot.During Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Rajasthan on February 12 and 13, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Govind Singh Dotasra was given preference over Pilot in the rallies.In Matrakundiya, Pilot said that the Congress is working to create awareness. “Our leader Rahul Gandhi in his meetings said that the farmers are the backbone of our country and they are being attacked through this farm laws. The Centre wants to impose laws on the farmers. Through these laws, the Centre has ended laws on the stock limit and want to give profit to a few people,” he said.“The PM is not ready to listen to the farmers. Our leader Sonia Gandhi had united 24 parties against the farm laws. They want to shut all the mandis. Through these laws, farmers will become labour on their own land.”The former deputy CM praised the state budget and urged the people to vote for the Congress in the bypolls. Pilot also hit out at the Modi government over increasing fuel prices.“The laws made by the Centre are not only against the farmers but also the common man. The price of petrol is ₹100 per litre, cylinder price is ₹800 and unemployment is at its peak. We need to remain aware,” he said.State Congress in-charge Ajay Maken said the three farm laws will benefit a few corporates. “Before passing any bill, suggestions are taken from those concerned but these laws were brought without consulting anybody. These laws will end the MSP and mandi system,” he said.Maken added that the Congress will continue to fight for the people against the farm laws, rising fuel prices and other issues of public interest.State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra said that the Modi government didn’t fulfil any of his promises related to farmers. “Before coming to power, the PM had promised that he will double the income of farmers, their profit share will be increased up to 50 per cent, educated unemployed youth will be provided jobs and the foreign policy will improve. But everybody knows what’s has happened so far and what is happening,” he said.On the allegations levelled by the Congress leaders, state BJP president Satish Poonia said, “In the name of farmers, Congress is trying to find its lost ground among people. In times of Congress government also, incidents of firing had taken place.”He added, “Generally it is a perception that the party in power wins the bypolls but Congress government is afraid that after performing poorly in the panchayat elections they will lose in the bypolls too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlot-pilot-hit-out-at-farm-laws-ahead-of-rajastthan-bypolls-101614438761139.html

He, however, said the common people will continue to get milk at ₹55 to ₹60 per litre."The khap today took a decision in which we have asked farmers to sell milk at the rate of ₹100 per litre to government cooperative societies. For the common man, this will continue to be sold between ₹55 and ₹60 per litre,” he said.“We want to awaken the government. They should repeal the farm laws and bring down fuel prices," said Petwar, adding that the government is not listening to farmers’ demand of repealing the laws and continues to increase fuel prices.“Farmers are adversely hit by the rising diesel prices. Farmers not only grow crops, they also rear animals which produce milk,” he said, adding that the government should know that farmers are producers who can hike prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-khap-panchayat-urges-dairy-farmers-to-hike-milk-rates-for-govt-co-op-societies-101614435608876.html

27-02-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal activists urge parties to follow environmental norms during assembly poll campaigns||Green activists in West Bengal have urged political parties to abide by environmental norms while campaigning for the upcoming assembly polls, voicing concern over the unrestricted use of plastic.Noted green activist Subhas Dutta, President of Rejuvenators for Environment Nature and United Society (RENU), said on Saturday that letters were sent to 13 political parties in the state on February 22 about the urgent need to follow such norms, including the ones on sound pollution."With the entire state literally being under a cover of plastic materials... we have urged the parties to refrain from using plastic or minimise its use in their campaigns," Dutta said.He said political parties have also been urged to curb decibel levels in roadshows and rallies, and not use loudspeakers without sound limiters."Our appeal to the parties is to project themselves as 'poribesh bondhu' (friend of environment). Apart from political issues, they should mention about green ideas in poll manifestos," Dutta said.He said the Election Commission was also urged to ensure environmental standards are maintained by political parties and the issue be included in the model code of conduct."Environment is the key for sustainable development. All parties should show interest towards green initiatives in their election manifestos and see to it that those are implemented if voted to power," said environmentalist S M Ghosh, one of the key activists of the Save Rabindra Sarobar campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/wb-activists-urge-parties-to-follow-environmental-norms-during-campaigns-101614433698615.html

27-02-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: I didn’t mind being “shameless” to sit near my guru||Pune: So, I became a student of Dubeyji in his 10-day workshop. Little did I know that he was going to be my guru for the rest of my life. The workshop was for five hours a day. Those fifty hours offer me a lot of insight even today. Even though I had learnt most of the exercises in previous workshops, it was the narration of his experiences and a little peek that he offered about his process that opened up a lot of possibilities.I enjoyed doing those exercises. But I would wait for him to speak after every exercise, where he would explain their importance and also give examples of how he used them while directing plays. He used to sit in a normal plastic chair and we would sit on the floor. I would wait for everyone to sit so that I could go and sit at the very front, in whatever space I could find, so that I didn’t miss any word and not get distracted by anything else. Those might be the only days when I didn’t want to be a back-bencher. Everyone else had noticed it and it had become a standing joke to keep some space for me whenever he called us to listen. But I didn’t mind being shameless! The workshop sessions always went beyond the scheduled five hours and I wouldn’t have had a problem if they continued even after that! As mentioned in the previous article, the sessions ended with all of us singing various songs. It started with a song or two on the first day and by the end of it we were singing for nearly three quarters of an hour. We weren’t good at it, but it was a good way to unwind after all the theatrical exercises.Of the many things that have stayed with me, and those that I use while directing and also try and impart while conducting a workshop, three things have made a world of a difference. First and foremost – the art of surrendering to the creator. He told us that whenever you are watching a play or film, just surrender yourself to that for the duration of its runtime. Do not question the logic while watching it. Analyse it after you have watched it. It made a lot of sense to me. As a viewer, if I continue to be critical while watching it, there is a good chance that I will not enjoy anything!Second, he emphasised on the concept of “before”. What has happened before is as important as what is happening now. Everything that is taking place in the play has some history. Once we find that, the current events start making more sense. I directed my first play immediately after I did this workshop and I remember using this new-found knowledge fully and it helped me a lot. We improvised a lot of scenes that might have happened before the events in our play took place. These scenes were unscripted and based on an idea, mostly about something that was mentioned in the play. This helped the actors understand their characters, their motivations better and it definitely showed in their performance.And the third thing he taught us through a theatre exercise was to understand the text and the sub-text. It was such a simple and beautiful exercise and it remains my favourite till date. We had to narrate the paragraph that we had learnt by heart to an imaginary toddler over and over again until she or he understood it. But the catch was that the toddler was never going to understand it and we were not supposed to get angry at it or give up explaining! I think we did this exercise on the fifth or sixth day of the workshop and suddenly all of us realised that for all this time, we were only saying the lines, without understanding their meaning fully.I remember I had read out a story at a function where I was one of the recipients of a theatre fellowship. He was invited to be part of the celebrations and he too had graciously accepted it. While everybody else was congratulating us, he was the only one who was talking about our pieces that we had performed that day and what changes we could have done to make it better. I tried to hold on to every word he said, not knowing when I will get that chance again. But as it turns out, there were many interesting interactions still in store for me!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-i-didn-t-mind-being-shameless-to-sit-near-my-guru-101614432728461.html
27-02-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government says ₹42,700 crore loan given to about 13 lakh MSMEs in FY21||As many as 13 lakh MSME units in Uttar Pradesh have been given loans worth ₹42,700 crore in the financial year 2020-21, the state government said on Saturday.This is also for the first time in the history of the state that such a large amount of loan has been given to the MSME sector in a year. This has also generated 65 lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities in the private sector, an official release issued here said on Saturday. About 14 per cent of the country's micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) are operational in Uttar Pradesh, the release noted.Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, MSME, recently reviewed the steering sub-committee of the State Level Banker's Committee (SLBC) and gave instructions for early disposal of pending applications for acceptance and distribution at the bank-level under various government schemes including Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), ODOP, Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarojgar Yojana (MYSY), the release said.Instructions have also been given to take necessary action for the disposal of cases related to banks on the MSME Sathi app. About 41.16 per cent of bank accounts have been covered under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) against the total Jan Dhan accounts in UP. "The state government's one Gram Panchayat, one Bank Correspondent' programme has started under which the process of appointment of 58,000 Bank Correspondent (BC) Sakhi is underway,” Brajesh Kumar Singh, convener of SLBC said.In the review meeting, Amil Agarwal, under-secretary in the Union Ministry of Finance, also suggested the banks and the NABARD to take necessary steps to reach out to potential projects and entrepreneurs for the use of agricultural infrastructure funds.“NBFCs should also be included in the SLBC meetings from time to time so that they can share their suggestions and progress,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-government-says-rs-42-700-crore-loan-given-to-about-13-lakh-msmes-in-fy21-101614431458407.html
27-02-2021||Patna||CM Nitish Kumar bats for judiciary’s role in establishing rule of law in Bihar||Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Saturday praised Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s “deep insight into the purpose of law, the purpose of the courts and his interpretation of the principles of theory of the separation of power without mentioning it.”“The theory of the separation of power does not imply hostility between the branches of the government and it is indeed extremely elevating to hear such wonderful, realistic views, which are absolutely in accordance with the Constitution. I thank the CM for understanding the needs of the courts,” he said, after inaugurating the new state-of-the-art centenary building of the Patna HC, built at a cost of ₹203-crore, to cater to the growing need of space.Kumar had earlier in his address referred to the Patna HC’s endeavour in 2006, soon after he took over the reins of the state, to help establish the rule of law by ensuring speedy trials so that wrongdoers could get punishment.“The government alone cannot control crime. The government does its job, but it could happen in Bihar because the courts also contributed to it significantly through speedy trial and constant monitoring. The role of judiciary is of utmost importance,” the CM said, promising whatever assistance the courts would require by way of infrastructure and manpower instantly..The CJI said that with the passage of a century, the need for a new building was being felt for a long time due to gradual rise in litigation over the years and also the increase in the strength of judges. “The need for an additional building signifies not just the increase in the number of cases being filed in the courts, but also the growing consciousness about legal rights and increase in legal literacy, which we have been striving for. Most importantly, it shows the courts are being resorted to for settling disputes, rather than taking law in own hands,” he added.Bobde said the old building of the Patna HC, which completed its 100 years in 2016, was an iconic structure and witness to great luminaries and great battles in the court room. “As the CM is so forthcoming, I will request the Patna HC CJ Justice Sanjay Karol to seek an additional budget from the state government for artificial intelligence (AI). The system of AI will in no way take away the discretion of the judges in deciding a case, but only ease of access of information that will change to add speed. There should not be any apprehension about it,” he added.The CJI said the inequality due to video conferencing should also not be allowed and for that purpose, public kiosks have been developed free of cost for lawyers and litigants. “We are exploring many other facilities, including possibility of satellite access wherever cabling is not possible. Pandemic has changed the way we function,” he said, underlining the importance of pre-litigation mediation in both criminal and civil disputes within legal framework to bring down the load of cases.76.38-lakh cases digitally heardUnion law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who started his journey in the legal field from the Patna HC, said that even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian judiciary rose the occasion, digitally hearing 76.38-lakh cases till January 31, 2021, including 66460 cases by the Patna HC and 6.42-lakh cases by the district courts of the state.“We are working closely with the judiciary to create a digital ecosystem. The national judicial data grid so far having 18.09-crore case status and over 13.50 judicial orders from across the country. From Bihar, 56.18-lakh cases and 8.3-lakh judicial orders are available on the grid. Cases more than 10-year-old are being fast tracked. We are also boosting telly law. For that we have over 4-lakh kiosks for obtaining free legal service,” he added.Prasad also threw light on the social media guidelines, making it clear while the government welcomed dissent and criticism, misuse and abuse was not allowed. “We can criticise the reasoning of the judgment, but some people should not be allowed to make comments on judges or criticize them just because they did not have a judgment of their liking. The judges must have freedom. Trolling and agenda-setting is not fair,” he added.Prasad said that soon the Centre would set up all India judicial service to have quality intake in the judicial system on the lines of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS). “The idea to have a particular number of additional district judges through open competition. Subordinate judiciary, those with seven-year experience and fresh law graduates can also sit for the exam,” he added.Others who spoke on the occasion included the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Navin Sinha, Justice Indira Bannerjee, Justice Hemant Kumar and chief justice of the Patna HC, Justice Sanjay Karol. A large number of former and present chief justices, judges and legal luminaries were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cm-nitish-kumar-bats-for-judiciary-s-role-in-establishing-rule-of-law-in-bihar-101614431397720.html
27-02-2021||City||Naidu on damage control after TDP's poor show in gram panchayat polls in Kuppam||Telugu Desam Party's poor performance in Kuppam Assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district, in the recently-concluded gram panchayat elections, has shaken the ground of party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who represents the constituency.Though gram panchayat elections are held on a non-party basis, the candidates contesting for sarpanch posts and ward members openly flaunt their party affiliations at the ground level. Both the YSR Congress party and the main opposition TDP took the gram panchayat elections prestigiously as they provide a hold over the electorate at the grassroots level.However, the YSRC had its advantage of being the ruling party with complete control over the official machinery. It has claimed to have won a little over 80 per cent of the 13,000-odd gram panchayats in the state including 16 per cent of them unanimously.The TDP, however, debunked this claim and said it won nearly 35-40 per cent of gram panchayats.What shocked the TDP was the poor show by the party in Kuppam which is considered as Naidu's bastion who has been representing it for the last seven terms. The TDP could win only 14 out of 89 gram panchayats falling under this constituency, while the YSRC grabbed 74 gram panchayats.Also read: How much will vaccine cost at private hospitals? Here's what govt says“The outcome of gram panchayat elections in Kuppam is a reflection of the people’s faith in the welfare schemes being implemented by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. It is a victory of Jagan’s policies, rather than Naidu's defeat,” YSRC general secretary and advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said.He pointed out that in the Pulivendula Assembly constituency of Kadapa district, represented by Jagan, the YSRC won all the 108 gram panchayats which showed the people’s support to the present government.The TDP's defeat in Kuppam completely demoralised the party cadre in the constituency, who blamed it on the top leaders in Chittoor who failed to take the elections seriously.“The ruling YSRC has been focussing on Kuppam for quite some with the sole intention of breaking Naidu’s bastion. It has pumped in huge money and mobilised all its senior leaders led by panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy in the constituency. By gaining control over the gram panchayats, the ruling party will go all out to defeat Naidu in the next Assembly elections to finish his political career,” said a senior TDP leader from Chittoor, who refused to be named.Realising the threat posed to his position, Naidu quickly plunged into action as part of damage control exercise. In the last three days, the TDP chief made a whirlwind tour of Kuppam constituency, interacted with party leaders and addressed a few rallies to rejuvenate the party cadre.Putting up a confident and aggressive stance, Naidu said the YSRC had tried to bulldoze the panchayat elections by misusing its power. He called upon the people of Kuppam to fight back the threats and attacks by the YSRC leaders and continue their fearless struggle to save democracy.“I assure you that in the next elections, the TDP’s victory march will begin from Kuppam itself, defeating the YSRC leaders' ulterior plans,” he said, addressing a rally at Kuppam on Friday.He alleged that the YSRC leaders and the police had threatened to file false cases against the TDP candidates in the panchayat polls. They threatened to put liquor bottles and ganja in their homes to book false cases. “We shall continue the fight even we have to go to jail for a day or two,” he said.The YSRC, however, rebutted Naidu’s allegations. State panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy challenged the TDP president to contest the next assembly elections from Punganur (represented by the minister), to prove that he had people’s support.“Naidu has lost the confidence of the people. He can never win any elections again,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/naidu-on-damage-control-after-tdp-s-poor-show-in-gram-panchayat-polls-in-kuppam-101614431235884.html

27-02-2021||Mumbai||'Dictatorial': Maharashtra IT minister on centre's new social media regulations||Maharashtra minister of state for information technology (IT), Satej Patil, on Saturday criticised the central government's regulations for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and over-the-top (OTT) players such as content streaming platforms, calling them dictatorial, and a threat to democracy and freedom of expression.Patil said his comments were his personal stand and that he is yet to discuss the issue with his colleagues in the state government. Patil told Hindustan Times, "The regulations curtail freedom of expression. With these regulations, the privacy of individuals will be threatened. As of now, if the government wants anything anti-national and objectionable taken off the social media platforms, the social media companies cooperate. So there is no need to bring these regulations unless the government wants access to everyone's social media."Also read: How much will vaccine cost at private hospitals? Here's what govt saysHe added, "We saw what happened in the United States, that the former president Donald Trump's Twitter account was deactivated. This shows that the law has such mechanisms to ensure such type of content is removed. What the government is seeking to do through these new regulations is to gain control of this content, which is not acceptable."Patil also said, some bureaucrats deciding on what can be published and what cannot on any social media is an attack on the freedom of the press. Such orders will not have any standing in the court of law.On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology notified the guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules, 2021, that social media companies and OTT platforms need to follow. One of the rules is enabling traceability of the originator of the content. It also requires such platforms to remove content flagged by authorities within 36 hours, and appointing a grievance officer to receive a complaint within 24 hours, and resolve it within 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dictatorial-maharashtra-it-minister-on-centre-s-new-social-media-regulations-101614428183843.html

27-02-2021||Lucknow||Want alliance with BJP in 2022 UP polls, says RPI chief Athawale||Union minister Ramdas Athawale Saturday said his Republican Party of India (RPI) wants an alliance with the BJP for the upcoming polls in four states and the Union Territory of Puducherry, as also for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections.He said talks will be held with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath this evening over an alliance in the state, and also with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah in due course."If the BJP leaves 8-10 seats, the RPI can be used to give a jolt to the BSP," he said talking about Uttar Pradesh, claiming that people in the state are getting disenchanted with the Mayawati's party and are shifting towards the RPI.On alliance in the poll-bound Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, the RPI president said his party wants to contest these elections together with the BJP.However, if it was not given seats by the BJP, the RPI would field its candidates on some seats and extend support to saffron party on the others, he said.He pointed out the Dalit constitutes 36 per cent population of West Bengal, and the BJP would benefit if RPI fights the election with it.Athawale, whose RPI is a BJP ally at the Centre, said also praised the works done by Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Adityanath.Asked about any political understanding with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, Athawale said Azad is an "independent person, but if he joins my party he will be given an important post".The Dalit leader extended Azad and BSP president Mayawati invitations to join his party."If Mayawati comes, she would be given the post of the president of RPI and I will myself opt for the post of vice president as this is the party of Babasaheb (Bhimrao Ambedkar)," Athawale said.When pointed out that the BJP was not inclined to give his party any seat, he said, "As of now, our organisation is not very strong but we are strengthening it at the district-level."He also claimed that the BJP would be getting more than 200 seats in West Bengal. "There is a resentment against the government in the state."The NDA will form its government in four states and in Kerala too, it can succeed since people there are intending to hand over power to the BJP, he said.On the ongoing farmers agitation against the Centre's three agricultural reforms laws, he said, "Our government is not against farmers but if one law is repealed, there would be pressure to withdraw all laws. The government is ready for amendment in the farm law."On the issue of Maharashtra Congress unit President Nana Patole's announcement to oppose film actors Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar on the issue of inflation, the RPI president said that his party has decided to support the Bollywood stars.When questioned about his silence over inflation and why he does not criticise the BJP over the issue, Athawale said, "I do not raise my voice against the BJP as our two voices are the same."To a question on Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Varanasi on the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti, Athawale said she can visit whichever temple she wants but there is no future for the Congress till there is Rahul Gandhi.The RPI president demanded the landless people of Uttar Pradesh be given 5 acre land by the Adityanath government.The union minister also said that Marathas in Maharashtra, Jaats in Haryana and Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are demanding reservation and so they should also get 10-12% quota.He also said that the 2021 census be caste-based so as to find out the actual caste data on the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/want-alliance-with-bjp-in-2022-up-polls-says-rpi-chief-athawale-101614422608263.html

27-02-2021||Delhi||NGT directs Delhi Jal Board to ensure supply of treated water in public parks||The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to ensure supply of treated water with adequate pressure in public parks and to stop groundwater extraction for gardening.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel said steps are reported to have been taken, the matter needs to be taken forward to ensure that freshwater is not used for gardening in public parks by the DDA and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation."The DJB may ensure supply of such treated water with adequate pressure and wherever piped supply is not available, supply may be ensured by tankers," the bench said."DPCC may monitor similar action by other agencies in Delhi owning parks and by bulk users, including other Municipal Corporations for adopting a similar course of action to save drinking water for drinking purposes to fulfil the basic need of maximum people. This may be overseen by the Secretary, Environment, Delhi," it said.The tribunal had earlier prohibited Delhi Development Authority (DDA), South Delhi Municipal Corporation and DJB from using freshwater for gardening purposes.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by retired Rear Admiral A P Revi seeking execution of the 2017 order directing the DDA/MCD that treated sewage water, supplied by the DJB, be used for gardening instead of freshwater.The counsel for DJB had earlier told the bench that there was a sewage treatment plant in Vasant Kunj in south Delhi from where treated sewage water can be provided to the residents for the purpose.Revi had sought directions for the supply of treated sewage water in Vasant Kunj for gardening and other purposes so that they do not have to use freshwater.The plea had said that treated water should be used for the maintenance of greenery in the Vasant Kunj area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ngt-directs-delhi-jal-board-to-ensure-supply-of-treated-water-in-public-parks-101614413789085.html
27-02-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: F&B startups keep the orders coming||PUNE The common refrain is: “Pune Tithe Kay Une” (There is nothing that cannot be found in Pune). This city has witnessed several brands of tea, biryani and other food items becoming “famous” within a short span of time. With a large student population, the “experimenting customer base” is always there. As the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns hit the city, social media was flooded with several “Puneri recipes”, with everyone becoming a chef and health conscious. This wave slowed down as the unlocking phase began, but till then, the hotel, restaurant, café (HoReCa) industry had been impacted adversely. Several outlets closed down while some turned to the online solutions, like Nikhil Dahake, owner of Just Bytes Café. He says, “A behavioural change is evident and seen in customers post lockdown. The overall spending capacity has also come down, but now a gradual recovery is happening. We have completely shifted to online ordering since the lockdown.”As customers were wary about hygienic practices at the reopened outlets, business owners looked for some innovative and technological solutions. These innovations and tech-based solutions are in demand in all segments, like food products, packaging and safety, storage and supply chain solutions, food distribution and food processing equipment and technologies.Pune has seen the birth of a “rebel”, another unicorn in the making, along with several other healthy food startups. City-based entrepreneurs are overcoming the challenges and riding the long-awaited wave of disruption in food industry.What the founders say“In the last one year we are seeing lot of action in the food-tech startup space, because of people becoming more conscious about their health and immunity. Covid-19 has pushed people towards adopting a healthier lifestyle and experimenting with healthy food. Customer acquisition that would have taken two or three years, has happened in just four or five months. We are aware that this is a temporary situation and there will be some dropouts, but we have got a lot of boost.“Even though the interest in the food-tech space has increased in the recent past, investors are not so keen in this domain, because margins or returns are less relative to other tech products. The packaged food revolution has not taken place in India yet. We still consume conventional food and no company has been able to change this habit. This will be disrupted soon and we will see this wave in near future. “Strategically, Pune has many advantages and an ecosystem is already developed. Pune has one or two food parks, but if we want new companies then we need to have more food parks. Also, there are SMEs existing in and around Pune which are into machinery production for food processing units. There are at least 20 to 25 new packaging food brands in my knowledge that are coming up. A few companies from Pune will grow big in the next two-to-three years, which will help build the ecosystem. “The other factors in favour of Pune are that Maharashtra is among the three states with a large number of food-tech courses offered in colleges. So, human resources and talent is not a problem for us. There is no issue regarding raw material supply. One advantage is that huge capital not required to start in the food industry, as compared to, say the auto industry. Hence, many entrepreneurs have started their businesses in Pune. Since margins are low and it’s a struggle to make it in food industry, it will take time to pick up. The young generation is helping the older generation in their businesses which is also changing the dynamics and building the ecosystem. The government should support and ensure that all permissions are given quickly.”Sreejith Moolayil, co-founder, True Elements“I was running an IT company and cloud kitchen in 2014 at Nigdi Pradhikaran. Managing these two simultaneously, I was facing challenges in the restaurant industry on the operations, inventory, staff, and expense-tracking front. I thought it was not my domain. I started looking for a software and approached some companies. The software was priced at about a lakh of rupees and hence, we could not afford it. Despite being an IT guy, I thought we can manage the operations manually, but then we failed miserably. Since then, I decided that we will help others to setup their cloud kitchen and run their restaurant smoothly. So, we diverted all our attention to the food and beverages industry with a special focus on technology. We designed our operating system for restaurant industry. We aimed to manage all tasks through our software in a smooth way and help the restaurant industry. “The restaurant industry was badly impacted during the pandemic. Hence, we decided to bail it out by offering a contactless platform for online and offline ordering. Since, customers were not stepping out and were sceptical about handling menu cards physically, we designed the QR code-based contactless ordering platform. We have on-boarded 4,000 restaurants since the lockdown, including 1,200 restaurants in the Pune region. Now with second wave of Covid-19 cases and restrictions in place again, enquiries have increased. We are also in talks with some investors for a first round of $1 million funding for scaling.Rahil Shaikh, co-founder, TMBill and TechMainstay------Food & beverage, and food-tech startups in PuneTrue Elements (HW Wellness Solutions), Hinjewadi•Founded in 2014 by Sreejith Moolayil and Puru Gupta•A whole-food plant-based and clean-label brand that provides a range of healthy breakfast (nashta) and snack food items using Indian local produce like millets, grains, and seeds. •Secured ₹10 crore funding from Maharashtra State Social Venture Fund (MSSVF) managed by SIDBI VC in January 2021.

27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Five Congress MLAs booked for causing hurt to Himachal governor||Hours after they were suspended for the entire budget session for unruly behavior at the Vidhan Sabha on Friday, the Himachal Pradesh Police registered a case against five Congress legislators, including leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, for causing grievous injuries to governor Bandaru Dattatreya. Besides Agnihotri, the case was registered against five-time Shillai legislator Harshwardhan Chauhan, Sunder Thakur, Satpal Raizada and Vinay Kumar at Boileuganj police station. All five were booked on the complaint from the Vidhan Sabha secretariat. The MLAs were booked for obstructing the exit of the governor and injuring him in the process. A marshal escorting the governor complained about this to Vidhan Sabha Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar. The MLAs had flung copies of governor’s address on his official car when he was leaving. “They threw copies of the governor’s address. It not only caused dishonour but also hurt him,” Parmar said. According to police sources, the MLAs were booked under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt. The offence is bailable. Besides, the case was also registered under Section 124, 341 and 34 of the IPC. Security to be beefed up in assembly Soon after the opening day’s session ended, the Speaker convened a meeting of the security staff to review the situation. Footage from close circuit cameras on the Vidhan Sabha premises and those being circulated on social media and electronic media was watched closely before the complaint was lodged. The Vidhan Sabha secretariat decided to increase the number of internal security staff on the premises for the session. “Due to the pandemic, we had restricted the number of entrants to the Vidhan Sabha and deployed fewer security personnel, but after Friday’s incident, it has been decided to increase the number of police personnel deployed there,” Parmar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-congress-mlas-booked-for-causing-hurt-to-himachal-governor-101614422888994.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP and Congress gear up for Delhi MCD by-polls tomorrow||By-polls in five wards of Delhi’s civic body, two of which fall under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and three under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), will be held on Sunday. The elections are being seen as a test for Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 27 seats in the Surat municipal corporation in Gujarat. Kejriwal hailed the party’s victory as “breaching the BJP’s citadel”. The MCD by-polls are also a precursor to the 2022 Delhi civic body polls and are important to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is aiming to gain ground in the national capital. The polling will start at 7.30am and end at 5.30pm and the results will be declared on March 3.Here’s everything you need to know about the Delhi MCD by-polls:1. The five wards where by-polls will be conducted are Ward No 32N, (Rohini-C); Ward No 62N, (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi and Ward No 02-E (Trilokpuri); Ward No 08-E (Kalyanpuri) and Ward No 41-E (Chauhan Bangar) in east Delhi.2. Four of the five wards fell vacant after sitting councillors contested assembly polls on AAP tickets last year and became MLAs. The Shalimar Bagh ward fell vacant following the death of Renu Jaju, who had won the seat on a BJP ticket in 2017.3. The last date for filing nominations for the by-polls was February 8. Over 70 nominations, including duplicate applications from some candidates, were received by poll authorities for the by-election.4. The BJP, which has ruled the three corporations in Delhi for more than a decade, has been holding meetings at the booth level and has tasked each party worker with getting support from around 21 houses as part of their campaign.5. The AAP, which called itself a better alternative to the BJP, built a door-to-door campaign highlighting financial mismanagement and corruption in the BJP-ruled MCD for 15 years.6. The Congress party accused both the AAP and BJP of fighting amongst themselves and ignoring the residents of Delhi. Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said, “People know that the BJP and AAP, in their fight, have worsened the finances of MCDs, affecting civic services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-and-congress-gear-up-for-delhi-mcd-by-polls-tomorrow-101614418850493.html

27-02-2021||Bangalore||Manual scavenging continues to mar Karnataka as conviction stays zero||Soon after entering the underground drain, two men collapsed due to the lack of oxygen. Even as those standing above on the road sensed something was wrong, they did not go inside realising that poisonous gases in the drain could be hazardous for them. By the time the officials of the fire and emergency services arrived at the spot, the two men were dead, and one was in a critical condition.The deaths of 30-year-old Lal Ahmed and 25-year-old Rasheed Ahmed in north Karnataka’s Kalburgi on January 26 were the latest in the list of people who died because of manual scavenging. A public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the Karnataka high court stated that at least 43 people have died in 21 incidents related to manual scavenging in the state since 2015.“Any death related to manual scavenging is called an accident, but the truth is that it is culpable homicide, if not murder. When you send someone inside a pit with poisonous gases, you are aware of the danger to that person’s life,” said Clifton Rozario, a city-based advocate, who has filed the petition against manual scavenging in the high court.“Even though The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act came into existence in 2013, the inhuman practice not only continues, but it has caused lives,” Rozario said.The advocate added that the lack of political will, failure in enforcement of law and apathy from the civic society allowed the practice to continue.An example to show the institutional failure in enforcing the law is the number of cases filed regarding manual scavenging. According to Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, the state has witnessed 36 manual scavenging-related incidents since 2008, resulting in 72 deaths. Police cases were filed in all the incidents, but there has not been a single conviction.In four cases, police filed a B Report, which meant they did not find any evidence to file a charge sheet. Five cases were registered as unnatural death reports, 15 were under trial, two under investigation and in 12 cases, the accused were acquitted.“Manual scavenging is happening in the city on a daily basis, but it comes to the eyes of the police only if there is a death. There is not one case where manual scavenging has been stopped. If the government gives stricter orders, this could be done. But the government has been dragging its feet for years now,” Rozario said.According to a worker employed as manual scavenger in the city, there are two types of people employed — those working with government agencies or contractors, who either work for the government or privately, and those who go door-to-door seeking work.“In most cases, we have no options but to enter the pits. We don’t have the power to demand machines and if we refuse to work, they will find someone else. It is true that all works can’t be done with machines and we have to enter the pits, but we don’t get any masks and boots. We often look at fire department officials entering manholes with oxygen tanks on their backs, with fascination,” a worker employed with a contractor, said on the condition of anonymity.Earlier, manual scavenging was associated with the cleaning of septic tanks. However, according to experts, there are many aspects to the illegal practice. One being sewage treatment plants (STPs) set up in apartment buildings. “STPs are emerging as the new killing fields of sanitation workers after sewer lines, manholes and septic tanks. In the last two years in Bengaluru, at least eight workers have been killed in four incidents while cleaning STPs,” said Siddharth Joshi, member, Safaikarmachari Kavulu Samithi-Karnataka.There is no clarity on the number of people engaged in manual scavenging. While activists working for the welfare of safai karmacharis peg the number at 25,000, a pilot survey of six districts, including Bengaluru, in 2018, identified a total of 1,720 workers engaged in manual scavenging.The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB), too, acknowledges that it has limited equipment to clear sewage lines. the board has around 150 jetting and sucking machines, said an official on the condition of anonymity, admitting the machines were not enough to cover the requirement of the city.“We are planning to get more machines. Private markets are also showing improvement, where many contractors are offering to clean sewage using machines. There is a certain trend of moving away from people getting into drains and manholes,” the officer claimed.Rozario, however, said the only way for the problem to end was change in mindset. “First of all, it is a caste issue. Most of those working as manual scavengers come for certain castes and there is no interest in changing the social structure,” he said.He added that more than the government enforcing the law, if residents of Bengaluru could make a conscious decision not employ anyone to clear their sewage lines or sewage pits and insist on the use of machine, an ecosystem will be built. “When there is demand, there will be supply. In this case, a supply for using more technology to replace the man entering the sewage lines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/manual-scavenging-continues-to-mar-karnataka-as-conviction-stays-zero-101614415524006.html

At least three persons were detained for the violence while police presence in the neighbourhood was intensified to maintain law and order.A senior police officer said it was a blind kidnapping case and the investigating team had been trying to gather leads from the day the case was registered.“The CCTV footage helped us get some leads about the suspects but their whereabouts were not known... We tracked them down using the IMEI numbers of their cellphones, but by the time we could arrest him and the other three suspects, they had already killed the girl,” said the officer, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/9yearold-girl-kidnapped-killed-in-east-delhi-village-101614380236390.html
27-02-2021||Bhopal||Ex-MP Cong chief objects to entry of Godse worshiper into party||A day after the Congress’ Madhya Pradesh unit admitted a Nathuram Godse admirer into its fold, former Union minister Arun Yadav wrote an open letter on Friday to protest against the move, saying he “can’t sit silently” watching the entry into the party of a man he described as a murderer of Gandhian ideology.The Congress on Thursday inducted former Gwalior corporator Babulal Chaurasiya, who once built a temple dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin, into the party in the presence of former chief minister Kamal Nath. “Many big politicians say Nathuram Godse was the first terrorist of India, but why are they silent over the induction of an admirer of Godse in the Congress party,” Yadav, a former president of the Congress’s Madhya Pradesh chapter, asked in the open letter to the party.He cited the example of Bhopal’s Pragya Thakur, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bhopal MP, who in the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign described Godse as a patriot, a remark for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he wouldn’t ever forgive her. Yadav posed the rhetorical question: If Thakur joins the Congress in the future, would the party accept her, too?In the open letter, Yadav attacked his party leaders and questioned them about the Congress’s ideology. “Being a true soldier of the Gandhian ideology of Congress, I can’t sit silently. My struggle is not against any person, but it is dedicated to the ideology of Congress. I am ready to suffer any political damage for that.” Yadav noted that during his tenure as CM, Kamal Nath had an FIR registered against Chaurasiya and others for distributing pamphlets containing a statement by Godse and derogatory references to Mahatma Gandhi.Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) leaders said Yadav had expressed a personal opinion and defended Chaurasiya as a follower of Gandhian ideology who had been misguided by the Hindu Mahasabha about Godse.MPCC spokesperson Ajay Singh Yadav said Babulal Chaurasiya had only returned to a party to which he belonged before 2015. “He clearly said he was misguided by Hindu Mahasabha and he believes in Gandhian ideology and had nothing to do with Godse and RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh],” he added.The BJP took swipe at the Congress, saying the episode had exposed an internal feud among party leaders. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said: “The Congress is facing existential crises. Its leaders are fighting with each other for posts. Now, Yadav made it clear that the party leaders are confused about the party’s ideology too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/exmp-cong-chief-objects-to-entry-of-godse-worshiper-into-party-101614374603042.html

Their investigations have also revealed that the number plate on the car is fake, and the number actually belongs to the pilot car in the security convoy of Ambanis.Police officials said that the note was found in a bag bearing logo of “Mumbai Indians”, the Indian Premier League cricket team owned by the Ambanis.Directly addressed to Nita and Mukesh Ambani, the note claimed the vehicle with the gelatin sticks was just a trailer and that there was more to come.Taking serious note of the incident, Mumbai police crime branch has formed 12 teams to probe the matter. Ambani and his family are already under Z+ category protection. Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company in terms of market value.The company on Friday issued a statement thanking Mumbai police for the efforts being taken to probe the matter.“We are thankful to Mumbai Police for their quick and immediate action. We are confident that Mumbai Police will complete their thorough investigation quickly,” said a company spokesperson.Meanwhile, a team from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) too reached Mumbai and has started a parallel probe.One of the police teams has found that the SUV used was stolen from Vikhroli area on February 17, and a fake number plate was affixed on it, said a police officer attached to the crime branch who asked not to be named.A Thane resident owns the SUV. He has told police that the SUV was lying unused for almost a year due to the lockdown. Last week, he took it for a drive to check it because he wanted to sell it, but found the steering was jamming. he parked it in Vikhroli, and took a cab home, but when he returned the following day, the vehicle was no longer where he left it. He registered an FIR at the Vikhroli police station on February 18.About 2.5kg of gelatin, in sticks, was found in the SUV, enough to trigger a low intensity explosion. However, there was no detonator or timing device. The police believe the explosive was purchased in Nagpur.The fake registration number chosen for the SUV was that of the lead car in the security convoy deployed for Nita Ambani, said the officer cited in the first instance. A second officer who is directly involved in the investigation said that the operation seems well planned.The police also found more number plates in the SUV and that there have been attempts to erase the chassis number of the SUV.Thus far, the police have found that the Scorpio was accompanied by an Innova, and that the two vehicles together moved towards Antilia.At about 2.18am, the Scorpio was abandoned near Antilia; its driver sat in the Innova and escaped from the spot, said a third police officer who asked not to be named.The Innova exited Mumbai at 3.05am through Mulund toll naka, this officer added. The registration number of the Innova car was found to be fake and cops suspect that this vehicle too was stolen. The Mumbai Anti-Terrorism Squad has also started a parallel probe into the matter.A Quick Response Team and police commandos have been posted outside Antilia after the incident.“An offence has been registered in this regard at Gamdevi Police Station, under sections 286, 465, 473, 506(2),120(B) IPC and u/s 4 of Explosive Substances Act 1908,” said Mumbai police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police, Chaitanya Siriprolu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/just-a-trailer-says-letter-found-in-car-near-mukesh-ambani-s-residence-101614373353697.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi sees 256 fresh Covid cases, highest single day spike in 35 days||The Capital saw its highest single-day rise in Covid-19 infections in 35 days on Friday, adding 256 fresh cases of the infection. The city has seen the number of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections inch up gradually, with over 200 cases being recorded for three days on the trot now, a spurt that comes as some states in the country — Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh — have seen what appears to be the start of fresh waves of the infection.Further, Delhi’s Covid-19 test positivity rate has also increased gradually over the past few days, hitting 0.41% — the highest recorded in the Capital since January 29. Friday’s positivity rate was nearly double the 0.22% recorded in the city two weeks ago. Delhi conducted 62,768 tests, as per Friday’s bulletin, of which 41,775 used the gold standard RT-PCR method, while the rest used the rapid antigen method.The seven day average positivity rate – calculated on the basis of the number of tests and cases over the last seven days – has also increased to 0.30%, up from 0.24% last week and 0.21% the week before that.Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection. To be sure, the World Health Organization recommends a rate below 5% for two weeks for an infection to be considered under control. Delhi has not touched this number in its positivity rate since December 2, when it recorded 3,944 new infections.“I hope I am wrong, but the positivity rate has almost doubled in the last two weeks. The speed at which the positivity rate has increased leads me to believe that we might again see an increase in the number of cases like it is being seen in other states like Maharashtra. Now, we need to trace the areas from where the new cases are being reported and probably look at pre-emptive containment,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), who headed Delhi government’s first expert committee on strategies to control the spread and manage Covid-19 cases.The fewest cases in a day was reported on February 16, when the city added just 94 new infections.The number of tests in the city has also gone down from its highest capacity of over 80,000 tests a day. This month on average 58,231 tests were conducted each day in the city. The proportion of the more accurate RT PCR tests has, however, increased to over 64%.Dr Sarin had also suggested that people living in regions reporting increase in cases be immunised as quickly as possible. However, Delhi has seen a decline in the number of immunisations, with just over 13,000 people getting the shot on Friday as compared to the highest of over 27,000.“The numbers have gone down because fewer people are coming in; there is a need for more motivation. Those who were motivated already took their first shot last week,” said a senior district level officer.Delhi, like much of the country, will not have immunisations on Satuday and Sunday as India transitions to CoWIN 2.0 that would allow people to self-register for vaccination.Government experts have also been stressing hard on not getting complacent, and to continue following Covid-19 appropriate behavior. “We have seen in other countries, wave after wave after wave, so we cannot afford to drop our guard just yet. There is a large percentage of population that is still susceptible so we must strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings as far as possible, and observing hand hygiene among other things,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, in Union health ministry’s Covid briefing earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sees-256-fresh-covid-cases-highest-single-day-spike-in-35-days-101614372844372.html
27-02-2021||Noida||Three men in auto gang-rape GB Nagar woman in Hapur||A 30-year-old woman from Gautam Budh Nagar was allegedly gang-raped in Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh by two co-passengers and the driver of the autorickshaw she was travelling in late on Wednesday night, police said on Friday.A complaint has been filed against the three unidentified accused, but no arrests have been made so far.Police said that the woman works for a jewellery store at a mall in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram and was heading home to Greater Noida after leaving work around 8:30pm on Wednesday night when the incident occurred.On Wednesday, she boarded the first auto from National Highway-9 and reached the Lal Kuan intersection in Ghaziabad around 9:15pm.From Lal Kuan intersection, she boarded another autorickshaw with three co-passengers and the driver — all men. Soon after one of the passengers de-boarded, the driver steered the auto 20km towards a secluded spot in Masuri area (Ghaziabad), bordering Pilkhuwa area of Hapur, where the three overpowered the woman and raped her, police said.According to police officials, the incident occurred around 10pm a short distance away from the highway and near a small canal in Hapur.“We received a call at around 3.30am on Thursday from control room in Ghaziabad about the incident. The scene of crime told by the woman is about 5-10 metres inside the jurisdiction of Hapur district and we immediately registered an FIR under IPC section of gangrape (Section 376 D) based on her complaint given at Pilkhuwa police station. We have formed three teams and are trying to trace the three unidentified men who, she said, were in the age group of around 30,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (Hapur), who also visited the scene of incident.“They stopped the auto before the Lal Kuan flyover, during which they gagged me and people sitting behind asked the driver to turn on the music system ... They then raped me one by one... Around 11.30pm they took me to the main road and waited for a bus. However, when none of the passing buses stopped, they made me board an auto back to Lal Kuan,” the woman said in her complaint.She stated that the suspects had snatched her mobile, so she begged her auto-driver to lend her his phone, which he refused claiming he had no balance. The auto then stopped at a juice shop at Masuri. But the vendor there too refused to help her saying that it was a case of kidnapping and directed her to reach Masuri police station nearby.The woman reached Masuri police station in Ghaziabad at around 11:30pm, after which the Ghaziabad police finally referred the matter to their counterparts in Hapur and later sent for medical examination.“After the woman reached us, we inquired the matter and referred the incident to the Hapur police who lodged the FIR. On our part, we have also formed one team to help investigation,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), Hapur.Additional superintendent of police (Hapur) Sarvesh Mishra said authorities were scanning CCTV footage in the area near the crime site to identify the suspects.The woman has a 10-year-old child and was living separately from her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-men-in-auto-gang-rape-gb-nagar-woman-in-hapur-101614372658413.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 55-year-old mowed down by speeding car in Vasant Vihar||A 55-year-old man was killed after a speeding Mercedes-Benz car driven by a 18-year-old son of a diamond exporter hit his scooter in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar outside a market on Thursday night, police said.The driver of the car, who, according to the police, was taking a joyride with his friends ran away, but was arrested on Friday morning.The police said that based on a medical examination conducted on Friday, he was not drunk at the time of the incident.The mishap, which happened at around 11.45 pm has been captured on a CCTV camera installed outside a shop in the market. The victim, Antony Joseph, a security guard, was on his way to meet his wife, who works in Vasant Vihar.The driver, Aryan Jain, was returning home with his two friends after a late-night drive in a Mercedes E 250 car, the police added.His car was coming from Outer Ring Road and was on the Vasant Marg.As it reached the A-block market, it hit a scooter that came out from a lane and took a right turn onto Vasant Marg.After hitting the scooter, the car rammed a tree and a telephone junction box, uprooting both of them , before crashing into the boundary wall of a bungalow and its guard room. The trio panicked and fled, the police said.Jain was identified and arrested on Friday morning after the police established the ownership of the car and contacted his family, which brought him to the police station. He was booked for rash and negligent driving causing death, and released on bail.“Jain’s medical examination showed that he was not drunk at the time of the mishap. He claimed that he tried to avoid hitting the scooter and lost control. We are carrying out our investigation to ascertain the exact sequence of events,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.Singh said Jain is studying in a UK university and will turn 19 in March. His father Sushil Jain has diamond and jewellery store at a shopping mall in Saket. “Jain had a learner’s driving licence,” added Singh. It wasn’t clear whether any of the others in the car had a licence. Indian laws allow someone with a learner’s licence to drive only when accompanied by someone with a licence.“The market was closed when the mishap took place. But when we learnt about it in the morning, we checked the CCTV footage. The footage shows that the Mercedes car was speeding when it hit the scooter. Some security guards who saw the accident told us that the scooter rider was flung several feet in the air while his scooter was thrown nearly 40 feet away,” said Aman Singh, a shopkeeper in the market.“The car stopped only after hitting the boundary wall and the guard room of a house. Had the car not hit the tree and the junction box, it may have entered the premises of the house after breaking its boundary wall. The scooter rider died on the spot,” said a local resident.Police said they were informed about the mishap by a local resident, who called the police control room. Joseph was rushed to the AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he was declared brought dead. At the time of the mishap, Joseph was going to meet his wife, who works as a cook at a Vasant Vihar bungalow for expatriates who work in the American Embassy.Joseph is survived by his wife and a 32-year-old son. Joseph worked as a security guard at a private company in Delhi’s Naraina while his son worked as a guide with a tour and travel company in Delhi. The father and son both lost their jobs between May and June last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.There are at least 12-15 accidents reported across the city every day, according to Delhi police data. In 2020, there were 1163 fatal accidents across the city. The number in 2019 was 1433. Traffic police officers said that speeding is the most common reason why fatal accidents happen across the city.The number of accidents during the night hours, when the roads are relatively less crowded, is more compared to the day hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-55-year-old-mowed-down-by-speeding-car-in-vasant-vihar-101614372329744.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: For him, waste is wealth||His voice has nothing to particularly set him apart. If you overheard him chatting in a party, you wouldn’t think twice of it.But suddenly he cries out—“kabadi walla!”And instantly that same unremarkable voice turns into the universal cry of the trash collector, any trash collector, going about our city’s neighbourhoods asking dwellers to sell him the household stuff they no longer need. This voice has no resemblance to the man’s conversational voice.How is that possible?Wali Muhammed shrugs, looking amused.Calling himself a “kabadi walla,” or trash collector, he says he cycles around south Delhi’s Green Park, his trash collector’s voice echoing off the walls of the bungalows lining up the quiet alleys. Because it is morning and Mr Muhammed has just started, he has nothing to show on his bicycle for now.But from whom did he learn to make this cry, which sounds like any “kabadi walla” cry in any part of this city? Surely, there’s no training school for it.Mr Muhammed parks his bicycle on the side of the road, and seems to think hard. “It’s like asking from whom do baby birds learn to fly... they just start flying.” And so, according to his analogy, once a man decides to make his living as a “kabadi walla,” he automatically slips into this booming incarnation when at work. “The main thing is to cry out very loud, announcing who you are so that the people inside their houses”—here he gestures towards the surrounding buildings—“register your presence.”Mr Muhammed dismisses any hereditary connect to his professional voice. “My father was a farmer.” A farmer without a land, he notes, working as a farmhand on other people’s agricultural holdings in Aligarh district, in UP. There was no bright future in following his footsteps, so the young Mr Muhammed decided to build his future in Delhi. “I started as a labourer, carrying bricks to construction sites.” Only years later, he switched to his current profession.And now, he says in a satisfactory tone, his son is doing yet something else. “He has a job in a mobile phone company.”Mr Muhammed makes his rounds from 8am to 2pm, after which he sells his day’s collection to buyers, who deal with recyclable objects.He now pedals ahead, crying out “kabadi walla”, his voice undoubtedly breaching into the solidity of these houses, probably jolting out at least a few of the residents and making them aware of the existence of their neighbourhood “kabadi walla”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-for-him-waste-is-wealth-101614372135737.html
27-02-2021||West||TMC tries to hold fort as BJP aims to gain ground||West Bengal’s political narrative projects a bipolar electoral contest between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), and its Left Front partners, the Congress and cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front trying to emerge as a viable third contender in parts of the state.On Friday, the Election Commission announced dates for the assembly elections in West Bengal, where the BJP is determined to win power. Polls in the state will be held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29.The schedule was announced in the backdrop assertions by chief minister Mamata Banerjee that the political battle between her TMC and the BJP was a personal battle as well; she has cited the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) investigation into a coal smuggling racket in which the agency has questioned her nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife and sister-in-law. “Threats of jail sentence cannot scare us. We have stood before guns in the past. We won’t be scared of fighting rats. I will not surrender as long as I am alive...,” Banerjee said at an event in Kolkata on January 21.To oust her government, the BJP is on a war footing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Bengal thrice in 30 days, followed by Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP president J P Nadda and over 30 Union ministers and senior BJP leaders from other states who Banerjee calls “outsiders with no roots in Bengal.” The party is organising over a dozen events every day.Bengal BJP spokesperson and convenor of the party’s Kolkata zone election committee, Debjit Sarkar, said, “This election is about getting relief from the misrule, anarchy and nepotism established by the TMC since 2011. This poll is about building a golden Bengal and establish democracy. We hope holding the polls in several phases will help counter the electoral malpractices the TMC has expertised in.”To trace the growth of the BJP vis-à-vis that of the TMC’s, political experts often look back to 2009. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the TMC was not in power, the Left Front secured 43.3% votes but won only 15 seats. In comparison, 19 seats went to the TMC although Mamata Banerjee had a lower vote share of 31.18%. In that election, the BJP secured only 6.14% vote share and one seat.The BJP has drastically improved its position since then, winning two Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and 18 in 2019. In terms of the assembly segments, the BJP is already ahead of the others in 122 assembly seats in 2021 and the TMC is leading in 163.In terms of vote share in the 2019 polls, the TMC won 43.69 % against 40.64 % secured by the BJP. The CPI(M)’s vote share came down to 6.34 % and the Congress received only 5.67%.The most impressive achievement of the BJP in the last election was its penetration into regions with a substantial tribal presence, such as the districts of Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore and also parts of north Bengal where it managed to win seven of eight Lok Sabha seats.The BJP’s success in north Bengal and the south Bengal districts of Malda, Nadia and Hooghly is seen as a sign of its popularity among Hindus who are either descendants of refugees from Bangladesh or who crossed the border into India to escape religious persecution.The same reason applies to the Dalit Matua community that helped the BJP win the Bongaon Lok Sabha seat in North 24 Parganas district. In the same district, the support of Hindi-speaking people from Bihar and other states helped the saffron camp win the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat as well.Politicians from across the spectrums concede that religion, caste and creed have been never so important in any Bengal election in the past as they are in the upcoming contest.Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “Only a multi-phase polling can stop electoral malpractices we have seen in the past.”CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim also questioned the multi-phase polling. “This was jointly decided by the TMC and the BJP who are partners. How come everybody knew in advance that polls will be held in multiple phases?” Indian Secular Front leader Abbasuddin Siddiqui threw a fresh challenge at Banerjee, saying a member from of his family will contest the Nandigram seat (in East Midnapore district) that she decided to contest after it was vacated by her aide-turned-adversary, BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari.The most important role, poll contenders say, is going to be played by Muslims.According to the 2011 census, Bengal’s population stood at 91.3 million. It was projected to reach 101.9 million in 2021 and around 30% of this population comprises Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/tmc-tries-to-hold-fort-as-bjp-aims-to-gain-ground-101614370477635.html
27-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport’s Terminal 1 likely to be reopened from March 25||The Terminal 1 (T1) of Delhi’s Indira Gandhi international airport will resume domestic flight operations starting March 25, according to officials privy to the development.Airport officials said only a portion of the terminal will be made operational for now, as the ongoing expansion work of the building will continue. For now, the terminal will cater to approximately half the number of flights it handled before the pandemic-induced lockdown.Officials in the know of the matter said the decision to reopen T1 was taken because of the increasing domestic flight operations in the country. Confirming the development, Sachin Badshah, deputy inspector general of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which secures the airport, said a decision had been taken to open T1 starting March 25.“Earlier it was decided that the terminal will be made operational from March 28. However, the date has been preponed to March 25. CISF will have its adequate arrangements as required. Even when the terminal was closed completely, because of the ongoing expansion work, our staff was deployed throughout to secure the facility,” Badshah said.The domestic terminal was shut last year on March 25, two days after international flight operations were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. After two months, as air operations in the country resumed, on May 25, only Terminal 3 was opened. Later, Terminal 2 resumed functioning on October 1. Terminal 1, however, has remained shut due to the ongoing expansion work.Asked about the ongoing expansion work at T1, Delhi airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) refused to comment.An officer from the Delhi airport, who wished not to be named, said the terminal building will start operating at half its capacity and will be open completely in phases as construction work is on in full swing.“Only a portion of the terminal will be made operational now. Other areas are at present under construction. For now, roughly about 150 flights will operate in a day from T1 including both departure and arrivals. Before the Covid-19 lockdown at least 280-300 flights operated in a day from T1. The daily passenger footfall of the T1 before Covid-19 was also 43,000 to 45,000 passengers a day, which is also likely to go down by half due to the restricted flight operations. The operations are limited because of the ongoing expansion and as flights at Delhi airport are also yet to recover completely,” the official said.Currently, IndiGo and GoAir flights are operating from the T2 terminal. Air India, Spice Jet, and Vistara are operating from T3. Another CISF officer said their staff will also be deployed according to the space that will be made available to flyers. “There can be a shortfall in the number of staff deployed if the terminal is opened with a limited capacity. We will ensure complete security of the terminal. Even when the terminal was shut our security arrangements were adequate and no one was allowed to enter the terminal building only after screening,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.T1 caters to domestic flight operations at the Delhi airport. The domestic airlines operating from Delhi airport said they have not been officially conveyed about shifting their operations back to T1. However, some passengers who are booking their tickets for dates after March 25 are being informed that their flights will operate from T1.Dolly Thakur, 35, a private teacher from Delhi, who booked a flight from Delhi to Patna with IndiGo airlines for April 28, said her air ticket mentions that her boarding will be from T1. “I had to reconfirm with the airline and I was told that the flight will operate from T1,” she said.Officials from the airport said that the expansion of T1 will take at least a year and half to be complete and will double the passenger capacity from 20 million to 40 million passengers per annum. “The work will be complete by 2023. Under the current expansion plan the apron area of T1 will be expanded to 6.29 lakh sq metres from 2.82 lakh sq meters. The total area of the terminal (departure and arrival) will be 1.92 lakh sq meters, around three times of the existing 64,000 sq meters,” the officer said, wishing not to be named.The newly developed facility will also ramp up the baggage screening capacity and also introduce boarding bridges at the terminal building to enhance passenger experience and reduce their hassle. “The baggage screening capacity will go up from almost 2,800-3,000 per hour to 5,000-6,000 per hour, almost double. The terminal till now had no boarding bridges but will have 22 when fully revamped,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-s-terminal-1-likely-to-be-reopened-from-march-25-101614370233327.html
27-02-2021||Bangalore||Rahul Dev: The Kannada film industry has grown immensely in the last five years||After kick starting his Kannada film journey in 2004 with Omkara, Rahul Dev went on to do as many as 15 films in the language. The actor says he is amazed to see how much things have changed for the better in the Kannada film industry in the last few years.“I have not worked there in the past five or six years but I have seen the Kannada film industry grow immensely. Look at KGF (2018), it was such a huge hit. It was the first Kannada film to enter the ₹100 crore club. Now KGF 2 is coming and it stars Sanjay Dutt as the main villain, that is just amazing,” says Dev, who has also starred in films such as Soundarya (2007), Bombaat (2008), Yodha (2009)and Abhimanyu (2014).Dev says he would love to get back and do more work in Kannada films. “It is a growing industry. Some very nice and sensitive films have been made in Kannada. I have been mostly part of commercial films over there. They are very quick in making them when I compare to Hindi films. Their economics are different,” he adds.Noting the other changes in the Kannada film industry, the 52-year-old says, “Over the last six years, the overall turnover of the Kannada films have changed humongously.

He added that there may be more students who got treated, but only 28 were admitted to the hospital. Kazal added that the university has requested the civil hospital to depute one or two doctors on campus in case any other student faces any complications. Food supply inspector Harjot Singh said a team had visited the hostel mess and found that the quality of food products was good but there was no cleanliness in the mess. “We have issued a notice to the varsity to clean the mess within two days,” said Singh.Kazal, meanwhile, stated that the mess was managed a students’ committee and that the university has formed a committee headed by dean student welfare (DSW) to probe the matter. PTU vice-chancellor Ajay Kumar Sharma remained incommunicado.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-least-42-students-of-ptu-fall-sick-after-eating-mess-food-hospitalised-101614369483446.html
27-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab likely to rope in 675 private hospitals to push vaccination drive||With the next phase of Covid-19 vaccination set to start from March 1 for senior citizens and those aged above 45 with co-morbidities, the Punjab health department is planning to rope in as many as 675 private hospitals to give the campaign a big push. The healthcare facilities, including 605 private hospitals which are already providing treatment under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme, have been asked to provide the details about the number of vaccination does they can administer on daily basis as per their infrastructure. “The district health officials have received details about their capacity and further modalities will be clear by early next week,” said a senior department functionary. Besides, the government has finalised 60 more private hospitals that are already carrying out Covid-19 testing and are offering treatment to those found infected. In this phase, those aged above 60 can walk in at any government or private hospital registered under the vaccination drive with their identity proof to receive the shot. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said while the vaccination shots will be provided for free at government health facilities, one will have to pay for the same in private healthcare centres at a rate as decided by the central government from time to time. “We are yet to receive the guidelines on this from the Centre. Though nothing is final as of now, it is likely that the private hospitals will be able to charge fee for providing the facilities as one needs half an hour of observation after vaccination,” an official said.Co-morbid patients will have to show prescription The state government is following the NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19) guidelines which state that those aged between 45 and 60 with co-morbidities can take the shots with the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. Health minister Sidhu said that to augment and simplify the process of vaccination registration, the Union ministry of health is coming up with COWIN 2.0 app based on the feedback received during the implementation of the first phase-1 of the vaccination drive. “Senior citizens will be able to register and book an appointment for vaccination using the COWIN 2.0 portal or through other IT applications such as ArogyaSetu etc,” he added. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Unregistered health care workers and frontline workers, who could not receive the vaccine shots in the first phase, can also walk in to get the jabs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-likely-to-rope-in-675-private-hospitals-to-push-vaccination-drive-101614369062598.html
27-02-2021||Other||CCI steps aside in Punjab as private players buy cotton above MSP||With private players beginning to pay cotton farmers up to ₹6, 240/quintal, which is ₹515 above the minimum support price (MSP), the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has stepped aside. According to information available with the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board, of the 35.55 lakh quintal crop sold in various places of the state till February 18, the CCI purchased a record 23.39 lakh quintal on MSP in 2020-21. Private buyers, meanwhile, have bought more than 12 lakh quintal till last week, and almost all of this purchase was at rates higher than the MSP of ₹5,725 per quintal fixed for ‘long staple’ varieties that have a length of 27.5 to 28.5mm.State cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel said an estimated 15-18 lakh quintal cotton is still being held back by farmers who hope for a further increase in rates.“After CCI started buying cotton from October 1 last year, farmers brought about 10 lakh quintal kharif crop to various purchase centres of the cotton-growing belt in south Malwa in the first month. For the same period in 2019, the arrival was 5.71 lakh quintals. CCI made an elaborated arrangement to meet a major surge in arrivals this season,” said Goel.CCI enters the market when rates are below the MSP and the central agency pays cotton growers after meeting the prescribed norms.CCI assistant general manager and Punjab in-charge Neeraj Kumar said the agency paid about ₹1,525 crore to cotton growers through direct payment in 2020-21. CCI is paying farmers since 2019 where the middleman has no role in cotton purchase.“Major purchase was halted across the state from January 5 but CCI continued buying cotton from farmers in small quantities in Muktsar till the end of last month. CCI did not buy cotton stock for over a month as rates in mandis soared and benefited farmers in a big way,” said Kumar.Of nearly 43 lakh quintal cotton production in Punjab in 2019, the CCI had purchased 3.5 lakh bales or 17.5 lakh quintal.But in the ongoing season, CCI’s purchase share at MSP has surged by 33%.Industry sources credit CCI for playing a major role in market stabilisation by purchasing the produce at MSP amid a slump in the yarn sector in 2019 in India and aboard due to a pandemic outbreak. No major case of resentment over delayed payment by the central agency was highlighted by farmers of farm rights groups.Indian Cotton Association Limited president Mahesh Sharda said as there was a major drop in demand for cotton by the industry, CCI made a crucial contribution by purchasing raw cotton at MSP.“In 2020-21 season, CCI prevented distress sale by buying the most stock of the kharif crop. As the global situation strengthened amid the Covid-19 scare, CCI further contributed by selling cotton to Indian and overseas users. CCI has been able to exhaust about 70% of the cotton stock of the last two years to meet the demand by the industry,” said Sharda.In 2019, cotton was sown on 5.01 lakh hectares, the highest in a decade.A progressive farmer like Baldev Singh of Bathinda’s Bajak village said the centre should enhance MSP for cotton and the announcement should come before the month-long sowing season, starting from April 15 to motivate farmers to replace cotton with paddy. “Last year was excellent for cotton and then average yield was 10-12 quintal/acre. The surge in the cost of diesel will have a direct impact on farm expenditures and the centre should increase MSP accordingly. The Punjab government should also motivate farmers to prefer cotton in the semi-arid districts for water conservation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cci-steps-aside-in-punjab-as-private-players-buy-cotton-above-msp-101614368822967.html

The accused, Dhiraj Deepbandhu Jha, had taken ₹1.45 lakh from the complainant on the pretext of securing a job for him abroad. “When Jha failed to find the complainant a job, he pestered the accused to return his money. So the accused lied to him about finding him a job in Dubai and arranged for a tourist visa for the man. He also arranged for a fake Covid-19 test report for the complainant to travel,” said a police officer. As the complainant had not undergone an antigen or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, he found something amiss and approached the police in Mira Road. “The Covid-negative certificate was forged and we are checking the authenticity of the other documents, including the four-day Dubai visa arranged for the victim. On Wednesday, we arrested Jha for cheating and forgery. A court in Thane has remanded him to two-day police custody. We are probing the case further and more arrests are possible as Jha may have duped more people in a similar manner,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agent-held-for-issuing-fake-covid-19-report-to-job-seeker-near-mumbai-101614368042429.html

In the past one week, Mumbai has seen a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases reported daily. This is the third time this month that Mumbai has reported over 1,000 cases in a single day. On Friday, Mumbai reported 1,035 cases and three deaths, taking the tally to 323,879 and toll to 11,466. On Wednesday, Mumbai reported 1,167 Covid-19 cases, while on Thursday, it reported 1,145 fresh cases. Before this, the city had recorded over 1,000 cases in November. There are 7,899 active cases in the city at present.However, despite the surge in the cases, the daily positivity rate is painting a hopeful picture for Mumbai. Positivity rate is the total number of cases tested positive for Covid-19 against the total tests done.Over the past one week, Mumbai has reported a daily positivity rate between 3% and 6%, even as the overall positivity rate in the city stands at 10%. So far, Mumbai has conducted 3,230,798 tests, and has a total of 323,879 Covid-19 positive cases. The average positivity rate in February till Friday is 4% against the 3.98% recorded in the entire month of January.“We’ve been tracking the positivity rate. Despite the high number of tests, the number of infected patients is under control. This is a good sign,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is in-charge of the public health department, said earlier this week. Mumbai’s average positivity rate peaked at 37% in June 2020, according to information from BMC. At the time, the civic body was conducting an average of 4,000-5,000 tests per day.On Thursday, BMC conducted 22,113 tests, of which Mumbai’s daily positivity rate was 4.6%. Similarly on Wednesday, BMC conducted 23,315 Covid-19 tests and the daily positivity rate was 4.9%. However, these are approximate figures, said a senior civic official. “When BMC issues an official statement on the number of Covid-19 cases reported on any day, they are the new infections. However, when we calculate the positivity rate, we also take into account those who are testing positive for a second time, as part of the mandatory test required to be done before discharging a patient from a hospital,” said the official.If the second test result also comes positive, the patient’s details are updated on Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal, but it is not counted as a fresh infection by the civic body for the day. Hence, BMC takes into account a difference of approximately 1% while calculating the daily positivity rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cases-rise-but-mumbai-s-covid-positivity-rate-still-at-35-101614367802686.html

27-02-2021||Mumbai||‘1 year after Dombivli MIDC road turned pink, no drop in pollution’||A year after a road in Dombivli Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) turned pink, there is still no change in the pollution situation in this area, reveals a study by NGO Vanshakti.As per the reports of the water samples collected and tested from various drains in MIDC by the MPCB, the water appears to be in different colours – blackish, light brown and light green. The NGO also claimed that the water had a stench of ammonia and sulphuric acid.Vanshakti visited several locations in Dombivli MIDC on February 9 and also raised a complaint to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Kalyan division, regarding rampant pollution caused by the industries in the region.Stalin D, director, Vanshakti, said, “The pollution situation has not changed in the MIDC area of Dombivli as the drains have bad odour, which affects the air in the nearby areas. The drain water also has different colours. If this situation continues, it will be difficult to even pass through Dombivli MIDC.”Last year, a road along the storm water drain near tempo naka, phase 2 of Dombivli MIDC turned pink, after the silt cleaned from the drain spilled on the road during transportation.Activists and residents claimed chemical effluents in silt have turned the road to pink colour. This also got the attention of CM Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the road and directed the factory owners to follow norms or shut the units.The MIDC claimed that the work on storm water drains, which is one cause of pollution in the area, was supposed to be completed in May 2020, though is extended to 2022.Sanjay Nanaware, executive engineer of Dombivli MIDC, said,” The work is expected to be completed by next year. Half the work is over and the remaining half is being undertaken.”The MIDC took up the work of storm water drains in May 2019, 32 years after it set up a base there. The MIDC is spending ₹22Cr, in which it will cover around 35km-40km storm water drain line, which passes through most of the roads in Dombivli MIDC region.An officer from MPCB, who did not wish to be named, said,” We have collected the samples from the drains. It is true that the water changes colour while there is a stench in the air. This is due to the on-going work on the storm water drain. However, the pH level recorded is between 5 and 8, which is not dangerous. We have asked the authorities to speed up the work.”Action plan still a distant dream An action plan was prepared on November 11 last year followed by the directions from the Supreme Court on November 5.The action plan emphasised on several steps that were asked to be completed within a span of two to seven months. These included setting up vigilance teams of officials of MPCB, MIDC and local civic bodies, installation of pH sensor-based alarm system at major hotspots, CCTV by MIDC at hotspots, to conduct regular surprise visits and penal action, effluent conveyance pipeline network by MIDC, installation of GPS tracking system for tankers, MIDC to monitor tanker movement, impose blanket ban on tanker movements between 6pm and 6am, and MPCB to conduct periodic audits of factories. The action plan includes 25 points that were supposed to be adhered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1-year-after-dombivli-midc-road-turned-pink-no-drop-in-pollution-101614366182028.html

Lotus Lake adjacent to Amra Marg Road, which connects Uran Phata to Palm Beach Road, has been wearing an unpleasant look for a few months. The plot adjoining the lake is beautified by Cidco, who, however, deny any dumping in the lake.KP Sherif, 62, a resident of Sector 27, said, “Lotus Lake is next to our society building and has been declared as wetland in Navi Mumbai. Wetlands are highly sensitive and protected areas. Any violation or interference is subjected to stringent provisions of law. We are fortunate that we are residing in the vicinity of this natural phenomenon. Till last year, it flourished with lotus and other plants. Cidco has always remained negligent, though its duty is to protect the lake. During the lockdown, this wetland has severely been affected by encroachments and dumping of debris.”Land-levelling work has been undertaken at one end of the debris while heaps are dumped on the other side. Encroachments by hutments is another issue here.Meanwhile, Saluja Sutar, ex-corporator of the area, said, “The work going on has affected the natural habitat and is hazardous for the lake. There is no fencing done to protect the lake. We demanded that the lake area be under us for developing a garden around it. If Cidco doesn’t cater to this need, we will consider protesting for the same in future.”Meanwhile, the Cidco PRO said, “The work of levelling the plot near the lake is in progress. During this work, however, all the technical norms are being followed and the lake is not harmed in any way. We would be looking into the debris dumping issue and will have a watchman stationed, if needed, to make sure no illegal dumping happens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-residents-complain-of-illegal-dumping-of-debris-at-lotus-lake-101614365881313.html

They kept the body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The UP police, in its status report, have stated that no FIR has been registered by it in connection with the death as claimed by the petitioner.“It is further submitted that the videography of the post-mortem or original X-Ray plates — which are medico-legal documents — cannot be given to the family of the deceased by the medical department,” it has said in its report.The petition, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of the young farmer.The high court on Friday listed the matter for further hearing on March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-gunshot-wounds-on-man-who-died-during-r-day-delhi-up-cops-tell-delhi-hc-101614365656414.html

He also inaugurated a water mill built by the NGO in Dehradun on its premisesCarbon credits are part of national and international attempts to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases. According to experts, carbon credit means any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of different greenhouse gas. One carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide, or carbon dioxide equivalent gases.Uttarakhand government has been seeking Green Bonus as compensation for the conservation of its forests by not expanding the industrial development by chopping forests.Kumar also laid stress on focusing equally on ecology and economy, saying that they go side by side. He said without ecology, the economy cannot go a long way.Anil Joshi, 'founder of HESCO, said in his presentation that the slogan of 'Atma nirbhar Bharat' or 'self-reliant India' matches with their core philosophy that local needs of people should be met locally. “Prosperity of Bharat cannot be ensured without taking villages and their local economy into account,” he said.Talking about the importance of water mills in local Himalayan ecology, Joshi said it is one of the most easily accessible traditional forms of hydropower, which was earlier used for grinding wheat.“Now with advances in technology, watermills can be developed to generate power for villages in the upper reaches of the Himalayas. One watermill has the capacity of generating two to five kilowatts of power. We should have a Himalayan network of all the streams which can be tapped to generate power,” he said Joshi.The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda, promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system, and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment, according to the UNEP website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/for-green-bonus-compensation-uttarakhand-should-request-unep-niti-aayog-vc-101614365031533.html

The panel has indicated that there were no financial irregularities as alleged by an activist.The report also highlighted that it was a faulty registration procedure that led to the addition of some people to the ICMR website even as no Covid tests were conducted on them.A city-based activist, in November, had alleged that some testing laboratories under the NMMC would seek details of the family members of a person visiting the Covid-19 testing centre and then would prepare fake negative reports in their names to show that tests were conducted on all of them in order to claim funding for each test.Following media reports on the activist’s allegation, the civic chief set up an inquiry committee to probe the allegation. The committee submitted an 11,591 page report to the municipal commission on Thursday.As per the report, the committee reached out to around 1,51,956 citizens who had reportedly undergone either antigen or RT-PCR test for Covid-19 between July 16 and November 30, 2020. The committee had interacted with them through a dedicated call centre and asked those people whether they had actually undergone the tests. Of the 1,51,965 citizens, 1,50,359 admitted to have undergone the tests. However, 1,597 citizens said they did not go for any test.Likewise, the committee made another verification by physically visiting a total of 1,845 citizens’ home. Of these, they found that 1,843 had gone for the tests and the remaining two did not.“After checking all the documents the committee came to the conclusion that 7,872 additional entries were made on the ICMR website that was a result of faulty registration procedures,” said an official from the public relation department.“The committee also checked the inventory of antigen test kits. The civic body had bought a total of 2,40,000 kits of which 2,13,604 kits were used while 4,717 were found defective. And, a total of 21,679 kits were available in the inventory. Thus, by recording statements of nodal officers, doctors, and other staff the committee concluded that there were no financial irregularities in the testing of Covid-19” he added.Despite repeated attempts, the NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, remained unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-financial-irregularities-in-covid-testing-navi-mumbai-civic-body-panel-report-101614365701601.html

Earlier, 2019 had witnessed two major fires at industrial units in Dera Bassi, which left 18 workers injured. A factory on the Barwala road in Dera Bassi was gutted in December last year too. “We could not act earlier due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of the pandemic, but now we will be acting tough. We have asked the violators to get the NOC or we will be sealing their building after 15 days as per the fire Act. We will not compromise with fire safety,” said MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg. In the survey report last year, the fire department had identified various properties that did not comply with fire-safety norms. The violations included presence of only a single entry and exit point, which could be dangerous in an emergency.Fire extinguishers were missing on many floors and did not have ISI mark.

27-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Channel Bandh agitation called off after 7 hours||The JNPT project-affected fishing community, on Friday, conducted a Channel Bandh agitation, blocking ship movement at the country’s largest container port for seven hours. This was in support of their 36-year-long pending issue of resettling the displaced families of erstwhile Sheva village.The agitation was called off in the afternoon following the intervention of Raigad MP Sunil Tatkare, who personally promised to resolve the issue in four-five days.“JNPT deputy chairman, Umesh Wagh, spoke to the agitators and assured that an amicable solution will be found. Wagh promised that a high-level meeting will be held next Thursday,” Dilip Koli of Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti said.He added, “The CM and deputy CM had given orders after our previous protests and yet JNPT has not done the needful. In 1986, the government had decided to allot us a 17-acre land for the 256 displaced families and we are asking exactly the same and nothing more.”Parmanand Koli, one of the displaced families from Hanuman Koliwada, said, “On Thursday, Raigad collector, Nidhi Chaudhary, wrote to JNPT asking to allot the land immediately to us and we are still waiting.”The agitation was originally planned on Republic Day but was put off to February 26 with the intervention of the police who promised to have the issue resolved, said Suresh Damodar Koli, head of Hanuman Koliwada Village Reforms Committee.The Sheva families have been relegated to transit camp at Hanuman Koliwada for 14 years. The original plan of 1986 was to allot 17 hectares at Bori Pakhadi at Uran city, which is now a wetland with mangroves growing.Two villages – Nhava and Sheva – were acquired originally for the creation of Nhava Sheva Port Trust, which has been later renamed as JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust). By Friday evening JNPT issued a statement which said, “JNPT has paid the entire cost towards compensation for acquiring the land and also the cost of rehabilitation to the Government of Maharashtra for resettlement of the residents of the village Hanuman Koliwada.”JNPT said that it had fulfilled its commitments and that the state government had to take further action in the matter. It has written to the state government on the issue of second rehabilitation of village Hanuman Koliwada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-channel-bandh-agitation-called-off-after-7-hours-101614365402745.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 8,333 new Covid cases; city records 1,035 new infections||Even as Maharashtra and Mumbai witnessed a slight drop in cases on Friday, compared to the past two days, the state is urging citizens to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent another lockdown, which could hurt the state economy badly. The state logged 8,333 new cases, taking its tally to 2,138,154, while Mumbai’s tally touched 323,879 with 1,035 new cases. The state clocked more than 8,700 cases, while Mumbai saw more than 1,100 cases over the past two days. Pune and Nashik cities saw a slight reduction with 765 and 220 case, respectively, while Amravati and Nagpur cities witnessed a jump in cases and reported 720 and 881 cases. CM Uddhav Thackeray during his meetings earlier this week with local administrations, had made it clear to strictly adhere to Covid-19 protocol to avoid a second lockdown. The municipal corporations and district collectors have restricted crowding at weddings, weekly markets and have started penalizing heavily for not wearing masks at public places. Although the CM announced last Sunday that he would take a review in the next few days to decide on lockdown, the state government is expected to defer the decision for a few more days. “We have been strictly monitoring the situation at district levels to ensure the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the pandemic is implemented rigorously, so that there is no need for a lockdown. The district administrations have been taking action for violations related to crowding and social distancing which are key to arrest the spread. The district administrations have been empowered to impose restrictions at their level. Many of them have imposed local restrictions, results are expected in the next few days,” said Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary. After an upsurge in a few Vidarbha districts like Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim, the local administration has imposed restrictions. A seven-day lockdown in Amravati city and Achalpur town started Monday evening, while other districts have restricted shop and establishment timings. Marathwada districts, including Parbhani, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur, have imposed a night curfew and restriction on the travellers coming from the affected Vidarbha districts. Schools and colleges in all these districts have been closed for few weeks. “Weddings and market places have been super spreaders in Vidarbha districts. We have restricted the crowding at these places. Tracing of contacts has been increased to 20 persons per infection and testing has been increased multifold. We expect the spread in five Vidarbha districts (Amravati, Akola, Washim, Buldhana, Yavatmal) to be arrested at the earliest,” said Gajendra Bawane, deputy commissioner, Amravati division. In Aurangabad, divisional commissioner, who heads the administration of six districts in Central Maharashtra, has directed to keep their certain beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. The commissioner has also directed industrial units in Waluj and Chihkalthana industrial areas to take due precautions to ensure their employees do not spread the infection. “We have doubled the testing in the past two weeks, while process of ramping up of oxygen stock and number of beds has started. We are starting at least one Covid care centre per tehsil,” said Jagdish Miniyar, deputy commissioner, Aurangabad division. Meanwhile, the state’s positivity rate went up to 9.69% on Friday, from 9.36% a week ago on February 19. However, it has witnessed reduction in the past two days after recording 10.89% on February 24, which was the highest daily rate in the past few weeks. With 48 new deaths, the state’s toll stands at 52,041 and the case fatality rate at 2.43%. The turnout for the vaccination drive improved as Friday recorded inoculation of 58,809 beneficiaries at 826 vaccination centers. At 71.19%, this has been highest ever one day turnout since the drive started on January 16. Of the total 1201096 doses given to health care and frontline workers, 661200 HCWs have taken their first dose while 158681 have taken their second shot.3,81,215 FLWs have taken their first jab. Maharashtra has 10,27,484 HCWs and 8,02,137 FLWs registered for the vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-8-333-new-covid-cases-city-records-1-035-new-infections-101614365401197.html

27-02-2021||Mumbai||Thane: Restaurants, eateries upset over losses due to strict Covid protocols||Following the recent action by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), hotel and other eatery owners are upset as they are incurring losses due to the permitted 50 per cent seating capacity and similar Covid protocols.Moreover, the crowd at streetside food joints and tea stalls continue as no action is being taken. The TMC claims that they are vigilant towards both hotels and roadside eateries and those flouting social distancing rules are either fined or served notice.Raghunath Rai, secretary, Thane Hotels Association, said, “The lockdown has impacted our business a lot. We have faced huge losses. The rentals are also high. Now, we have to follow the 50 per cent seating only rule. Even in that, hardly 40 per cent people visit hotels or opt for take-aways. Many have reduced the number of staff. We are not able to maintain the business as well as it was earlier.”Since the sudden spike in the number of cases recently, TMC has increased its vigilance and sealed a few restaurants and bars this week. “We keep an eye on all food joints and establishments. Everyone has to strictly follow protocols. This week, we have sealed 10 hotels, bars and one wine shop for crowding. People also prefer streetside eateries or food joints. If we find anyone flouting rules, such establishments will also be sealed immediately,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.Just like hotel owners who are upset with the losses incurred, small-time eateries and street food joints are also struggling to make ends meet. “As fewer people move out, unlike before, there is hardly any business. Earlier, people used to gather at tea stalls and have small conversations during evening hours over tea. Nowadays, hardly anyone turns up and even if they do, most come alone. This has been affecting business,” said Lakkhan Trivedi, a tea stall owner near Panchpakhadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-restaurants-eateries-upset-over-losses-due-to-strict-covid-protocols-101614365102700.html

He said although he had earlier directed to normalise OPDs at all medical institutions, the heads concerned can take in-house decision regarding the number of patients and other precautions to be taken.Meanwhile, MC commissioner KK Yadav said that presently apni mandis do not pose much risk, necessitating their closure, and precautions have been taken. Next phase of vaccination from March 1The next phase of vaccination is due for the people above 60 years of age and those aged from 45 years to 59 years and having comorbidities, said Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, adding that the number of vaccination sites will be increased from the existing 13.

27-02-2021||Mumbai||Sanjay Rathod’s future uncertain; BJP may disrupt Maharashtra session||While speculation remains about whether Shiv Sena leader and forest minister Sanjay Rathod will resign before the state legislature’s budget session begins on March 1, the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] has threatened to disrupt the session’s proceedings unless Rathod is dropped from the state Cabinet. The Opposition has alleged a suicide case is not being investigated thoroughly because the deceased was involved with Rathod. Sources in Shiv Sena said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is irked by the links to the suicide case and the show of strength staged by Rathod in Washim earlier this week. Rathod may be asked to step down to minimise damage to the Shiv Sena’s image despite him being an influential leader from the Banjara community, which has a strong presence in parts of Vidarbha. BJP has raised questions about Rathod’s relationship with a 23-year-old woman who died by suicide in Pune on February 8. BJP leader Chitra Wagh said, “The deceased girl’s mobile display showed that there were 45 missed calls from Sanjay Rathod.” Opposition party BJP has already threatened to not allow the budget session of the state Assembly to proceed if Rathod remains in the state Cabinet. “Rathod has to resign or else we will not allow the budget session to function,” said BJP leader Pravin Darekar, who is also the leader of Opposition in the legislative council. The deceased was well known on the social media platform TikTok and did not leave a suicide note. The police have registered a case of accidental death and ruled out foul play. BJP has claimed that a series viral audio clips are of Rathod in conversation with the 23-year-old and alleged the suicide case is not being investigated thoroughly. The parents of the deceased have not filed any complaint with the police so far and have appealed that the 23-year-old not be vilified. “People have to stop vilifying the name of my daughter. I will be forced to either commit suicide or I will lodge police complaints against them,” said her father. Thackeray is said to have been irked by Rathod because Rathod disappeared for 15 days after the suicide. Also, Rathod staged a show of strength at Washim, where thousands of his supporters gathered, violating the Covid-19 restrictions. Additionally, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is believed to have conveyed to Thackeray that Rathod may be spoiling MVA’s image.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sanjay-rathod-s-future-uncertain-bjp-may-disrupt-maharashtra-session-101614364921234.html
27-02-2021||Kolkata||TMC cries foul on Bengal poll announcement, others are 'happy and prepared'||Most political parties in West Bengal welcomed the announcement of eight-phase election schedule for Assembly polls in the state starting from March 27. The ruling Trinamool Congress, however, gave a bitter reaction and asked the Election Commission why the polls could not be held in fewer phases as in Assam and other states.TMC MP, Saugata Roy, said, “We are not happy. If polls can be held in Tamil Nadu in one phase and Assam in three phases there was no need to hold polls in eight phases in West Bengal. The law and order situation is not that bad. It is the opposition and the BJP in particular which is spreading this propaganda. We don’t understand on what ground the ECI decided to hold polls in so many phases. If elections are held for more than a month then people would face harassment as no work would take place. This is an injustice to Bengal.”Also read: 'Together in fight against pandemic' - PM Modi thanks WHO chief on Covax deliveryBJP state vice president Jay Prakash Narayan welcomes the move. “We are all prepared. In 2016, elections were held in seven phases. Even though there were six phases, the first phase was broken up into two parts. So it is not a big jump. The ECI took into consideration the ground reality of the state, hence two police observers have been deployed. We are expecting a peaceful poll this time.”Leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said, “the law and order situation in West Bengal has touched the rock bottom. We apprehended massive violence in the run-up to the polls and on the election days. We are happy that polls would be held in eight phases. People should be allowed to cast their votes freely without any fear.”CPIM leader Sujan Chakraborty said, “Seven phases or eight isn't a factor. Several other factors come into play. The ECI should take actions so that free and fair elections are held. We just want that people should be able to cast their votes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-cries-foul-on-bengal-poll-announcement-others-are-happy-and-prepared-101614364631482.html
27-02-2021||Mumbai||Transfer MSC Bank scam case to CBI: Petition in Bombay HC||A petition has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking transfer of the investigation into the alleged Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank scam from Maharashtra Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The petition was filed the activist who lodged the complaint in the MSC Bank scam. The petitioner has alleged that the closure report filed by EOW giving a clean chit to the then finance minister Ajit Pawar and 75 directors of the district banks was questionable as it was based on the statement of managing director Ajit Deshmukh, who was also named in the alleged scam. The petitioner claimed that though there was enough evidence and statements of other authorities confirming the scam, Deshmukh had given a statement that the banks had recovered the alleged losses and the offences were of civil nature, based on which the C-summary report (closure report) was filed by EOW last year. EOW had started the probe after receiving directions from the Bombay HC in 2018 while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist Surinder Arora. The petition, filed by Arora and Manik Jadhav through advocate Satish Talekar, has alleged that the closure report filed by the investigating officer of EOW before the sessions court last year has recorded statements of directors who are accused in the case and incorporated Deshmukh’s statement in verbatim, which clearly show that the cyclostyle statements were prepared with common design and agenda by the investigating agency in collusion with the accused. The petition challenged the closure report and alleged that Deshmukh was not the managing director of MSC Bank at the time when illegal loans were sanctioned or Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana (SSKs) were illegally sold to politicians at throw-away prices. It added that all the documents placed on record by EOW are those referred to by Deshmukh. Referring the lapses in the EOW investigation, the petition states that the serious findings of misappropriation and mismanagement recorded in the NABARD inspection report, Joshi and Nair report, inquiry under section 83 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, charge sheet issued under section 88 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act were given a go-by, holding that the bank managed to recover the losses. The petitioners opposed the C-summary report, wherein EOW had filed an intervention plea in the proceedings, on the grounds that it was a ‘serious economic case and required thorough investigation. Stressing on the need to transfer the probe to CBI, the petition stated, “The petitioners have strong apprehensions that the cause raised by them shall be nipped in the bud due to the political clout of the accused whereas no fair investigation shall be carried out in the matter. Since the accused persons are people in power, there is no likelihood that the investigation shall be at any point of time completed fairly. The conduct of the EOW right from the very beginning in stating that no cognisable offences have been made out till filing of C-summary report itself warrants investigation by an independent agency in order to ensure fair trial of the proceedings.” Due to paucity of time on Friday, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale could not hear the petition. The bench is likely to take it up on Monday, March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/transfer-msc-bank-scam-case-to-cbi-petition-in-bombay-hc-101614364741369.html

The civic body audits inflated bills above ₹1.5 lakh.Dr Ashish Bharati, chief, health department, PMC, said that some private hospitals have given inflated bills to patients. “Some private hospitals have repeatedly overcharged patients for Covid treatment. And after checking the bills, it was found that over ₹2 crore were overcharged from patients,” said Dr Bharati.He added that some private hospitals have overcharged up to Rs7 lakh.“Now that the cases are increasing, we are hoping that more patients approach us if their hospital bills are over ₹1.5 lakh,” said Dr Bharati. He added that several notices have been issued to such hospitals.PMC has evaluated up to ₹16,76,66,879 bills and refunded ₹2,86,86,926 to the patients and ₹13,89,79,953 were retained by hospitals, according to officials.Dr Abhijit More, Jan Aarogya Manch and a city-based health expert, said that the step taken by PMC shows the malpractices of the medical fraternity.“It is evident from the bill collection that fee capping should be done by hospitals to ensure that medical facilities do not drain out the savings of the common man. Also, this practice of bill audit should continue in the future as well as we are experiencing a spike in Covid cases,” he said.”Patients should be made aware so that they can approach PMC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-corrects-inflated-bills-refunds-rs-2-86-cr-to-covid-patients-101614356218913.html

Also, for beneficiaries who cannot access the application, there will be on-site registration.Along with government hospitals, private healthcare facilities will also be giving jabs to senior citizens and beneficiaries with comorbidities.A compulsory medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner will be needed by those beneficiaries whose age group is between 45 to 59 years and who have comorbidities.Dr Dilip Patil, state immunization officer, said government hospitals will be giving the jabs for free.“Government and hospitals empanelled for health schemes which can be visited by the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) patients will be giving the jabs for free. Whereas, the Centre has decided that the private hospitals can charge for the vaccine and other facilities provided by them to the beneficiaries,” said Patil.He said that the Centre has as of now not clarified the cost of the vaccine that private hospitals can charge.“We will start the training of government and private hospital staff. More details of the same will be shared by the Centre soon,” said Patil.“The application can be downloaded through Google just like other apps. For beneficiaries above the age of 60 years, the registration will require any photo ID like an Aadhar card, voter ID card, among others. And for beneficiaries between the age of 45 to 59 with comorbidities, along with photo IDs, they will have to provide a medical certificate required from a registered practitioner in the given format,” said Patil.“The format for the medical certificate will be given by the central government soon. There is a list of 20 comorbidities issued by the central government which will include various diseases and the beneficiaries should have one of them,” said Dr Patil.“After registering, the medical certificate has to be shown at the vaccination site. Taking into account that a few senior citizens cannot register by themselves, there will be on-site registration with required documents,” he said.”Through one phone number, four people can be registered in the third phase of vaccination. So youngsters can help the elderly in getting them registered for the vaccination,” said Patil.“After the registration, slots and timing will be allotted to the citizens at the nearby vaccination centre where they can take the jab,” said Dr Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seniors-persons-45-yrs-and-above-with-comorbidities-can-register-on-co-win-app-from-march-1-101614352738644.html

The survey was conducted between March 22, 2020, and June 30, 2020, when the first lockdown was imposed.All the surgeons gave their feedback by maintaining anonymity.The findings revealed that most of the surgeons were willing to operate on confirmed Covid patients, were taking physical consultation every day, and the eagerness to make the rounds of the patients remained almost the same during the said period.Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, surgical oncologist, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We wanted to see how surgeons look at providing healthcare services during the pandemic. The questionnaire proved that most of the surgeons were willing to take the risk to treat their patients despite the higher risk to their safety.”“The reason why this kind of survey was done is, there was a lot of criticism initially that doctors are not ready to provide care to the patients. We expected that surgeons will be willing to treat their patients and the survey results proved that we were right. We also wanted to evaluate how doctors face a pandemic,” he said.The hospital was located in Covid containment zones and had many of its staff including nurses residing in the containment zones. However, with proper precautions in place, the hospital was able to conduct necessary oncology surgeries and was also successful in avoiding any major complications.Out of the 118 surgeries performed by the hospital during the said period, minor complications were seen in 18 cases including, 12 Clavien–Dindo grade I or II complications, six grade III complications requiring some form of intervention. There were no grade IV or V complications. A cancer’s grade describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope when compared to healthy cells.There were eight wound infections, three of which required dressings, three required changing antibiotics, and two required operative debridement of the wound. Also, three patients had postoperative delayed gastric emptying, one of which was due to sepsis and required a change of antibiotics.Two patients were found to be Covid positive before the operation and hence their procedures were postponed. One of them had a chemo port inserted four weeks later while the other patient had an ovarian cytoreduction done five weeks later.Cancer patients have a higher chance of developing Covid infection due to their depressed immune system as seen in China, said the survey.The survey reveals that the majority of the specialist preferred the open surgery approach, delayed non-emergency surgeries, and used palliative strategies for advanced malignancy.The survey also found that majority of the respondents had a decreased income from their surgical practice, and almost half of them said that they would want to change their financial strategies. The survey highlighted that the time spent with family increased significantly and it made the family members quite happy. But almost an equal number of surgeons were unhappy to spend time at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oncologists-willing-to-operate-on-covid-patients-survey-finds-101614350698610.html

The project recently got a nod from Nitin Gadkari, union minister for road and transport.The flyover project is slated to be completed in two years. Once complete, it will supplement the six-lane Katraj-Navale bridge stretch, work for which is currently underway.In August 2019, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had proposed to build a flyover at Katraj junction to resolve the traffic woes in the area. As the civic body could not take up the work due to a shortage of funds, NHAI decided to fund it. While on a visit to Pune recently, Gadkari had confirmed the work on the flyover at Katraj will begin in a month.“The total length of the flyover is 1,326 metres, while the width is 24.20 metres. The cost of the project will be ₹170 crore and tenders are called for the same which will undergo technical scrutiny,” said Dhananjay Deshpande, executive engineer, National Highway Public Works Department.“This flyover will decongest two junctions, viz Katraj chowk and area near Rajas Society,” he added.The authorities were waiting to get a nod from the central zoo authority for land acquisition as part of the flyover passes over the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Centre. The central zoo authorities have suggested a few changes to the proposal.Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Katraj Zoo, said, “We have given approximately 8,000 square metres of land in the southern periphery of the zoo.”“We have proposed adequate measures to minimise the noise pollution so that the animals are not affected. This can be done by constructing an anti-crash barrier which should be 1.1 or 2.5 metres in height,” he said.Deshpande confirmed that a noise barrier will be installed to protect animals from the vehicular sound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nhai-invites-bids-for-katraj-flyover-project-101614340739450.html
