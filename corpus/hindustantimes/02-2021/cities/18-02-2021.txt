Later this month, five municipal wards in the city will go polls. Full elections to the three corporations will be held next year.“People in Delhi are fed up with BJP’s corruption. That is also one reason why people who want to work for the people are leaving the party and joining the AAP. They believe that the AAP has a vision and we have proved that through our work in welfare and governance,” said the AAP’s municipal affairs in charge Durgesh Pathak, at a press conference in the party’s office in central Delhi on Thursday.In the conference, Pathak announced the induction of Rekha Dixit, the councillor of Anarkali ward in east Delhi, and Shravan Dixit, who was the BJP’s district general secretary in Shahdara.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These allegations are baseless. If Mr Pathak feels that BJP councillors are corrupt, why is he welcoming them now? Few people who have failed in their duties as councillors and senior office bearers, and have learnt that they are not going to be given tickets for the next polls at any cost, are leaving the party and it is surprising that the AAP is happily welcoming them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-councillor-local-office-bearer-joins-aap-101613672265709.html

18-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ rail roko agitation has minimal impact, passes off peacefully||While farmers demanding the repeal of agriculture laws declared their four-hour rail blockade on Thursday a success, railway officials said it had “negligible impact” on train services. Delhi remained largely unaffected by the agitation.Farmers of Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka staged sit-in protests on the railway tracks in these states, while demanding the repeal of the three farm laws.“Trains were stopped from 12 noon to 4pm at hundreds of locations across the country as part of the rail roko agitation under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). It was a peaceful and successful event,” SKM leader Jagmohan Singh said. He added that by engaging in the programme, people had shown that they “opposed the attitude of the central government towards the farmers’ movement”.The farmers had announced the four-hour rail roko as part of their efforts to scale up the agitation against the three contentious farm laws. “We had given the call for the rail roko agitation to be held outside Delhi,” said Harinder Singh, media coordinator at SKM. “Anger among farmers is intensifying and the central government will have to repeal the laws,” SKM said in a statement on Thursday. Farmer leaders also visited various spots on Thursday and appealed to people to “come to the Delhi borders to strengthen the movement.”Train movement in all zones was normal by Thursday evening. “The rail roko agitation passed off without any untoward incident. There was negligible or minimal impact on the running of trains across the country. A majority of the zones reported not a single case of any stoppage of train by the agitators,” the ADG (PR) of the Railway Board said in a statement.“A few trains were stopped in some areas, but train operations was normal by evening. While dealing with the rail roko agitation, utmost patience was exercised by all concerned,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-rail-roko-agitation-has-minimal-impact-passes-off-peacefully-101613672263584.html

The general body of the PMC announced the 15 per cent rebate in property tax in the next financial year, 2021-22. Recently, PMC had an amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters and gave an 80 per cent waiver of the fine. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “As the PMC had given the benefit for defaulters, there was a demand to give some relief for the honest taxpayers who are paying tax regularly. Already, PMC is giving a 10 per cent and five per cent rebate if general tax is paid in the first two months of the financial year.”Rasne said, “Now as per the new scheme, all the honest taxpayers who used to pay tax regularly will get 15 per cent tax rebate directly. This scheme is only for residential properties.”The general body of the PMC on Thursday rejected the a 11 percent hike in the property tax proposed by municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, while presenting the draft budget.All parties rejected the tax hike in the online general body meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-gives-15-rebate-to-regular-property-taxpayers-101613672263049.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Court pulls up police over delayed filing of charge sheets||Upset that the charge sheet in a particular case was delayed by more than a year and a half, a Delhi court has directed assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) of the south-east district to furnish details of all charge sheets that were filed over the past three years.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACCM) Arvind Bansal directed the ACPs to prepare a list of all charge sheets between 2018 and ­2020 while also asking them to seek the status of filing from the IOs concerned.“This exercise would definitely unearth many “hidden ghosts (files)” and wake up many “souls (IOs)” from slumber,” the judge said. The court also asked the deputy commissioner of police (south-east district) to file a compliance report in this regard.The case pertains to the alleged rash and negligent driving by a person, Ravi Yadav, in 2017 on the Modi Mill Flyover. According to the complaint by Lallu Ram Morya, Yadav had rammed his motorcycle leading to Maurya sustaining injuries.The IO had not submitted the charge sheet before the court till January 2021, even though the file was cleared by the ACP concerned in October 2018.While noting that the IO retained the charge sheet for “reasons best known to him”, Bansal said the filing of the charge sheet was done only when an application was moved by one of the parties. “The retaining of “forwarded” files by IOs... may further result in the accused fleeing from justice and witnesses disappearing or losing interest in the case. It creates an overall disappointing scenario for all stakeholders. It is felt that a time period for filing forwarded charge sheets must be fixed and IOs must be asked to strictly comply with the same. Such time (frame) should not be more than 30 days from the date of forwarding of charge sheet by the ACP concerned,” he further said. The court said the IOs need to understand that investigation of all summon cases generally needs to be concluded within six months of the accused being arrested, and failure may result in the magistrate stopping further investigation into the case.“...most IOs are not aware of this provision and therefore, continue investigation even after the initial period of six months….It is incumbent upon DCP concerned that this provision is reminded to IOs,” the judge said in his order of February 16..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-pulls-up-police-over-delayed-filing-of-charge-sheets-101613672205876.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Woman kills husband for stopping her from sending money to son||Angry with her husband for not allowing her to send a monthly allowance to her five-year-old son from her previous marriage, a 24-year-old woman strangled him to death at their home in south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri on Monday, the police said.After killing 25-year-old Om Prakash Kumar, the woman, identified only by her first name Sunita, took his body to Safdarjung Hospital saying that he had suddenly collapsed and died of natural causes, the police said. “But the post-mortem revealed ligature marks on the neck of the dead man, pointing to murder. When we questioned his wife, she confessed to killing him,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south).Kumar lived with Sunita in a rented house in Fatehpur Beri. While Kumar was unemployed, Sunita worked at banquet halls in the city.They had married early last year following the death of Sunita’s first husband. “Sunita has a five-year-old son from her first marriage. The boy lives with his grandmother in Bihar and Sunita would send him a monthly allowance of ₹5,000,” said the DCP.Kumar objected to this and that lead to frequent quarrels between the couple, the officer said.On Monday morning, during one such quarrel, Sunita allegedly strangled her husband with a dupatta, the officer said, adding that she then raised the alarm and informed neighbours that he had suddenly collapsed.Kumar was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital from where the police received a call. Once the autopsy report revealed that Kumar was murdered, the police focused their attention on Sunita.“The woman’s interrogation led to her revealing that she had killed him. We have arrested her,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-kills-husband-for-stopping-her-from-sending-money-to-son-101613672144479.html
18-02-2021||Other||Sion hospital doctor, associate arrested in second cheating case||manish.pathak@htlive.comMumbai Sion police have again arrested Dr Rakesh Verma, the assistant dean of the Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital at Sion, and his associate Rajesh Guha, in connection with a second cheating case lodged against him. The two men are accused of taking ₹18.50 lakh from a Hyderabad-based doctor for allegedly securing a postgraduate (PG) medical seat for him.The third accused, Pankaj Dubey, who allegedly approached the complainant and took ₹15 lakh as advance, is on the run.“Both the accused were in judicial custody, and after the second FIR (first information report) was registered against them, we made the arrests again on Tuesday. They were produced in the court and remanded in police custody till Saturday,” said inspector Dilip Ghuge from Sion police station.Sion hospital dean Dr Mohan Joshi said, “I am not aware about the second case registered against Dr Verma or about his second arrest.”Verma and Guha were arrested last December for allegedly taking ₹50 lakh from a Pune-based doctor after promising to secure a PG medical seat for her. After Dr Verma’s first arrest, Dr Joshi had said that he could not comment anything much as the police inquiry was ongoing. According to the police, the 36-year-old complainant from Hyderabad received a call from Dubey in August 2020, offering him a seat for a PG medical course. When the complainant expressed his wish to pursue the Master of Surgery in Orthopaedics course from Mumbai, Dubey informed him that there were seats available, for which he will have to pay a donation of ₹1.40 crore. The complainant refused to do so.Some days later, Dubey again contacted the complainant and offered him a seat in exchange for ₹90 lakh. Following negotiations, the amount was brought down to ₹70 lakh, which were to be paid in instalments, said a police officer.The complainant then came to Mumbai on August 20, 2020. Dubey sent Guha to meet the complainant. They met outside Sion hospital, and Guha also introduced the complainant to Dr Verma, who had collected his National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) score card and other necessary certificates, said the police.The complainant claimed that he then paid ₹18.50 lakh to Guha and Dubey but did not get an admission till November. The two accused also stopped taking his calls. The complainant then approached Sion police on February 4 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sion-hospital-doctor-associate-arrested-in-second-cheating-case-101613672144078.html
18-02-2021||City||'UAPA can’t be invoked in gold smuggling case': Kerala HC||In a jolt to investigating agencies probing the high-profile Kerala gold smuggling case, the Kerala High Court on Thursday observed that the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) can’t be invoked in the case.The court said smuggling can’t come under the purview of the act unless there were enough evidence to show that it was done with the intent to threaten the economic security of the country.The HC bench of Justices Hari Prasad and MR Anitha also interpreted Section 15 (1) A of the UAPA and ruled that the act can’t be invoked in the smuggling case. The court said offence of smuggling will come under the provisions of the Customs Act and upheld the bail of 14 accused.Also read: ‘Won’t let Covid-19 get better of Mumbai’ - BMC updates norms to tackle pandemicEarlier, the NIA court in Kochi had granted bail to 14 accused in the case and it was challenged by the agency in the High Court citing UAPA provisions. But the HC upheld the lower court's verdict and observed that smuggling won’t come under the UAPA. Earlier, the NIA had claimed that the smuggling case had terror links and slapped the UAPA against the accused.Last month, the NIA had filed charge-sheet against 20 accused under the UAPA. Legal experts said since UAPA provisions were removed, now central agencies will have to deal with only smuggling and money-laundering offences.“On a reappraisal of the entire materials, we agree with the learned trial judge that materials produced before the court at that point of time are insufficient to hold prima facie that the accused persons have committed a terrorist act,” the court observed.The gold smuggling case surfaced last July after 30 kilograms of gold was seized from a consignment camouflaged as a diplomatic bag in the UAE consulate in the state capital. Later, many including CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, were arrested for helping the accused. After three months in judicial custody, he was granted bail last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uapa-can-t-be-invoked-in-gold-smuggling-case-kerala-hc-101613670984003.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Poor infra poses a speed bump as Mumbai aims to become bicycle capital of India||In the aftermath of the global pandemic, city authorities and urban planners are promoting cycling, especially for last-mile connectivity. But given the narrow roads, uneven footpaths, crowding and humid weather, will it be possible for people to adapt to this sustainable mode of transport? Also, apart from the infrastructure, the biggest question is – Where is the space, given the encroachments and hawkers even on pavements that are in bad shape?The needIn February 2020, while inaugurating a public-bike sharing initiative at the Jagruti Nagar Metro station in Mumbai, metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said it was unfortunate that Metro-1 (Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar) stations were not designed for multi-modal integration. Taking this as an example, he further said all upcoming 225 Metro stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will have a dedicated 100-m space in the periphery to enable last-mile connectivity. First- and last-mile refer to the journey from the public transport system to your home/office. Even as the MMR targets a 337-km Metro network by 2026, a recent study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) said that most Metros in India have not been able to meet their projected ridership as it did not provide last-mile options to the commuters. For a city where 60% of the start and end of public transport journeys are walks, as per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) Development Plan 2034, not much thought was given to enhance or make this journey more comfortable, say experts.Firoza Suresh, Mumbai’s first bicycle mayor, said, “Cycling is the best mode for last-mile connectivity, which is a huge problem in Mumbai. The main focus should be to convert trips between 0-3km into cycling trips. Currently, 22% of these short-distance trips are covered by motorised transport. The other area where authorities need to focus is cycles for the urban poor.” Two years ago, Suresh’s Smart Commute Foundation (SCF) provided a GPS device to an Andheri-based incense seller. To their surprise, they found that he covered 30km around the city by cycle for work. “We also found a dabbawala covered 12-15km on his cycle. They don’t cycle for recreation, but livelihood. They need to be provided with the right infrastructure and good cycles,” Suresh added. On right track?Last week, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) revived its plan to install a cycle track in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). According to the plan, around 5km in the commercial hub will have cycle tracks along the pavement, Rajeev said. Mumbai’s suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray also tweeted in support. MMRDA had experimented with cycle tracks in BKC in 2011, but failed.Before the cycle track project, the authority launched an e-bike service in and around BKC. In the past five months, more than 78,000 trips were made on these e-bikes. MMRDA has also allocated funds for a 100-meter radius around every upcoming Metro station to have bus-bays, parking area, seating arrangement, and cycle docks.Apart from this public bike-sharing has also been introduced at four Metro-1 stations – Jagruti Nagar, Versova, DN Nagar, and Azad Nagar. Arjit Soni, founder of MyByk, which runs the services at Metro stations, said, “In a month, we have seen around 3,800 trips at four stations.” The highest number was recorded at Versova Metro station.In 2018, the BMC had also decided to lay out a 36-km cycle track between Mulund and Sion, along the Tansa pipeline. While the deadline for the ambitious project was 2020, it got delayed owing to the pandemic and less than 30% of the work has been completed till date. Rajeev said, “Mumbai has tremendous potential to get converted into a cycling capital of India. The MMRDA has initiated the process from BKC and Metro line one stations. The multi modal integration plan at each upcoming metro stations will facilitate non-motorised movement of people by giving priority to pedestrians and cyclists.”The hurdlesWhile a number of initiatives have been rolled out in the city, Mumbai still lacks dedicated cycling infrastructure, which makes it safer to cycle on roads. At a press conference held this month, Somnath Gharge, DCP, traffic, said in 2019, nine cyclists died on the spot and 38 were injured in fatal crashes on the road. “We need a shift in attitude,” Gharge said.Paresh Rawal, a transport planner based in Mumbai, said, “It is not safe to cycle in the city because there is no supporting infrastructure. Cycling can’t be an option if one has to travel from Andheri to South Mumbai, but is definitely an option for last-mile connectivity, if the right infrastructure is provided.”Soni, whose company offers commuters to take the cycle home or to their offices, agreed that the city’s weather is not conducive for long-distance travel. “This is where public bike-sharing initiatives help. If you want to travel from Borivli to Churchgate, MyByk allows you to travel to Borivli station on the bike and then pick up another bike from Churchgate station. Public bike-sharing, in a way, boosts public transportation,” said Soni, who founded the business after struggling to commute in Mumbai. “Mumbai can never have a seamless cycle network because of the narrow roads and footpaths. There is not enough space for even pedestrians. We agree, but there are solutions to these problems,” said Suresh. Her team of 24 bicycle councilors are now looking at creating a cycling network. “We are first looking at two wards – Bandra and Parel. The idea should be to have a mixed cycling infrastructure where some roads can have a dedicated lane, there can be shared mobility spaces on some roads and we could also have a lane along the median in some cases. The important thing is to study these patterns,” she added. However, there are also administrative challenges to be met. With multiple agencies operating in the city, obtaining permissions is complicated. “In Mumbai, the land may belong to the BMC, but the public transport is being built by another. We have been facing a lot of issues with obtaining permissions,” Soni said. Obtaining permissions from the traffic police also is a challenge. Suresh’s team, which has started a campaign ‘Cycle Chala, City Bacha’ (Ride a cycle, save the city), is also demanding a cycling network and cycle docks at 600 locations in the city. Their campaign aims to make Mumbai the bicycle capital of India by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/poor-infra-poses-a-speed-bump-as-mumbai-aims-to-become-bicycle-capital-of-india-101613670764082.html

18-02-2021||Noida||Tractors can again go to Delhi, if govt makes things difficult: Tikait||Ghaziabad: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said that farmers and their tractors can again go to Delhi if things “get difficult”. He reiterated the farmers’ plans to hold a rally of 40 lakh tractors across the country, adding that this will be a hal kranti and farmers will proceed to Delhi with all equipment used for farming.Tikait has been regularly holding rallies in Haryana. At the rally held at Kharak Punia in Hisar, Haryana, on Thursday Tikait yet again restated the farmers’ demand that the government hold talks with them, which have ceased since January 22. “Our next target is 40 lakh tractors which we will gather from across the country. If they make it difficult for us, these are the same tractors and same farmers who will again go to Delhi. And this time it will be hal kranti and all sorts of equipment used for farming will be taken along,” Tikait told a gathering.Tikait has been spearheading the farmers’ protest at UP Gate. On Wednesday, he had said that farmers were ready to bear the loss of one crop but will not let the agitation die down.“The centre should not be under any misconception that farmers will go back to harvest their crops. If they insist, we will burn our crops. They shouldn’t think that the protest will end in two months. We’ll harvest as well as protest,” he reiterated during the Hisar rally on Thursday. He said that the government should talk to their panchs (committee of farmer unions’ leaders at Singhu border). “We will continue with rallies and panchayats in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal, Karnataka and other states. Is there any ban on us? We have been getting support of khaps. If the government makes things difficult then tractors can go to West Bengal as well,” he added. Tikait had mentioned plans to hold panchayats in poll-bound West Bengal during his rally at Garhi Sampla in Haryana on February 16 as well.Assembly elections are likely to be held in the state in the coming few months with political parties holding rallies to garner support. “You should support and be confident of the 40 people (referring to the committee of farmer unions’ leaders who held talks with the government). You must oil your equipment and fill sufficient fuel in tractors and keep them ready, pointed towards Delhi, once we give a call,” Tikait added. Farmers at the UP Gate have been camping there since November 28, 2020 demanding rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. Off late, the gathering has reduced at UP Gate and their leaders are now conducting panchayats and rallies. “The rallies are helping us keep the momentum of the gathering going. At present we have about 2,000-2,500 people who are at the site. Many are now making it look as if the decrease in numbers means the agitation is dying out. To tackle this, we have come up with a team which is now educating farmers about the use of social media platforms,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. He said that once acquainted with social media, the farmers will tackle the criticism on their own by posting their videos and pictures and will spread awareness about the on-ground situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tractors-can-again-go-to-delhi-if-govt-makes-things-difficult-tikait-101613670404305.html
18-02-2021||Noida||In Noida, farmers say they halted Bihar-bound train; cops, railways differ||Noida: In Gautam Budh Nagar, while farmers claimed they stopped a Bihar-bound train at the Dankaur railway station in Greater Noida on Thursday, as part of the rail roko call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the police and the railways, on the other hand, maintained that the train stopped due to technical reasons as the route ahead was blocked at some places. The Bihar Sampark Kranti Express stopped at 2:03pm and left Dankaur at 2:37pm, said railway officials.Sunil Pradhan, the Gautam Budh Nagar spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Tikait faction, said that farmers had already informed the police and the administration about the rail roko programme. “Around 200 farmers reached the Dankaur station around 12pm and made a sit-in protest outside the station. In the afternoon we stopped one train and garlanded the train’s driver. We distributed fruits, juice, banana, water bottles, etc., to passengers and informed them about farmers’ issues,” he said.Another farmer, Gajendra Nagar, a resident of Mahmoodpur village in Dankaur, said the protesters were disciplined. “Most farmers were outside the station. We had assigned only 20 persons to board the train and distribute food and eatables. We did not sit on the railway tracks or damage any property,” he said.He added that the farmers apologised to the passengers for the inconvenience due to the rail roko call. Pradhan said some passengers agreed with the farmers’ demands that the three farm laws should be repealed. The rail roko call remained peaceful and the farmers left the spot by 3pm.According to Sagar Baliyan, station master, Dankaur railway station, however, “The train was halted at Dankaur as the route ahead was not clear.” Noida police said they had deployed a number of personnel at the station to ensure law and order.Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, concurred with the railways’ version: “Farmers in Greater Noida had not stopped the train. We received information that some farmers were sitting on the railway tracks in Khurja, Bulandshahr and the route was not clear. The trains following that route were stranded at different stations on the way. This Bihar-bound train had thus stopped at the Dankaur railway station by the time the farmers had reached there. They garlanded the train driver and distributed food and water to the passengers,” he said.Police said that the protest was peaceful, and no complaint was filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-noida-farmers-say-they-halted-bihar-bound-train-cops-railways-differ-101613670343030.html
18-02-2021||Noida||‘Rail roko’ stir: Farmer groups miss the train in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The four-hour rail roko call given by the farmer unions passed off peacefully in Ghaziabad and Hapur on Thursday. Officials of the Government Railway Police (GRP), Moradabad region, said that no trains were stopped in Ghaziabad, Hapur and other nearby districts by the farmer groups who occupied the tracks but found no trains for stopping. The GRP officials said that they had “regulated” some of the trains which were to pass between 12 noon and 4pm at different railway stations in Ghaziabad, Hapur, Amroha and Rampur, among others. “About 22 trains were scheduled to pass during the protest timing of 12 noon to 4pm and most of them passed successfully. GRP, in coordination with the railways, regulated three trains for a maximum of two hours. These were halted beforehand at different stations and they departed once the farmers vacated the tracks,” said Aparna Gupta, superintendent of police, GRP – Moradabad region. The officials said that of the three trains, the Dibrugarh-bound Rajdhani was held back at Simbhaoli railway station in Hapur district, Shramjeevi Express (Varanasi-bound) was halted at Hapur while Kalinga Utkal Express (Haridwar-bound) was stopped by the authorities at Ghaziabad junction. “These three trains were regulated by the authorities and no train was reported to be stopped by farmers. Their groups had occupied the tracks at some places, but they returned well before 4pm. Some protesters also arrived in Amroha and Rampur, but they did not occupy the tracks,” Gupta said. The chief public relation officer of the Northern Railways did not respond to calls. The farmer groups waited for about four hours on the tracks but found no train midway to stop. “We occupied the tracks at Modinagar in Ghaziabad and also at Garhmukteshwar in Hapur, but no train arrived. So, we finally put the garlands over the tracks and called off our agitation and returned to our protest site (at UP Gate). We also distributed sweets to railway officers and police, and the protest went off peacefully,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). Farmer leaders at the UP Gate admitted that the protesters could not get to stop any train in Ghaziabad and Hapur.“It was so because the railways held back trains and our supporters found no running trains on tracks. Otherwise, our groups went to each site and occupied the tracks,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and a member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. The farmer leaders on Wednesday had said that as part of the rail roko stir, they would stop trains and offer water, sweets and fruits, among other items, to passengers and would also tell them issues concerning the three farm laws and their demand for a new law on minimum support price. This was the second major call given by farmer leaders after the chakka jam call given for February 6 for which the two states of UP and Uttarakhand were excluded. On Thursday, Northern Railway officials said that a festival express train moving towards Haridwar was held back at Meerut City while Ambala intercity was held back at Delhi as it was to pass during the protest period through Modinagar in Ghaziabad. “There was no stoppage of trains bound for Tundla and Aligarh and these trains departed on time from Ghaziabad junction. The Kalinga Utkal Express was held at Ghaziabad for a little over one hour.

Traffic police had conducted a drive against illegal parking on roads at Marine Drive on February 4. During the drive, when they reached Panchsir Building on F Road, they took action against 15 vehicles parked illegally.While the cops were trying to tow away his vehicle, Nagarseth confronted the policemen and allegedly manhandled a police officer. A case was later registered against him at the Marine Drive police station.Nagarseth, in his defence, argued that the entire adjacent road to his building was dug up by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and residents were forced to park their vehicles on the road. Nagarseth also claimed that at the time of the incident, he was trying to help one of his neighbours to unclamp his vehicle as the former had a medical emergency. He claimed that it was during that time that he got into a heated argument with the officers.Considering his defence, the court granted him anticipatory bail but observed: “The traffic condition in Mumbai city is precarious and day-to-day an increasing number of motor vehicles are coming on the road. In addition, when work of digging – for electric line, water line, drainage line, etc – the traffic woes are worsened. But that does not mean that residents or the public, in general, should park their vehicles in no-parking zones and/or disobey the traffic rules. Every citizen must obey the rules and cooperate with the authorities to smoothen the functioning of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dugup-roads-not-an-excuse-to-park-illegally-mumbai-sessions-court-101613670224204.html

The bike service has been introduced to improve connectivity between Kurla and Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC).The 30-minute e-bike journey from Kurla railway station to BKC will cost ₹25. “Kurla is one of the most crowded stations, especially after the development of the BKC area. The launch of Yulu’s public bike-sharing (PBS) initiative in partnership with CR at Kurla station, is another step towards providing a safe, affordable, and eco-friendly commute option to Mumbaiites. As more businesses are set to reopen in BKC in the coming days, users can now rent sanitised Yulu Miracle vehicles from Kurla station,” said Amit Gupta, co-founder, Yulu & Green Entrepreneur. Commuters will have to download the Yulu mobile application and pay ₹5 to unlock an e-bike. They will be charged ₹1.5 per minute for the ride.After downloading the Yulu app, passengers can scan the quick response (QR) code or enter the vehicle number to unlock the bike.“The Mumbai division has awarded the tender to Yulu for the e-bike parking and charging facility for one year. The bikes will provide connectivity from Kurla (West) to BKC and nearby areas,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. The e-bike services will also be available at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Ghatkopar, Thane, Parel, Mulund and Bhandup railway stations.Further, in a bid to increase its non-fare revenue, CR has also introduced electric vehicle charging facilities at CSMT.

Overall, 41.51% of listed FLWs got their shot till date.“We wanted to vaccinated 7,168 people today, but only 2,772 turned up,” said district chief medical officer Dr N K Gupta. “We administered Serum Institute of India’s Covishield to 627, while 2,145 got Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Thirty-three centres and 67 health teams were involved in the immunisation drive today. We will once again approach departments to encourage their staff to vaccinate although it is purely voluntary.” The vaccination drive began on January 16. Health care workers (HCWs) were part of phase 1, while in phase 2 that began on February 5FLWs too joined in. The third phase, around mid-March, will see people about the age of 50 and those with comorbidities get the dose.The vaccination coverage for HCWs was 73.52%. Experts had earlier attributed the disparity in coverage to higher awareness among HCWs.On Friday, the health department will take up another round of vaccination which also include a second “mop up” round for about 5,700 HCWs who had missed their dose. The day will also see the 3,251 HCWs who got their first shot on January 22 get their second shot. “The vaccination on Friday will be taken up at 35 centres with the help of 53 teams. However, we are not expecting bigger turnout for the final mop up round as the previous mop up round registered only 19.13% coverage (1,405 of 7343 getting the shots),” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/only-38-turnout-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-ghaziabad-101613669802923.html

The couple lived in a rented accommodation under the Expressway police jurisdiction. Their 20-year-old son and wife lived in an adjacent apartment.The neighbours broke down the couple’s door when nobody answered it for a long time, according to the police.“The man was found hanging, while the woman’s body was on the floor. It seems that the man first killed his wife and then killed himself. There are strangulation marks around the woman’s neck,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (zone 1) Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police said the couple was not on talking terms with their son over some dispute. “The bodies will be handed over to the family following the autopsy. So far, no complaint has been filed in the matter,” Singh added.There is no dedicated helpline in Gautam Buddh Nagar to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914424640050 — Delhi-based ‘Sneha India Foundation’, and +914066202000 — Hyderabad-based ‘Roshni’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-kills-wife-takes-his-own-life-in-noida-101613669742946.html

18-02-2021||Noida||Residents demand opening of Sector 101 metro station during peak hours||Noida: Days after the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) started the ‘fast train’ service on its Aqua Line by skipping a few metro stations, a group of residents from sectors 78 and 79 on Thursday asked the corporation to open Sector 101 station during peak hours. The residents said that this is the nearest metro station, but now they have to walk more or get an auto to reach another metro station.Aimed at reducing travel time by nine minutes during peak hours, NMRC on February 8 started the fast train service on a trial basis. The service has been made available from terminal stations -- Sector 51 station in Noida and Depot station in Greater Noida -- from 8am to 11am, and 5pm to 8pm on weekdays. Out of the 21 stations on the Aqua Line, 10 stations, including Sector 101 station, have been skipped under the new system.Brajesh Sharma, a member of 7X society welfare team, said that earlier local residents found it easy to catch a metro train from Sector 101 station. “But NMRC suddenly launched the fast Metro service whereby skipping 10 stations, including Sector 101,” he said. The residents said that they have written to the NMRC managing director to look into the issue.Sangeeta Lohani, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 1, a high-rise in Sector 78, said that she had shifted to Noida home five years ago. “The Sector 101 metro station is about 200 metres away from my home. There was much fanfare during the development of this housing project that the metro station will be in the neighbourhood. Now, the station is closed. What is the point of the station?” she said.OP Sagar, another resident of Sector 78, said that he travels to Mandi House in Delhi every day. “Earlier, it was easy to get the metro at Sector 101 station. Now, I face problems in hiring an auto to reach Sector 52 metro station and then go to Delhi,” he said.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said that the fast train service was launched on a trial basis. “Earlier, NMRC had received feedbacks from people demanding fast metro. We launched this service and are reviewing the feedback. If there is genuine demands from certain sectors, we will review them and make suitable changes to facilitate people’s commuting,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-demand-opening-of-sector-101-metro-station-during-peak-hours-101613669502909.html
18-02-2021||Noida||Noida struggles for clean air as wind speed drops||Noida and neighbouring Ghaziabad and Greater Noida suffered “very poor” air for 11th straight day on Thursday, according to the central pollution control board’s (CPCB’s) air quality index (AQI).According to the data, Noida had suffered 14 days of very poor air, one day of severe air till date this February, as against only six days of very poor and no severe day in the same period last year. There has been only one day of satisfactory air this month.Analysts at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) say that the air is likely to remain very poor for the next few days due to slow wind.“The city’s air quality is likely to see only a slight improvement during the afternoons when the wind speed is at its peak. Overall, though, wind speed is very low. On Thursday, the maximum wind speed was 10 kmph, that too for only a few hours. The rest of the time it was almost calm. Due to this the particle pollutants don’t disperse leading to pollution,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Experts say that consistent wind of at least 8kmph is required to ventilate the region. They, however, added that there was more to the air pollution this year than just the meteorological factors.“Other cities too have suffered more highly polluted days this year. People talk of meteorology as the sole reason, but last year the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) was active and monitored the ground situation and the graded response action plan (Grap) was effectively implemented. In the absence of a larger powerful monitoring agency, measures like ensuring curbs on construction activities seem not to be that effective,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE).The Supreme Court-appointed Epca was replaced last year with the central government-appointed Commission for Air Quality Management. According to the AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, Noida recorded was 315 against 322 a day earlier, Greater Noida was 336 against 337 and Ghaziabad was 325 against 328.The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve from February 20.“Surface winds are low and forecasted to improve and change in direction to easterly. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. AQI is likely to stay in the lower end of Very Poor for the next two days. AQI is likely to further improve on 20th Feb,” said the SAFAR statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-struggles-for-clean-air-as-wind-speed-drops-101613669442896.html
18-02-2021||Bangalore||IT dept unearths 'cash for medical seat' scam worth 400 cr in Karnataka||The Income Tax (I-T) department on Thursday said that search and seizure operations conducted in nine major trusts in Karnataka have revealed evidence of cash-for-seat malpractice. The search and seizure operations were conducted in trusts registered in Bengaluru and Mangaluru, running educational institutions including medical colleges.“The search was conducted at 56 different locations across Karnataka and Kerala. During the search and seizure operation, it was found that the transparent selection process for medical colleges through NEET has been subverted by the trustees and key persons running these medical colleges in collusion with agents/brokers and some students who got high ranks in NEET examination,” read the I-T department statement.Modus operandiAccording to the I-T department, the first stage of malpractice for these medical colleges is to get students who have scored high ranks in NEET examination to take admission for MBBS and other courses in their institutions. However, these students have no intention of joining these institutions since they are expected to get admissions at better medical colleges.This arrangement ensures that during the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) counselling process, these seats remain occupied. Subsequently, these students withdraw from the admission process, making the vacant seats available for the college management. These regular seats then get converted into management seats.Also read: BMC issues updated Covid-19 norms as pandemic rises again in MumbaiThese seats are then made available during the “stray vacancies round”, which is the filling of remaining vacant seats after the initial round of admissions. In this round, the seats are filled by the college management by admitting candidates who have scored low ranks in NEET. For this, the college collects a huge sum as capitation fees or donations.The I-T department said that such a collection of fees is illegal under the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984. “Also, there is evidence indicating that one of the medical colleges has some sort of a “package arrangement” for passing management quota students in written examination and viva voce for a fixed sum ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakhs,” the I-T department said.Evidence seizedThe evidence gathered by the I-T department indicates that ₹402.78 crore has been accepted as illegal capitation fees by manipulating the online admission process and the same has not been disclosed to the Income Tax Department.The search has resulted in the seizure of cash amounting to ₹15.09 crore, gold jewellery worth ₹30 crore, 50-carat diamonds and 40 kilograms of silver articles from the residential premises of the trustees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/it-dept-unearths-cash-for-medical-seat-scam-worth-400-cr-in-karnataka-101613666464050.html

They are rehearing their first commercial play after lockdown, “Kunala Kunache Mael Nahi”, a Marathi production, two hours and 20 minutes long. The students have called their theatre company “Not Fit” entertainers and chosen this play by playwright Venkatesh Madgulkar. “This play has an important place in theatre,” said Bhushan Bhingarkar, one of the actors, “Maharashtra’s beloved actor Nilu Phule acted in this play in the ’60s and it was performed all over Maharashtra by the Rashtra Seva Dal.” The students had performed this play during their last year of academics at the Lalit Kala Kendra. “We chose this play because we had a great response from the audience. This play is the folk art of Maharashtra. It is full of comedy and entertainment. Also, it is a musical,” said Unmesh Dhore, a student and an actor in the play. 2020-21 has been tough year for the young graduates and work has been almost zero. Hence, they decided to perform this production outside the university, commercially. Putting in their own money and with help from head of department at the Lalit Kala Kendra, Pravin Bhole, the play is directed by Ajit Sable, assistant professor, Fine Arts Centre.

The farmers held a “Rail Roko” on Thursday to protest against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre. In Pune and the rest of the region, most trains operated smoothly despite Congress and the Shiv Sena holding a protest at the railway station. From Congress, city unit president Ramesh Bagwe led the protest while Sena workers were also present at platform number one of Pune railway station. Elsewhere in Marathwada, members of a farmers’ union staged a Rail Roko’ at Lasur railway station in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district on Thursday to protest against the Centre’s farm laws.

In the pilot project, PMPML will convert 15 buses into these different vehicles to check the feasibility of revenue generation. PMPML has floated tender for the conversion. At present, PMPML gets ₹1 lakh to ₹1.50 lakh when its old buses are scrapped. Presently, PMPML has a fleet of 2,194 of which 134 buses are not being used. During the Covid-19 period, PMPML already converted its old buses into sanitising vans. Before that, PMPML also converted buses into mobile toilets for women. Rajendra Jagtap, chief executive officer of PMPML said, “ We have decided to use old buses for commercial purposes such as goods carriers. The state transport department has started a commercial service to carry goods to different districts. We have decided to implement these ideas at the city level to generate revenue.” He further said, “Normally, PMPML auctions the old buses. This time, we are exploring new revenue sources. At present, we have 134 old scrap buses. We will use these buses for commercial purposes. So, we have issued a tender instead of auctioning the buses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-convert-old-buses-into-goods-vehicles-sanitising-vans-101613667223563.html
18-02-2021||Pune||ICCR teams up with SPPU to globalise traditional Indian knowledge||With an aim to disseminate traditional Indian knowledge across the world and to make present-day Indian citizens aware of their roots and culture, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) have come together to launch an ambitious initiative titled Universalization of Traditional Indian Knowledge System (UTIKS). An MoU to this effect was signed between the two organizations on Thursday during a ceremony held at the SPPU campus.Dr Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, president ICCR, said, “There are many platforms available around the world to discuss economic and strategic issues, but there are no platforms available for discussing culture. Considering this, we are undertaking the ‘UTIKS’ project with the Savitribai Phule Pune University, through which efforts will be made to enhance education and impart the right information over Indian traditional knowledge and dispel stereotypes and misconceptions.”ICCR’s mandate is to universalise the traditional Indian knowledge system which is of interest to the international community. It has entered into an agreement with SPPU through its e-Content Development and Learning Innovation Centre (e-CDLIC) to create structured e-content capsules. It will provide basic information for those within India and overseas about the subjects related to Indian art, culture, Indian epics, Indian wildlife, temple architecture, folk art and tradition, yoga, Indian cuisine and traditional dances of India among others.SPPU vice-chancellor Dr Nitin Karmalkar said, “We will make a special effort to understand Indian traditional knowledge in a contemporary way and not just by providing available information. The project will be important in preserving Indian culture as well as guiding the new generation.”The knowledge base of various departments of SPPU and the allied institutions shall be utilized for the development of UTIKS. The e-CDLIC at SPPU will utilize the best academic brains to create engaging content that would include presentation, video, quizzes, and reading material of about two hours in each capsule. The centre has the expertise of developing e-content using its state-of-the-art studio facility.

Despite repeated attempts, applications and follow-up it didn’t happen but today after meeting Samant sir and telling them the importance of this game like its invention in Pune and the international recognition, we got the permission letter from SPPU immediately,” said Gajanan Tharkude, Pune district president of roll ball federation. A team of roll ball players along with Dhurkude and Raju Dabhade, the inventor and founder of this game met Uday Samant during the programme. They explained to Samant the importance of this game and the inclusion in the syllabus. “They have given a chance to thousands of students who are playing this game on state, national and international level. From 2011, we were trying to get a sanction from the SPPU sports department for this game, but nothing happened. We have a sanction from the state sports department, Central government and even from the Olympics game official department. But we only didn’t have permission from the SPPU sports department. Because of this many good players from this game were not getting a chance to play ahead at the state or national level just because of this permission issue. At the same time other universities in the state have given permission and are supporting this game fully,” said Dabhade. Dabhade was earlier working as a sports teacher at Balshikshan Mandir English School in Kothrud. While working as a sports teacher, he invented this game in 2003. It is a mix of speed skating, handball and basketball. Currently, this game is so popular and widely played across more than 50 countries in the world. Samant said, “We are so happy to resolve such long pending issues which have an impact on the career of thousands of students. At the same time, this game was invented in Pune but didn’t have permission to add to the sports syllabus of SPPU. This issue needed an immediate solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/samants-visit-forces-sppu-to-grant-permission-for-roll-ball-after-10-years-101613667164502.html

Amongst them were student groups and organisations that had come with student-related problems which need to be addressed. Kuldeep Ambekar, president of Students Helping Hand organisation said, “There are many issues and problems which students are facing today post the Covid-19 pandemic. We are continuously taking them up with SPPU and other concerned government authorities. But today in our application given to the minister we demanded to immediately refund back the deposit money taken from the students at the time of admission. This deposit money is from ₹500 to ₹10,000, and colleges do not refund it to students when they leave the colleges. Lakhs of rupees of students are pending with colleges and today in our application we demanded to take action on such colleges.” Sharmila Yewale, a student representative said, “Now as colleges and university have opened up for students, one of the major issues which students will face is of daily meals. Especially, for students coming from rural and economically backward families. So, we requested Samant sir to extend the Shivbhojan thali scheme facility inside the university and college campuses. On which he has positively responded to us and told that he will talk with the concerned minister on it.” Sagar Alkunte, a student and president of Garware College Yuva Sena branch said, “Now, the next semester examinations will be held and for the purpose, the filling up of the online form application is underway. But for the payment of exam fees, only the offline option is given, means students need to come to the college campus to pay the fees. This system needs to be immediately changed as just to pay a nominal fee a student has to come from his village or hometown which is far away from Pune. Students need to be given an option of online payment for the examination fees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-demand-shivbhojan-thali-online-payment-facility-101613667162740.html

18-02-2021||Lucknow||UP teacher who killed her family may be India's 1st woman to be hanged in 70 yrs||The Mathura district jail in western Uttar Pradesh is preparing for the possibility that Shabnam, a woman convicted of murdering her family in 2008, maybe ordered to be hanged soon, a senior jail official Akhilesh Kumar said. If the death sentence is carried out as expected by jail officials, Shabnam could be the first woman convict to be hanged after Independence.Preparations are on at the district jail in Mathura for the probable hanging of Shabnam, said Akhilesh Kumar, Agra’s deputy inspector general (Jail).Shabnam and her lover Salim were sentenced to death for sedating seven members of her family and slitting their throat on the night of 14 April 2008. Among the dead was a 10-month-old child. He was strangled.The caseShabnam’s family were against her relationship with Salim due to the difference in their social and economic status. Shabnam was a school teacher, Salim a class 6 dropout.Shabnam, then 24, and Salim were arrested within days of the murders. The couple was sentenced to death by the trial court in 2010; the death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015. Their mercy plea was also rejected by Rashtrapati Bhavan. In January 2020, the Supreme Court also turned down their review petitions, underscoring that Saleem had “meticulously executed the killing after Shabnam administered sleeping pills in tea”.“The devilry was with the desire to see that no legal heir except Shabnam remains alive. They wanted to grab the property of Shabnam’s parents who were against their marriage,” a bench comprising Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna ruled.DIG Akhilesh Kumar did not indicate a timeline for execution at Mathura jail but said it could be Shabnam from Amroha district of Uttar Pradesh.“The gallows in Mathura jail is for hanging women convicts but they were in a poor condition as no woman has been hanged in free India. Thus, it was thought proper to get it renovated and the maintenance work is on,” said the officer.Death PenaltyIndependent India has sent more than 750 men to the gallows; only 8 of them during the last two decades, according to data compiled by the research organisation Project 39A of National Law University, Delhi.Archives: An investigation into capital punishment in India Figures compiled by the group indicate there were nearly 404 death row convicts as of 31 December 2020. A 2016 survey had indicated there were only 12 women on the death row.Preparations at Mathura jailPawan Kumar, the executioner more commonly known as Pawan Jallad, said he had visited Mathura jail about a year ago and had pointed out the extensive repairs that the gallows needed.“The wooden platform (takht) was not in proper condition. There were other shortcomings, which I pointed out to the jail authorities in Mathura who have placed an order for fresh rope from Buxar jail in Bihar,” he said.People familiar with the development said two ropes, each 24 feet long, had been ordered for the noose.Shailendra Maitrey, senior superintendent of the district jail, confirmed that an order was placed for the rope but repeatedly called the preparations at the jail as “routine maintenance”.“Mathura jail has arrangements for hanging women convicts, but the place required maintenance. Thus, the required steps are being taken and the rope is to be brought from Buxar jail in Bihar,” said Maitrey.“The maintenance of the cell for hanging women convicts is a routine exercise. I have received no communication that Shabnam or any other woman convict is to be hanged here in Mathura,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-teacher-who-killed-her-family-may-be-india-s-1st-woman-to-be-hanged-in-70-yrs-101613664666713.html

The guidelines further mandate that travellers coming to Mumbai from Brazil will need to compulsorily undergo seven days of institutional quarantine, while hands of those directed to undergo home quarantine will be stamped.At least one case of the Brazil strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected thus far in India.The updated guidelines also say that 300 marshals will be appointed to act against those not wearing masks in trains, the resumption of full services of which on February 1, many say, has led to the 'revival' of the pandemic in Mumbai. Also, to keep a check on passengers not wearing masks, the number of marshals will be doubled from 2,400 to 4,800.Further, police personnel have been authorised to fine citizens not wearing masks and regular checks will be conducted at halls, wedding venues etc. to ensure full compliance of norms. Violation of any rule, guidelines say, will lead to action against the organisers, as well as the concerned management officials.The Covid-19 situation in Mumbai, as well as in Maharashtra, has seen a resurgence in recent days, leading to speculations that another lockdown could be imposed in the city.

PMC has fined 184 in seven days and collected ₹92,500 fine while police have collected a fine of ₹21,39,800 from 4,498 violators. Activists say that the civic administration should include extensive sensitisation in its strategies to get the residents wear masks. From May 2020 till February 17, 2021, PMC has fined 6,778 people for not wearing masks and collected a fine of ₹33,85,100. Pune police have taken action against 4,498 people in the last seven days. “PMC and police have the rights to take action against those not wearing masks in public. We have given receipt slips to the police. Half of the fine collected will be deposited with PMC and rest with the police. We have intensified the action against mask offenders in the last two days,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, PMC. In the total tally of coronavirus positive cases in the district, PMC area has maximum cases, according to the state health department officials. Health experts have noted that the civic body needs to do a lot more to contain the virus spread. “PMC is behaving in a manner that it is the job of police authorities to take action against those not wearing masks. This approach is not correct. The cases have been rising. You may fine people for not wearing masks, but a mask should be provided to the offender and PMC must step up in this. The municipal corporation is resourceful, and people should be encouraged to wear mask rather than fear action for violation,” said Abhijit More, health activist and state co-convenor for NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyan. “Mask is an important tool to prevent coronavirus infection. After the meeting with the chief minister, I have instructed authorities to ensure strict compliance of the Covid-19 prevention SOPs (standard operating procedure). The action against those not wearing masks has been intensified,” Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh had said earlier. Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police, Pune, has instructed police stations to intensify drive against those who do not wear masks. Mask norm drive resumes in rural areas Pune: In the light of increasing coronavirus positive cases, the district administration has intensified action against those without masks in rural areas. As some restrictions were eased during the unlock process and the number of positives had reduced, the action against mask norm violation was halted in these areas. The administration has resumed the drive since February 16. “We have collected ₹2.5 crore fine for violating mask compulsion in rural areas till date. The drive was halted, but resumed since last two days,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police, Pune rural. On February 16, the Pune rural police took action on 327 persons for not wearing masks and collected ₹53,100 as fine. On February 17, 152 were fined and ₹16,300 was collected. “I have ordered every grampanchayat to be vigilant about compelling people to wear masks. It is true that the number of positive cases from rural areas has been increasing but these are located in specific pockets. For example, more cases have been reported from Shirur taluka, Hinjewadi from Maval taluka and in the villages on Ahmednagar road. We are alert,” said zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-covid-cases-surge-in-pune-pmc-and-police-begin-crackdown-on-mask-violators-101613665902683.html

The next date of hearing is March 5.Two days ago, the enforcement directorate (ED) had filed a chargesheet against the 22 persons, including Hooda and three retired IAS officers.The case involves allotment of 14 industrial plots worth ₹30.34 crore to Hooda’s acquaintances in 2013. The ED had initiated investigation in 2015 after an FIR was lodged by the Haryana vigilance bureau.The FIR was subsequently transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2016, which registered a case under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 204 (destruction of record to prevent its production as evidence), 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 467 ( forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (to use a forged record or document as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.The investigation revealed that the chargesheeted parties had illegally benefitted from the pre-selected acquaintances of the then CM as they were allotted 14 industrial plots in lieu of worthier applicants.The three retired officers include Dharam Pal Singh Nagal (the then chief administrator, HUDA), Surjit Singh (the then administrator, HUDA), and Narinder Kumar Solanki (the then zonal administrator of HUDA’s Faridabad zone).Others involved are Subhash Chandra Kansal (the then chief controller of finance, HUDA) and Bharat Bhushan Taneja (the then superintendent, HUDA).The investigation revealed that the price fixed for subject allotment was kept four to five times below the circle rate and seven to eight times below the market rate.The agency added that the criteria for allotment was altered 18 days after the last date of application so as to favour the pre-selected applicants by increasing discretion at the hands of the interview committee. The ED said the interview process was “vitiated and compromised”. All 14 industrial plots were attached as per provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchkula-land-scam-court-summons-hooda-21-others-101613664223420.html

"Naveen Patnaik has been ruling the state for last 20 years and yet his administration had no clue about Andhra Pradesh encroaching into Odisha territory," he said.The boycott of opposition leaders of the Governor's address came a day before the SC is supposed to hear the contempt of court petition of Odisha government against Andhra Pradesh government over the latter holding panchayat polls in one of the villages of Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district. On February 13, over 80 per cent of the 1,025 voters of Patusinri village under Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district had voted for electing the sarpanch of Pattuchennuru gram panchayat of Andhra Pradesh.Officials, meanwhile, said the Andhra Pradesh government in its affidavit before the SC has said that there is no question of contempt by Andhra Pradesh as it is holding Lok Sabha, Assembly and panchayat polls in the three villages of Kotia - Talaganjeipadar, Phagunseneri and Patusinri."The AP government in its affidavit has said that in 2006 and 2013, panchayat elections were held in those three villages. The Andhra Pradesh government stated it has been duly administrating its own territories and has not infringed upon Odisha’s territory. The villages come under Araku Parliamentary Constituency and in Saluru Assembly Constituency in Andhra," said a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-opposition-boycotts-guv-s-speech-on-ap-holding-polls-in-state-s-villages-101613661468946.html

18-02-2021||Kolkata||Amit Shah promises to implement 7th pay commission if BJP forms govt in Bengal||Starting from implementing the 7th pay commission, which would benefit more than a million state government employees, to providing an annual subsidy of ₹6,000 to around four lakh fishermen, Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday listed out a series of doles which he claimed the BJP would implement if it is voted to power in the coming elections in West Bengal.While on one hand, Shah showered poll promises ahead of the crucial assembly elections, on the other, he mounted an attack on the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state alleging corruption.“I assure you that if you vote the BJP to power, we would implement the seventh pay commission for state government employees. The BJP government (after coming to power) will reserve more than 33 per cent government jobs for women,” he said at a rally organised to flag off the BJP’s fifth and last 'Poriborton Rath Yatra' from Namkhana in South 24 Parganas.Even though the BJP had made deep inroads in north Bengal and the Jangalmahal areas, winning 18 of the 42 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, South 24 Parganas remained a TMC bastion.“We would initiate a series of programs for the development of the fishermen community. Around four lakh fishermen would annually get ₹6,000 each under a new scheme Machhuaara Samman Nidhi on the lines of the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. To ensure that fishermen get the right price for their produce, we would form an organisation for fishermen produce. A separate minister would be given charge,” he added while listing out the sops.He also said that while South 24 Parganas would be developed into a seafood hub, Ganga Sagar mela would be developed into an international tourist destination.Also read: After 11-month shutdown, Kashmir train services may be partially restoredShah on Thursday also visited the Kapil Muni Ashram at Ganga Sagar where millions of Hindu pilgrims congregate every year to take a holy dip at the confluence of the River Ganges and the Bay of Bengal during Makar Sankranti. He even had lunch with a refugee family.The Union home minister attacked TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, who happens to be chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew alleging that the Centre had sent money after Cyclone Amphan but TMC-backed goons had eaten away everything.“During the Congress regime, the Centre had sent ₹1.32 lakh crore to West Bengal. Narendra Modi government has sent ₹3.59 lakh crore. Where did the money go? Bhaipo (nephew) and his goons took all the money. When BJP government comes to power, a high-level probe would be done against all those who had taken the money and legal actions would be taken against all accused,” he added.He also attacked Mamata Banerjee and said that the TMC supremo gets angry and feels insulted whenever she hears the slogan 'Jai Shri Ram' while urging the crowd to chant the slogan so loudly that Mamata Banerjee could hear it while sitting in Kolkata.“In West Bengal, you need to take permission for Durga Puja. Saraswati Puja was stopped. It was only after the BJP mounted pressure that Didi was seen performing Saraswati Puja. I felt very good when I saw her allowing Sawarsati Puja. 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan is a symbol of protest against appeasement politics. It is also a symbol of the BJP’s Poriborton Yatra,” he added.TMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was addressing a rally in the same district around the same time, hit out at the BJP-led Centre over price rise and disinvestment policies.“You never talk about price rise. You just talk about Didi and Bhatija (nephew). First fight the bhatija then you can fight didi. I challenge Shah to contest against bhatija. Hiding your corrupt son and pointing fingers at others won’t do. Your son is my bhatija. How did he become the BCCI secretary and amassed wealth?” said Banerjee.Banerjee also hit back saying that Shah was coming to Bengal regularly and telling lies.“First ask him (Shah) to chant the Saraswati Puja mantra. If I don’t allow Durga Puja then how did the clubs get the money to hold the puja? He doesn’t know the culture of Bengal,” Banerjee said while attacking Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/amit-shah-promises-to-implement-7th-pay-commission-if-bjp-forms-govt-in-bengal-101613659765306.html

On day three, Thursday February 18, technical errors were reported by many vehicles on the roads. Famous Marathi poet Sandeep Khare, traveling towards Pune from Kolhapur, alleges that at the Kini toll plaza, he was asked to pay a fine - double the toll - even though he had money in his FASTag account.Khare posted a video from the Kini toll plaza and narrated his experience. “The scanner couldn’t read the sticker on my vehicle. Then I was asked to move the vehicle to and fro. Still the payment did not happen. Then they asked me to pay the double toll penalty. I refused, as I had fully recharged FASTag account. Then the worker came down with another machine and scanned closely. After this, the payment was done, but this procedure took more than 10 minutes,” said Khare. Hemant Takawale, who travelled from Kolhapur to Pune on Thursday, alleged, “Sometimes the scanner can’t read the sticker. Then cash has to be paid and after leaving the toll plaza a money deduction message is received. This is a common problem.” A Pune resident Sagar Gade experienced a different problem with his FASTag account. “My vehicle was parked at home in Pune and I could see my car. But I received the message of a toll deduction of Rs125 from a toll plaza situated in Uttar Pradesh. This has happened twice and I have officially filed a complaint about it,” said Gade. The toll manager of the Khed-Shivapur and Anewadi toll plazas, Amit Bhatia, said, “On Wednesday, the total FASTAg sale was more than 900. On Thursday, it was more than 600 till 7pm. People are now accepting that the change is being implemented. Traffic movement was smooth. FASTag traffic penetration has almost reached 70% at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/technical-glitches-mar-smooth-fastag-operations-on-day-3-101613659841957.html

The Class 7 student of The Bishop’s School, Camp, achieved 11.35 points to secure top spot in UTR and become the only one Indian player in top 10 in the latest ranking. Universal Tennis Rating is a global tennis player rating system intended to produce an objective, consistent and accurate index of players’ skill in tennis. It rates players on a single 16-point scale. “In this system, you achieve points when you defeat players from higher seeds at ITF tournaments and I have gained points by winning matches in the recent past,” said Dhamne, after his practice session at Metro city Sports Club, Kothrud, on Wednesday. Ravindra Pandey, Dhamne’s coach, said that the youngster likes to play with seniors. “He always wants to compete with higher age group players. He used to play practices matches with coaches during his under-10 days and never feared losing a match as his aim was only to improve his game,” said Pandey who has been coaching Dhamne since he started playing tennis at Solaris Sports World from the age of five years. “Fitness was the one factor on which I had to work to improve my strength and my gaining height has given me an advantage on the court,” said Dhamne who is supported by IMG Academy and HEAD, a sports equipment company. At 13, Dhamne aims to make an entry into Junior Grand Slams. “It is the next goal which we want to achieve. He has good backhand and needs to improve on other aspects – forehand, service, court control,” Pandey said. With Dhamne eligible for playing ITF tournaments from this year, the Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association had awarded him a wildcard for the tournament held in New Delhi last month. He reached the quarterfinal stage. Dhamne, on wildcard again, made it to the semis of the next ITF tournament in Gurugram. “MSLTA is guiding and supporting me in the endeavour. Our state and particularly Pune has produced many good players in tennis players and the association is providing all necessary facilities,” Dhamne said.

Addressing the inaugural session of the state BJP’s working committee meeting in Dharamshala, Nadda said: “The BJP is a political party with a difference as a common worker can reach the top position. For others, the family is the party. In the BJP, the party is a family. All other parties are marred by nepotism.” He said the BJP’s economic model is driven by the doctrine of “integrated humanism”. “It comes from the principle of antyodya. Antyoydya means the uplift of the last man in the line. Sabka sath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas is an expansion of this principle and it is reflected in its schemes both at the Centre and states,” he said. Says cultural nationalism core principle Congratulating the state party unit on its victory in the recent panchayat elections, Nadda said the winning streak should not stop and aim of gram sabha to Vidhan Sabha must be achieved. Crediting the collective efforts of the party, he said: “No other party has the strength to make 18 crore members. They are no match.” The former Union minister said that cultural nationalism is the core principle and objective of the BJP “and we all have to take it forward”. He said unity is the strength of the party and it is due to this vigour that tough tasks are easily achieved. “However, sometimes this becomes a weakness as people become laidback as work gets easily done due to the massive strength. So, every worker should do a self-assessment of force he has applied and his relevance in that task,” he said. Himachal a model state for BJP Nadda said the BJP is a cadre-based and mass-based organisation. “Himachal has emerged as a model state in organisational programmes such as panna pramukh and booth-level presidents. For this, the state unit deserves appreciation and now you should take this to the next level by forming panna committees by March,” he said. Nadda also appealed to Himachal’s leaders to brand the handicraft of the state. Modi steered nation through pandemic He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi proved his leadership to the world during the Covid-19 pandemic. “While powerful countries with better infrastructure had given up, India showed the way due to the timely decisions taken by the Centre,” he said. “The country has also taken a lead in the vaccination of its population and is supplying vaccines to other countries as well,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/from-gram-sabha-to-vidhan-sabha-bjp-chief-sets-target-for-2022-101613644213610.html

It is modeled on Delhi government’s Mohalla clinics except that the centers will have Ayurveda doctors.“The aim is to provide many services according to Vedas and classical Ayurvedic scriptures to teach people of MP how to live a long and healthy life,” said Ramkishor Kawre, minister of the state of Ayush department.The department will also hold a health survey of genotype (Prakriti Parikshan) of residents of MP to know about the health status of residents and to analyse the reason behind their ailments, said Rajeev Mishra, deputy director at the state’s Ayush department.“Ayush ministry has asked the states to open health wellness centers across the nation to decrease the burden of disease. In MP, we are strengthening the ayurvedic system which will run parallel to the conventional health system to prevent diseases related to lifestyles and will provide ayurvedic treatment to people," said Mishra.“Our objective is to promote Ayurvedic medicines and our ancient method of living a long and healthy life. For a healthy baby and good maternal health, we will introduce Garbh Sanskar. For adolescents, we will introduce Panchakarma and for geriatric nutrition, we will introduce Jaravastha Poshan, “said the officer.The objective is to prevent non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiac issues, arthritis, renal disease and others by changing the lifestyle, he added.With wellness centers, the department will start pathology lab to perform the allopathic tests which are possible through rapid test kits, said the officer.The initial budget for both health wellness centers and Vaidya Apke Dwaar scheme is ₹55.5 crore, according to the official, who claimed it would increase as the demand of such centers increase.Also Read: Ahead of kisan mahapanchayat in Malwa region, MP issues prohibitory ordersIndian Medical Association MP convener, Shankul Dwivedi said it was fine to promote Ayurveda but how will the state government ensure that quackery was not promoted through this.“There should be a proper mechanism to check the activities of Vaidyas. The state government should have clear guidelines for Vaidyas. They shouldn’t be allowed to treat diseases for which they are not authorized or qualified. Otherwise, there are chances of promotion of quackery and exploitation of patients in the name of Ayurveda,” he added.However, Ayush Doctors’ Association president Rakesh Pandey said, “It is wrong to compare qualified Ayurvedic doctors with quacks. Ayurvedic is a tried and tested methodology, and it has the cure for many diseases, which Allopathy doesn’t have. It is a good decision by the state government and it will also increase employment opportunities for 20,000 qualified Ayurvedic doctors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/educating-mind-of-unborn-baby-part-of-mp-s-new-ayurved-at-doorstep-scheme-101613643119164.html

18-02-2021||Lucknow||UP Assembly budget session: Opposition MLAs walk out during Governor Anandiben Patel's address||The MLAs of opposition Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress staged a walk out from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly during Governor Anandiben Patel's address on the first day of the Budget Session on Thursday.The MLAs of the Samajwadi Party also shouted slogans against the ruling BJP inside the Assembly before walking out.Congress MLA Aradhana Misra, while talking to media after the walk out from the Assembly, said her party expected the government to express condolences for the farmers who died during the ongoing protest against three farm laws, but the 'compassionless' state government did not do so."We had thought that the state government will offer condolences for the farmers who died during farmers' protest before the Governor's address to the Assembly. But there is no compassion in the government, the Governor also started her address without paying respect to the farmers. Most farmers who died were from Uttar Pradesh. We registered our protest against the Governor's address and after that walked out from the assembly," said Misra.BSP MLA Aslam Raini said his party 'boycotted' the Governor's address to protest against the state government's treatment of protesting farmers and the poor law and order situation of the state."The Governor was in disagreement with the government's policies that is why she came for her address seven minutes late. The crime in the state, especially crime against women has increased under this government," said Raini.The Budget Session of the Assembly commenced today with an address by Governor Anandiben Patel to a joint sitting of both Houses. The session will continue till March 10.On February 16, Covid-19 tests of all MLAs and MLCs were conducted in view of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-budget-session-opposition-mlas-walk-out-during-governor-s-address-101613639254737.html

Banerjee also ordered three separate probes into the incident by three investigating agencies – the Criminal Investigation Department, Special Task Force and Counter Insurgency Force. “The state will bear the treatment cost and even provide artificial limbs to those whose legs and hands have been blown off. The state will provide compensation of ₹5 lakh to each of the seriously injured and 1 lakh each to those who sustained minor injuries,” she said. Also Read | Bengal minister injured in bomb attack in Murshidabad; rushed to hospital“I am not leaving this investigation upon just one agency. Three big state agencies – CID, STF and CIF – will probe the incident,” she said after visiting SSKM Hospital in Kolkata where some of the injured, along with the minister, were admitted. A powerful explosion rocked Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on Wednesday night, injuring Hossain and at least 26 others. The minister and 10 other victims were shifted to Kolkata. The chief minister compared the incident with the blast that killed Beant Singh (former Punjab chief minister) and the one which targeted Maninder Singh Bitta (Congress youth leader). “Those who were with him have claimed that the blast was remotely controlled. Police is investigating so nothing concrete can be said as of now. But prima facie it appears that it was pre-planned,” she said. Piyush Goyal, Union railways minister, tweeted: “I condemn the dastardly bomb attack at Nimtita Railway Station in West Bengal. My prayers are for the quick recovery of the injured.” Banerjee attacked the centre saying that the blast took place inside the railway station and it was beyond the jurisdiction of the state police. She said that neither there were any rail security personnel nor lights in that area. “It was their game plan to kill Zakir. The incident took place inside railway property and it is the responsibility of the Union government. The state police have no jurisdiction. I don’t understand how the railway authorities are taking this so casually. It is a big conspiracy. We want the truth to come out. His condition is very critical and he is undergoing surgery,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/murshidabad-blast-mamata-orders-probes-by-3-agencies-announces-compensation-101613639885369.html

18-02-2021||Chandigarh||Post-Covid, Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla opens doors for tourists||Almost a year since the Covid-19 induced lockdown, the 18th century British-era building of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) in Shimla was opened for visitors on Thursday. “The building is now open for visitors from 11am to 1pm and 2pm to 4pm. However, they will have to adhere to the standard operating procedure (SOPs) amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Visitors need to carry hand sanitisers and maintain social distancing,” said Akhilesh Pathak, the public relations officer at IIAS. Built in 1888 and formerly known as Viceregal Lodge, the majestic building on the Observatory Hills 3km from The Ridge, served as the summer residence of the viceroys who governed India between 1886 and 1946 and came to be known as Rashtrapati Niwas, the President of India’s retreat in 1964. Big draw with tourists Due to its old-world charm, it is popular with tourists. On an average, two lakh tourists visited the building annually before the lockdown. The IIAS charges ₹40 as entry fee from domestic tourists and ₹85 from foreign nationals. Those who want to see the building from outside alone are charged ₹20. The government earns an estimated ₹85 lakh annually from visitors to the building, which was thrown open to the public in 1992 and declared a heritage structure in 1997. Witness to history being made During the Raj, several significant strategies were deliberated upon in the building that served as the nerve centre of the British administration. Thirteen viceroys stayed in the building with Lord Dufferin being the first to move in and Lord Mountbatten the last. The Simla Conference of 1945 at Viceregal Lodge was attended by the then viceroy, Lord Wavell, and leaders of the Indian Muslim League and the Indian National Congress such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Liaqat Ali Khan, Master Tara Singh and Mohammed Ali Jinnah. It is said to have laid the foundation of the Partition as the meet was convened by Lord Wavell to find a way out of Jinnah’s insistence for Pakistan. Mahatma Gandhi was in Shimla at that time but didn’t attend the meet. The table where the Partition papers were prepared is carved out of walnut wood and displayed in one of the galleries of the building. In May 1947, Lord Mountbatten discussed the plan for Partition at the same table. Sir Cyril Radcliffe was given two months to chalk out the boundary between India and Pakistan. Radcliffe was optimistic that at the final meeting, differences would be resolved but the four members of the commission, comprising two Muslims, a Hindu and a Sikh, disagreed so much that he took it upon himself to do the needful. The ballroom that was the venue for the Simla conference has now been converted into a library. Standing the test of time Viceregal Lodge was designed by British architect Henry Irwin and built in the Jacobethan style during Lord Dufferin’s tenure as viceroy. Its construction started in 1880 and was completed in 1888. Lord Dufferin occupied the lodge on July 23, 1888. It was built at a cost of ₹38 lakh with an annual upkeep cost of ₹1.5 lakh in the 1880s. The estate stood on 331 acres but today it’s reduced to 110 acres. The structure draws inspiration from the architectural style of the English Renaissance, and also reflects elements of the castles of the Scottish Highlands. The building is of light blue-grey stone masonry with tiled pitch roofing. The interior of the main building has elaborate woodwork that has stood the test of time. Teak was brought from Burma, and was supplemented by local cedar wood and walnut. The second president of India, S Radhakrishnan, thought of putting the building to academic use and the Indian Institute of Advanced Study was set up at Rashtrapati Niwas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/postcovid-indian-institute-of-advanced-study-in-shimla-opens-doors-for-tourists-101613629025071.html

18-02-2021||Lucknow||BJP scales up Suheldev's anniversary celebrations ahead of UP panchayat polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) grand celebration of the birth anniversary of 11th-century king Suheldev, an icon of the other backward caste (OBC) communities in Uttar Pradesh, is being seen as a bid to counter former political ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) while consolidating Dalit and OBC votes for the upcoming rural panchayat elections. While the Yogi Adityanath government organised birth anniversary of the warrior king in each district, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 40-feet high statue in the king’s memory on Tuesday.As per the new reservation policy both Dalits and OBCs would have more representation in the predominantly rural polls due in April-May and Om Prakash Rajbhar, who named his party SBSP after the warrior king, is planning to take on the BJP by forming an alliance of small groups.“He (Suheldev) is one of us. There is enough proof. But, we are not bothered about who is staking claim to his legacy. As for us, we definitely propose to go to each village talking about the greatness of Suheldev ji. Some may be felicitating him for political reasons but for us, he is our guide, guru, and god,” said SBSP chief.But the BJP does not appear to be leaving anything to chance. The party through a slew of activities, including getting a song penned in honour of the king, is hoping to connect with the lower caste groups.The BJP maintains King Suheldev didn’t get his due from past governments and historians. The party has been working to glorify the ruler of Shravasti, located in Bahraich district. State’s cabinet minister Anil Rajbhar said stories of Suheldev’s valour will be popularized not just in UP but across the country as the state’s culture department has got some artists to sing a song in the memory of the king whose caste origins are mired in a controversy of sorts.Some call him a Dalit who was born into the Pasi caste, while others feel he was a backward, born into the Rajbhar caste. BJP leaders said they won’t mind if both the numerically dominant castes claim the king to be from among them.Also Read: Why use FAStag for cars which ply in city limit, asks RLD“Either way, these caste groups have been with the BJP since 2014 and will continue to be with us. We idolise him for his bravery and his patriotism,” said UP BJP vice president Vijay Bahadur Pathak, who is also the in-charge of forthcoming rural panchayat polls due in April-May.He recalled how in 2016, Union home minister Amit Shah had visited Bahraich and hailed Suheldev as a national hero and unveiled his statue and also named a train after him. PM Modi had also released a stamp in Suheldev’s memory.Before that, Rajnath Singh, the present defense minister, too had got Suheldev’s statue installed when he was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-scales-up-suheldev-s-anniversary-celebrations-ahead-of-up-panchayat-polls-101613627379183.html

He said he married in June 2003 in accordance with Buddhist rites and rituals and had a daughter and a son with his wife. However, he alleged that his wife didn’t perform her duties as a housewife, would often quarrel with him and his family, and leave the matrimonial house without informing him.Also Read | Bombay HC tells ED to not take coercive action against Avinash BhosaleHe added that his wife was addicted to chewing tobacco and had developed a cyst in her abdomen because of that, and he had to incur heavy expenses for getting that surgically treated.The family court had, however, rejected his petition, concluding that the allegations were not sufficient to grant decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty.Concurring with the family court, the high court bench said careful perusal of the pleadings and the evidence submitted by the husband revealed that the allegations were nothing but “normal wear and tear in married life”.The judges said that so far as the treatment meted out by the spouses to each other was concerned, the woman was on a better footing than her husband, as she cohabited with him for about two years even after he was found HIV positive in 2008.The court said that if the marriage was dissolved, the children would suffer, and it was in the best interests that the marital tie remains intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/womans-tobacco-addiction-not-sufficient-for-divorce-bombay-high-court-101613626625052.html
18-02-2021||Lucknow||Why use FAStag for cars which ply in city limit, asks RLD||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) flayed the Centre on Wednesday for issuing an order seeking to levy a penalty for not putting FASTag on passenger and goods vehicles and asked why the tag was held important for vehicles that only plied within the city limits. The party demanded that the government withdraws the order.Party national spokesman Anupam Mishra said the government had made FASTag compulsory for all new vehicles when it was useless for those who didn’t travel beyond city limits. Mishra was addressing a press conference in Lucknow."Why should anyone who does not travel beyond city limits be forced to put a FASTag on his vehicle," Mishra questioned.FASTag is an electronic toll payment system that has been implemented across the national highways in the country since February 16. The system works through a unique code for every vehicle enabling digital payment of the toll tax when the vehicle crosses the sensors attached at the toll plazas. As per NH Fee Rules 2008, any vehicle not fitted with FASTag or vehicle without valid, functional FASTag entering into the FASTag lane of the toll plaza shall pay a fee equivalent to two times the fee applicable to that category, road and highway ministry had said in a notification. Mandatory implementation of the FASTag system has also resulted in traffic delays at several toll plazas.Made mandatory for each vehicle, the minimum price for Fastag is ₹200. All this, Mishra claimed was an organised loot.Also Read: 3,800 FASTag violators pay double toll penalty at Khed-Shivapur toll plazaHe claimed the decision to do away with cash-lanes on toll-plazas would also be a reason for harassment of vehicle owners crossing the highways.In a different statement, another party leader Anil Dubey criticised the Central government for an increase in the prices of LPG and diesel/petrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/why-use-fastag-for-cars-which-ply-in-city-limit-asks-rld-101613624275887.html

The official added that the maintenance cost of solar lights on toll roads is included in the toll fee.“The maximum speed limit must be fixed between two toll booths on the national highways and vehicles taking less average time than the fixed limit should be fined as is done on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway,” UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said.

18-02-2021||Lucknow||No invite to BJP leaders for any function till farm laws scrapped: UP panchayat||A panchayat of farmers held at the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) headquarters in Sisauli (Muzaffarnagar) appealed to people to not invite Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders to any family function or programme till the prevailing deadlock between farmers and government ends. Meanwhile, a meeting of BJP MPs and MLAs of western UP was held at the residence of union minister Sanjeev Baliyan in Muzaffarnagar; they resolved to approach Khaps and farmers to brief them about the three new farm laws and to get their feedback and concerns. The directive given by BKU chief Naresh Tikait in the Sisauli meeting is likely to discomfit the BJP, which has been facing a tough time in the region due to the ongoing farmers’ movement. Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Delhi borders closed, traffic diverted to avoid jamsChaudhary Digamber Singh, state president of BKU’s youth wing, told HT that BKU chief Naresh Tikait had advised people to not send “chitthi” ( invitations) to BJP leaders for any programme till the impasse ended. BKU’s district president in Muzaffarnagar Dheeraj Latiyan also confirmed this and explained, “ He said this to protect BJP leaders from possible harassment and misbehavior by people in the wake of the ongoing farmers’ movement”. The panchayat in Sisauli went on for over four hours in which different aspects of the movement and issue of no increase in sugarcane rate were discussed. Meanwhile, after the meeting, Baliyan said that the discussion was regarding the farmers’ movement. He said that they had decided to approach Khaps and farmers to brief them about the farm laws. “Reservations and doubts of farmers will be cleared and their feedback will be sent to senior leaders and government. If the laws have any flaws then they will be corrected,” he said, reiterating that the farmers didn’t explain what was wrong in the new laws. On being asked about the government’s readiness to bring some amendments, he said, “The farmer leaders didn’t mention anything about amendments. Their only demand is to ‘ repeal’ the laws.” The minister said that western UP only had gur ( jaggery) mandi and the state government had already exempted it from 2.5% mandi tax. Therefore, the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) had no impact here. Replying to a question about the dilution of Essential Commodities Act in the laws, which could encourage hoarding, he said, “We will give the government the feedback we receive and act as per the directions of the party”. Reacting to this, Digamber Singh said that it was too late for BJP leaders to have a dialogue with farmers. Latiyan said, “Instead of talking to farmers they should work on finding a solution to the issue. It would be better if they convince the government to repeal the farm laws.”Rashtriya Lok Dal’s regional president Chaudhary Yashbeer Singh said that farmers would not fall prey to such gimmicks because they were extremely annoyed “at the way the Prime Minister mocked farmers in Parliament and used objectionable words for the ongoing movement.” Besides, over 200 farmers had died so far and the BJP leaders had not said even a single word of condolence. They had rubbed salt in the farmers’ wounds by not increasing the rate of sugarcane in the past three years, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-invite-to-bjp-leaders-for-any-function-till-farm-laws-scrapped-up-panchayat-101613616965636.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Delhi borders closed, traffic diverted to avoid jams||Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders continue to be blocked as farmers continue their agitation demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws. The Delhi Police have diverted the traffic that may possibly lead to heavy traffic jams in parts of the Capital during the peak travel hours. Delhi Traffic Police officers said Delhi and Ghaziabad are facing heavy traffic jams in peak hours as the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border has remained completely closed due to the ongoing agitation. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut, NH-9 and NH-24 are closed because of the UP Gate border blockade and vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to the alternate border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND, and Kalindi Kunj, they said.Also Read | A second toolkit was in works: Delhi PoliceHowever, NH-24 road is kept open for traffic going to Delhi from Ghaziabad through Ghazipur roundabout. So, motorists entering Delhi from Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar or Apsara border may take a right turn from the Ghazipur roundabout and take NH-24 road from there to move towards south and central Delhi via Sarai Kale Khan and the Ring Road.“Also, commuters can take Vikas Marg after taking a right turn from under the Patparganj Industrial Area flyover from Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road. No traffic is being allowed on Delhi-Meerut expressway while NH-9 is kept open only during morning and evening peak hours when traffic remain heavy,” a traffic police officer said.Apart from the UP Gate border, Singhu, Tikri, Saboli and Piau Maniyari borders are also closed. Traffic police officials said that Jharoda and Auchandi borders are opened only during morning and evening peak hours while Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu school and Pall toll tax borders are open for traffic.As traffic is expected to remain heavy on GT Karnal Road, Outer Ring Road and NH-44, the traffic police have asked motorists to avoid these routes and take the alternate or diverted routes.Chilla border between Noida and Delhi remains open on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-borders-closed-traffic-diverted-to-avoid-jams-101613616004738.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||R-Day clashes: Car mechanic held, two swords recovered||A 30-year-old car air-conditioning mechanic from north-west Delhi’s Swaroop Nagar was arrested for swinging swords and dancing with the weapons at the Red Fort on Republic Day, acts that “motivated” protesters to cause “more mayhem” at the monument, the Delhi Police said on Wednesday.Pramod Kushwaha, deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said the accused, Maninder Singh, was arrested after being identified in a video that showed him wielding the two swords. “We have recovered the two 4.3-feet-long swords from his home,” said Kushwaha.The Red Fort was one of the epicentres of violence and vandalism on Republic Day after a tractor march planned by the farmers protesting against the three farm laws descended into chaos with the protesters clashing with the police at several locations in central, east Delhi and north-west Delhi, and a large group storming the Mughal-era fort.Three others have already been arrested in connection with the vandalism and violence at the Unesco World Heritage site. These include Deep Sidhu, an actor-turned-activist who was arrested on February 8, for allegedly instigating protesters at the monument and destroying property. Sidhu remains in police custody for interrogation.Sidhu was arrested after the Delhi Police announced a total reward of R6 lakh for information leading to the arrest of eight men, including Sidhu, gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana and Jugraj Singh. The latter is accused of hoisting a religious and a farmers’ body flag at the Red Fort.Police teams are continuing to carry out raids in Punjab and Haryana to arrest Sidhana and Singh.Kushwaha said Singh was “radicalised” by watching various “provocative” videos on Facebook and was “motivated” by speeches made by leaders at the Singhu border, a protest site frequented by him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-clashes-car-mechanic-held-two-swords-recovered-101613610688374.html

His scooter was lying nearby,” said the officer.Believing him to be involved in a road mishap, his wife rushed him to a nearby hospital where even doctors believed he was involved in a vehicular accident. “We received a call from the hospital at 1.47 am. When we took a close look at the body, we found a gunshot wound to his left forehead. That is when we realised that it was a murder,” the officer said, adding that the autopsy report is yet to arrive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-who-ran-a-youtube-local-news-channel-found-shot-dead-in-dwarka-101613610581190.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Chandni Chowk to be revamped by March-end||Work on the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk is likely to be completed by March 31, said officials of Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the agency which is overseeing the project.The project envisaged revamping the 1.3 km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque flanked by the Chandni Chowk market on both sides by making it a pedestrian-only zone, provide broad walkways, water ATMs, toilet complexes, and street furniture mimicking the Mughal-era architecture.Senior officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said over 90% work was complete. They said currently “finishing touches” were being given and stone work was going on near Town Hall. A toilet complex near Fountain Chowk was also nearing completion, they said.PWD minister Satyendar Jain said the officials have been directed to complete the project within the stipulated deadline.The idea of the project first came up in 2004. In 2008, the chief minister Sheila Dikshit set up the Shahjanahabad Redevelopment Corporation as a nodal agency to oversee the implementation of the project by bringing all stakeholders on a common platform. It was launched in August 2018 by the AAP government and work began in December that year. The initial deadline was fixed at March 2020, but it was revised to March 2021 due to several delaying factors such as the Covid pandemic and the legal issues in removing encroachments, including some religious structures.Read more: Delhi Gymkhana to get govt administrator, rules NCLATGarima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, said the deadline of the project has been rescheduled to March-end this year. “The work is underway in full swing and we hope to complete it within the timeline. The deadline of the project has now been revised to March 31, 2021,” Gupta said.Explaining the reasons behind the delay, a PWD official who declined to be named said even though work resumed in June this year after the government began the unlock process after the nationwide Covid-induced lockdown, progress was slow due to shortage of labour. “Now the project is inching towards completion. We have completed over 90% work, which includes major construction works such as digging and shifting of utilities. Overhead wires have also been made underground and drains in the area are being fixed and beautified. We will complete the project by March 31, 2021,” the official said.PWD engineer-in-chief Shashi Kant conducted an inspection last week to review the progress of the project. He directed the officials to expedite work and finish it within the deadline.The corridor will strictly be a “no vehicle zone” during the daytime and only non-motorised vehicles such as rickshaws and e-rickshaws will be allowed to move on the stretch. However, loading and unloading of goods will be allowed during the night, officials said.Read more: Youth Congress activists protest in Delhi against fuel price hikeSanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said it is the maintenance of the redeveloped portion, which is required as it is being spoiled by encroachment. “Stretches that have been beautified on the corridor can be seen occupied by beggars, illegal vendors. The authorities should also take care of this problem of encroachment as it will only malign the beauty of the redeveloped areas,” Bhargava said.He said besides the remaining civil work, the agencies were yet to install CCTV cameras and streetlights.AGK Menon, a consultant with Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), said the project will improve shopping experience in the area. “There were practical problems that delayed the project. It should not be delayed further. Hopefully, it will be completed by the revised deadline,” Menon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chandni-chowk-to-be-revamped-by-marchend-101613611322869.html
18-02-2021||Chandigarh||Amid farm stir, Congress wins key local body polls in Punjab||Results of civic body elections in Punjab reflect the long shadow of the farmer’s protest with the state’s ruling Congress, which is opposed to the farm laws at the heart of the issue, winning a clear majority in six of the seven municipal corporations for which results were declared on Wednesday.In the last elections, conducted in 2015, it did not win a majority in any of the corporations that went for polls on Sunday. Elections to the state assembly are to be held in early 2022 and analysts see the Congress’s strong performance as a boost for the ruling party, which has been facing the headwinds of anti-incumbency.“The results are a prelude to the state polls scheduled in 2022. The reasons for this are its committed grassroot workers’ [reach] and historically it’s the single largest party and has an umbrella organisation character,” said Amanpreet Gill, a professor of political science in Khalsa college in Delhi.Results of the eighth municipal corporation, Mohali, will be announced on Thursday. The six where the Congress has won a majority are Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Abohar Batala and Pathankot. Neither party has won the majority in Moga.The Congress was also ahead of all other political parties in the majority of municipal councils and Notified Area Councils.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh termed the results as a validation of his government’s policies and the rejection of anti-people and anti-farmer parties. The Shiromani Akali Dal’s Sukhbir Badal, in a Twitter message, thanked his party workers for fighting the polls and challenging the “corrupt” and “incompetent” government.In all, 2,302 wards across 117 civic bodies including eight municipal corporations went to polls on February 14. Results for 2,150 wards were announced on Wednesday. Of these, the Congress won 1,360 wards. The BJP, contesting alone (its long-term ally, the SAD broke up with it over the farm bills) won 50, compared to the 248 it did in 2015, when 2,044 wards went to the polls. SAD won 281 fewer than the 870 it did in 2015. The Aam Aadmi Party, which did not contest the last elections, won 60 and independents won 390, down from 624 last time.Read more: Punjab to have 9 more fast-track courts under Pocso ActState Congress chief, Sunil Jakhar, said, “Maintaining communal harmony would be the central plank of Congress government to steer the state on path of unprecedented growth, development and prosperity.”The analysts said the Congress’s strong performance should be seen in the context of the farm protests.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for 84 days, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.Read more: Punjab municipal polls highlights: AAP demands recounting of votes in JagraonThe government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.“We are prepared for a lone fight and we will be successful,” said a SAD spokesperson Daljeet Singh Cheema. BJP candidates were heckled during the campaign on account of the laws.The polls evoked a strong response, witnessing a 71% turnout; it was 78% in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-farm-stir-congress-wins-key-local-body-polls-in-punjab-101613595221612.html

The police had earlier booked Sauda and her nine family members on charges of murder and attempt to murder on Tuesday night.The FIR comes after a resident of Govardhan Nagar, Deepak, alleged that the councillor’s family members had attacked his kin after he had objected to them feeding the pigs in the middle of the road. This had led to an argument between the families, that had turned into a violent quarrel with one dead and four injured.“We had a heated argument, but my father pleaded for peace and we left for home. Later, Rishi along with 8-10 men came with weapons and the three brothers, Rishi, Lucky and Rimpi, attacked my brother Arun. Me and my father were also injured.

18-02-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ stir: Khaps agree to follow Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s lead||Khap representatives from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan unanimously decided to follow the lead of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a united front of around 40 farmers’ unions, with regards to the stir against the three farm laws on Wednesday. Hundreds of representatives, including those from prominent khaps such as Nandal, Malik, Dalal, Dahiya, Hooda, and Ahlawat, attended the meeting. Khap-84 head, Hardeep Singh Ahlawat, who chaired the meeting, said, “The representatives agreed to support all decisions taken by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha pertaining to intensifying the stir and starting talks with the Centre to end the deadlock.” Khaps condemn Dalal’s statement on farmers’ deaths While condemning Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal’s controversial statement on farmers’ death on the Delhi borders, the khap bodies said the minister will be boycotted. On February 13, Dalal had said the farmers who lost their lives during the protests would have died even if they had stayed back on their fields.Ahlawat said the minister had hurt the farming community’s sentiments. “How can a minister laugh at farmers’ death? The khaps have decided to disassociate themselves from the minister as such people can only defame the community. We will not hold any talks with Dalal in future,” he said.Dismissing rumours that the khap was willing to intermediate between the protesters and government, Ahlwat said, “ Such rumours are being spread to weaken the agitation. The khaps firmly stand with the Samyukta Kisan Morcha.” Independent MLA from Dadri, Sombir Sangwan, who also heads the Sangwan Khap said they will also participate in the ‘rail roko’ stir from noon to 4pm. “We will return only when the government repeals the three farm laws. Farmers are fighting for legitimate rights. The government should guarantee them minimum support price,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-stir-khaps-agree-to-follow-samyukt-kisan-morcha-s-lead-101613594343237.html

18-02-2021||Chandigarh||Mustard seed prices soar in Haryana, fetch ₹1500/quintal over MSP||Mustard seed growers in Haryana are elated as the price of their produce has crossed the minimum support price. As per reports from mandis in northern districts where harvesting begins early, the price of yellow mustard (desi sarson), climbed to ₹6,500 per quintal and the price of black or hybrid mustard seeds has increased to around ₹5,800 per quintal.However, the minimum support price (MSP) for this staple oilseed, is fixed at ₹4,650. Government agencies will begin procurement in April.In the absence of government agencies, private traders are purchasing the seeds in open auctions.“I had cultivated mustard over four acres this year. The seeds were sold for ₹5,680 per quintal against the MSP of ₹4,650,” said Mohan Lal, who sold his produce at a mandi in Kurukshetra. However, farmers said the per acre yield of mustard was underwhelming at around 6-7 quintals.Traders say the hike in prices can be attributed to increased demand for mustard oil, the price of which has touched ₹160 per litre and may soar further.“This is for the first time in the several years that the price of mustard seeds has crossed the ₹6,000-mark,”said Naresh Kumar, a commission agent at Ladwa grain market.As per officials from the state agriculture department, the prices of mustard seeds have increased due to reduction in area under mustard cultivation after many farmers failed to get MSP after the government made registration mandatory on the Meri Fasal Mera Byora (MFMB) portal. “Last year, I had to sell mustard cultivated on six acres below MSP as government agencies imposed restrictions on procurement, which is why this year I only sowed mustard over two acres,” said Praveen Kumar, a farmer.In 2019, the government procured around 5.19 lakh tones of mustard from farmers who had registered themselves on the MFMB portal. In 2020, the government had procured only 4.53 lakh tonnes of mustard seed on MSP..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mustard-seed-prices-soar-in-haryana-fetch-1500-quintal-over-msp-101613593623213.html

SAD won on 34 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was restricted to five and the Aam Aadmi Party managed to win on only one.Stronghold of late Akali minister Captain Kanwaljit Singh and then SAD MLA NK Sharma, Dera Bassi constituency didn’t see the party lose any MC election for 18 years in Zirakpur, and 10 years in Dera Bassi and Lalru, until the Congress on Wednesday wrested 48 of the 67 seats in the three towns.Even, in Banur and Kurali, Congress won with clear majority, securing 21 of 30 seats.ZirakpurThe largest municipality among the seven and traditionally a fiefdom of SAD, Zirakpur chose Congress on 23 of the 31 seats and Akali Dal on eight, while BJP and AAP drew a blank.The Zirakpur MC was formed in 2000 and saw its first elections in 2003, when NK Sharma became its president. He was re-elected in 2008 and resigned in 2012 on becoming the local MLA, when his close aide Kulwinder Singh Sohi took the reins of the post, never allowing the Congress to make its presence felt in the area. Since 2015, the MC here had 28 councillors from the SAD-BJP combine, while three were independents.Lalru Dethroning SAD, which ruled Lalru for 10 years, Congress won on 12 of the 17 seats, while two seats went to SAD and three to independents.

While Congress and SAD had contested these elections on all 19 seats, BJP fielded 14 candidates, AAP 18 and BSP had one candidate in fray. BanurIn Banur, which was once the stronghold of SAD under late Captain Kanwaljit Singh, the Akali Dal managed to win on only one seat, while the remaining 12 went to Congress. SAD had fielded eight candidates, while Congress contested from all seats. Even AAP had contested from seven wards, but was not picked anywhere. BJP did not even enter the fray here. In the last term, Congress had six members in the House, SAD four, three were independents and one member was from BJP.KuraliKurali voted for Congress on nine of the 17 seats. Winning five seats, independent candidates here bagged more seats than the SAD (2) and BJP (1). For the past one decade, SAD was ruling the House. In 2015, SAD-BJP had won nine seats, Congress six and two were won by independents, who later joined SAD. Nayagaon It’s only in Nayagaon where SAD managed to save face by securing 10 of the total 21 seats, yet could not secure a majority. Here, Congress won on six seats, while three went to BJP and two to independents. Nayagaon, which falls under the Kharar assembly constituency, is represented by AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu. Congress and SAD fielded all candidates, while BJP contested from 15 wards and AAP from seven. In the last term, SAD ruled the council with only its councillors in the House.KhararCongress secured the most seats in Kharar, winning in 10 of the 27 wards, but could not manage a majority, leading to a hung house just like in Nayagaon. Here, eight independents won, the most in all seven councils, while SAD also clinched eight seats and one went to AAP.

18-02-2021||Chandigarh||HC initiates contempt proceedings against Haryana CJM for ‘disobeying order’||The Punjab and Haryana high court has initiated contempt proceedings against a Haryana chief judicial magistrate, observing that prime facie he had violated court orders, which warranted disciplinary action.The high court bench of justice Manoj Bajaj, while seeking response from Yamunanagar chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Arvind Kumar observed that the officer passed the order in question despite the HC directions being ‘absolutely clear and unambiguous’.The CJM, in his January 13 order, had dismissed the plea of one Puran Chand Sharma, who upon the HC’s directions had approached the CJM court seeking release of the ₹1.1 lakh deposited by him in a criminal case. The judicial officer dismissed the plea for release of money observing that the February 2014 order, in which Sharma was asked to deposit the money ‘carried prohibition against the release of the amount till the disposal of the case, instead of trial’.Justice Bajaj observed that after a court order, Sharma had deposited the requisite amount on March 3, 2014 with the trial court and was granted bail. As per conditions imposed at the time, it was ordered that the amount deposited would be finally adjusted against the claim of the complainant against the petitioner (Sharma), if any, in civil litigation. The trial ended with Sharma’s acquittal and thereafter, Sharma moved an application before the high court for directions to the CJM court to release the deposited amount. Acting on the same, the high court on November 6, 2020 had ordered that the amount deposited by the petitioner be refunded to him. However, the CJM dismissed the plea filed by Sharma for release of the said amount.“ ..prima facie this court is of the opinion that the chief judicial magistrate, Yamunanagar at Jagadhri, while passing the impugned order has not only shown judicial indiscipline warranting disciplinary action, but has deliberately and wilfully disobeyed the orders of this Court and this amounts to contempt of Court,” justice Bajaj observed, issuing notice of motion on the plea for February 25.The bench further observed that even though notices were yet to be served to Sharma against the appeal filed in that acquittal case, the trial court declined the prayer compelling him to seek clarification or direction from the high court. Apart from it, the condition contained in the February 2014 order was imposed in a pre-arrest bail matter and could not have been stretched beyond the conclusion of the trial, the bench added.Sharma had to deposit the said money in securing a pre-arrest bail in a case of criminal intimidation among others charges registered at police station in Yamunanagar on September 16, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-initiates-contempt-proceedings-against-haryana-cjm-for-disobeying-order-101613593022897.html

The party’s candidates won by huge margins on most seats, even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged discrepancies in counting at some places.In all, the grand old party bagged 81 out of the total 112 seats in the six municipal councils of Khanna, Jagraon, Samrala, Raikot, Doraha and Payal. It also emerged victorious in ward number 8 of Mullanpur Dakha nagar panchayat, where bypolls were held. It, however, lost to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the bypoll at ward number 6 of Sahnewal nagar panchayat.The SAD remained the first runner up in the district, winning 15 seats in all. It won six seats in Khanna, five in Samrala, two in Doraha and one in Payal. The party failed to bag any seat in Raikot. The party had fielded 86 candidates in all. The Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile, was reduced to just two seats in the entire district. Its two winning candidates were from the Khanna municipal council. The party had fielded only 45 candidates in view of the growing hostility against it in the backdrop of the farm protests on Delhi borders. A large number of turncoat leaders from BJP, in fact, fought on SAD tickets. It is for the first time in several years that the SAD and BJP fought the elections separately in Punjab. It is pertinent to mention that the SAD had severed ties with the BJP last year, over the issue of farm laws. AAP won two seats in Khanna and one in Doraha but failed to add any seat to its kitty from the other municipal councils. While the AAP had fielded candidates on 109 seats, Bahujan Samaj Party was vying for 13 seats. The BSP did not win a single seat. As many as 123 independents had also fought the election, of which 11 emerged victorious. Of these, four independents were from Khanna, five from Jagraon and one each from Doraha and Payal. AAP alleges discrepancies in countingMeanwhile, the AAP alleged discrepancies in the counting process in Jagraon and Raikot. The party staged protests and blocked the Raikot main road and National Highway-5 near Jagraon for over two hours, seeking recounting of votes. The protest was still going on outside the counting centre in Jagraon at the time of filing of this report.SAD’s Jagraon unit president Gurcharan Singh Grewal said, “The Congress party used every unethical tactic to threaten our candidates, but our 16 candidates still came out victorious. Our councillors will continue to serve the public and we will actively perform the duties of opposition in the municipal councils.”Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said the counting remained largely peaceful and there was no report of any untoward incident from any part of the district.The counting had begun around 9am and as soon as the results were declared, Congress supporters burst into celebrations, and danced to the beats of dhols and took out victory rallies. Some of the vehicles, used by the party during its road show, were seen bearing the flags of farmers union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/clean-sweep-for-congress-in-all-six-municipal-councils-of-ludhiana-101613590863201.html

The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) enjoys the backing of the community.Yediyurappa has gone out of his way to make assurances, which he may not be able to keep, in the hope to consolidate support from communities that back the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and those seen backing others to help its chances of returning to power in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/fresh-demand-for-reservation-by-vokkaligas-add-to-cm-yediyurappa-s-challenges-101613589086351.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress, BJP gear up for protests across state||The Congress has announced that it will take to the streets against the Central government over hike in fuel prices, while the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is planning a jail bharo agitation against state government on February 24 over the disconnection of power for non-payment of bills in the state.State Congress chief Nana Patole said the party will announce a statewide protest against fuel and gas prices hike after the meeting of their parliamentary board next week. “Modi had attacked the previous Manmohan Singh government for fuel price hike and assured the people of the country of reducing the price once elected to power. Today, petrol and diesel prices have touched ₹96 and ₹86 for one litre respectively, while domestic gas cylinder costs ₹800,” he said.Patole said the Modi government has been acting in the interest of a few select industrialists, by hurting the interest of the general public. “Despite the fall in crude oil prices, retail prices of fuel are on the rise every day. If international crude oil prices are considered, petrol should be sold at ₹35 for one litre in the country. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has expressed his helplessness in Rajya Sabha over rising prices,” he said.The state Congress chief also questioned why celebrities such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar are silent even after fuel prices skyrocketing. “When petrol price touched ₹70 a litre during Manmohan Singh government’s tenure, Bachchan and Kumar had expressed their anger on social media. Why are they silent now? Are they afraid of the Modi government?” he questioned.On the other hand, the BJP took on the state government for power disconnection move undertaken by the state discom for non-payment of bills by domestic consumers. Former energy minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the party would stage a state-wide jail bharo protest if their demands are not met. Their demands include directions to stop the disconnection drive, rectification of excessive bills issued during the lockdown, and free electricity to consumers with usage of less than 100 units.“Government authorities have started disconnecting electricity supply to more than 6 million farmers and domestic consumers for non-payment of bills. Farmers and the common people are not in position to pay the bills owing to crop loss and Covid-19 lockdown. The state had announced to give free electricity to consumers with less than 100 unit usage, but has failed to keep the promise. The government also backtracked on its promise to rectify excessive bills issued during lockdown. We will stage unprecedented jail bharo if the government does not act immediately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-bjp-gear-up-for-protests-across-state-101613590444158.html

In addition to the 23 centres at government hospitals and Covid-19 jumbo facilities, Jaslok, Dr LH Hiranandani and Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospitals are administering vaccines to their staff. Public hospital Cama and Albless also started a vaccination centre.The three private hospitals are among 20 private hospitals shortlisted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to join the vaccination drive. Sixteen more private hospitals are expected to set up vaccination centres for their healthcare staff. All 20 will continue to function as vaccination centres once BMC enters the third phase of the drive, in which senior citizens and those in the general public with comorbidities will be inoculated. About 3 million Mumbaiites will qualify for vaccination in this phase, according to BMC’s door-to-door survey.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is also in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “All 20 hospitals have a go-ahead from us to remain vaccination centres during the third phase, if they chose to do so. Over the next few days, all 20 will start functioning as vaccination centres for their own healthcare workers.On Wednesday, 8,400 beneficiaries were inoculated in Mumbai, of which 1,374 were HCWs who got their first dose of the vaccine and 393 HCWs received the second dose. While the turnout for HCWs was 59%, it was 115% for frontline workers (FLWs) with 6,633 FLWs receiving the first dose.

This was followed by forming teams in the city to ensure that banquet and marriage hall owners are taking adequate safety measures of not allowing gathering of more than 50 people at a time.Last week, BMC also announced that though state had allowed reopening of colleges from February 15, the civic body will take a final call for colleges in the city after February 22.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday said, “We need to ensure that we do not lower our guards. Covid-19 has not gone anywhere. The city might head towards lockdown if citizens do not follow Covid-19 precautions. There were deliberations to reopen school in next two to three days, but now even that has been postponed.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are witnessing an increase in cases, and any further decision on relaxations or restrictions will be taken by BMC after a review meeting on February 22. Citizens have to continue wearing mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently to curb the spread of Covid-19.”He added, “We are targeting marriages and social gatherings for which ward officers have been given targets. I have asked officers to visit shopping malls, restaurants, clubs, etc., to ensure Covid-19 compliance at these establishments.”Meanwhile, Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Maharashtra Covid-19 taskforce, said, “We are seeing a surge in cases and Mumbai is slowly heading towards red zone again. To avoid any further worsening of the situation, BMC needs to reinforce the basics. This includes strict masking, testing, tracing, quarantining. We need to regulate all types of gatherings and ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed here.”According to figures by the state health department, Mumbai’s fatality rate stands at 3.61% while 298,933 patients have recovered, taking the recovery rate to 94.67%. The city’s overall positivity rate is 10.30% and 3.058 million tests have been conducted so far, according to BMC data.The city’s average growth rate is 0.16%, but in areas like Mulund, Chembur, Sion, Goregaon, it is above 0.20%. City’s active cases stand at 4,530 with the highest number of active cases from western suburbs including Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Andheri etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-700-new-covid-19-case-mark-after-over-a-month-101613590083270.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||When will Mumbai-Pune e-way toll collection stop, Bombay HC asks state||The Bombay high court (HC) has sought to know from the state government as when it will stop toll collection on Mumbai-Pune expressway. The directive came on a public interest litigation (PIL) that complained that the total capital outlay of the project had been recovered in 2019, but toll was still being collected. The PIL further alleged that the excess toll collected has been pocketed by the contractor who was assigned the contract of toll collection till 2019.The PIL, while seeking directions to Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to discontinue the toll collection contract, also urged that the toll amount collected by the contractor since 2019 be deposited to the state exchequer. When the PIL filed by advocate Pravin Wategaonkar came up for hearing before the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, the court expressed concerns over the continuation of toll collection on Mumbai-Pune Expressway. In the praecipe moved by Wategaonkar and other petitioners Sanjay Shirodkar, Vivek Velankar and Shrinivas Ghanekar, the court was informed that the previous contract had exceeded its collection target of ₹4,330 crore in the 15-year contract period which ended in 2019 by nearly ₹2,343 crore. The bench has asked MSRDC whether it had received the excess toll revenue. In view of the submissions, justice Kulkarni expressed concerns and agreed that travelling from Mumbai to Kolhapur entailed paying a large sum towards toll. “Till when do you plan to continue collecting toll, now that the project cost is recovered,” justice Kulkarni asked MSRDC. He also enquired whether the government was receiving its share of toll revenue from the contractor as it raised a larger issue of public interest. While responding to the court’s query, the advocate for MSRDC said the contract has been given after payment of upfront amount by the contractor and the government had a right to collect toll in view of the Motor Vehicles Act. He further sought time to file a detailed reply to address the other queries, which was allowed. The court while directing MSRDC to file a reply within two weeks also asked it to serve copy to the petitioner and directed listing of the PIL ‘High on Board’ after three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/when-will-mumbai-pune-e-way-toll-collection-stop-bombay-hc-asks-state-101613589849440.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Notify mangroves as reserved forest: Maharashtra mangroves cell to JNPT||The state mangrove cell has written to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to begin the process of notifying mangrove land in its possession as reserved forest, in compliance with a Bombay high court (HC) order. In a letter issued to the chairman of JNPT on February 12, Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests and an ex-officio executive director of the state mangrove foundation, asked the port authority to notify mangrove area under its control under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, “at the earliest”. Once notified, the mangrove area has to be handed over to the mangroves cell for better conservation. “It has come to our notice that JNPT has not yet started the process of notifying mangrove land despite a court order in 2018. Since we do not have any information regarding mangrove area owned or controlled by the JNPT, we had been waiting for the port trust to start the process on its own. Since it has not happened, we have now written to them to start the process at the earliest,” said Tiwari. In 2005, an interim order by the HC had stated that all mangrove areas on government land were to be handed over to the forest department. The HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018. While district bodies are yet to hand over 1,592.8 hectare (ha) of mangrove land, state agencies such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and JNPT have failed to transfer approximately 1,147 ha to the forest department. An email to the JNPT spokesperson did not elicit any response. However, HT has accessed a letter issued to the mangrove cell on January 16, in which JNPT had sought details on its share of mangrove land to be transferred to the state forest department. In December last year, environment group Vanashakti had issued contempt notices to all Konkan district collectors, the Konkan divisional commissioner and JNPT for failing to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction to the Maharashtra forest department. In January this year, Vanashakti filed a petition in the HC seeking immediate transfer of all mangrove lands to the forest department. “After receiving the notices, the state agencies have now started acting on the court order. JNPT is yet to transfer around 900ha of mangroves land,” said Stalin D, founder and director of Vanashakti.“This letter from the mangrove cell to JNPT is a welcome development. As per JNPT’s official admission on its website, there is 900ha of mangroves in its area. By the thumb rule of 1,000 mangroves-per-hectare, JNPT is sitting on 900,000 mangroves,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, another NGO that has been complaining of destruction of mangroves in the JNPT special economic zone (SEZ).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/notify-mangroves-as-reserved-forest-maharashtra-mangroves-cell-to-jnpt-101613589848230.html

She asked food stall operators at stations, stall owners outside railway stations and passengers inside local trains to wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands and use sanitiser.Pednekar had on Tuesday said, “If citizens do not follow Covid-19 guidelines, there will be no option for the state but to go for another lockdown. It is on the citizens to ensure that proper masking, sanitisation and social distancing are maintained.”Apart from this, BMC has also set up squads on ward level to keep a watch on passengers travelling in local trains without wearing a mask.According to railway officials, daily around 3.7 million passengers are travelling via Western and Central Railways.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday directed district authorities to strictly enforce the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down to facilitate unlocking in the state. Taking a serious note of the laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour, Thackeray had warned that a lockdown would be imposed again if people do not prevent crowding or wear masks in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-takes-local-train-to-work-appeals-citizens-to-wear-mask-101613589662770.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get new skill development university, 6 centres of excellence||In a bid to increase skilled manpower and increase employment opportunities in the state, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday approved a proposal to set up its first public skill development university and six centres of excellence (CoE) that would offer degree and post-graduate courses. The government will introduce a bill in this regard in the budget session of the state legislature which will start on March 1.Maharashtra currently has one private skill development university in Pune, while there are seven other such universities across the country, including three private ones. According to skill development minister Nawab Malik, currently, the skill development courses are largely limited to diploma courses. He added that the proposed university will provide courses keeping in mind the requirement of the day and the future.“There will be degree and post-graduate courses offered through the university. Besides that, different colleges will be allowed to offer skill development courses. Courses will be designed keeping in mind the requirement of the industries so that more and more people get trained and get jobs,” said Malik. “We will also have six CoEs, which will be sub-centres of the university. Campus training and the courses will be conducted at these sub-centres,” he added. The CoE will be set up in each of the six revenue divisions of the state. “The university will receive annual funding of ₹50 crore from the government for 10 years, following which it will become a self-sustaining university,” Malik said.Meanwhile, the state is still deliberating where to set up the university. Some of the short-listed locations include Mumbai, Thane and Pune. “We are still discussing where to set up the university; whether to do it in Mumbai, Thane or Pune or around the [Mumbai-Nagpur] Samruddhi Mahamarg. We intend to set it up near a city so that it is easier for faculty and students, and so that they get all the facilities,” Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-get-new-skill-development-university-6-centres-of-excellence-101613589542824.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to depute 300 marshals at railway stations for mask check||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will depute 300 marshals at railway stations across the city by the end of the week to enforce the rule of wearing face masks in public places. Since local train services have resumed for the general public, Mumbai has seen a spike in the number of reported cases of Covid-19. Wearing the face mask is mandatory for all those travelling by local train. Health officials believe the violation of Covid-safety norms while travelling in trains is a contributing factor to the uptick in the number of cases. To ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among commuters, BMC will station 100 marshals on Western (WR), 100 marshals on Central (CR) Railway and 100 marshals on Harbour line. “Since we are still fighting the pandemic, people cannot be careless and need to follow all precautionary measures to stop further spread of the infection. So we have decided to keep marshals at railway stations to implement safety rules by issuing fines,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In April 2020, BMC had issued a directive that set a fine of ₹1,000 for being outdoors without wearing a mask and/ or spitting in public places. The penalty was reduced to ₹200 in September after citizens complained that the amount was too high. Since February 1, when local trains opened up to the general public after almost a year, on an average of 2 million people are using local trains daily. Although social distancing is among the prescribed Covid-safety norms, commuters have reported overcrowding and maintaining a one-metre distance from the next person to be a significant challenge. “Buses and trains are as crowded as they used to be earlier [before the lockdown] due to reduced frequency and high demand for public transport. It is all the more essential, therefore, that masks be used by everyone,” said Dr Vispi Jokhi, chief executive officer, Masina Hospital. Commuters have also complained that few are taking Covid guidelines seriously, particularly in matters like wearing face masks. “People keep their masks below the mouth, and don’t use a handkerchief when sneezing or coughing. Then they hold the side handle bars without sanitising their hands. We never know who is infected, which makes me anxious,” said Shreyas Salvi, who runs a construction firm and has been travelling daily from Vasai from Borivli for work. Dr Jokhi said wearing face masks properly offered almost as much protection as the vaccine. “The [face] mask protocol is almost 80% as effective as the vaccine in terms of the control of the pandemic as it reduces the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. Although the vaccination drive in India is at a nascent stage, if coupled with the precautions of maintaining [face] mask protocol, then we have a better chance to control the pandemic and ensure the second wave doesn’t come in the country,” said Dr Jokhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-depute-300-marshals-at-railway-stations-for-mask-check-101613589483227.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||20% students needed help for mental health issue but never sought help during their IIT stint||A survey of some students of the graduating batch of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has revealed that at least 20% needed to consult a mental health professional during their time at the institute, but never sought one, while 16.3% consulted a mental health professional for a brief period and 5.6% received counselling through their stay.However, 55.8% of students who participated in the survey said they never needed any such help throughout their course.These figures were part of the Senior Survey released by the institute’s in-house magazine, Insight, this week.“Stigma attached to mental health is a big problem and to date, seeking professional help from mental health experts is considered a sign of weakness and low confidence. This could be one of the reasons for students to not seek help despite having the opportunity to do so anonymously on campus,” said a mental health expert who formerly worked with IIT-B.He added that the institute has a professional set-up and students are always encouraged to share their concerns, however, since many students come from smaller cities, they are still not open to the idea of sharing their problems.The survey, which took into account responses from 215 students from the graduating batch, also shed light on the time these students spent on campus, their future plans as well as their political inclinations, to name a few.Demographically, a majority of the students came from Maharashtra, followed by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Of these, 32.5% grew up in metros while 38.6% and 23.7% came from small cities and towns across the country, respectively.According to the survey, almost 38.4% of the respondents admitted to being chain smokers, revealing that they smoked around a pack a day, whereas one in 10 students admitted that they rarely smoke or smoke at least once a day.“A lot of students start smoking once they joined the institute because they allegedly find it easier to try such vices once they are away from their families, while others just fall prey to peer pressure,” said a student of the institute, on condition of anonymity.Almost 50% of respondent agreed that they used unfair means at the time of submission of assignments/projects as well as in quizzes, due to various reasons including lack of confidence or no interest in the course.The survey further revealed that almost 40% of the respondents were neither happy with the hostel nor the food served in the hostel mess. Nearly 25.4% of respondents also highlighted how studying in the competitive environment of the IIT did not help them develop any social skills.Around 38.1% of the respondents said they planned to appear for the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations), whereas 27.9% will appear for the Common Admissions Test (CAT) for MBA admissions. “Of those surveyed, 74.2% said that job-wise, they have been posted in India, whereas 12% have been posted in the US, and another 4.7% have been posted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan,” highlighted the survey.In terms of political inclination, 21.4% said they were inclined towards the left, 18.5% were inclined towards the right and around 37.6% stated that they had no political inclination at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20-students-need-help-for-mental-health-issues-during-iit-b-stint-survey-101613589422927.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||2 held for destruction of mangroves in Mumbai’s Mahul area||Almost a fortnight after the state mangrove cell found evidence of destruction of mangroves on government land at Mahul in Chembur, it arrested two persons on Wednesday.On February 4, Neenu Somaraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell) had visited Mahul following complaints of debris dumping and illegal construction on the protected land.On Wednesday, the mangroves cell arrested the accused, Rani Mani Arjun and Shafiqullah Chaudhary for illegally dumping debris on the mangrove land. The arrests were made under sections 63 (penalty for counterfeiting or defacing marks on trees and timber and for altering boundary marks0 and 26 (1) a, d, f, and h (punishment for prohibited acts in forests) of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Somaraj said that since the land belongs to the state government, the mangroves cell will work with all stakeholders and decide on joint action for the restoration of the mangroves and wetlands in the area. Earlier this month, NGO Vanashakti had written to the state government and the mangrove cell, highlighting the extensive destruction of mangroves, wetlands and buffer zones in Mahul. Citing that Vanashakti had documented the destruction, Stalin D, founder of the NGO, said, “Close to 700 truckloads of debris and mud have been dumped on mangroves and wetlands, over an area of around 10 acres or more. In some locations, the dumped material is over 15 metres high. Construction pillars are also coming up on the reclamation. Illegal road admeasuring almost half a kilometre has been made by dumping debris on mangroves near an SRA building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-held-for-destruction-of-mangroves-in-mumbai-s-mahul-area-101613589182883.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government clears Metro Neo line in Pimpri||The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to extend the Pune Metro from Pimpri to Nigdi. The 4.41-km elevated Metro Neo corridor is being built as an additional route after the Pune-Swargat Metro corridor was altered. The project will have three stations between Pimpri and Nigdi, including Nigdi, Akurdi and Chinchwad.Metro Neo is the rubber tyre-based articulated bus system which will draw power from an overhead electric conductor. It will have a dedicated elevated right of way which will ensure uninterrupted mass transit of commuters. Being implemented by the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation, the project will cost ₹946.73 crore. The Centre will fund 10% of the cost, while the state government will provide ₹170.3 crore, including ₹90.63 crore as a secondary loan. Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will also chip in with funds, while the remaining 60% will be raised through loans, said a government official.The official added that the clearance for the project was stuck due to a change in the percentage of funds provided by Centres and state. As per an earlier practice, the Central and state government would provide 20% of the funds, each. “But since the Central government had said it would provide 10% of the funds, the matter had come before the state government for its approval,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-clears-metro-neo-line-in-pimpri-101613589003069.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government clears policy to allow caravan tourism, parks||In a boost to tourism in the state, the Maharashtra government has cleared the caravan policy, which will allow private players to get the vehicles for tourism and setting up of caravan parks in public and private places. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. Maharashtra is the third state after Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka to get such a policy. Specially built vehicles (home on wheels) used for the purpose of travel, leisure and accommodation are called caravans. A caravan park is a place where caravans can stay overnight in allocated spaces, providing basic or advanced amenities and facilities to the travellers. According to officials, the policy is expected to help provide an experience other than the traditional stays and family trips at hotels and resorts. It will allow appropriate use of no-development zones, promote tourism in remote areas and also create job opportunities in the state, they said. Each caravan is expected to have facilities such as beds for stay at night, kitchen, toilet, sofa and table for comfort of the travellers and maintenance of proper hygiene. The state government has allowed use of different sets of caravans – single axle and twin axle caravans, folding caravan, camper trailer – under the policy. One of the essential pre-requisites for caravan tourism is the presence of sufficient caravan parks in the identified circuits. “The policy is to allow privately owned caravans to be used on trips and encourage them. They will come under the tourism policy and will be eligible for all incentives in stamp duty and registration, electricity duty and Good and Services Tax (GST),” said Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, state tourism department. The concept of caravan tourism has gained popularity across the world owing to the freedom and flexibility it provides while holidaying, along with itineraries and accommodation. It promotes family-oriented tours even in circuits and destinations, which don’t have adequate hotel accommodation. There are many places where the state cannot build any structure as they come under NDZ (no-development zone) or CRZ (coastal regulation zone) laws or near heritage sites or forest. “The areas where construction is not permitted by the law, caravans can be allowed and they can do well in these areas because one can go on a foothill, park the caravan and explore it,” she said. The state government has also allowed setting up of caravan parks at public and private places by the owner or a developer. “We will be setting up caravan parking bays across the state. Like abroad, 10-15 caravans can be parked at a particular place. The land available from irrigation department, forest department, revenue department or MTDC etc. will be identified and developed as caravan parking bays having all the basic infrastructure water, electricity, security, safety. A memorandum of understanding will be signed with the private tour operator for its use,” the principal secretary said. The state will also allow developing hybrid parks. It means a private tour operator can tie up with a resort for using its open space as a caravan parking bay. For instance, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) can tie up with any caravan operator for it, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-clears-policy-to-allow-caravan-tourism-parks-101613588703078.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees biggest 1-day Covid case spike in 70 days; curbs slapped in 7 districts||After 21 of Maharashtra’s 36 districts reported a rise in active Covid-19 patients between February 9 and February 15, at least seven of them have imposed restrictions on the movement of people, while the state government has reiterated its warning of imposing a lockdown if the case curve keeps moving northward. Experts have also attributed the spike in cases to a drop in tests and poor contact-tracing in districts where cases are on the rise.Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 4,787 new Covid-19 cases (second 4,000-plus spike in the past four days) and 40 deaths, taking the tally to 2,076,092 and toll to 51,631.More importantly, Wednesday’s spike in infections is Maharashtra’s highest in the past 70 days. The state had earlier clocked 4,981 cases on December 9. Amid the rise in cases, the district administrations in Amravati, Nagpur, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Akola, Parbhani and Jalna have either restricted gatherings to less than five people or have started to strictly implement the standing government standard operating procedure (SOP) that was meant to facilitate unlocking. The district administrations are also fining people heavily for not following SMS (social distancing, masking and sanitising) protocol, besides keeping schools and colleges shut for at least another two weeks.In a video conference with the district collectors and municipal commissioners, Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health department, had directed to ramp up contact-tracing in the ratio of 1:20. “Aggressive tracing and testing could help them in bringing the positivity rate in control. They have been told to take help of revenue and police machinery to keep the crowding under control and for the awareness among people. The districts and corporations have also been directed to revive the containment zones and seal the affected areas,” an official from the department said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reiterated the government’s stand and said if the people do not follow the protocol the government will be forced to impose lockdown. He also warned that the state will have to pay a heavy price if cases continued to rise. “In some cases, 5,000 to 10,000 invitees attend wedding ceremonies, people forget to wear masks and maintain social distancing. In local trains in Mumbai, too, we have been witnessing heavy crowding. The positivity rate in some of the districts is high. We will have no option, but to impose the lockdown if this continues,” he said.The daily caseload in districts like Pune (864), Nashik (114), Nagpur (512), Amravati (625) continued to be on the rise. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) reported 1,237 cases on Wednesday with the highest contribution from Thane (113) and Kalyan-Dombivli (131) after Mumbai.In the past week (February 9-15), as many as 21 districts have witnessed a rise in active cases, while the weekly positivity rate in few districts such as Amravati (24.79%), Akola(20.94%), Nashik (16.31%) has been much above the state rate. The state administration has expressed concerns over the poor contact tracing and testing. In districts with high positivity rate, the per million test rate isreported to be poor. Buldhana (568), Dhule (568), Nanded (670) were among the top districts with low rate of per million testing.Dropped testing and poor tracking is also one of the reasons for the rise in the cases and positivity rate, according to public health experts. The daily testing in the state dropped to 48,705 in past 16 days in February, against the daily average of 60,308 tests in January. Against the protocol of tracing of 20 contacts per positive patients, many districts saw it much below the parameter. “With the drop in the cases over last three months, the district authorities had stopped taking it seriously, clinically and administratively. The spike in the cases is also because of it,” said the official from the health department. “There should be strict tracking and testing across the state. It is true that the administrations in some areas have lowered their guard in term of tracking and testing, but they should immediately take corrective measures,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “We have been conducting about 60,000 tests per day. But the tests in the districts and areas with the rise in cases and positivity, the testing has been increased. The district administrations have been directed to go for aggressive contact tracing and testing.”Dr Awate said the cold wave witnessed in parts of the state, recently held gram panchayat elections in over 14,000 panchayats, crowd at the wedding ceremonies and public gatherings are mainly the reasons for spike in cases. “We have been concentrating on the districts with high number of cases and the positivity rate. Our state level teams of experts visited these districts to take a review and guide local administration,” he said.Meanwhile, the turnout for the vaccination with the first dose to healthcare and frontline workers continued to remain low. 7959 HCWs and 21,112 FLWs took their first shot, while 7065 HCWs turned up for their second dose of vaccine. Of the 1,054,822 registered HCWs, 575,046 have taken their first dose and 16,181 the second dose of vaccine. 186,279 FLWs of the total 5,94,471 enrolled on CoWIN app have taken their first dose after vaccination for them began from February 03.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-biggest-1-day-covid-case-spike-in-70-days-curbs-slapped-in-7-districts-101613587982988.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari directs to hold election for Speaker’s post||In a rare development, Governor BS Koshyari has directed the Maharashtra legislature to hold elections for the post of Speaker of the Assembly, which is lying vacant following the resignation of Nana Patole who was appointed as state Congress chief. Koshyari’s directive assumes significance in the context of the on-going tussle between him and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state. It also comes barely a week after Thackeray denied a state aircraft to Koshyari to travel to Uttarakhand last Thursday. Koshyari has written a letter to the state legislature secretariat on Tuesday in connection with the Speaker’s election.Patole resigned as Speaker on February 4 to take up new responsibility as the state Congress president. The ruling coalition has been deliberating whether to hold the election at the beginning of the budget session of the state legislature that starts on March 1, or later. Coalition leaders are wary of holding the election immediately since it needs to be held through a secret ballot. MVA leaders are wary that the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may encourage cross-voting to defeat their nominee, which would mean the collapse of the Thackeray government. Koshyari, in his letter, directed the legislative secretariat to hold the election in the first week of the budget session, said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The issue was discussed in a state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The ministers expressed unhappiness over the move. “This is the first time the Governor wrote such a letter as he cannot issue such a directive without the recommendation of the state government,” said a senior minister, on condition of anonymity.The ministers also expressed discontent over the delay in appointment of 12 names under the Governor’s quota to the legislative Council. It has been over three months since the state cabinet recommended the 12 names to Koshyari to nominate them to the upper House as per the norms, on November 6, last year.Rule 6 of the Maharashtra legislative Assembly rules states: “If more than one member has been so nominated, the Assembly shall proceed to elect the Speaker by ballot.”Deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal is in charge of the Speaker’s responsibilities at present.Last Thursday, the Thackeray government had denied permission to Koshyari to use the state’s aeroplane to travel to Dehradun. This has led to a controversy and blame game between the Raj Bhavan secretariat and the state.According to Raj Bhavan, Koshyari had reached the international airport and even boarded the state’s aircraft, but he was told that the plane would not take off as the chief minister’s office (CMO) had not approved the travel. Consequently, permission to fly had not been sought from the aviation authority. The Governor then took a commercial flight to Dehradun.The CMO blamed the secretariat for the entire episode.

He, however, went ahead with the move and got a good produce, which he sold in the open market to a trader. He received ₹4,000 per quintal on soya bean, a rate higher that other farmers from the neighbouring Satara district got. “I was happy about my decision. The rain was good and so was the produce. The rate I got was equally good,” said Tamgave. When asked if he participated in last year’s December 8 Bharat Bandh to extend support to the farmers protesting at Delhi borders against, the three farm laws, Tamgave answered in negative. Western Maharashtra, mainly known for the sugarcane produce, has largely been silent against the farm laws. The few protests were largely driven by political outfits such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and its leader Raju Shetti. On the eve of Republic Day, Shetti with his supporters took out a protest march on tractors from Sangli to Kolhapur. One reason, the region has not seen much protests is because sugarcane is a cash crop, for which the three laws may not directly be applicable, given that farmers have to sell their produce to nearby sugar factory. “The highly institutionalised cooperatives engaged in sugar sector, along with firms owned by farmers who purchase the agriculture produce, have largely kept the farmers assured about rates,” said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator Rohit Pawar, who is party chief Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew. For those growing other crops such as soya bean and wheat, the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act, 2003, adopted in 2006, allows farmers to sell their produce either at APMC markets or to private traders. The law was enacted during the NCP-Congress rule when Shetkari Sanghatana, one of the first farmers’ outfits in western India, had demanded for freeing agriculture. If farmers from North India have been excessively relying on single crop, their western Maharashtra counterparts have been cultivating multiple crops on small plots. The multiple crops along with vegetables, according to agriculture experts, have ensured that money flows into the hands of farmers. Sanjay Suryawanshi, a 53-year-old farmer from Loni Bhapkar village in Baramati tehsil, has been cultivating wheat and jowar in his 4.5-acre non-irrigated land. In 2020, Suryawanshi sold his 10 quintals of wheat grown on 0.5 part of the land at ₹1,500 per quintal to APMC in Baramati, Sharad Pawar’s home town. “I could hardly recover the money I had put in producing the wheat as I had to pay the head-loader, middlemen and transporter,” said Suryawanshi. He said if the Centre implements the three laws properly, there’s no problem with some of the provisions of the laws, such as contract farming. On minimum support price (MSP), he said that farmers are not getting much anyway. The critics of the farmers’ protest have often pointed out the benefits of contract farming, which is in existence in Maharashtra. One such firm – Baramati Agro – started by Rohit’s grandfather Appasaheb Pawar in 1988, underlined several benefits of contract farming. As per its website, the firm deals with various sectors such as animal and poultry feed, sugar and ethanol manufacturing, co-generation of power, trading of agri-commodities, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and retailing. Rohit said he has not faced any problem from farmers even while running a firm involved in contract farming. “One reason why our firm never faced issues from farmers is because we have always safeguarded their interests. However, the same cannot be said about big companies whose owners farmers may not even know.” On the current protests by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, Rohit said the main concern of farmers is on MSP. “Under MSP system, farmers can sell their produce to private players if they are getting better rates. However, under contract farming, farmers do not have this freedom [to sell produce to entities they have not signed agreement with]. The Centre is stressing that farmers have freedom to come out of contracts. However Clause 11 in the law says: “At any time after entering into a farming agreement, the parties to such agreement may, with mutual consent, alter or terminate such agreement for any reasonable cause”. This means unless both parties agree on the terms, they cannot come out of contract.” The farmers HT spoke to feel that the alternate arrangement of allowing produce outside APMC may not be bad if the mandis are going to stay. “I have been alternatively growing vegetables and pulses. I sell vegetables in APMC and pulses to private traders who pay in cash,” said Balaji Sawate, a farmer from Malshiras in Solapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-protest-sugarcane-hub-western-maharashtra-remains-largely-silent-101613587742796.html
18-02-2021||Other||Farm stir: In north Maharashtra, farmers divided over pvt traders, contract farming||Thirty-year-old Pandurang Kadali who owns a 4-acre plot at Suryagadh, a small hamlet in Nashik, is constantly worried about the fate of his land, which is a part of the forest area. Kadali wants the land rights of this plot, on which he has been cultivating from the past 15 years. “Despite promises and various agitations, the government is not transferring the land in our name. It’s our only asset and source of livelihood,” said Kadali. His father Madhukar was among the 35,000 farmers who had trekked 180km to Mumbai to press for their rights for land in March 2018.Somnath Aher’s situation is different. Aher cultivates a variety of crops such as sugarcane, onions, tomatoes and soya bean in 5 acres of land and earns at least ₹8- ₹10 lakh per annum. However, he rues that the government has not been supporting farmers like him. “The government announces various schemes such as subsidies on seeds, compensation for unseasonal rains and loan waivers, but they never reach us. We have to struggle as we get electricity for an average of just nine hours daily and at erratic timings. At times, we need to irrigate even at midnight,” said Aher.Kadali and Aher represent the farmers of northern Maharashtra, who are largely unaware of the three farm laws. They are more troubled by local issues which they face on a daily basis. Over 80 lakh people in this region depend on agriculture and predominantly cultivate onions, sugarcane, grapes, soya bean, tomatoes and bananas.Sahyadri Farms, a company of small farmers, said the farm laws will hardly create any impact in Maharashtra. “Farmers here have the freedom to sell where they want to and hence it does not make much of a difference to them,” said Vilas Shinde, managing director, Sahyadri Farms. He said even contract farming, which finds a prominent place in these laws, is prevalent in Maharashtra and farmers have already tied up with private parties. “We have grape farmers in Nashik who have inked contracts with wine-making companies. Such practices have been there in Maharashtra for years,” said Shinde.Aher agreed with Shinde and cited his own example. “I was getting ₹4,100 for 100-kg soya bean outside APMC (agriculture produce market committee), while the same produce was being offered ₹3,900 at APMC. So I sold my produce outside,” said Aher.Sandeep Ranapratap, who cultivates on his 2-acre land, has to work in a cushion-making unit to supplement his family income. “The produce in our farm is mainly for our household. I have to work outside to sustain my family,” said Ranapratap. He earns ₹300 as a daily wage worker in the unit.The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), which is affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), enjoys a strong base in north Maharashtra. It said there is lack of awareness on the laws among the farmers. “A majority of the farmers are unaware of the new laws and hence, we are spreading awareness of the ill-effects, among them,” said Sunil Malusare, joint secretary, AIKS (Maharashtra). “It’s true that there is not much opposition among the Maharashtra farmers like that expressed by the Punjab and Haryana farmers,” he added.Dattatray Ganpat Chile, whose family of five are engaged in the cultivation of the 3-acre land in Sawrichamal village, said he is not fully aware of the new farm laws. “There was neither an attempt by the government nor the opponents to educate us about the laws. Last year, I suffered a huge loss, as our cauliflower crop was destroyed due to unseasonal rains, and we didn’t even get any compensation. We are more worried about our crops than these laws,” said Chile. However, he cautioned that the government needs to ensure that small landholders are also accommodated in the law and that their land is not gobbled up by the corporates.Former state minister Sadabhau Khot and the chief of Rayat Kranti Sanghatana said farmers are not bothered as the new laws will not affect them. “The largest contract farming takes place in Nashik in the grape sector. These laws will not enslave the farmers but in fact make them stronger,” said Khot, who has been campaigning in favour of the laws across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-stir-in-north-maharashtra-farmers-divided-over-pvt-traders-contract-farming-101613587682703.html

Wearing masks in public is mandatory and violating this Covid-19 protocol attracts a fine of ₹200. According to BMC, the civic body has collected ₹30.96 crore in fines as of February 16. The highest fine collection was from K-West ward, which includes Andheri (West), Jogeshwari (West) and Oshiwara, where 108,912 citizens were fined of ₹2.22 crore. S ward (Bhandup, Powai and Vikhroli) came next with 85,119 citizens being fined ₹1.70 crore; followed by L ward (Kurla), where ₹1.69 crore was collected from 83,932 citizens. B ward, which is the smallest ward in the city and covers areas like Pydhonie and Bhendi Bazaar, has recorded the lowest collection with 30,876 citizens fined ₹61 lakh. Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Thursday directed BMC officials to register a case against a hotel in the western suburbs to which four citizens had fled instead of entering institutional quarantine upon returning from international travel. Passengers from the United Kingdom, Middle East, Europe and South Africa are required to quarantine because of new variants of Covid-19 have been found in these countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15-million-people-fined-30-96-crore-for-not-wearing-mask-mumbai-civic-body-101613587622768.html
18-02-2021||Other||Farm laws stir: At Maharashtra’s Vidarbha, farmers wary of private traders||The Vidarbha region has been in the news for ignominious reasons for decades. The region’s farmers, predominantly cotton growers, have remained in distress, and many of them have been driven to commit suicide, essentially due to non-remunerative income for their produce. But the locals in the epicentre of country’s farmer suicides are completely oblivious to the provisions of the new farm laws which have triggered massive protests in the national Capital for over two months. Dabhadi in crisis-ridden Yavatmal district is one such typical dry land village where 18 farmers have committed suicide in the past few years after being unable to bear the perils of perennial losses either due to the vagaries of nature, pricing or policy paradigms. Dabhadi hit the headlines in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in 2014 when Narendra Modi, then the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate, held ‘Chai Pe Charcha’, a nationally televised conversation with farmers. Promises made during the election campaign remained unfulfilled, villagers said. The situation in the village has not changed a bit, though farmers are receiving the dole of Rs6,000 per year, under the Modi government scheme started in 2019. “Modi had promised us so many things…better prices for our produce, facilities for value addition of crops, efficient crop insurance, among others. But the promises remained hollow as none of them materialised,” said 80-year-old Rajeshwar Dabhodkar, a former panchayat samiti member who was present at the Chai Pe Charcha event with Modi on March 20, 2014, at his village. Former sarpanch Santosh Take, who had interacted with Modi during the event, said that situation is just a shade better, but grossly unsatisfactory. He insisted that farmers must get remunerative prices for their produce. “We have both the open market and mandi but farmers hardly get the MSP (minimum support price) as private parties purchase the produce from the needy farmers at throwaway prices before the government comes out with MSP. This must stop,” he said. Pushpa Ingle, a newly elected gram panchayat member from Dabhadi village appreciated PM for transferring Rs6,000 annually to her husband’s account. But she believes that Modi did not keep the promises made during the Chai Pe Charcha event. Though the farmers of the region are not agitating as fiercely as their counterparts from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, they claim to be equally unhappy with the government over the prevailing prices of agriculture produce in the market, the approach of the banks and the government’s attitude in the event of a natural calamity. Ingle pointed out that Modi had in 2014 promised that if elected, his government would function as “kisan mitra (a friend of farmers)”, and that agriculture would be a priority sector, where farmers would feel proud to be in the profession. “But the situation in the villages is rife with suffering, anguish and misery. No one in the village is proud to be a farmer. In fact farmers find it difficult to get a bride,” said Ingle. He, along with all other 10 gram panchayat members of Dabhadi, have a Congress leaning and were elected last month by defeating BJP-supported candidates. But Ingle, Dabhodkar, Take and other farmers also admit that they have no idea about the three new farm laws which are being contested by the Opposition parties and the protesting farmers in Delhi. One reason being that the farmers at Dabhadi are so neck-deep worried about earning a living that they feel the new contentious farm laws are not worth their attention. This is perhaps the reason that Vidarbha has not so far witnessed any farmers’ agitation over the farm laws despite the fact that farmers continue to end their lives amid agrarian crisis. The Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti floated by Kishore Tiwari, the chairman of state-run Agriculture Mission, which has been documenting farmers’ suicide since 2002, claimed that as many as 12 farmers have killed themselves in the region since January, while the figure was 278 last year. Former Shetkari Sanghatana chief Vijay Jawandhia from Wardha, who was once vocal against the Congress’s agriculture policies, is today a disillusioned man on Modi’s agriculture policy. His disappointment stems from what he terms as “unfulfilled” promises made by PM to the region’s farmers ahead of the 2014 elections. Now that the Modi government is into its second term, farmers are still doubtful of any meaningful and visible changes in their lives. The uproar over the new agriculture laws has only emboldened their doubt, said Jawandhia. Farmers get a raw deal from the government for the rising input costs that they face and the wildly fluctuating prices they receive for their produce. Jawandhia believes farmers’ incomes in real terms have remained stagnant or even declined in several years. A dole of a few thousand rupees a year does not make much of a difference if one takes into account factors such as inflation, he said, while justifying the agitation in Delhi for repealing the farm laws. Farmers from Punjab and Haryana are now in a grinding standoff with the Modi government, demanding calling for the repeal of the three laws. One of the biggest changes in the laws is that farmers will be allowed to sell their produce at market price directly to private players – agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell a majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices. The reforms give farmers the option of selling outside the mandi system. Farmers at Vidarbha are mainly concerned that this will eventually lead to the end of wholesale markets and guaranteed prices, leaving them with no backup. If they are not satisfied with the price offered by a private buyer, they cannot return to the mandi or use it as a bargaining chip during negotiations, said Jawandhia, adding that the contentious reforms will loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce, which have protected India’s farmers from an unfettered free market for decades.Meanwhile Tiwari, a staunch Shiv Sena supporter, said he was in favour of the reforms. “In Maharashtra and particularly at Vidarbha, we have private mandis and farmers are being allowed to sell outside. But are they getting the remunerative prices for their produce?” he asked and insisted on a law for minimum guarantee price. He pointed out that Modi had promised that his government would ensure that it was always with farmers in every situation, provide quality seeds, fertilizers, crop credits, and crop insurance and formulate a progressive agriculture policy for the overall development of farmers during the Chai Pe Charcha event at Yavatmal. But in reality, farmers hardly got anything, he alleged. Tiwari says the banks are not farmers’ friendly. Over 40% of farmers from the region do not get crop loans from the banks on technical grounds and hence, they get trapped by moneylenders, agriculture traders and the mushrooming micro-finance institutions who charge exorbitant rates of interest. Unsurprisingly, for a large number of farmers, incomes are dwindling, he said and claimed that farmers end their lives because of the agricultural crisis in the region. The working president of Maharashtra Congress and former minister Shivajirao Moghe also said batted for a law on MSP, so that farmers have a sense of security instead of treading with trepidation about fetching remunerative prices for their produce. He also feels that there would be a monopoly on essential commodities, particularly on rice, wheat and pulses if the government allows corporate farming in the country. “The partial corporate farming and private trading of agriculture produce in Maharashtra totally failed and hence, the government should refrain from making a law in this regard,” he said, and announced that his party would , soon launch a massive agitation across the state against the new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-laws-stir-at-maharashtra-s-vidarbha-farmers-wary-of-private-traders-101613587562756.html

The weather-beaten building must be empty inside.Yet, it shelters very many people. Outside.Those people are nowhere to be seen this late afternoon but their residences are as visible as daylight. Their possessions—all the essential stuff that makes up a house—are laid out in a great display across the length of this building, on the footpath, here in central Delhi’s Ansari Road. One of the doors is clipped with a string on which are hanging shorts, pants, a pithu bag, and a hand bag, which has a white banian (vest) coming out of it. A sheet of plywood is plonked against the door. It is the size of a single bed, and perhaps is used by its owner to spread out on the ground at night as a bed.The building faces a motor workshop. A middle-aged mechanic, his clothes greased in black, wearily says, “Majdoor (labourers) live by this pavement... this is their home.” Currently, the labourers are away at work and are likely to return only by sunset, he says, slipping under the car he is repairing.Read more: Delhiwale: Vasudev’s worldLooking at these open-air living spaces feels like entering a gated apartment complex without permission.

18-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends Eknath Khadse’s interim protection to February 24||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday extended interim protection to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse against coercive action by the Enforcement Directorate till February 24. The court took the decision after it was informed by Khadse that he apprehended being arrested on responding to the summons issued to him by the investigating agency under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, for Khadse, stressed on the fact that while responding to the summons if he refused to disclose any incriminating evidence or documents during the interrogation, then the agency would invoke the power vested in the said section to arrest him on the grounds of non-cooperation. In view of this, Khadse was seeking quashing of not only the summon issued to him on December 23 but the proceedings arising out of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) filed by ED. While hearing Khadse’s petition, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale was informed by Ponda that Khadse was prompted to file the petition as he was apprehensive of being arrested in connection with the ECIR. He further said that though the NCP leader was not named in the ECIR, the report was prepared in view of the FIR registered against Khadse and others in the Bhosari land deal case at Pune. ED had, in an earlier hearing, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that the petition was not maintainable as the summons were actually show-cause proceedings and no appeal could lie against show cause proceedings. In response, Ponda submitted that the summons were issued by the ED director under section 50 of PMLA and hence the petition was valid. Singh then requested the court to allow the investigation agency to rely on previous judgements which held that petitions which challenged issuance of summons in show-cause proceedings were not maintainable, which the court allowed. After receiving an affirmative reply to whether ED will continue to not take coercive action, the court posted the petition for hearing on February 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-eknath-khadse-s-interim-protection-to-february-24-101613587383073.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body sets up call centre to meet vaccination target||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has set up a call centre to meet the daily immunisation target. A team of 12 people work at the call centre and make daily calls to 1,800 registered beneficiaries to prepare them for vaccination the next day. These callers also counsel those who have apprehensions to come for the immunisation. The civic body has also permitted walk-ins for registered healthcare and frontline workers. These measures have helped TMC to achieve a target of 97% immunisation, the highest in the district. The vaccination drive began on January 16 and by the first week of February, the city witnessed more than 100% immunisation with some centres going beyond the target set for the day. Gradually, the civic body also increased the number of vaccination centres to 12 and roped in private mid-level hospitals as well. “We have set up a team of 12 people who focus on calling the registered beneficiaries and preparing them for the vaccination process for the next day. Each person from this team makes around 150 calls per day. These calls also help understand if any individual has any apprehensions regarding the vaccine. We also counsel them and create awareness related to the vaccination process. As the call centre helps in reaching out to almost 2,000 beneficiaries, we can expect around 1,000 to 1,500 people to turn out on a daily basis; which helps us reach our target,” said Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer, Thane. With the start of the booster vaccination drive, the number of daily immunisation within Thane city has seen a dip. “In order to create awareness and ensure that the buzz related to the vaccines does not fade, we are urging senior officials to get vaccinated. This week, civic chief Vipin Sharma got vaccinated and two weeks ago commissioner of police Vivek Phansalkar got vaccinated. We are using various mediums to reach out to the public and highlight that the process does not have any major side effects,” added a senior health official from TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-sets-up-call-centre-to-meet-vaccination-target-101613587203091.html
18-02-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan civic body blames CoWIN glitches for slow vaccination||With only 58% of vaccination target for healthcare, frontline and police department workers achieved in Kalyan Dombivli so far, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) claimed it was facing various glitches while operating CoWIN app. The application is used for registration, data entry and sending messages to Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries.Civic officials said that staffers had to call up beneficiaries a number of times as the messages are not sent to them automatically through the app. The civic body, which is planning to start the second dose of vaccination, claimed those who have received the first dose, are not getting the messages. So far, KDMC has managed to give the second dose to 66 beneficiaries till Tuesday. “We have to send the messages to batches of people one after another as the messages are not sent automatically. This takes time, thus delaying the work. Those who have taken the first dose of vaccination should get the message for second dose automatically which is not happening,” said Ashwini Patil, data entry operator, KDMC. The employees also claimed the names of the beneficiaries are repeated, leading to confusion.“Sometimes even after a beneficiary is vaccinated, the name of that particular beneficiary is still seen in the list. This causes confusion; so we have to cross check and make changes accordingly and then call up some other beneficiary for vaccination,” added Patil. Apart from this, the app is also allegedly not allowing any fresh entry of healthcare workers, due to which the vaccination is delayed. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said,”There was technical issues earlier and we had reported about it. Now the app is working better way. However, since it is used all across the country, it sometimes has issues for time beingKDMC had on January 16, the first day of vaccination drive, met the target while getting all the work done manually.“With data entry of new health workers not happening on the app, we adjust them with frontline workers and give them the dose. We collect their data and try to do the entry later as the vaccination should not stop,” said an official from KDMC health department.According to KDMC records, 7,291 of the 9,075 listed health workers, which is 80% of the total target, have been vaccinated, and 1,499 of 8,856 frontline workers and police personnel, which is 23.7%, got vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-civic-body-blames-cowin-glitches-for-slow-vaccination-101613586782783.html

While doing this the beauty of old infrastructure and buildings will be retained, also underground work of water pipelines will be done. There will be separate space given for the parking lots for the tourists.”“To attract tourists at various spots street lighting will be done. The historical “Petit Library” in Mahabaleshwar will be renovated under this project,” said Pawar.Throughout the year tourists visit Mahabaleshwar and various points in and around the town.Last year due to Covid-19 pandemic all the tourist’s spots were closed down for public due to state government’s orders. Now gradually the tourist destinations and hotels are opening up for tourism purpose.Suryakant Jadhav, vice-president, Mahabaleshwar hotel owners association, said, “It is necessary to redevelop the hill station. Our only demand is that the state government while undertaking the project should take local shop owners in confidence and keep a check that less space of shops is acquired for the project.“There is a need for washrooms for tourists in Poonam chowk, as most of the time tourists go back to the hotel and if public toilets come up here it will be beneficial for shop owners and hoteliers,” he said.“Also, road construction work undertaken from Venna Lake toll naka to Mahabaleshwar market and Kshetra Mahabaleshwar road via Venna lake dam flyover bridge to Panchagani road should be completed soon. This will solve the traffic issue in the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-sanctions-rs-33-50-crore-to-redevelop-mahabaleshwar-on-the-lines-of-manali-shimla-101613586122746.html
18-02-2021||Pune||Taste of life: How an Italian barfi became a pop cultural icon in the Puneri peths||Around 1880, Federico Peliti, renowned Italian pastry chef and caterer living in India, went on a trip with a group of Italian friends to the island of Elephanta, a few miles from the coast of Mumbai. Known for his ability to serve a perfect lunch anywhere, he had brought with him everything he needed to prepare a grand feast on the island. He took a photograph which portrayed him in the company of his wife, his guests and some of the Indian servants against the backdrop of the island’s rupestrian temples. The element that strikes the most in this photograph is the presence of two male figures in the centre mimicking the typical Neapolitan gesture of eating spaghetti, pulling it up with their hands.Before the nineteenth century, the stereotype of Italians eating pasta was already widespread outside Italy. The stereotype, as it normally happens, was constructed by non-Italians, to identify and in some way mock the newcomers and their “strange” eating habits. However, the situation of the Italians in India was poles apart from that of their compatriots who immigrated to, say, America. In Anglo-Indian society, Italians were associated with a completely different food – sweets. And they were well aware that they were often identified with their pastry shops in Calcutta, Bombay and Poona. Therefore, a choice of pasta as a metaphor for Italian identity, as can be seen from the photograph by Peliti, can be attributed to the perception that Italians had of themselves and of their food culture, and to the desire to represent themselves and therefore, stand out through it, in India.Food acts as an essential cultural symbol on an individual as well as collective level. In India, the Italian confectioners were never a part of large or small local communities, hence, they were able to fully reproduce the food of their motherland. Since their clientele mostly comprised Europeans and the Indian elite, they and their pastry shops and restaurants were largely unknown to the natives. An exception to this was Enrico Muratore. While several celebrities like V Shantaram, Vishram Bedekar, PK Atre would regularly dine at Muratore’s, it was out of bounds for most of the population of Poona living in the peths. Still, Muratore and his pastries became part of the local pop culture in the first half of the 20th century.Muratore was an Italian migrant who started his confectionery and bakery on Main Street in Camp around 1898. He soon expanded his business to start a restaurant on the same premises and later shifted to East Street where Kwality restaurant and Kayani bakery are located today.Muratore was of course known for his confections and these confections became a symbol of “liberal, progressive, Western, and hence anti-religion and anti-national values”, as perceived by the locals. “Usha”, a Marathi magazine published from Mumbai, carried a short story written by one “Balwant Gopal” in February, 1932. The hero of this story travels to Germany to study. Upon his return to Poona after spending a few years in Berlin, his father insists that he travel to Nashik and perform certain religious rituals to “purify” himself. His wife refuses to talk to him till he seeks atonement (crossing the ocean, eating non-vegetarian food being the sins!). Our hero refuses. He quotes GG Agarkar and MG Ranade, the early Indian progressives. His father, a staunch follower of Tilak, reminds him of the virtues of “true Indian values”. He is finally made to leave his house when his father finds out that his son has been secretly dining at Muratore’s twice a week. The story ends by cautioning the readers about the perils of “Western” education and popularity of European and Irani restaurants.While a few other stories published in Marathi magazines like “Kirloskar”, “Mouj” and “Vasudha” mentioned Muratore and linked it with “liberal and Western” values, the real claim to fame (or notoriety!) was the mention of “Muratorechi barfi” (Muratore’s pastry) in songs specially composed for Ganeshotsav in Poona.The famed Ganesh festival in the early part of the last century was also known for its several song and dance troupes, known as Ganpati Mele. Children and young men who were part of these groups would sing songs and dance during the ten days of the festival. The songs were meant to inculcate patriotism and valour in the hearts and minds of the young and the old and make them aware of certain social issues. The songs often ridiculed and denigrated women who sought education, young men who frequented clubs and restaurants, widows who remarried, and progressive, liberal leaders like GK Gokhale and Pherozeshah Mehta.I have come across six songs sung by Shilimkar mela, Navtarun mela and Gopal mela which chided youth for embracing “modern” values. The youth in these songs all had a thing for “Muratorechi barfi’”. As the songs suggested, these young men espoused liberal values and hence, were anti-national. That the pastry baked by an Italian confectioner would be called by an indigenous name (barfi) and would symbolise values which went against popular, conservative beliefs is truly interesting. But, this is not the only interesting story about E Muratore and his restaurant. The Second World War triggered a chain of events that resulted in Muratore shutting down a few years after India gained independence. That story is for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-how-an-italian-barfi-became-a-pop-cultural-icon-in-the-puneri-peths-101613586121818.html

In any case, any area that fulfils the conditions of the definition of ”deemed forest” is to be protected by the forest department.Further, dumping of construction waste is not just prohibited on forest land but is also illegal in any public space, according to the Delhi Municipal Corporation ActThe forest department order came on a complaint received by the office of the deputy conservator of forests, stating that on November 4, 2020, the PWD was found undertaking “some kind of earth levelling work by dumping construction and demolition waste on the green belt”.Such activity was also noticed on November 19 and then again on December 10, according to the complaint.A follow-up on that complaint, sent on January 20, 2021, asserted that the activity was still continuing.Deputy conservator of forests Srivastava said no fine has been imposed on the PWD yet. “We have not levied any monetary penalty yet. The matter is being investigated now. Since the restraining order was issued, no fresh dumping has been noticed at the site,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-issues-restraining-order-to-pwd-for-dumping-construction-waste-on-forest-land-101613584562416.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi government leans on poll data for scaling up vaccine centres||The Delhi government will be using booth level poll data for further scaling up of Covid-19 vaccination centres to ensure a proportionate distribution of sites across the city, before the drive is opened to people aged over 50 years, which is likely to happen by mid-March, said senior government officials on Wednesday.The government estimates suggest that there are 4.24 million people in Delhi who are aged over 50 years. This is the biggest priority group in terms of numbers and opening up the vaccination drive to them would require a major scaling up of sites. The numbers are being fed into the database from the electoral rolls. Booth level poll data will be used to ensure proportionate distribution of vaccination sites -- areas which have more beneficiaries will get more centres,” said the government official who did not wish to be identified, adding that the government is likely to open up the vaccination drive to the 50+ group by mid-March.Currently, the vaccination drive is open to health workers (240,000 registered beneficiaries) and front-line workers (450,000 registered beneficiaries) – and 228,290 of them have been vaccinated so far, government records show.Read more: 'Karnataka will go to square one': Minister on lockdown amid Covid clusters in BengaluruThe national capital currently has 261 functional Covid-19 vaccination centres of which 228 administer Covishield vaccine -- the Indian variation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that is manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – and the others administer Covaxin, which was developed by Bharat Biotech, an Indian firm. On January 16, when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country, Delhi had started with 81 sites.A second official, also on condition of anonymity, said the government is likely to further break up the 50+ category into smaller chunks in terms of age and prioritise the most elderly of them. “Several recent meetings have discussed this issue but specific directions are awaited from the Union ministry,” said the official.The second official further said that once vaccination of people aged over 50 years begins, the government will also be setting help desks where eligible people can get themselves registered on their own – by submitting documents that qualify as proof of residence.Read more: Fewest new Covid-19 cases in Delhi since April 30By late-March, the government also plans to start vaccinating people with comorbidities (such as blood pressure and hypertension). They are still ascertaining the number of such people from the findings of the socio-economic survey conducted in 2019, health surveys conducted during the pandemic, hospital data, and records of several government departments, said the second official.Dr K Srinath Reddy, president , Public Health Foundation of India, said, “Using granular data to scale up vaccination capacity is a good way to ensure maximum coverage with minimum inconvenience. Also, elderly people are more vulnerable to Covid-19. With age, the probability of having comorbidities is higher and the body’s immune system weakens. It would be a good strategy to further break down the beneficiary group of people aged over 50 years into smaller segments and prioritise the most elderly of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-use-poll-data-for-better-distribution-of-vaccine-sites-for-50-plus-category-101613584505022.html
18-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Vasudev’s world||The night is cold. Vasudev has rustled out a small fire from wooden twigs he picked up from the pavement. Dressed in cap and woollen overcoat, he is fortifying himself with a glass of steaming ginger chai. He is alone in his tea stall, which lies on the roadside, midway between Hauz Khas village and Aurobindo Market in south Delhi.The establishment is very modest but very comfortable. A plank of cement laid across two chunks of concrete serves as a seat for customers. The boundary wall on the back is crowded with idols of many gods, giving the stall a homely feel, as if this open space were part of a cosy god-loving household. And even in the dark, you can sense the shadows of the many dogs milling about—they all are strays, but they feel loved here.Read more: Delhiwale| Capital’s most beautiful door, perhapsPointing each of the shadows one by one, Vasudev says, “That’s Cheeku, Tiger, Meena—she is a lady, and Sheru.” Vasudev looks after their well-being. “Each day I buy one litre of milk, four packets of bread and a few packets of ‘biskuts’ for them,” he says in a flat tone, implying that these expenses are facts of life and thus non-negotiable.A long-time resident of Hauz Khas village, Vasudev, 62 and a native of Madhubani in Bihar, founded his stall 35 years ago. This is like a fraction of a second compared to the centuries-old monuments scattered across this area. But compared to the highly unstable nightlife scene of the village, Vasudev’s stall is an ancestor to most of cafes and restaurants.Read more: Delhiwale| Paradise in the midst of rosesHe lives with his two sons, whom he raised as a single parent. “My wife, Seema Devi, died of a heart attack 25 years ago,” he says, drinking down the last dregs of chai from his glass.Now Vasudev gets up, quietly fills up a large bowl with milk and bread, and walks towards one of the dogs sitting under a tree. “It’s his dinner time.” After serving the other strays their dinner, Vasudev will close the stall and walk home. His sons, back from work, will be waiting for him with freshly cooked dal chawal. His stall is open daily from 6am to 10pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-vasudev-s-world-101613497265011.html
