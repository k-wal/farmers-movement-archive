Authorities repeatedly asked the MCD to stop the construction of the building but no action was taken. The AAP demands that the BJP immediately suspends Mr Jai Prakash and that he be arrested under charges of forgery,” said Pathak in a press conference at the party’s headquarters in central Delhi.Dismissing the allegations, Prakash said, “The allegations are baseless. Mr Durgesh Pathak and the AAP are misleading people. My son owns a custodian property at Gully Vikram in Sadar Bazar… He has been paying rent to DUSIB for the property and has all documents of correspondence with the officials of DUSIB. Any construction on that plot was carried out by previous custodians. For one particular construction activity on the first floor, my son had offered to pay damages to DUSIB through letters dated October 19, 2020, and January 15, 2021, and he was asked to visit the DUSIB office. If all rules have been followed, how can they call it an encroachment?”Spokesperson of Delhi BJP Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The AAP has not released ₹13,000 crore which the Delhi government owes to the municipal corporations. Mr Jai Prakash had exposed them (AAP) and that seems like the only reason for them to stoop to personal allegations now.”While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-north-corp-mayor-of-illegally-occupying-dusib-land-he-refutes-allegation-101613067380989.html
11-02-2021||Other||Pace and Space: shooting skills and state of play in the modern NBA||As seen through examining draft selections, lineup changes and the best players in the NBA throughout different eras of NBA basketball, the progression and evolution of the physical measurables required by NBA players is clearly obvious. However, these changes in talent selection from a physical standpoint have come about as various NBA coaches and franchises have undergone a drastic change in game tactics and strategy. For example, recently Stephen Curry became just the third player in NBA history to make 2,500 career 3-pointers, along with historical sharpshooters Ray Allen and Reggie Miller. Most notable in Curry’s accomplishment was that it took him 702 games to hit the landmark of 2,500 3-pointers, while it took Reggie Miller 1,288 games and Ray Allen 1,021 games. While each of these players is generally regarded as among the pantheon of the greatest NBA shooters, what leads to such a wide discrepancy in the number of games it took them to reach 2,500 made 3-pointers? Looking closely at the evolution of game strategy throughout the eras and it provides a clear answer.The earlier eras of the NBA emphasised an extreme pace of play, as well as shots close to the basket. In the 1970s, big men like Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were dominant due to their ability to convert a high percentage of dunks and shots close to the basket. With the introduction of the 3-point line to the NBA game in 1979, a high pace was still prioritised with almost 20 teams playing more than 100 possessions per game consistently throughout the 1980s’ decade, dominated by Magic’s Lakers and Bird’s Celtics. As basketball shifted towards more deliberate isolation play with the dominating play of Michael Jordan’s and Scottie Pippen’s Chicago Bulls, the pace of the game slowed considerably. The presence of big men who could dominate in the paint with a slower tempo game, combined with the presence of defenses allowed to “hand check” meant that by the early 90s and throughout the decade, pace had slowed considerably to such a level that there were no teams playing more than 100 possessions per game by 1999. The early 2000s’ Lakers’ dynasty of Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant won championships while never exceeding 94 possessions per game, and the Detroit Pistons ended the Lakers dynasty with an average pace of 88 possessions per game. This methodical and deliberate playing style was not conducive to a lot of 3-point attempts that could be generated by players playing in the open court. In the mid-2000s, the slow pace of play throughout the NBA (90.5 possessions per game) led to an average of 16 3-point attempts per game by each team. With the increased pace of play in the current era (2019 featured 102 possessions per game), there has been a dramatic spike in the number of 3-point attempts per team to almost 32 each game. Hence, the term for the current era of basketball is “pace and space”, referring to teams that play a high pace and space their 3-point shooters all around the court. As the NBA has evolved from this methodical playing style to a more free-flowing game, there has clearly been an uptick in 3-point attempts, as well as an extreme focus on individual player’s offensive efficiency, therefore, also prioritising shots close to the basket. This evolution has led to players re-writing the record books with regards to 3-point shooting volume and makes, which has drastically altered the skills necessary to play in the NBA today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pace-and-space-shooting-skills-and-state-of-play-in-the-modern-nba-101613067379840.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Porous surfaces like paper and cloth curbs spread of Covid-19 better: IIT-B study||Surfaces such as paper and cloth, which expedite evaporation of respiratory droplets, can curtail the spread of Covid-19, according to a recent study by a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). The researchers, all from the department of mechanical engineering, found Covid-19 can survive for four days on glass and seven days on plastic as well as stainless steel. In comparison, the virus survived for only three hours on paper and two days on cloth. Their paper was published in Physics of Fluid, a peer-reviewed letter by AIP Publishing, on Tuesday. Covid-19 can be transmitted via droplets that settle on surfaces of objects, known as fomite transmission. “This study was to understand the evaporation of respiratory droplets on porous surfaces, which are responsible for the fomite transmission of the virus,” said co-author Rajneesh Bhardwaj, associate professor of mechanical engineering, IIT-B. In a previous study, the same researchers had shown that Covid-19’s survival period correlated to the drying time of a respiratory droplet on an impermeable (non-porous) surface along with a residual film left on it by the droplet. This follow-up study demonstrated how the mass loss of a respiratory droplet and the evaporation mechanism of a thin liquid film are different for porous and non-porous surfaces. “The researchers from IIT-B have worked out a good theory using simple models. While it is known that droplets evaporate faster on porous surfaces because of capillary action, this is the first time it has been put in context of spread of a virus. This lays the foundation for further systematic study using virus samples to understand the spread of viruses on different surfaces,” said Amitabh Bhattacharya, associate professor, department of applied mechanics at IIT-Delhi, who was not part of the study. Based on their findings, the researchers have made recommendations to curb the spread of the virus. “We recommend that furniture in hospitals and offices, made of impermeable material, such as glass, stainless steel, or laminated wood, be covered with porous material, such as cloth, to reduce the risk of infection upon touch,” said co-author Sanghamitro Chatterjee, a postdoctoral researcher. Another co-author, Janani Srree Murallidharan, assistant professor, IIT-B, said, “Other recommendations include covering seats in public places, such as parks, shopping malls, restaurants, and railway or airport waiting halls, with cloth.” For the study, the team used proxy droplets to visualise their evaporation on porous and impermeable surfaces, and compared these measurements with computer-based models. The researchers found that 99.9% of a droplet’s liquid content evaporated within the first few minutes on both impermeable and porous surfaces. Then, a microscopic thin residual liquid film remained on the exposed solid parts where the virus could survive. “When we tested different surfaces that are porous, we found the droplet spreads quite quickly through capillary action [fibres inside the material]. The film left on the surface of the porous material evaporates faster, therefore, harbouring the virus for lesser time,” said Amit Agrawal, institute chair professor at the department of mechanical engineering and co-author of the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/porous-surfaces-like-paper-and-cloth-curbs-spread-of-covid-19-better-iit-b-study-101613067019503.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Over 100,000 people from Mumbai got Covid-19 vaccine shots||After vaccinating 5,707 beneficiaries on the 20th day of the vaccination drive, Mumbai crossed the milestone of 100,000 beneficiaries on Thursday. A total of 1,01,364 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Mumbai since January 16, when the vaccination drive began. Of these, 85,034 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and 16,330 are frontline workers (FLWs). On Thursday, the turnout was 61%, but the average turnout over the past 20 days is over 70%. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began the second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on February 4, during which FLWs are being vaccinated. By February 15, the civic body will start administering the second dose of the vaccine to HCWs who were part of the first phase. Out of 9,375 beneficiaries expected in Mumbai on Thursday, 3,825 were HCWs and 5,550 were FLWs. The final turnout was 61% with 1,989 HCWs (52%) and 3,718 FLWs (67%) turning up for their shots. Of these, 11 beneficiaries reported minor adverse event following immunization (AEFI) in the form of giddiness. They were kept under observation for 30 minutes before being discharged. A total of 121 beneficiaries have reported minor AEFI so far in the drive. On Wednesday, Mumbai saw an overall turnout of 69%; on Tuesday it was 68%; and on Monday, it was 83%. The highest turnout so far was reported on February 1 (93.41%), when BMC vaccinated 7,707 of the expected 9,250 HCWs. There are currently 23 active vaccination centres in the city, operated by 125 teams. Of these, 51 teams administer vaccine shots to HCWs and 74 teams administer vaccine shots to FLWs. The number of vaccination centres in the city has almost doubled in the past 10 days. Mumbai had 12 active vaccination centres on January 30, which increased to 18 on February 4 when BMC started the second phase of the drive. The number further increased to 20 on February 5; 21 on February 6; 22 on February 9; and 23 on February 10. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “Initially, the speed of the drive was low and now it is picking up, and we will be able to complete the drive in the targeted time. BMC noticed that whenever senior doctors have not participated in the drive and taken vaccine shots, the turnout is low. Where senior doctors have also taken the vaccine, other HCWs are more confident and the turnout is high.” BMC has been facing problems with the Co-WIN app failing to contact all registered beneficiaries of their vaccination appointments. Kakani said, “As we could not communicate to everyone through the app, we are also using the ward war rooms to communicate to people that their turn to take the shots has come. To increase the turnout, we are thinking private hospitals to vaccinate their own staff, not for general public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-100-000-people-from-mumbai-got-covid-19-vaccine-shots-101613066779282.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Nana Patole takes a dig at Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari||Newly appointed Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole alleged that Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was not giving his nod to the 12 nominations to Legislative Council because of the pressure from the top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said that it was possible for him as the Assembly speaker to stall the appointment of BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar as head of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC), but his party did not resort to vendetta politics.Patole on Thursday visited various religious places of all faiths including Chaityabhoomi, Siddhivinayak temple, a church and a masjid in Mahim, a day ahead of assuming charge as the party chief. He will take over the charge at August Kranti Maidan on Friday.While addressing a press conference on Thursday, Patole said the Governor, who is the Constitutional head of the state, should clear the proposal of the appointment of 12 members to the Council at the earliest. “He should not bow under the pressure (from Delhi) and nominate 12 members to the Upper house,” he said. “Had I acted vindictively like the Governor has been doing, appointment of BJP legislator Mungantiwar on parliamentary committee BAC would have been stalled. But we did not do so,” he said.Meanwhile, the Congress has launched social media cell to give befitting reply to BJP’s ‘vicious and divisive propaganda’. Patole said, “The BJP is a massive factory which produces lies that disturb the social fabric of the country. The Congress, through its 200,000 workers on social media sites, will give befitting reply to them.”Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the nomination of the MLCs was the prerogative of the Governor. “He is acting within his constitutional framework. He is the constitutional head of the state. The ruling party leaders should introspect about the language they use for Governor,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nana-patole-takes-a-dig-at-maharashtra-governor-bs-koshyari-101613066539299.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Centre’s charges of rioting, sedition against journalists are not correct: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday targeted the Centre over the sedition case filed against lawmaker Shashi Tharoor and journalists Rajdeep Sardesai, Mrinal Pande, Anant Nath, Zafar Agha and Vinod Jose. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena questioned why it has not taken suo moto action against “godi media”– a derogatory term for a section of the media seen to be pro-government, for spreading false news and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, who allegedly leaked matters of national security.On January 30, Delhi Police lodged a case against Tharoor, Sardesai, and others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony following the death of a protestor during the tractor rally in New Delhi on January 26. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh under serious charges including sedition.The editorial said the Supreme Court has stayed action against the journalists and Tharoor, but the sword of arrest is still hanging over their heads. It added that journalists should stand by them as they are safe now, but the government may crush them later. “These people may have faltered on one incident but because of that, slapping charges of rioting and sedition is not correct... Charges are pressed against Sardesai, Tharoor, Mrinal Pande, Jafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Vinod K Jose and Ananth Nath, but has such stringent action been taken against [the] godi media for spreading false news and misleading people?” the editorial asked.Opposition politicians last month had demanded a probe into purported WhatsApp chats between Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of TV audience measurement agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). Goswami’s critics said the remarks he made in the chats show he may have had advanced knowledge of the Indian Air Force 2019 strike on a terrorist camp in Pakistan’s Balakot region.The chats form part of Mumbai Police’s 3,600-page supplementary charge sheet in a scandal over alleged manipulation of TV ratings. The over 500-page transcript of WhatsApp conversations between Goswami and Dasgupta sparked allegations of collusion and alleged access the TV news anchor had to classified information.“...corrupt TV journalists like [Arnab] Goswami [are involved] in a TRP scam... [their] acts... [led to the leaking of information related to]...national security. And they still remain free. Instead of taking suo moto action and slapping sedition charges, the Central government has kept the entire issue in cold storage,” the editorial mentioned. Goswami did not respond to HT’s messages for comment. The editorial added that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi was once a friend of the media. “Journalists brought Modi to the top. Will Modi shed tears for an old friend?”Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye, meanwhile, said that the only task the Shiv Sena has is to criticise the BJP and PM Modi. “It has become their job to criticise Modi and the BJP. They should not be given such importance. Besides, they should first see how they behaved with journalists in Maharashtra. One TV journalist in Maharashtra was imprisoned based on mere suspicion. They should not teach others,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centres-charges-of-rioting-sedition-against-journalists-are-not-correct-shiv-sena-101613066179102.html

The police claim the accused, Chetan Thulkar, has around 22 house break-in cases filed against him in south Mumbai in the recent past. A police officer said that after committing the thefts, Thulkar went to Goa, Nagpur and Kolkata by air and enjoyed five-star hotel stay there and spent on lavish lifestyle. According to the police, on January 8, the Dubashs discovered that gold ornaments and cash, collectively worth Rs3.38 lakh, were stolen from the place of worship in their bungalow, Akashganga, located opposite Tata Garden on Breach Candy Road. They suspected the involvement of their four domestic helps. The family’s manager Pankaj Shirsagar lodged a complaint in the case and a first information report (FIR) was then filed. The police interrogated the domestic helps, but did not get any significant lead. They then discovered that the thief had entered through a window on the rear side of the bungalow. “The CCTVs covering entrance of the bungalow and the adjoining road didn’t capture any suspicious movement, but a CCTV camera installed at the coastal road construction site 150 metres away from the bungalow captured two suspects breaching the 15-feet-high boundary wall of the bungalow with the help of an adjoining tree. The two got easy access to the window from the wall itself. They then removed the iron grills covering the window and entered the house,” said senior inspector R Rajbhar of Gamdevi police. “This CCTV footage made it clear that the domestic helps were not involved in the theft and then we focused our probe on outsiders. Meanwhile, the complainant informed us that there was a small camera installed near the area in the house where the ornaments were stolen from. The camera had captured the movements of two men, but their faces were not clearly visible. However, later we identified one of the suspects as Thulkar,” Rajbhar added. Police then activated their sources and discovered that prior to the theft, Thulkar was seen in the area and after the theft he had left for Goa, where he stayed in an elite hotel for couple of days, returned to Mumbai and then travelled to his hometown in Hinghanghat at Wardha district. He then went to Nagpur where he stayed at another five-star hotel. The police team was trying to track him, but Thulkar kept changing his mobile phones. “Through our informers, we then learnt that from Nagpur, Thulkar went to visit his girlfriend in Kolkata and booked air ticket to Mumbai after two days. We verified his travelling details and a police team immediately left for Kolkata. After he arrived at the airport to board a flight to Mumbai, he was nabbed with the help of the airport security and brought to the city,” said assistant police inspector Sharad Gare. “During interrogation Thulkar revealed that he had conducted a recce of the bungalow and the positions of the CCTV cameras installed in the area before planning the theft. He had committed small thefts previously too at the bungalow in April, July, September and December last year,” said Rajbhar. The police have recovered some stolen ornaments from his friend Prakash Lovekar, 55, who met him while the duo were lodged at Arthur Road jail. Lovekar would help Thulkar sell the stolen ornaments. He too has been arrested in the case. The police have also arrested Akash Waghmare, 35, who had entered the bungalow along with Thulkar. Waghmare, who received Rs30,000 from the stolen cash, told the police that he aided Thulkar because he had an urgent requirement of money for his wife’s delivery. Thulkar, a Class eight dropout, has 22 criminal thefts and other property offences registered against him at Malabar Hill, Pydhonie, Colaba, DB Marg and Azad Maidan police stations, a police officer said, adding that he would target old bungalows and never carry a mobile phone with him to the crime scene to avoid getting tracked and detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-steals-from-mumbai-home-of-adi-godrej-s-kin-stays-at-5-star-hotels-held-101613066058959.html

No passenger or railway staff was injured in the incident. The two coaches of the train operating between Bandra Terminus and Ramnagar railway station in Uttarakhand got decoupled twice. The first incident occurred at 5.27am between Jogeshwari and Ram Mandir railway stations. The coaches were coupled back only after 73 minutes and the outstation train resumed its journey at 6.40am. At 7.17am, the coaches again decoupled between Naigaon and Vasai Road railway stations.“The train was operating at a slow speed, which is why the risk was less,” said a senior Western Railway official.WR has launched an investigation into the incident. “Two coaches that were in lock condition in the rear, uncoupled near Jogeshwari railway station,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR.Due to the incident, local and outstation train services coming towards the city were delayed. Train services on all the slow and fast railway corridors were operating with delays of up to 20 minutes. The delay resulted in overcrowding inside local train compartments and passengers were seen standing on the footboard of the train. Passengers took to social media to complain about overcrowding inside the compartments. “See the todays situation at Mira road. Where is controlling??? Where is social distance ? Where train got increased? From June i am traveling but not seen this much ruch under essential services.” tweeted @Gdixit44, with a video of passengers trying to board a crowded train.WR’s divisional railway manager (DRM) GVL Satyakumar had tweeted on Thursday morning, “Due to technical problem at Jogeshwari station all UP and Down suburban train services between Churchgate to Virar stations are running late by 10-15minutes. Inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-wr-coaches-detach-cause-delay-in-mumbai-local-services-101613065999078.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses bail to UP man accused of raping daughter-in-law||A bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Monday refused to grant anticipatory bail to three members of an Uttar Pradesh family – a man and his two sons – accused of domestic violence and sexual assault of their newly-wed daughter-in-law. HC’s decision was based on the observation that as the court had already refused to quash the first information report (FIR) against the family.The court held that the complaint of the woman, the wife of one of the accused, was serious and required custodial interrogation, and hence rejected their anticipatory bail application.The woman in her complaint had stated that after her wedding in 2019 when she was residing at her matrimonial home, she was pressured for dowry. In January 2020, she was allegedly injected with some drug and raped by the father-in-law, a doctor, in the presence of her husband and brother-in-law. Though the offences had occurred in UP, the complaint was registered at Santacruz police station on June 16, 2020, when the woman returned to her parent’s home. A single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of the accused, was informed by advocate Girish Kulkarni that the Santacruz police station did not have jurisdiction and there was a delay in filing the complaint. He further submitted that though the offences were serious, the custodial interrogation of the three would not yield anything, and hence they should be granted anticipatory bail. According to the complainant, after her wedding, her husband refused to have any physical contact with her and she came to know that he was undergoing treatment for impotency. After being raped by her father-in-law, the survivor was sent to her parental home later in the month and her parents were told that if their dowry demands were not met, the woman could not return to her matrimonial home. While opposing the application, the state informed the court that the three had not cooperated in the investigation as the husband had refused to undergo a medical test. Additional public prosecutor SH Yadav further informed the court that due to the serious nature of the offences, an earlier division bench had refused to quash the FIR on August 13, 2020, and hence the application should be rejected. “At this stage, it is not possible to observe that the informant’s allegations are false, just because the FIR is lodged after some delay. In such cases, delay in lodging the FIR can be explained by the victim. But that has to be considered at the time of trial. This is the stage of anticipatory bail. The gravity of the offence cannot be overlooked,” the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-up-man-accused-of-raping-daughterinlaw-101613065759589.html

A case was registered on the complaint of Emaar India against the MD and seven others under sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at DLF Phase-1 police. station.The MD of MGF India did not reply to repeated phone calls, messages and emails sent by HT seeking a response on this matter. Calls to the company office in Delhi also went unanswered.In a complaint to the police in July 2020, Emaar India stated that the MD of MGF had effected a fraudulent sale of 3.65 acres in Sector 61 land and transfer of licence No 56 of 2008. The company alleged that the MD and his associates transferred valuable land parcels belonging to Emaar India and its subsidiaries. The complainant further alleged that the value of the land parcels was around ₹4 crore initially, which exponentially rose to ₹183 crore after a licence was granted by the Department of Town and Country Planning.The complainant further alleged that MGF Developments India and its officials also wrongly induced the DTCP to transfer the licence held by Emaar India to its associate company, on the basis of a demerger scheme, despite the land in Sector 61 and licence number 56 never being part of the scheme. It also alleged that fake letters were used to ensure this transfer and further Emaar India was not informed about the basic facts.Preetpal Sangwan, an assistant commissioner of police, Gurugram police, said that a case has been registered and the matter is being verified. “The facts of the matter and the documents are being verified by police. The matter is being investigated on the complaint of the company,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/senior-executives-of-mgf-booked-on-complaint-of-emaar-india-101613065760034.html

As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 27 and 12 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Friday. As per the forecast, mist in the morning is expected while the day will remain cloudy. Meanwhile, Delhi on Wednesday crossed the 30 degrees Celsius mark for the first time this year, leading to a deviation of seven degrees from the normal temperature for this time. However,IMD scientists said this time in February, Delhi crossed the 30 degree-mark earliest in the last 15 years. Gurugram’s air quality dipped on Thursday with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin recording the air quality index (AQI) at 294 — a deterioration from Wednesday’s AQI reading of 247 in the “poor” category. Experts attributed the deterioration in air quality to poor ventilation conditions due to which pollutants could not be dispersed.VK Soni, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) environment monitoring and research centre, said that the AQI had dipped on account of calm winds. Slower wind speed and low ventilation conditions are unfavourable for the effective dispersal of pollutants, said Soni. The level of ultra fine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 440.02 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 414.4 µg/m3 on Wednesday. The PM 2.5 concentration at Gwal Pahari stood at 179.86 µg/m3. The safe limit of PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the “very poor” category on Friday and Saturday. Subsequently, over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the “very poor” category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/temperature-likely-to-increase-in-coming-days-air-quality-dips-101613065758145.html
11-02-2021||Gurugram||Plastic use can lead to fines up to ₹25,000 from February 27||Using plastic from February 27 can invite penalties of up to ₹25,000 as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday issued a notification for residents, shopkeepers, retailers and vendors to stop the practice. The MCG has set a 15-day deadline for compliance of the order, following which officials will start fining violators.In its order, the MCG has banned the usage of various types of plastic, such as polythene, plastic bags, bottled water with volume less than 200 ml, any type of single-use plastic, plastic wraps used for gift wrapping or in bouquets and plastic sheets used for table cover, among other such items, under the Haryana Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1988.Depending on the quantity of plastic, fines can range from ₹500 to ₹25,000. (see box)“Over the last four months, the MCG has started several projects to curb the use of plastic and polythene across the city. The latest order has been issued keeping this continuous effort in mind. We have now reached a stage where a citywide implementation is needed to eradicate plastic completely,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.Most garbage collected from across the city is non-biodegradable plastic waste, which increases legacy waste and is one of the primary reasons for choked drains across the city. Hence, a citywide ban is being enforced, said Kumar.“In the past four months, the MCG has generated enough awareness regarding the banning of polythene and single-use plastic so there has been ample time to make the shift. We’ll start fining violators for using them from February 27. Regarding other types of plastic, we will be carrying out area wise awareness drives to ensure people are aware that using them is a violation and after a short period of time, start issuing fines for it as well,” said Kumar.Kumar said that the MCG will be constituting several teams for carrying out awareness drives across the city and subsequently, for enforcement measures.“The problem with such policies and notification is that consumers are mainly penalised for using plastic instead of those supplying it. Until the supply is checked, the production of plastic will remain unaffected and will continue to be circulated in the market. This is not just the case in Gurugram but across various cities in the country as well, where a similar ban has been introduced. The public bodies concerned, such as the MCG, should look at adopting other strategies for more successful implementation,” said Priyavrat Bhati, sector head, Climate, Environment and Sustainability, Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy.Since last December, the MCG has been working towards turning four markets in the city — Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1, Sector 46 market, Sector 4 market and Sector 23 market — into areas free of polythene and single-use plastic. Each of these markets is located in a different zone of the MCG.“Until the MCG starts fining violators, the practice of using plastic and polythene will continue. The same has been the case in the Sector 46 market as well. Since the MCG has started issuing fines, both shopkeepers and visitors have largely refrained from using polythene and single-use plastic. To make this a success across the city, it is essential that the enforcement is stringent and remains a continuous effort, instead of a one-off measure,” said Vikram Yadav, president, Sector 46 market association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/plastic-use-can-lead-to-fines-up-to-rs-25-000-from-february-27-101613065698841.html
11-02-2021||Gurugram||Farmers to scale up their protests, starting February 14||Farmers protesting at various sites across the Haryana-Rajasthan border said that they would be scaling up the agitation against the three contentious farm laws through various programmes, starting with a mashaal juloos (torch march) on February 14.Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sanjay Madhav, member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers will be holding a torch march to honour Pulwama martyrs and recognise their sacrifices on February 14. On February 16, they will be dedicating a day to veteran farmer leader Choturam, while a Rail Roko (rail blockade) agitation has been planned for February 18, shared Madhav. “We have four crucial programmes lined up till February 18. Through these programmes, we seek to strengthen the movement and put pressure on the government to accept our demands. Farmers will not go back until the three laws are repealed and MSP guarantee in writing is given to us,” said Madhav. He added that farmers from different districts were continuously joining the agitation in batches. “Farmers from Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh joined the agitation today. Earlier this week, farmers from northern Rajasthan also arrived here. There is a constant movement of farmers at the site which tells us that the movement is alive and will eventually succeed,” said Madhav. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that protesting farmers had planned to mark Choturam Jayanti on February 16 to recognise the contributions of the veteran farmer leader. Sanjay Madhav said, “As per the Hindu calendar, Choturam was born on the day of Basant, which is why this day is also observed as his birthday culturally.” “While the modalities of the programmes are still being discussed, the Delhi-Jaipur railway line that crosses Rewari is being considered as a site for Rail Roko agitation. It will be a four-hour programme but we are yet to decide on the location,” said Sohlot. Maulana Arshad Meel, who is spearheading the Haryana-Rajasthan Mewati Kisan Andalon (movement) protest at Sunehra-Junehra near Punhana, said that farmers were planning to hold a candle march on February 4 to honour the sacrifices of soldiers who lost their lives in the attack. “We will be holding a meeting tomorrow to decide the route of the candle march,” said Meel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-to-scale-up-their-protests-starting-february-14-101613065698172.html

The doctor had asked for documents related to the redevelopment of their housing society in Borivli (West).The first information report (FIR) was registered on January 30, even though the victim filed a written complaint with the police in November 2020, after conducting a preliminary inquiry.The police have booked the complainant’s uncle Pradeep Sharma, secretary of the society, Harish Chheda, a BJP corporator, who is also the chairman of the society and other members - Nitin Mehta and Ravi Jain. All of them are booked for molestation, assault and threatening the complainant, under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code.According to police, the woman in her statement claimed that since her parents are not fit for dealing with legal issues, she had been given the authority to attend society matters.The complainant who returned from Dubai, after leaving her job, to look after her ailing parents claimed, that in 2018 she had been abused and threatened her at her uncle’s house when she asked to see the minutes of the meetings and legal documents relating to redevelopment plans of the society, Jai Shreenath Apartments, at Mandapeshwar Road.“ The men abused and tried to hit me because I asked for the documents related to the redevelopment of the building,” said the complainant.In 2019 too, the woman claimed, she had been a victim of abuse by the builder and her uncle.On March 8, 2020, the woman said that when she went to the society office to attend a meeting, she was cornered by the accused and beaten up inside the watchman’s cabin.“The society members did not even allow me to attend the meeting as I was the only one asking questions about the redevelopment,” said the woman.Vishal Thakur, deputy commissioner of police zone 11 said the police will take action against the accused under the law. “We are investigating the case at present,” he added.Chheda said that the allegations were baseless and that such an incident did not occur. “These are just tactics as the high court has ordered the family to vacate the premises,” said Chheda. Parag Mehta, however, said the claims made by the woman were false and she was fabricating a story just to stall the redevelopment. They filed a case against them after the victim was asked to vacate the premises, he said.“On March 8, I had left the meeting within 15 minutes and no assault had taken place. The meeting was called to grant the victim a NOC to sell her flat, however, she did not speak on the subject,” Mehta said, adding that, they had the consent of 59 members of the society and only this woman was refusing to give consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-corporator-others-booked-for-abusing-woman-over-society-s-redevelopment-101613065640733.html

While health department officials said that a majority of staff at the Bhondsi jail refrained from taking the shot, the superintendent of Bhondsi jail blamed the health department for not carrying sufficient doses.“Due to insufficient vaccine doses carried by the vaccinators at the site the targeted staff could not be inoculated. The vaccination officers from the health department carried only 30 doses of vaccines with them despite their target of covering 200 people on Thursday,” said Harinder Singh, superintendent of Bhondsi jail. “The department on February 7 provided the list of 269 front-line staff for registration. Only those who had received messages were given the vaccine shot on Thursday, while it has been conveyed to us that majority of the staff will be covered on February 15 during the vaccination drive,” he said.However, health officials refuted the claim. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer said, “The vaccinating team carried almost 400 doses of vaccine to the site. Enough vaccines are available with the health department to inoculate front-line workers. The staff did not turn up due to doubts regarding vaccine safety.”The overall drop in the vaccination comes two days after the district reported 103% coverage on Tuesday. The vaccination of the front-line workers in the district started on February 4, with a poor footfall of employees from civic agency staff. The overall footfall, however, remained above 80% over the two days.On Thursday, 650 of the 1,200 front-line workers — Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) staff, police and Bhondsi jail staff — took the vaccine jabs across 12 session sites. An additional site was also set up to inoculate 50 healthcare workers, but only 19 of them turned up.As per the district health department data, 338 of 500 targeted MCG employees took the vaccine shot, while 285 of the 500 targeted police personnel turned up.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “Over 1,250 front-line and healthcare workers were targeted, of whom 669 reached various vaccination sites to take the jab. There will be no vaccination drive on Friday. On Saturday, only MCG, police staff and rapid action force from Gujarat, who were deployed for farmers movement at the border, will be given shots at 13 vaccination sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/turnout-for-vaccination-down-to-54-jail-staff-health-officials-play-the-blame-game-101613065639348.html

The decision to cancel the licence was taken after hundreds of home buyers and residents of the project approached the DTCP and the state government to take over the project after several hundred apartments remained undelivered and several infrastructure-related deficiencies were found. Sare Homes project was launched in 2010 and the possession was offered in 2014. The project had five phases in which 3,000 apartments were sold, said the residents’ welfare association (RWA). Presently, only 1,200 apartments have been handed over to buyers while remaining are at various stages of construction. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) Gurugram, who submitted a report to the director, DTCP, regarding the cancellation of licence said that the next step in this process would be to take over the project. “Notices will be issued for cancellation and the department will assess the status of infrastructure deficiencies, inventory, receivables and amount to be spent to complete the project. Most of the work is near completion and pending issues will be resolved,” he said. DTCP officials said in order to initiate takeover, a committee headed by deputy commissioner, Gurugram, will be formed to manage the affairs of the project. “The completion and management of work can be done by the department or a third party but that decision will be taken later,” said Bhath.The letter sent to director, DTCP, regarding the cancellation of licence cites that the Sare Gurugram Private Limited, the licencee of the project has no acting director at present, the assets of the company are frozen by H-RERA, Gurugram. It also said that the project suffers a number of deficiencies pertaining to electrical system, fire-fighting system and infrastructure. Pravin Malik, president, SARE Homes RWA said that the decision to take over the project should be executed at the earliest as it will benefit thousands of owners and their families. “Around 3,000 buyers will benefit by this step particularly those who are yet to get their homes. We are thankful to the state government and local MLA who helped in this matter,” said Malik. A senior executive of Sare Homes could not be contacted despite repeated phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-decides-to-cancel-licence-of-sare-homes-take-over-project-101613065638770.html
11-02-2021||Gurugram||Study identifies Mangar forests as crucial bird habitat, calls for increased research and conservation||A new study has found that the Aravalli forests in and around Faridabad’s Mangar village have become a crucial habitat for birds, recording the presence of 219 species in a 17 square kilometre area. Experts said the degree of biodiversity was comparable with that of other Aravalli forests in the National Capital Region (NCR), such as the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram or the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary in Delhi.Findings of the study, conducted by the Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), validates the Haryana government’s 2016 decision to notify the Mangar Bani hill forest and surrounding areas as a “no construction zone” while providing a strong basis for ramping up research and conservation efforts in the area.The Mangar Bani (or sacred grove) is widely regarded as the last remaining patch of native, old-growth Aravalli vegetation in Delhi-NCR, but does not have the tag of a deemed forest, as per Supreme Court orders. As such, the region has not been centrally notified as a forest under the Indian Forest Act, despite performing the ecological functions of one. “Our report is based on the first systematic survey of the birds of Mangar. The forest and surrounding landscape have not been comprehensively studied despite being a popular birding destination for nearly a decade. Our findings are significant because they demonstrate the conservation value of Mangar forests, using birds as biological indicators. The forests in this area do not have strong legal protection and our work will hopefully encourage steps in the right direction,” said Misha Bansal, project fellow at CEDAR, who led the study.Based on a year-long field survey conducted in 2019-20, in addition to five years worth of data taken from eBird (a citizen-science initiative which maintains a repository of bird sightings globally), Bansal and other members of the CEDAR team arrived at some key findings to establish the area’s ecological significance.For instance, Mangar was found to provide a breeding habitat for summer migrants such as the Indian pitta and Indian paradise flycatcher. Both species are “tropical dry forest specialists”, meaning that they are particularly suited to native Aravalli habitats. Several other birds that are not so easily seen in Delhi were also found in the study area, which comprised not only the Mangar Bani (about 2.66 square kms) but also the surrounding forests, fields, plantations, village settlements, water bodies and old mining sites within the revenue boundaries of Mangar village. These species include the grey-bellied cuckoo, common rosefinch, crested bunting Tickell’s blue flycatcher, and Eurasian wryneck.Researchers also noted that five nationally endangered raptor species, which are red-listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, have been seen in Mangar -- including the king vulture and Egyptian vulture. Moreover, six bird species whose populations are believed to be in national decline (according to the recent State of Indian Birds 2020 report) were found to be “thriving” in the Mangar landscape. These include the yellow-crowned woodpecker and short-toed snake eagle, among others.“Our study thus suggests that the Mangar landscape is a crucial habitat for birds of the Northern Aravallis of Haryana. The diversity of birds indicates good quality forest and other resources available for birds,” said the report. This claim is bolstered by the abundance of 27 “tropical dry forest specialist” species of birds, which are particularly suited to the local environment.Such birds make up 12.5% of Mangar’s bird fauna, and are no longer sighted frequently in Delhi. This is partly because native scrub forest habitats are now found in only a few sites across NCR, the report explained. The authors also noted: “Most of the recorded dry forest specialists occur most abundantly in Mangar landscape in comparison with three other forest habitats in Delhi-NCR. Further, the recorded forest specialists are overall rare in Delhi-NCR area (such as Indian pitta), and one species (brown-capped pygmy woodpecker) is found only in Mangar landscape.”The higher frequency of dry forest specialists in the area, the researchers said, was perhaps the strongest bioindicator of ecological health in the region. “These birds are mainly insectivores (feed on insects), which in turn thrive only where the habitat is moist and well-vegetated. The presence of sufficient water in the bani, along with a range of microhabitats that the forest provides are creating conditions which allow for multiple specialist species to thrive,” said Ghazala Shahabuddin, senior fellow at CEDAR and one of the study’s authors. Despite the report’s positive findings, researchers said Mangar’s potential as a biodiversity hotspot remains uncertain. “Despite the report’s positive findings, researchers said tMangar’s potential as a biodiversity hotspot remains uncertain. “There are not enough legal safeguards for the Aravalli range in Haryana which also apply to the Bani. Since Mangar Bani is in the middle of a densely urbanised region, the anthropogenic stress on this ecosystem is quite immense. There needs to be a scientific management plan to guide its future conservation,” added Shahabuddin, reiterating a point made in the report. When asked what degree of conservation would be apt for Mangar’s forests, she said: “The typical approach of establishing a sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act would be inappropriate here, apart from creating resistance locally. Instead, we should recognise the cultural heritage of the Gujjar community, which has so far protected the forest and coexisted with wildlife. Instead, we may consider notifying the area as a Biodiversity Heritage Site, which would allow a range of ownership patterns within it, including private, village commons and forest land but prevent harmful development activities.” This view was echoed by Sunil Harsana, a researcher and Mangar resident, who also authored the study. Harsana said Mangar’s “no construction zone” tag offers only “weak protection” to the area. Unlike other mountainous ecosystems in India, such as rainforests of the Eastern Himalayas or the Western Ghats, the Aravallis of Haryana remains extremely accessible to real estate development, illegal mining, and land grab.“Our study shows that dry tropical forests can harbour rich biodiversity, but they are also among the most endangered habitats in India because of how accessible they are. Banning construction in the bani is a good first step, but we need more comprehensive reforms for the future. There is also an abundance of mammalian wildlife in the area in addition to birds. The entire ecosystem requires protection. Community support and construction bans will not be enough,” Harsana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/study-identifies-mangar-forests-as-crucial-bird-habitat-calls-for-increased-research-and-conservation-101613065638183.html

The state has banned processions and cultural-religious programs. However, a gathering of around 100 people has been allowed on the day.The guideline issued by the home department on Thursday had restricted the gathering to 10 people, but by evening it was increased to 100 people after the opposition slammed the government. The revellers gathering at forts (built by Shivaji Maharaj) at the midnight of February 18, have been advised to keep the celebration low key. “The revellers are advised to organise cultural programs online through the cable network. Bike rallies, processions will be banned,” the guidelines stated.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have criticised the government for the restricting the celebration of birth anniversary of great Maratha warrior. “By imposing restrictions on Shivaji Jayanti celebration, Shiv Sena has shown it true colours of compromising politics for the power. The government which permitted provocative Elgar Parishad has imposed restrictions on Shivaji Jayanti.

Nidhi on Thursday opposed the bail application of Diya Padalkar, one of the accused in the case and a daughter of Kukreja’s neighbour. Padalkar had filed bail plea earlier this month.Jhanvi was found dead on the ground floor of a building in Khar, where she had gone to attend a New Year Eve party with her friends. The police have booked Janvi’s friends Padalkar and Shree Ambadas Jogdhankar. Nidhi in her plea to intervene in and oppose Padalkar’s bail application claimed that “the accused jointly persuaded and convinced the intervener (Nidhi) and her husband to take the victim Jhanvi to a New Year party, which was supposed to be at the house of one Yash Ahuja, with a preplanned intention to kill the elder daughter of the intervener.”Padalkar, in her bail plea, has claimed that she had no role to play in Jhanvi’s death. Explaining the sequence of events, Padalkar has claimed that, “Applicant (Padalkar) was feeling dizzy, the applicant while climbing down the staircase lost her balance and got severely hurt on the lip portion of her face and was bleeding profusely.”She further claimed that when she was hurt, she went to Ahuja’s flat to clean the bleeding. The bleeding, however, did not stop and therefore she was taken to a hospital.Padaklar’s plea claimed that “material instances and witness statements are enough to rule out the mere possibility of the applicant’s presence in the alleged offence against the said deceased that took place on the intervening night of December 31, 2020, and January 1, 2021.”The bail plea is scheduled for hearing on February 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-new-year-case-it-was-a-pre-planned-murder-claims-victim-s-mother-101613065158732.html

11-02-2021||Delhi||AAP claims Delhi BJP office land given at throwaway price||The Aam Aadmi Party claimed on Thursday that the Centre had sanctioned more than 2 acres of posh land at just ₹2 crore to the Delhi BJP to build its office, a charge rejected by the saffron party as baseless.AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj claimed the land at the Deendayal Upadhyaya Marg was not for building any political party office, but a school."At one side, the BJP government harasses the ruling party of Delhi and try to evict them from their party office. On the other side, it provides land to the BJP at negligible prices," the legislator said at a press conference in New Delhi.Bharadwaj demanded that the Delhi BJP must disclose how could they get 10,000 square yards of land in "just ₹2 crores". "Here, no one can buy 2 yards of land with this money!" he said."On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, I want to ask the BJP whether it is true that this land was sanctioned to build schools or not," he said.The Delhi BJP said the AAP was describing the land as a 10,000 sq yard though it was only 809 sq metres and the amount was deposited in 2001 at the prevailing rates. It said the ruling party was showing the amount in today's time, which was a "total lie".Bharadwaj added that the Centre had asked AAP to pay crores of rupees as rent for the party office, alleging that the BJP government "had also tried to evict us from this office repeatedly"."The BJP should come clean and tell us whether they have any shame or not to own such a party office despite having such a negligible number of assembly seats in Delhi," he added.Reacting to it, BJP general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal said: "On the contrary, it is the AAP which has constructed its office on government land."Neither the AAP has the land allotted for this, nor deposited any amount in this regard, Chalal alleged.He said the government policy was that all political parties should be allotted land in Delhi and it had applied accordingly for land for its office in 2001.The party then moved the Delhi High Court for getting this piece of land and it was on May 12, 2010, that the land was allotted to us, Chalal said, adding the BJP really had to work very hard for this.He accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of running a government like "land-grabbers" who cared neither for the Constitution nor courts."In order to do his own politics, Kejriwal does not even have respect for the national flag," he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-claims-delhi-bjp-office-land-given-at-throwaway-price-101613062928924.html

Under its threatening theatrics, and at the behest of the Union government, the Haryana government forcibly picked up Nodeep Kaur and other labourers, who were peacefully protesting," Chaudhary said in an official release."Kaur has been charged under section 307 (attempt to murder) and extortion, which is not acceptable at all," she added.Chaudhary appealed to the NCW that the Punjab government, through Punjab State Women's Commission, will lend legal assistance to Nodeep Kaur and the Haryana government should be directed to arrange a meeting of the Punjab State Women's Commission's delegation with the labour rights activist.She said, the allegations of outraging the modesty of Punjabi trade unionist Nodeep Kaur in police custody as per her family members and not even granting bail after four weeks, is a horrifying moment for the entire womanhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-minister-seeks-ncw-s-intervention-on-release-of-nodeep-kaur-101613060544449.html
11-02-2021||Noida||Noida Film City CM's dream project, to come up in next 3 years: Raju Srivastava||The proposed film city near Noida is a "dream project" of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and is expected to be completed in the next three years, the state’s Film Vikas Parishad Chairman Raju Srivastava said Wednesday.Srivastava, a comedian-actor, led a state government delegation that visited the site and reviewed the progress of the project scheduled to come up along the Yamuna Expressway in western Uttar Pradesh.The delegation met with the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority officers, including CEO Arunvir Singh, and officials of project consultant CBRE South Asia."It is a dream project of Chief Minister Adityanath. Once our chief minister decides to do something, it gets done. Our effort will be to get the project completed within the stipulated time," Srivastava told reporters."The project is expected to be completed within next three years," he added.Srivastava and accompanying officials of Film Bandhu, the Uttar Pradesh government's nodal agency for film production-related facilities, were apprised that the consultant would be shortly submitting a tentative study report of the project which will give an idea about the facilities the film city can have and the budget required for it."It has to be a world-class film city only then can we attract talented artistes from places like Mumbai and elsewhere because as such film cities are in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai also," Srivastava said.YEIDA Additional CEO and Officer on Special Duty Shailendra Bhatia said the delegation was informed that CBRE would be submitting a tentative draft of the detailed project report by February 20."The draft would give an idea about the components and facilities of the project and an approximate budget required for it. The timeline for its completion would come up accordingly and may vary depending on the model, like it could be built on public-private partnership mode," Bhatia said.The film city is being planned on a 1,000-acre area along the Yamuna Expressway in YEIDA's Sector 21. An area of 1,000 acres has been earmarked for the film city project of which 220 acres would be commercial and the remaining 780 acres industrial, he said.When asked about a section of the Mumbai-based film industry being wary about the project, Srivastava said no state should be worried over the establishment of a film city in Uttar Pradesh."It is only an extension of (cinema) facilities available in the country. Nothing is being taken away from or any state," he told the reporters.He stressed that the film city will benefit local talented artistes, among others, who cannot go out of the state for work due to several conditions, including financial restraints, to showcase their art to the world instead of living in oblivion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-film-city-cm-s-dream-project-to-come-up-in-next-3-years-raju-srivastava-101613059903916.html
11-02-2021||Kolkata||Modi govt should resign if BJP fails to prove TMC siphoned off central funds: Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday challenged the BJP to prove its allegation that her party, the Trinamool Congress, has misappropriated funds sent by the Centre to the state, or the Narendra Modi government should resign. Addressing a programme of NGOs and civil society organisations in Kolkata, the TMC supremo claimed that the language used by BJP leader Amit Shah, who is currently on a visit to the state, smacks of arrogance and does not behove a Union home minister."The BJP frequently says that TMC is corrupt, the TMC siphoned off money. It is not Modi's money. It is sent by one government to another. Then you should not collect taxes from the state and there will be no need to give it back. If you cannot prove the allegation, you will have to resign," Banerjee said."You continuously attack us with pishi-bhaipo (aunt and nephew) jibe. What about your son Mr Shah? Where did he get so much money from?" she said.She said that Shah has come to West Bengal to speak on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) but she will not allow it to be implemented in the state. "We always welcome everyone to West Bengal. But the statements made by Amit Shah today is below the belt and speaks of power hunger. I am very clearly stating, such words from the home minister don't look good," Banerjee said, without elaborating.The TMC chief said that she will not utter a word which breaches decorum."All political parties should maintain dignity. Courtesy cannot be one-sided. It has to be both ways," she said. The chief minister accused the BJP of spreading fake news and fake videos on social media to mislead people."After looting farmers, after not allowing me to practice my religion, after doing riots, you want Bengal? I will not bow down in front of these people," she said, attacking the saffron party. The chief minister said that hooliganism is rampant in states such as UP, Rajasthan and Haryana, but she will not allow it in West Bengal. "Let Bengal live in peace. The BJP should not be allowed to come to power in the state. I appeal to all to protect the honour of Bengal," she said. The assembly election is due in the state in April-May. "I am a street fighter. I will fight to the end," Banerjee said adding that she is not afraid of the BJP."Let's have a fair play. The Left and the Congress can be in your (the BJP's) team and we will fight alone. I will only be a goalkeeper and see how many goals you can score," the TMC boss said.Banerjee claimed that the people of neighbouring Tripura are regretting voting the saffron party to power. Farmers and Adivasis are under attack in BJP-ruled states, the chief minister alleged while speaking at the programme of the NGOs."The BJP has cancelled licenses of a number of NGOs after coming to power and stopped funds only because their opinions were different from the party. I will request all NGOs, faith based groups, and self help groups to save Bengal's pride, to save Bengal's culture," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/modi-govt-should-resign-if-bjp-fails-to-prove-tmc-siphoned-off-central-funds-mamata-banerjee-101613059511415.html

11-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt seeks details of liquor vends in all assembly constituencies||The Delhi excise department has directed private individuals and government agencies to provide details of their liquor vends that are located in the assembly constituencies and at the Indira Gandhi International airport here.In a letter issued on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner Sanjeev Kumar directed all the licensees of private as well as government liquor shops to submit the details by Friday.The letter said non-compliance by licensees of private vends will be viewed seriously.There are around 850 liquor shops, including those run by government agencies and private individuals, in the national capital.The move comes nearly a month after an excise committee formed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had suggested minimising the presence of Delhi government in retail liquor business and increasing private participation.An official said the Delhi government runs around 60 per cent of the retail liquor shops while the rest is run by private individuals in the city.The department has called a meeting on Friday with all four government agencies --- the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation, the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited and the Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store that have been given the permission to open liquor shops in public sector.In a separate letter, the department also asked these agencies to furnish all details pertaining to their liquor vends, mentioning the names of the assembly constituency, revenue district and municipal ward.Earlier this month, the government had constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) under the deputy chief minister to examine the current system of excise duty administration and the recommendations of the expert committee on a new excise policy.Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Law Minister Kailash Gahlot are part of the GoM that is examining all aspects of the current system of excise duty administration and going through the report of the expert committee and suggestions received from stakeholders and the public.The expert committee had also recommended the legal drinking age in the city be reduced from 25 years to 21 years in line with cities of Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region (NCR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-seeks-details-of-liquor-vends-in-all-assembly-constituencies-101613058795094.html
11-02-2021||Kolkata||Left-Cong activists clash with police during march over jobs; 12-hour Bengal bandh called on Friday||Left and Congress activists demanding jobs clashed with the police in central Kolkata's Esplanade area Thursday as they tried to break barricades on their way to state secretariat Nabanna, resulting in injuries to several participants and also the police. Condemning the brutal attacks on students and young men and women by the "police force of the Trinamool Congress government", Left Front Chairman Biman Bose announced a 12- hour West Bengal bandh by the Left and associate parties from 6 am on Friday in protest. "The way police unleashed atrocities on the participants in the march to Nabanna, it created a situation somewhat akin to the historic Jallianwala Bagh incident," Bose said in a statement.The Left Front chairman claimed that more than 150 students and young men and women were injured in the police action while participating in the 'Nabanna abhiyan' programme of the student and youth wings of the Left and Congress demanding jobs and better education facilities. Bose said that the bandh call has been discussed with the Left Front constituents and the Congress party, with which it has formed an electoral alliance for the coming assembly elections in West Bengal. The Left-Congress allaince has come up to make the Bengal polls a triangular fight with the TMC and the BJP. The march to Nabanna started at College Street but was stopped by the police on SN Banerjee Road in the Esplanade area. As the activists tried to head further by breaking the heavy metal barricades, police used water cannons. Amid slogans against the Mamata Banerjee government, the Left-wing youths and students tried to climb up the barricades, following which police began a baton-charge and also fired tear-gas shells. Some police officials were also reported to be injured in the clashes. CPI(M) politburo member Mohammad Salim alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government is totally dependent on the police force to suppress protests and demands by the people. "Why is she afraid of receiving a memorandum from jobless youths," he asked in a press conference at the CPI(M) headquarters here after the incident. Condemning the attacks on the agitators, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pradip Bhattacharya said that the Trinamool Congress government has lost the people's faith and violent suppression of protests is an indication of that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/leftcong-activists-clash-with-police-during-march-over-jobs-12-hour-bengal-bandh-called-on-friday-101613058495042.html

Whatever is being spread on social media is not something that we can comment on. The enquiry in the ADR is on,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police, zone 5 of Pune police.The 23-year-old girl was a graduate in Arts and was in the city to attend spoken English classes. She lived with her brother and his friend in a rented place.On Monday night, the girl allegedly died by suicide while one of her flat-mates was asleep, and the other had gone out, according to the police.In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, BJP legislator from Mumbai Atul Bhatkhalkar demanded a probe.“Social media is ripe with posts about love relations between the young girl and this minister. This is quite serious and a detailed investigation in this incident is required. A case of culpable homicide should be registered in this case and a Special investigation team (SIT) should be formed,” said Bhatkalkar in the letter that he posted on Twitter.“The news of tis girl (name withheld), who is from my voter base, is shocking. A detailed investigation should be done,” tweeted Pankaja Munde, national secretary of the BJP.The police had registered an accidental death report in the case at Wanowrie police station. The veracity of the alleged audio recording of a call between the girl and the said minister is yet to be ascertained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-seeks-probe-into-woman-s-death-by-suicide-after-links-to-minister-emerge-on-social-media-101613056036191.html
11-02-2021||Chandigarh||Players upset over Haryana’s new policy for outstanding sportspersons||For a long time, India’s 800m runner Manjit Singh Chahal has been harbouring thoughts about securing a job with the Haryana government. After he won gold in the 800m event in the Asian Games at Jakarta in 2018, Chahal has been trying his luck. However, his hopes of joining either the Haryana Police Service (HPS) or the Haryana Civil Service (HCS) came crashing as the Haryana cabinet has decided against appointing outstanding sportspersons as HCS and HPS officers.“It is unfortunate that the Haryana government has come up with this new policy. I had applied for a job with the Haryana government in 2018 but am yet to hear from them. It would have been ideal to be placed in either HCS or HPS cadre for the state. It seems they have not recognised my feat of winning gold in Jakarta,” said a disappointed 31-year-old Chahal, who is training at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) in Patiala.In 2018, the state government had decided that medal winners in Olympics, world championships and Asian Games from Haryana will be eligible for appointment as HCS and HPS officers. As per the new rules, outstanding sportspersons will now be appointed only on the posts of deputy director (Group A), senior coach (Group B), coach (Group B) or junior coach (Group C). These posts would be offered on the basis of their performance in international or national events.“States like Rajasthan are offering top-notch jobs to their athletes including police services and other administrative jobs. Even I got offers from Rajasthan but did not move. But I’m sure younger athletes won’t compromise and leave Haryana for other states in search of better jobs. This new policy is going to diminish Haryana’s image as a sports-promoting state,” added Chahal.Echoing Chahal’s thoughts, para-athlete Amit Saroha, who won a silver medal in men’s club throw F51 competition in the World Para Athletics Championships of 2017, questioned the Haryana government’s stand on sports promotion.He said, “They keep introducing new policies and never implement them. If they had introduced the policy to offer HCS and HPS jobs to medal winners of repute in 2018, why was there no appointment till now? Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had copied Haryana’s sports model and are excelling. And now the Haryana government is stepping down. They should value the athletes and offer them esteemed posts. There will be no choice left for athletes than to move court. Also, there should be equality when it comes to para-athletes.”Internationally-acclaimed wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, boxers Amit Panghal and Manoj Kumar, track stars Neeraj Chopra, Manjit Chahal and Seema Antil-Punia and para athletes Amit Saroha and Ekta Byan, all winners at Asian Games or Commonwealth Games, have applied for jobs with the state government but have not been given any posts so far.SS Phulia, director of Haryana’s sports and youth affairs department, defends the Haryana government’s new policy and thinks it will make the system better.“The policy is aimed at promoting sports in state. Outstanding sportspersons, who win medals at international level can apply for posts in Group A and work for the state government. Since 2018, no sportsperson has been inducted in HCS or HPS. Group A posts offer good salaries and can encourage sportspersons to do well,” Phulia said.“There is not much difference in the pay package of HCS/HPS and a Group-A salaried person,” added Phulia.“HCS and HPS involve administrative work. Sometimes, we have seen a sportsperson don’t have adequate educational qualification and thus aren’t fit for an administrative job. It becomes difficult for the less qualified people to perform their duties with perfection. The new policy has been made to make the work culture and society better. Also, soon 50 posts will be open for outstanding sportspersons in Group A category. If we observe that there is more need of creating more jobs for Group A so that more sportspersons can benefit, we will increase the number of posts in the cadre,” shared Phulia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/players-upset-over-haryana-s-new-policy-for-outstanding-sportspersons-101613055076732.html
11-02-2021||Chandigarh||Why Haryana dumped 2018 rules about giving govt jobs to outstanding sportspersons||Eligible sportspersons lacking minimum qualification and out of turn employment of sportspersons leading to surge in litigation were among the hosts of administrative issues that nudged the Haryana government to bury the 2018 rules under which the sportspersons were also appointed as Haryana Civil Service (HCS) and Haryana Police Service (HPS) officers.On Wednesday, when the Haryana cabinet met, one of the key policy decisions it took was to replace the Haryana Outstanding Sportspersons (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2018, with the Haryana Outstanding Sportspersons (Group A, B & C) Service Rules, 2021.Now, the outstanding sportspersons will be appointed under the new service rules in a separate cadre for promotion of sports. The new rules apply brakes on accommodating outstanding sportspersons in the elite HCS and HPS mandated under the abolished 2018 rules.In the cabinet agenda, the sports department admitted that it was facing difficulties in providing government employment to eligible sportspersons as some of them lacked requisite qualification.Another issue that prompted the state government to put in place the new rules was the Punjab and Haryana high court making some observations regarding the 2018 rules in two different cases of 2018 and 2019 in cases of sportspersons appointments.Yet another compelling reason to replace the 2018 rules was sportspersons of certain stream exploiting the loophole in the existing rules, a government functionary involved in framing the new rules said asking not to be identified.“The case of IAS officer Jagdeep Singh’s son, Vishwajeet Singh, who is an international shooter and was appointed as an HCS officer, also played a key role in forcing the government to replace the old rules,” officials familiar with the development said.After appointing Singh as an HCS officer in December 2019 under the sports category, the state government didn’t issue an appointment letter till September 2020, forcing him to move the HC. Now, the HC has directed the state government to issue appointment letter within four weeks.Top government officials said that under the new policy medal winners in Olympics and Asian Games will be offered Group-A posts.DIFFICULTIES IN PROVIDING GOVT JOBSAs per the cabinet agenda, the sports department was facing some difficulties in providing government jobs, especially posts of Group-A and B to the eligible outstanding sportspersons having qualification below matriculation standard. Some other departments “did not have the posts for outstanding sportspersons.”In this backdrop and keeping in view the problems the departments were facing in implementing the 2018 rules and the observations made by the HC, a departmental committee was set up as per the August 10, 2020 orders of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.Officials said that inter-departmental consultations were held to draft the Haryana Outstanding Sportspersons (Group A, B, and C) Service Rules, 2021.While CM approved the new rules on January 28, 2021, finance department gave nod on February 5, followed by general administration department on February 8. The matter was submitted for concurrence of chief secretary, and Haryana Staff Selection Commission.The new rules were also placed before the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) also that gave approval to the new policy on February 9, a day before the cabinet approved the policy.PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENTThe outstanding sportspersons will be given provisional appointments in case they do not possess the requisite qualifications for the post at the time of initial appointment. They will be granted two extra years in addition to the prescribed period required for the attainment of requisite qualification.The outstanding sportspersons will be eligible to apply for the post within 10 years of their sports achievement or up to the age of 43, whichever is earlier.Under the new service rules, a separate cadre will be created to promote sports in the state for which 50 posts of Group A (deputy director), 100 posts of Group B (senior coach), 150 posts of Group B (coach) and 250 posts of Group C (junior coach) have been sanctioned. The upper age limit has also been reduced from 50 years to 42 years.Some new tournaments have been included in new rules such as South Asian Games, National Games, Ranji Trophy, Circle Kabaddi, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-haryana-dumped-2018-rules-about-giving-govt-jobs-to-outstanding-sportspersons-101613055016166.html

Despite having a tender component, why is the PMC not doing it?” was a question asked to Fadnavis.Fadnavis replied, “I too have the same opinion that both optical fibre ducts and water pipeline laying work should be done together. The commissioner was of a view to do that work separately and divide the work into two components. Commissioner was of the view that if the ducts got dug along with the water pipeline laying works, almost all roads would get damaged, but I was instructed to do both works together and not divide it.”Fadnavis then asked Mayor Murlidhar Mohol and the commissioner to sit together and carry out the work together.Mayor commits to get on the jobMayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “I have been aggressive since the beginning, that both, the water pipeline laying work and the optical fibre cable laying should be carried out together. Now Devendra Fadnavis has also instructed the commissioner to carry out both the works together. Administration had given the reason to Fadnavis that road widths are too narrow, but this is not true. I will ensure both works are carried out together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fadnavis-lays-responsibility-for-ensuring-fibre-optical-ducts-laid-on-mayor-civic-chief-101613052795897.html

The state government issued orders on Wednesday that the 250 homestays in Spiti and 70 in the valley headquarters at Kaza will be open for tourists from February 17. However, hotels in the region will open in the second week of April once the valley tides over its water scarcity due to sub-zero temperatures. “We decided to open up the homestays as we found that tourists visiting the tribal region, particularly those from outside the state, are facing inconvenience. All homestay owners will have to follow the Covid-19 standard operating procedure (SOP),” said Kaza-based additional district magistrate Gian Sagar Negi. “The sub-zero temperatures and intermittent heavy snow spells have disrupted the water supply in hotels so they will open in April,” he said. The tourists will need to undergo the Covid-19 test 72 hours before entering the Spiti valley and will need to follow the SOPs. Snow leopard habitat at Kibber out of bounds “The snow leopard habitat at Kibber will be prohibited for tourists,” said Lara Tsering, the general secretary of Spiti Tourism Society. There were four deaths due to Covid-19 in Kibber after which villagers decided to close their village to tourists, he said. Tourists visit Kibber mainly for sighting the elusive snow leopard. No new Covid-19 case has been reported from Spiti valley in a fortnight. The local administration recently organised a winter festival in Spiti, which was a big draw. “Most tourists stayed at government rest houses but it has limited accommodation. We felt bad when we saw tourists sleeping inside their vehicles,” said Pema Tandup, who owns a homestay in Kaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/320-homestays-in-hp-s-spiti-open-doors-for-tourists-from-feb-17-101613042595277.html

11-02-2021||Chandigarh||Vigilance Bureau falsely implicated PCS officer for corruption: Probe report||The Vigilance Bureau (VB) had falsely implicated a Punjab Civil Services (PCS) officer, Tarsem Chand, posted as secretary in the Regional Transport Authority in Faridkot district, in a corruption case in connivance with two private transporters in June last year. According to the findings of the probe conducted by VB deputy inspector general Surjit Singh, Chand was implicated in connivance with Muktsar-based private transporter Gursahib Singh Brar and complainant Baaj Singh, another transporter from Muktsar. The findings are a part of the probe carried out after Chand filed a representation for a fair inquiry in August. Officer’s driver is main accused On 23 June, 2020, Chand along with his driver and Punjab Police head constable Amarjit Singh were arrested by the Mohali VB team, led by deputy superintendent of police Harwinderpal Singh, for accepting ₹15,000 from Baaj to run his tourist buses bearing Rajasthan registration numbers in Punjab and also to ensure that they are not challaned. In July, the PCS Officers’ Association condemned Chand’s arrest and demanded that the case be cancelled. The probe report, accessed by Hindustan Times, grants a clean chit to Chand and recommends that he be discharged from the case. It says driver Amarjit Singh is the main accused and there is no “meaningful evidence” against Chand, who has been implicated due to a personal rivalry of the complainant, the transporters and aides. Recordings helped nail the lie The report says that Baaj approached Amarjit on June 16 and offered a monthly bribe to him, saying he had paid another RTA office employee, Suresh Kumar, too. Amarjit agreed to help. Baaj recorded their conversation and approached Mohali vigilance DSP Harwinderpal Singh. Baaj claimed that Chand was demanding the money for himself through Amarjit. “It’s clear from the recording of the conversation between Amarjit and Baaj that Chand never asked the transporter to meet his driver had no pending work of the complainant. Without taking the recording on the case file, the earlier investigating officer registered a corruption case against the RTA merely based on the complainant’s apprehension. Chand never directly or indirectly sought money,” the report says. “During the VB trap, Baaj kept asking Amarjit to get him to meet Chand. The VB team didn’t recover the money for 90 minutes (which should have been done immediately) after taking Amarjit into custody. Instead, the VB team took Amarjit to Chand’s office after being asked by Baaj,” the report says. After Baaj met Chand in his office and gave the list of his buses to the RTA, saying whatever you asked for as service (sewa) has been given to Amarjit, the VB team recovered the amount from Amarjit. Private transporter hatched conspiracy The report says Gursahib Singh, the owner of Darvesh transport, Muktsar, along with his brother, Rajinder Singh, frequently visited the RTA office in Faridkot and knew employees there. Gursahib is known to both Baaj and Karandeep Singh, a reader of the Mohali VB DSP. The three were in touch when the trap for Chand was laid. It is learnt that when Chand was posted as the Faridkot RTA, a case to register a VIP number, PBQ-0001, came to his office. Gursahib was interested in the number and was upset with the RTA for not acceding to his request for the number. “Gursahib was miffed when Chand transferred some old employees of the RTA office, resulting in his losing his grip on the office and thus began his rivalry with Chand. Gursahib hatched the conspiracy with Baaj and VB officials,” the report says. Call details showed Karandeep, Gursahib and Baaj were in touch with each other on the day the trap was laid. Gursahib and Karandeep exchanged 21 calls between 8am and 11.30pm on June 23.  ₹2 lakh placed in RTA’s car by driver On the recovery of ₹2 lakh from Tarsem’s car, the report says CCTV footage shows Amarjit keeping a packet in the RTA’s car at the Faridkot deputy commissioner’s office. The amount belongs to an RTA office clerk, Sukhwinder Singh, who alleged that Chand demanded the money. Sukhwinder withdrew the ₹2 lakh from a bank 13 days before the trap but handed over the amount to Amarjit only on the day the trap was laid. “An official witness in the case stated on August 5 that the bribe was recovered from Amarjit and it was the driver himself who handed over the car keys to VB officials after which they recovered ₹2 lakh. The information about ₹2 lakh to the complainant and Gursahib led to suspicion that the additional amount in the RTA’s car without his knowledge was to create additional evidence against him”, the report adds. VB officials mum on report Deputy inspector general Surjit Singh was not available for comment, while DSP Harwinderpal Singh said the matter is still being probed and the Mohali court is yet to give its verdict. Vigilance head constable Karandeep Singh feigned ignorance, too. Gursahib denied the allegations and claimed the VB had caught Chand and now wants to give him the clean chit so it’s blaming the transporters. Baaj said he stood by his complaint and alleged that the VB was under pressure from Chand. He said that he has filed an RTI application for the inquiry report and will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court against the VB for giving a clean chit to Chand. CASE FILE June 16, 2020: Complainant Baaj Singh strikes monthly bribe deal with Faridkot RTA Tarsem Chand’s driver Amarjit Singh June 22: Baaj files complaint with Mohali vigilance bureau against Tarsem and Amarjit June 23: Vigilance bureau lays trap, arrests Tarsem and Amarjit for accepting ₹15,000 July 3: PCS association condemns Tarsem’s arrest and takes up matter with Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan August 18: Tarsem files representation with vigilance.

11-02-2021||Other||Taste of life: The art of baking... Viva la Italia in amche Pune||“It is the Italians who in the Indies have taught the English to live with refinement, to eat less crudely than they once did. Do not be surprised if the English tell you that without the Italians in the Indies, you would only have canned rice and preserved meat, and preserved meat and canned rice at the table”, wrote the Italian explorer and journalist Arnaldo Cipolla in his travelogue “In the flame of India”.Italian confectioners and chefs had earned high praise in British India where they were well known among European settlers and the Indian elite.They belonged to a migrant minority of traders and entrepreneurs, who sought to take advantage of a new world of commercial and economic opportunities opening up in India after the birth of the Raj.By the end of the nineteenth century, Italian food was introduced in Calcutta, Bombay and Poona, thanks to Federico Peliti and Felice Cornaglia, restaurateurs and professional caterers.Several guidebooks in the nineteenth and the 20th centuries advised Europeans travelling to India to have at least one meal at Peliti’s (in Calcutta and Simla) and F Cornaglia (in Bombay and Poona) because ‘their elegant but comfortable furnished rooms, sheltered from the heat of an Indian sun and cooled by the use of electric fans, present the most fascinating opportunities for the young and the old alike to enjoy those periods of relaxation which the occasion offers; while at the same time they are served, in the best European style, with delicacies of the most delectable manner, manufactured by the princes in the art of confectionary.” F Cornaglia in Poona boasted of a spacious tea-room and a shop. A billiards room was added later. It was a favourite resort for afternoon tea for many Europeans. The restaurant was a 5000 sqft hall with chandeliers and furniture imported from Europe. It had French, English and Italian dishes on its menu. Till the early 1920s, F Cornaglia and Merwanjee Cursetjee on East Street were the only establishments in Poona to have permit for consumption of wine on their premises.A very large business at F Cornaglia was carried on in the manufacture of wedding and Italian, French and English cakes (English plum, madeira, currant, almond), sweets of endless varieties (French and Neapolitan tarts decorated with fruits, meringues, torta barozzi, sfogliatelle, macaroon, seadas, cannoli, almond chocolates, nougats, pralines, crystallised fruits, fondants, pezzi duri, truffles), ice creams, ice wafers, ice puddings and pastries of all kinds. Some exotic desserts used and exhibited for sale in the restaurant were made in Carignano in a factory set up by Peliti and imported specially for connoisseurs. Cornaglia also sold Russian caviar, prime cuts of ham, salami, pastrami, cheeses (gorgonzola, parmesan, gruyere), French and Italian wines and liqueurs and cigars from Havana. Every year, native newspapers in Bombay would be flooded with advertisements featuring Christmas cakes and desserts from Cornaglia’s confectionary. In 1895, plain Christmas cakes were priced at Re. 1 per piece. Chocolate iced cakes were charged 4 annas more. All the cakes bore the stamp – F. CORNAGLIA. Catering was undertaken for wedding parties, entertainment and picnics. F Cornaglia were caterers by Royal Appointment to HE The Governor of Bombay, in addition to holding similar warrants from almost all the Viceroys of India since the time of Lord Ripon; they were official restaurateurs to several clubs in Bombay and Poona; and they entered into contracts for the supply of all refreshments to Indian chiefs on special occasions, and for tiger – shooting parties.Around 1920, F Cornaglia in Poona was taken over by a new European management. It shut down sometime around the 1940s. By 1935, the branch at Medows Street in Bombay (presently Nagindas Master Road) had shut down. The one on Esplanade Road (presently Mahatma Gandhi road) stayed in business till early 1970s with Indian owners. Cornaglia’s bakery with the same name still exists in South Bombay, but the present owners have never heard of him.Peliti died in 1914 in Italy and his restaurants shut down due to fire and events centred on the Second World War. Only the original marble plaque outside the main entrance of the Governor’s House, where Peliti’s was located in Calcutta, reminds one of its glorious past. And then there’s Villa Carignano which Peliti built in Mashobra. Peliti’s Vermut, a vermouth manufactured in Turin, Italy, is based faithfully on the liqueur Peliti produced for an official visit by the Prince of Wales, Edward VII, in 1877, using a blend of Indian spices, Piedmontese flowers, absinthe and Muscat wine, and has recently been revived by his family in Italy. Italians never considered India as a final destination; they used to go back home at the age of retirement, or even earlier, handing over their businesses to younger members of the family or relatives–in–law. Did Cornaglia go back to Carignano? I wish I knew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-the-art-of-baking-viva-la-italia-in-amche-pune-101613033053645.html

A BSF official requesting anonymity said that Mandeep Singh, a resident of Dhanoe Khurd village in Ajnala sub division of Amritsar district, was hospitalised with a bullet injury on the shoulder after the incident at 8.30am. BSF sources said Mandeep was accompanied by an accomplice who managed to escape, taking advantage of the zero visibility due to the fog. Mandeep is suspected to be roaming near the border to clear a drug or weapons consignment. They said the movement of suspects was also noticed across the barbed wire fence and before the zero line at the border. The suspects from across the fence also managed to flee due to the fog.

11-02-2021||Patna||Artificial intelligence to detect air-pollution sources in Bihar||The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) is all set to use artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing technology to detect key sources of air pollution in the state through satellite images and real-time monitoring.For this, BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh and India-based representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Shoko Noda virtually signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Tuesday.After inking the agreement, the pollution control board will soon be able to use the Geo AI platform developed by the Accelerator Lab of the UNDP and the University of Nottingham.Elaborating on the function of artificial intelligence, Ghosh said, “It is a first-of-its-kind application used by the state government to tackle environmental concerns effectively. The remote sensing technology will enable us to track down such brick kilns which have not been converted to the zigzag setting design along with the identification of areas where stubble burning is taking place and heavy vehicular emission across the state.”“Of the total 6,000 brick kilns, 70% have adopted the cleaner technology while the rest are still using the banned traditional method. Most of the brick kilns are situated in remote areas making it difficult to inspect manually,” said Ghosh.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had issued a directive in June 2017, mandating brick kilns across India to convert to the less polluting zigzag setting design.Also Read: Bihar’s best medical college fights absenteeism amid bid to turn it world classAccording to the BSPCB, brick kilns are one of the major contributors to air pollution. As per available data, 14% of air pollution in the state is caused by brick kilns while 22% is caused by domestic burning. Transportation causes 19% pollution, dust 15%, industry 14%, waste burning 11% and diesel generator sets 5%.Ghosh also shared that besides the existing 11 air-monitoring stations, the board is in the process to install additional 24 apparatus to monitor and analyse air and noise pollution in the state.“About 40% of deaths worldwide were due to air, water, and soil pollutions. We have geared up to check on environmental pollution in all possible ways,” he stressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/artificial-intelligence-to-detect-air-pollution-sources-in-bihar-101613016321397.html
11-02-2021||Patna||Bihar’s best medical college fights absenteeism amid bid to turn it world class||The Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) administration is firm on checking absenteeism of doctors, a big challenge in realisation of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s ambition of turning the hospital into a world class facility, said authorities. On Monday, Kumar laid the foundation stone for renovation of Bihar’s oldest medical college from a 1,754-bed unit into a 5462-bed facility.The project, at an estimated cost of ₹5,540 crore, will likely catapult the PMCH into the country’s largest hospital and the second largest in the world, next only to a Taiwanese health facility in terms of in-patient beds after it’s completion in seven years. Kumar has appealed to L&T, the firm executing the project, to complete it in five years instead.With the state government’s push for improved health infrastructure, in sync with the 137% increase in the Centre's health budget, absenteeism of government doctors in state-run medical colleges and hospitals remains the biggest challenge for the authorities.“I am aware of the work culture of our doctors. Ever since I joined (as superintendent), I have been able to check absenteeism of doctors to a large extent. Almost 90% of doctors have fallen in line. Just 10% remaining doctors now have to mend their ways,” said Dr IS Thakur, who took charge as the superintendent of the PMCH on February 1.There is no ban on government doctors’ private practice in Bihar. As such, some doctors allegedly abstain from duty to attend to their private clinics or work as consultants in private healthcare facilities in return for handsome remuneration, said an official.The coronavirus pandemic has thrown a spanner in the state government’s effort to check absenteeism and prevent doctors from bunking duty since the biometric system of attendance, put in place by the Medical Council of India (MCI), has been suspended.The system of scanning iris for attendance has yet not become operational though cameras have been installed at some departments of the PMCH a couple of months back.While the health department is struggling to put in place the iris-scan biometric system at the oldest and most reputed medical college in Bihar, AIIMS-Patna has been using it for the last six months.Efforts to reach PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Chaudhary didn’t succeed as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages.“Before taking any administrative action, I have, for now, requested all our doctors to be punctual and take their duty seriously. I personally make rounds of outdoor patient departments (OPD), wards and the emergency department. This has significantly reduced absenteeism and instances of doctors abstaining from duty,” said Dr Thakur.Also Read: Bihar budget: Builders seek lower registration rate, amnesty for illegal flats“The OPD registration begins at 8am. Junior doctors are supposed to be at their workplace by 8.30am and I expect senior doctors to join them at the OPD by 9am. All doctors on OPD duty have to stay back till whatever time it takes to attend to patients registered till 1.30pm,” he added.Dr Thakur, however, admitted that he was yet to ensure evening rounds of in-patient wards by senior doctors.“There is a government order, which says that senior doctors have to take evening rounds of wards. At present, this is being done by postgraduate medicos. I have requested senior doctors to do it. Give me some time to ensure that,” said the superintendent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-best-medical-college-fights-absenteeism-amid-bid-to-turn-it-world-class-101613014433407.html

Motorists will have to face heavy traffic jams in parts of the Capital due to diversion of vehicles on some routes.. Delhi traffic police officers said motorists in Delhi and Ghaziabad have been facing heavy traffic jams during peak hours as the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border has remained completely closed due to the ongoing agitation. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut, NH-9 and NH-24 are closed because of the UP Gate border blockade and vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to alternative border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND, and Kalindi Kunj, they said.Also Read | PM says govt ready for talks, farmers announce rail roko agitation: Key pointsHowever, they said, the NH-24 road is open for traffic going to Delhi from Ghaziabad through Ghazipur roundabout.

11-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A woman and her greens||The woman in white sooti (cotton) sari is walking erect, with a big sack on her head. She is carrying it with confidence, showing neither fear nor instability as she wades through the lanes of this central Delhi neighbourhood. Even more astonishing is that she is balancing it without the aid of her arms.On being stopped and complimented for this skill, she smiles, but without shaking her head, which stays as still as statue. “I have been doing it for years at this time of the morning,” says Simon Khatoon modestly. In her 60s, she is heading home after filling up her sack with vegetables for the day. Each day, at dawn, she leaves her home and walks for about a mile to the vegetable mandi where “I never buy any tarkari (vegetables),” she clarifies. She instead picks up the vegetables that accidentally fall off from “trucks and lorries” as they are transferred by the labourers from the vehicles to the mandi stalls. The vegetables come from Azadpur subzi mandi, from where most of Delhi gets its greens.“This way I don’t have to spend money, and nobody suffers any loss,” says the woman, explaining that most of the veggies she picks up from the ground tend to be rotten and thus unsaleable—“but I slice off the rotten parts and the rest of the saag-subzi tastes fine.”Ms Khatoon lives with her son, and is the family’s only breadwinner. She works as a part-time housemaid and dishwasher in a few households. Her husband died years ago, she says. “We had come from Patna.”Ms Khatoon’s sack shows an emperor-like figure holding a rose, beside a dish of steaming rice—the branding suggests it originally belonged to a basmati rice company.At this hour the street is empty. The woman’s eyes scan 180 degrees, as if searching for anything. Responding to a query, she expresses her relief that all her daughters are married. “One lives in Khajuri, another in Shastri Park...,” she lists, referring to various Delhi neighbourhoods. It’s her son for whom, she says, she continues to work even in her advancing years. “He cannot see… so he stays at home all the time.”Now, raising her eyes upwards, she mutters “today I got a bit of matar, a bit of tamatar and a lot of gobhi.” Her voice suggests satisfaction. She starts walking again, her head perfectly still.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-woman-and-her-greens-101612999747782.html
11-02-2021||Chandigarh||Vigilance Bureau falsely implicated PCS officer for corruption, finds probe report||The Vigilance Bureau (VB) had falsely implicated a Punjab Civil Services (PCS) officer, Tarsem Chand, posted as secretary in the Regional Transport Authority in Faridkot district, in a corruption case in connivance with two private transporters in June last year. According to the findings of the probe conducted by VB deputy inspector general Surjit Singh, Chand was implicated in connivance with Muktsar-based private transporter Gursahib Singh Brar and complainant Baaj Singh, another transporter from Muktsar. The findings are a part of the probe carried out after Chand filed a representation for a fair inquiry in August. Officer’s driver is main accused On 23 June, 2020, Chand along with his driver and Punjab Police head constable Amarjit Singh were arrested by the Mohali VB team, led by deputy superintendent of police Harwinderpal Singh, for accepting ₹15,000 from Baaj to run his tourist buses bearing Rajasthan registration numbers in Punjab and also to ensure that they are not challaned. In July, the PCS Officers’ Association condemned Chand’s arrest and demanded that the case be cancelled. The probe report, accessed by Hindustan Times, grants a clean chit to Chand and recommends that he be discharged from the case. It says driver Amarjit Singh is the main accused and there is no “meaningful evidence” against Chand, who has been implicated due to a personal rivalry of the complainant, the transporters and aides. Recordings helped nail the lie The report says that Baaj approached Amarjit on June 16 and offered a monthly bribe to him, saying he had paid another RTA office employee, Suresh Kumar, too. Amarjit agreed to help. Baaj recorded their conversation and approached Mohali vigilance DSP Harwinderpal Singh. Baaj claimed that Chand was demanding the money for himself through Amarjit. “It’s clear from the recording of the conversation between Amarjit and Baaj that Chand never asked the transporter to meet his driver had no pending work of the complainant. Without taking the recording on the case file, the earlier investigating officer registered a corruption case against the RTA merely based on the complainant’s apprehension. Chand never directly or indirectly sought money,” the report says. “During the VB trap, Baaj kept asking Amarjit to get him to meet Chand. The VB team didn’t recover the money for 90 minutes (which should have been done immediately) after taking Amarjit into custody. Instead, the VB team took Amarjit to Chand’s office after being asked by Baaj,” the report says. After Baaj met Chand in his office and gave the list of his buses to the RTA, saying whatever you asked for as service (sewa) has been given to Amarjit, the VB team recovered the amount from Amarjit. Private transporter hatched conspiracy The report says Gursahib Singh, the owner of Darvesh transport, Muktsar, along with his brother, Rajinder Singh, frequently visited the RTA office in Faridkot and knew employees there. Gursahib is known to both Baaj and Karandeep Singh, a reader of the Mohali VB DSP. The three were in touch when the trap for Chand was laid. It is learnt that when Chand was posted as the Faridkot RTA, a case to register a VIP number, PBQ-0001, came to his office. Gursahib was interested in the number and was upset with the RTA for not acceding to his request for the number. “Gursahib was miffed when Chand transferred some old employees of the RTA office, resulting in his losing his grip on the office and thus began his rivalry with Chand. Gursahib hatched the conspiracy with Baaj and VB officials,” the report says. Call details showed Karandeep, Gursahib and Baaj were in touch with each other on the day the trap was laid. Gursahib and Karandeep exchanged 21 calls between 8am and 11.30pm on June 23.  ₹2 lakh placed in RTA’s car by driver On the recovery of ₹2 lakh from Tarsem’s car, the report says CCTV footage shows Amarjit keeping a packet in the RTA’s car at the Faridkot deputy commissioner’s office. The amount belongs to an RTA office clerk, Sukhwinder Singh, who alleged that Chand demanded the money. Sukhwinder withdrew the ₹2 lakh from a bank 13 days before the trap but handed over the amount to Amarjit only on the day the trap was laid. “An official witness in the case stated on August 5 that the bribe was recovered from Amarjit and it was the driver himself who handed over the car keys to VB officials after which they recovered ₹2 lakh. The information about ₹2 lakh to the complainant and Gursahib led to suspicion that the additional amount in the RTA’s car without his knowledge was to create additional evidence against him”, the report adds. VB officials mum on report Deputy inspector general Surjit Singh was not available for comment, while DSP Harwinderpal Singh said the matter is still being probed and the Mohali court is yet to give its verdict. Vigilance head constable Karandeep Singh feigned ignorance, too. Gursahib denied the allegations and claimed the VB had caught Chand and now wants to give him the clean chit so it’s blaming the transporters. Baaj said he stood by his complaint and alleged that the VB was under pressure from Chand. He said that he has filed an RTI application for the inquiry report and will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court against the VB for giving a clean chit to Chand.

11-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh advisory council meets, leaves without any major decision||Organised after nearly 1.5 years, the Administrator’s Advisory Council meeting, held here on Wednesday, ended without any major decision for the city.The around two-hour session, organised at Hotel Mountview in Sector 10, started with UT administrator VP Singh Badnore addressing the members, following which law and order, and infrastructure development projects were taken up. The DGP made a presentation of around 15 minutes on the former, while UT chief engineer OP Ojha took 45 minutes for a presentation on the latter.Thereon, only some council members, mostly political leaders and bureaucrats, got the opportunity to speak for two minutes each. As a result, after the meeting, vexed representatives of the market, resident and industry associations sought changes in the format of the session.Suggestions were also made for action-taken reports to be tabled before the council members, to apprise them of the measures taken by the administration on the previously-issued recommendations by the council and its sub-committees.Fresh recommendations of the sub-committees were taken on record and members who didn’t get the time to speak were asked to submit their comments in writing.Council met last in Sept 2019The council had last met on September 13, 2019 after it was reconstituted in August 2019.Headed by the UT administrator, it is responsible for advising the administration on development issues and policy matters affecting the city, and gives a platform to the residents to air their views on a range of issues concerning the city.In addition to all senior UT officials, it includes current and former members of Parliament, mayor, resident and business association representatives, and other prominent citizens. It also has 10 standing committees, which are subject-matter-related groups headed by a chairman.‘Presentations were a waste of time’Terming the around one-hour-long presentations made by the UT police and engineering department a waste of time, Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said, “Such presentations could be instead provided as reports in advance. But, instead most of the meeting was dedicated to them, which was mostly an exercise in self-praise.”Bittu, who was not allowed to speak because of “paucity of time”, added, “The real objective of the meeting is to allow people to connect with the authorities and air their views. They, and not officials, should be given precedence during the meeting.”The business community also expressed disappointment at not being given time to speak. Anil Vohra, former president and patron of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “The administration not only ignored the business community, but also resident associations and industry representatives. The meeting should not be only about giving political leaders or bureaucrats another platform to speak. In fact, the administration should allow the resident and trader associations to express their views first.”Questioning the working of the council, Sanjay Tandon, BJP national council member and co-incharge of Himachal Pradesh BJP, said, “I have been attending the council meeting for the last 10 years and same issues are brought before us repeatedly. Why doesn’t the administration decide on issues on merit?”Tandon also demanded that before the meeting, the UT departments should give a closure report on the recommendations made by the sub-committees of the council. “I have worked in the sports committee for more than a year and we had suggested several measures to the sports department, like giving awards to local sportspersons. But, there has been no follow-up from the department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-advisory-council-meets-leaves-without-any-major-decision-101612986007761.html

These constitute 5.3% of the total doses utilised for healthcare employees and frontline workers, including those from the police and municipal corporation, till February 8.A vial of Covishield vaccine contains 10 doses – meant to be utilised on 10 beneficiaries within four hours of opening – failing which, it is rendered useless. What’s worrisome is that the percentage of doses wasted has almost doubled from 3% to 5.2% in the last two weeks, prompting authorities to take measures to bring it below 5%, even though the permissible limit set by the Union health ministry is 10%.“The administration recently suggested that the vaccine wastage be kept below 5% and measures be taken for it,” said a senior UT health official, not wishing to be named.Almost a month into the vaccination drive, less than 30% of the total registered beneficiaries have been inoculated in Chandigarh.“Preventing wastage of doses is our priority. After peak day hours, a vial is opened in the evening only after six to seven beneficiaries have arrived. If two sessions are underway at one site, we transport the opened vials for better utilisation, which saves some doses,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department.Jabs for 50+ age group likely in MarchThe health department is gearing up to administer the vaccine to the next priority group, which broadly includes people aged above 50, from March. While the department has not received any formal communication, the third phase of vaccination was recently announced by the health minister in the Parliament. Guv urges citizens to get the shotUT administrator VP Singh Badnore has appealed to the citizens to take advantage of the free vaccine being provided by the government. Speaking during the Administrator’s Advisory Council meeting on Wednesday, Badnore said, “There are some unfounded apprehensions in the minds of certain person regarding the vaccination. I solicit your support in spreading the correct message in this regard so that all prioritised persons take the vaccines not only to save themselves, but also all their near and dear ones and contribute in providing immunity to the nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/300-covid-vaccine-19-doses-wasted-in-chandigarh-101612985888486.html

The development has set tongues wagging in political circles.Koshyari visited the Gondia Education Society’s Manoharbhai Patel Institute and felicitated meritorious students from Gondia and Bhandara districts on Tuesday. He also visited the National Flying Training Institute at Birsi and interacted with trainees. Addressing a gathering to celebrate the 115th anniversary of Manoharbhai Patel, the NCP leader’s father who was a politician and educationist, Koshyari said: “Praful Patel is following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ in Gondia district. Manoharbhai Patel’s contribution to educational and social work in the era when there were no resources is inspirational and exemplary.”Koshyari is at loggerheads with the MVA government comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, but has a cordial relationship with Patel, who is a Rajya Sabha member of Parliament. In response, Patel said that the Governor made the comment in context to his speech in which he has said that he takes everyone along following the footsteps of his father.“The Governor visited Gondia district for an educational function. In my speech, I had said that we take everyone along, following the tradition of my father, who followed the same principles. We don’t bring politics when it comes to development and social activities. The Governor made the comment in this context,” Patel said.Koshyari has been criticising the MVA government over various issues. Recently, he slammed the Thackeray government for delays in providing a government job to athlete Kavita Raut. Before that, he had said that allowing physical classes for schools and not allowing them for colleges and universities seemed contradictory.The Governor is yet to clear 12 names recommended by the state government for appointing as members of the Legislative Council (MLC) under his (Governor’s) quota. The recommendations were made by the state cabinet in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-tussle-with-mva-governor-koshyari-says-ncp-s-praful-patel-following-modi-s-mantra-101612983787946.html

The SPR has been signed by the civic commissioner and sent to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for further approval. A 5.5-km stretch of this 13-km road passes through the coastal regulation zone (CRZ), where the road will be elevated. A 450-m stretch goes through Naval Akbar Camp, where the road will be underground as per the DPR. The cost of the entire road has increased from ₹350 crore to ₹1,200 crore, which the MMRDA will be funding. The road will be a bypass road or alternative to the existing Ghodbunder Road, so the current congestion on the road will be eased. “The road was first proposed in 2007. The cost which was then ₹350 crore has now escalated to ₹1,200 crore. The width of the road is 40m and around 40% of the road passes through CRZ zone so we will construct it as an elevated road to minimize the damage to the environment. The 450m which will pass through the Naval base in Kolshet will be underground. The DPR was approved by the civic chief and will be sent to MMRDA for approval. Once approved, we will start the implementation,” said a Thane civic official. An MMRDA official confirmed that the project will be funded by them. “The coastal road project will be funded by us. The corporation will be undertaking the primary survey, alignment of the road, land acquisition and seeking various permissions from the CRZ and environment authorities. We have not yet received the DPR, but will ensure the process is not delayed at our end,” he said. Tunnel Vision A 450-m stretch of the road will be constructed as a tunnel, as the road passes from the Naval Akbar Camp of Kolshet, Thane. The MMRDA had approached the defence ministry for their no-objection certificate (NOC), which was granted in 2016. The ministry gave its approval provided the MMRDA makes a below-ground tunnel for the 200-m patch near the naval camp. This will ensure that the camp remains undisturbed. The Navy also had security concerns owing to the heavy traffic movement and have asked the MMRDA to repair any damage to the camp’s security wall, jetty and helipad during the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tmc-finalises-dpr-for-thane-coastal-road-101612983487991.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra got ₹305,000 crore for infra in budget, says Fadnavis||Maharashtra has been allocated more than ₹305,000 crore for various infrastructure and development projects, including railway, Metro and road projects, in the Union budget, leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday, responding to the state government’s criticism. He added the criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre by the ruling parties in the state was to cover up their own failure. Fadnavis said 328 road projects have been given ₹133,255 crore, irrigation projects have allocation of ₹4,000 crore, while 16 new railway projects worth ₹7,107 crore and admeasuring 2,000km have been allocated for the state. “The Damanganga-Pinjal project has been given ₹3,000 crore, water supply project has been allocated ₹1,133 crore, while the drought-affected areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha have been given ₹1,200 crore. Metro line-3 in Mumbai has an allocation of ₹1,832 crore, ₹3,195 crore for Pune Metro, ₹5,976 crore for Nagpur and ₹2,092 crore for Nashik Metro lines,” he said. Fadnavis said many leaders and ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) attacked the BJP and its government in the Centre without actual knowledge of the outlay. He said the outlay of ₹42,044 crore for Maharashtra from devolution of taxes, ₹10,961 crore towards the finance commission grants is more than many other states. “The state has been complaining about the pending dues towards the compensation of the GST, but the computation of GST compensation is done in the month of July and the Centre has promised to pay all dues to the states,” he said. Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “Fadnavis should tell us why Maharashtra was neglected while announcing development of the fishing centres in budget speech, despite the state being fifth largest in fish production. During Fadnavis’s tenure, the International Finance Services Cetre was taken to Gujarat from Mumbai. He is talking about the allocation of ₹3,00,000 crore, but he should also speak about the Centre’s failure to allocate more funds amid a pandemic. The Centre has also failed to release the dues against GST compensation.” Meanwhile, Fadnavis slammed the MVA government for the delay in arrest of Sharjeel Usmani against whom Pune police registered a criminal case for his provocative speech at Elgar Parishad last month. “The state government has failed to arrest him, but its police have been detaining BJP workers for agitating against him,” he said. Fadnavis also criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led government for the home department’s announcement of probing the alleged pressure on Indian celebrities to tweet in response to the statements by international celebrities on farmers’ protest. Fadnavis said there was no provision in the law to take any action for the tweets, but the announcement by home minister Anil Deshmukh has exposed the state government’s mindset. Fadnavis also said that ruling parties are scared of the election of the Assembly speaker after Nana Patole resigned from the post. He said that the MVA was worried it will be exposed on the floor for the reduction in the support by the legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-got-305-000-crore-for-infra-in-budget-saysfadnavis-101612983008414.html

The visits were stopped since March 2020, after the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed. The inmates will now be able to meet their family members after almost a year. Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of Maharashtra prisons confirmed that a circular was issued to all central and district jail superintendents of Maharashtra, asking them to coordinate with the respective district collectors and municipal commissioners on this regard. As per safety protocols, instead of five people, only two will be allowed to visit at a time and those below 15 years and above 55 years will not be allowed entry. During the lockdown, the government had released a few inmates on bail to decongest the prisons. “Every inmate wanted to get bail citing the reason of Covid-19, however, as the visitations from lawyers were stopped, they could not get any updates on bail procedures. In July 2020, coin box calling and video calling was started. As per the jail manual, undertrials are allowed to use the phone four times a month, while convicts are allowed the use of it twice a month,” said an official from the Maharashtra prison department. VB Vayachal, superintendent of police, Arthur Road jail informed that after taking the inspector-general’s permission and meeting the Mumbai district collector, they have started visits from advocates on Wednesday. Masks and use of sanitisers have also been made mandatory. The same circular will be implemented in Thane, Taloja and Byculla jail from February 15. Sadanand Gaikwad, superintendent of police, Byculla jail, said, “Visitors with masks will be allowed and sanitisers will be used. The visits are through intercoms. We will see that the intercoms are sanitised after every visit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/visitation-for-lawyers-and-family-members-to-resume-in-maharashtra-prisons-101612982467666.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government expects revenue loss of Rs1.12L-crore, work on devpt projects hit||Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown that crippled Maharashtra’s economy, the state government is staring at a deficit of more than ₹1.12 lakh crore for financial year 2020-21. This has affected development projects and social schemes largely with all the departments being instructed to spend cautiously in the remaining two months of the fiscal year.The state finance department on Wednesday made a presentation before the state cabinet, informing them that against the estimated revenue of ₹3.34 lakh crore, the cumulative collection until the end of January was around ₹1.80 lakh crore and around ₹50,000 crore more is expected in the remaining two months, so the deficit is expected to be about ₹1.12 lakh crore. The outstanding dues with the Centre towards the compensation for losses while implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and devolution of taxes is about ₹26,000 crore, making it difficult for the state to release funds on development works.“All sectors, especially industries and services, were badly hit due to the lockdown imposed from March last year. The GST collection is expected to see a deficit of around ₹35,000 crore in FY 20-21, so is the fall in the collection in other heads, including stamp duty, vehicles taxes and excise. Despite it, the state government released cent percent funds allocated for district planning and developments and local area development funds allocated to the legislators. Barring a few departments such as home, public health, medical education, other departments will have to compromise on their allocations for the remaining period of the FY,” the presentation emphasised.Though the revenue receipts from the taxes have improved over the last few months and have crossed over ₹20,000 crore a month, which had dropped to about ₹12,000 crore in first two months of the FY 20-21. State spends about ₹12,000 crore on the fixed monthly expenditure on salary and pension of the government employees. “The state government has already borrowed ₹70,000 crore and ended up spending ₹25,000 crore for the relief and rehabilitation of farmers and people hit by unseasonal rain, Nisarg cyclone, among others,” the presentation stated. “The state is tapping newer ways of resource mobilisation and is expected to levy toll on heavy vehicles and the sand transported to the state from other states. This cascading effect of the economic crisis is expected to remain for at least first few months of the next financial year, which has made mobilisation of taxes more important,” said a minister after the meeting. Neeraj Hatekar, an economist with Mumbai University, said, “The deficit would be because of the revenue shortfall and drop in GST collection. It is a fallout of the economic crisis because of the pandemic. The government will however have to raise funds by borrowing instead of cutting down on the development funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-expects-revenue-loss-of-rs1-12l-crore-work-on-devpt-projects-hit-101612982407712.html

11-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 3,451 Covid-19 cases, tally now 2,052,253||After a gap of 21 days, the state recorded more than 3,000 new Covid-19 cases in a day. On Wednesday, 3,451 cases were reported, pushing Maharashtra’s tally to 2,052,253. While there has been improvement in terms of recorded number of cases, officials expressed concern that the daily average has plateaued instead of falling. Earlier on January 20, the state had recorded 3,015 cases.New cases of Covid-19 have plateaued in the last three months, but Maharashtra still has 34,640 active cases, which is the second highest in the country. The state also has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in India. In Mumbai, 558 new cases were reported, raising the total number of cases to 313,213. At present, the city has 5,372 active cases and four deaths reported on Wednesday. Mumbai’s Covid-19 death toll is at 11,402. In the last 10 days, there have been 25,854 cases of Covid-19 in Maharashtra and the daily average is around 2,585, according to the state health department. In the corresponding period in January, 34,892 cases were reported and the daily average was 3,489, which indicates a slight slowing down in the infection’s growth rate. However, a senior official requesting anonymity said, “We are expecting a gradual fall in daily cases, which is not happening. The daily cases have hit a plateau and are not going down as expected. In between, we are also experiencing a rise in daily cases like today’s.” At the state Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, health secretary Pradeep Vyas made a presentation on the spread of Covid-19 in Maharashtra and ministers expressed concern over rise in the number of daily cases in certain districts. Four districts — Parbhani, Jalna, Beed and Latur in Central Maharashtra and Amravati division (comprising Akola, Amravati, Buldhana, Yavatmal and Washim) — have reported rising incidence of cases daily. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the state administration to strictly implement tracking, tracing and testing formula to contain the spread,” said a senior minister, on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, close to 573,666 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Maharashtra since the nationwide vaccination drive began on January 16. Of them, 503,002 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and 70,664 are frontline workers (FLWs). On Wednesday, 37,223 people were inoculated, of which 20,004 were HCWs and 17,219 were FLWs. Maharashtra has around 800,000 HCWs and 580,000 FLWs registered on CoWIN, the centralised app that is managing vaccinations. In Mumbai, 4,431 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 23 centres. Across the island city and Mumbai suburban, 90,533 beneficiaries have been inoculated till date. Of the total vaccinated beneficiaries in the state, 5,149 received Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, across six centres in the state, said the health department. Both Covaxin and Covishield require each beneficiary to receive two shots of the vaccine at a gap of 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-3-451-covid-19-cases-tally-now-2052253-101612982167635.html

A circular on the decision was issued by the department on Wednesday. The state may soon also allow Maratha candidates to avail the benefit of job reservation under the EWS quota in all the departments. The government’s decision throws open around 8,000 jobs in the energy department to Maratha candidates, whose fate has been in the balance after the newly-created SEBC quota is stayed by the Supreme Court (SC), said energy minister Nitin Raut.The circular issued by the energy department stated that Maratha candidates can apply under the EWS quota, which is 10%. The department had started the process of recruiting for various posts in 2019, however, the process was delayed.Raut said that the advertisement for recruitment that was published in 2019 had to be put on hold after a stay on the Maratha quota on September 9, 2020. He added that those who want to avail the benefit can apply for the around 8,000 posts including those for engineer, junior engineer, sub-station assistant, etc.Candidates from the Maratha community who are also eligible for EWS quota and fulfil the income criteria can seek benefit under the quota, Raut said. The government has instructed all district administrations to set up special cells to initiate drives to issue EWS certificates. The state also stated that it would be optional for Maratha candidates to avail the benefit of EWS quota. State cabinet minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservations, Ashok Chavan on Wednesday requested the state cabinet to make this benefit available for other government departments as well. He added that the government is positive about applying the same decision to all other departments as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-candidates-can-apply-in-ews-category-for-jobs-in-energy-department-101612982107617.html
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Corporate area spaces, more residential spots for parking in Mumbai?||From use of parking spaces in corporate parks for public as private offices are now operating on a work-from-home (WFH) basis to increasing residential day and night parking in all wards to cater to increase in the demand due to WFH, the Mumbai Parking Authority (MPA) is exploring a variety of new parking options for the city based on the conclusions of a study on the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown on traffic, use of public transport, and parking demand in Metro cities, including Mumbai. The authority also plans to restudy peaks of demand in parking due to staggered working hours offices and has suggested use of school and office buses, which are currently not in use, to increase the bus fleet in the city.The study, ‘Impact of Covid-19 on mobility in Indian cities’, was independently conducted by a group of city-based transport planners via online platforms in eight Indian cities, including Mumbai, in May and June 2020. It was published by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, United Nations Bulletin, in mid-December 2020. Nishant Sawant, one of the transport planners who conducted the survey in the city, is also working with the MPA. Hence, the MPA has decided to examine the findings of this study to augment parking in the city.The survey, which researched public opinion via surveys on transport mode choice, public transport ridership, and vehicular ownership in a post-pandemic scenario, revealed that 36% of the respondents who use public transport are likely to shift to private mode of transport post-Covid-19. Moreover, 39% of the respondents who use public transport and do not own a vehicle at present are willing to purchase a vehicle for commute. The MPA has concluded that this will incrementally add to the demand for parking space in the city in the coming months. A total of 169 respondents were from Mumbai.Sawant said, “At least 39% of those who use public transport at present are willing to buy new vehicles for the commute. This was a new and significant finding for us. Most of them are from middle-income families, and used public transport in pre-Covid times.”MPA is now in talks with as many corporate spaces, business parks and business districts, to take them on board and use their parking spaces for public parking. Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai, and a member of the MPA, said, “As a lot of people are working from home and will continue to do so until mid of end of 2021, parking spaces in corporate and business parks can be used for public parking. Also, with offices exploring staggered work timings, our peak-hour demand for parking will now change.”The civic body has provided 30 public parking lots and 14 amenity plots under the policy guidelines, amounting to 25,948 parking spaces. The BMC is calculating the latest number of available on-street parking spaces.MPA noticed that as most people are working from home, their vehicles remain unused, and require residential parking through the day, contrary to the earlier scenario, where people would take their vehicles out to work for nine or more hours per day, and residential parkings would be vacant. This has increased the need to have more residential parking lots. Assistant Commissioners of all wards of the city are now tasked with exploring day/night residential parking space. The MPA will also explore differential pricing for longer hours of residential parking in the months to come.Rohit Ahuja, a resident of Vakola, said, “I do not have a problem finding a parking lot because my work space has ample parking. But the main reason anyone doesn’t park in a parking lot is because no one wants to pay money, or go through the effort of finding a parking spot. It would help to have added parking lots in the city. Alongside this, fining for parking on the street which is a no-parking zone needs to be made stricter so everyone uses paid parking lots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/corporate-area-spaces-more-residential-spots-for-parking-in-mumbai-101612982047723.html

He said for 15 days before the Republic Day rally was held, farmer leaders in Punjab and at the Singhu border were telling farmers that they will be “carrying out their tractor rally to New Delhi, Parliament, India Gate and Red Fort.”While the police said the “allegations and disclosures” made by Sidhu will be verified, farm leaders said they will not comment until they hear or read Sidhu’s revelations that he has made before the police.“We cannot comment on such allegations until we officially know what all Sidhu has said to the police,” said Manjeet Rai, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Doaba group.The farm leaders have maintained that they did not allow Sidhu to use the stage at the Singhu border because of his alleged association with the “ruling party and his extremist views”.Harinder Happy a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Tuesday said that Sidhu hijacked the stage on January 25 evening and gave a provocative speech to incite farmers after which he was asked to leave the protest site. He also said that it was the last time that anyone saw Sidhu at the border until photographs of the actor at the Red Fort were widely circulated on television and social media.Sidhu was arrested from near Karnal Bypass in Haryana around 10.30 pm on Monday while he was waiting for a car arranged by his friend for his journey to meet his wife in Bihar’s Purnea, the police had said on Tuesday and claimed that Sidhu played a key role in instigating protesters.“On the run after show-biz at Red Fort rampart, actor Deep Sidhu arrested. Was a prominent player behind Republic Day violence. Had been instigating youngsters with his provocative speeches and stardom even when he was hiding from the law,” the special cell had tweeted on Tuesday after his arrest.While seeking Sidhu’s custody on Tuesday, the police had informed the city court that he congratulated the men who hoisted flags at the Red Fort and also did a Facebook live from the complex. Police said he was seen entering the Red Fort with people carrying swords, sticks and flags and delivered speeches to incite people. Police said many videos on his verified Facebook page through which he claimed to be innocent and was not among the rioters were uploaded from the US. In those videos, Sidhu said he was not a “traitor” or a “rioter”.On Wednesday, an intelligence bureau (IB) team also interrogated Sidhu at the crime branch’s Chanakyapuri office to ascertain his political and international links, police officers privy to the development said.One of the officers said that Sidhu has disclosed that he had reached the Red Fort in a car with his three supporters and returned to the Singhu border in the evening after the violence. From there he went to Punjab in the same car and with the same three men.“He kept changing his hideouts in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. We will be taking him to all the places he visited and identify people who helped him,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deep-sidhu-feared-attempt-on-life-police-101612980607332.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||‘Upload all FIRs of Jan 26 violence from Nangloi on police website’: Court||A city court has directed the Delhi Police to upload on its website all FIRs registered at the Nangloi police station in connection with the violence during the January 26 tractor parade.Metropolitan magistrate Abhinav Pandey said that unless any specific reason is not given by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) concerned, all FIRs should be uploaded on the agency’s website, so that representatives of the accused persons are not forced to run from pillar to post.“Needless to state, in all pertaining to the violence ensued in context of farmers agitation registered at PS Nangloi, except where any reasons have been communicated to this court for not doing the same, the guidelines as laid down by high court of Delhi shall be adhered to, and the FIRs shall be uploaded on the website of the Delhi Police….,” the court said in an order of February 9.The court was hearing a plea by one Deepak, from Haryana, who was arrested from Nangloi for his alleged involvement in the violence during the rally.The suspect, who is in judicial custody, had through his counsel sought the copy of the FIR and related documents like arrest memo and remand application to pursue his legal remedies. On Tuesday, the judge asked the station house officer (SHO) and DCP to check whether the FIR has been uploaded on the website while noting that the DCP gave the court no verbal communication for not uploading the FIR.The court, however, denied the request for the supply other documents like arrest memo, remand order and remand application to the accused at the stage of investigation and it would be given after the charge sheet has been filed.The suspect, in his plea, said he was not able to pursue his legal remedies in absence of the FIR or related documents.The tractor parade on January 26, held by farmers to highlight their demands to repeal three new farm laws, had turned violent as police clashed with protesters. A section of farmers had also reached the Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag there.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over two months now against the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/file-all-firs-registered-at-nangloi-in-connection-with-jan-26-violence-on-your-website-court-orders-cops-101612980606829.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||The chill is gone: Mercury in Delhi crosses 30°C mark||The mercury in the national capital continued to rise on Wednesday, with the maximum temperature hitting 30.4 degrees Celsius, seven above the season’s normal. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast that temperatures will continue to show a rising trend from now, marking the end of the winter season in the national capital.IMD recordings show that on Wednesday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 10.2°C.At the Palam weather station, the minimum temperature was 12.5°C, two degrees above normal, while the maximum temperature was 25.8°C.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the maximum temperature on Thursday and Friday is exactly likely to be around 29 degrees Celsius.“We can say that the winters are over. After this there is no forecast of a cold day or a cold wave hitting Delhi and the NCR parts,” Srivastava said.The air quality also improved marginally on Wednesday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 291, in the ‘poor’ zone, which was an improvement from Tuesday’s 305, categorised as ‘very poor’ in the AQI scale.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the forecast said the AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate again in the coming days.“Surface winds are low, which is likely to reduce ventilation coefficient slightly and hence AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate. But it is predicted to remain within the very poor category for the next three days,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-chill-is-gone-mercury-in-delhi-crosses-30-c-mark-101612980549115.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||14,743 people get Covid-19 jabs as vaccination number keeps increasing in Delhi||Delhi on Wednesday saw 14,743 people receiving the Covid-19 vaccine shots — the highest number since the inoculation drive was launched on January 16 .After Wednesday’s drive, as per data, more than 12,000 had received the vaccines for two consecutive days, as the drive picked up pace and more beneficiaries, including police personnel, got the jabs.The vaccine coverage – the proportion of people who get the shot among total targeted – bounced back to 80.5% on Wednesday, an increase of 11% over the previous day. The Delhi government has added another 82 centre, taking the total to 265, to keep up pace with the rush.“Yes, not every centre is achieving 100% target; however having more centres will increase the ease of getting the shot for people. Plus, we need to vaccinate health care workers and front line workers as quickly as possible and then move to the general population. For that, we will again need more centres,” said a senior district official. This will also help, as the health care workers who were vaccinated initially will be given their next shot starting at the end of the week, another official said.The vaccination of the health care workers will stop February 20 onwards as per the directions of the Central government. Those who missed out on their turn can get it over the next five days. So far, only 146,768 persons – including front line workers -- have received the shot in Delhi. There are 240,000 registered health care staff who were eligible for vaccination.Currently, all the 265 vaccination sites are in hospital setting, allowing the government to quickly manage any adverse reactions that happen. However, two senior Delhi government officials confirmed that in the next week, vaccination sites are likely to be opened in dispensaries as well.“For this, proper planning would be needed – ambulances will have to be on the standby, nearby hospitals have to be recognised for emergency care of anyone who has adverse reactions,” said one of the two officials.At least three of the eleven revenue districts in Delhi saw over 100% vaccine coverage on Wednesday – north-east (176.8%), New Delhi (105%), North (103.8%). North-east district has seen over 100% coverage for the last three days.Almost 80% of the people getting the shot are front line workers in most districts.“Around 70 to 80% of the people who are getting vaccinated right now are front line workers. Initially, everyone was hesitant but slowly the awareness is building and more and more people are getting the shot,” said a senior official from south-west district.Another official from Shahadara district said, “Now, most of the beneficiaries being vaccinated are front line workers, especially police personnel who are now coming forward in large numbers. Earlier, the turnout was low because of the farmer’s protest. In addition, we are also calling the beneficiaries multiple times which is resulting in higher turnouts.”The official said that the department heads were being encouraged to get the vaccines themselves and motivate those working under them in order to increase coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/14743-people-get-covid-jabs-as-vaccination-number-keeps-increasing-indelhi-101612980548531.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||Third suspect in Red Fort violence arrested from Punjab||The police on Wednesday said they have arrested Iqbal Singh, who they claimed instigated the protesters gathered at the Red Fort and vandalised property and clashed with security personnel during the tractor rally taken out by the farmers on Republic Day.Singh was arrested from Hoshiarpur in Punjab on Tuesday night, the third suspect in the Red Fort violence case. The police arrested Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu from Karnal bypass in Haryana on Monday and Sukhdev Singh from Chandigarh on Sunday.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said Iqbal Singh delivered a “provocative speech” and “instigated the mob to storm Red Fort and hoist religious flags”. Iqbal also “intimidated” police personnel during the violence at the monument, said Yadav after Iqbal’s initial interrogation at the special cell’s Rohini office on Wednesday.“Iqbal Singh was very excited...He did a Facebook live from the Red Fort and can be heard instigating people to climb onto the fort. He was not taking any instructions from farmer leaders and wasn’t in touch with them,” said DCP Yadav.Also Read | Deep Sidhu spent 13 days as fugitive with friends, was active on FacebookHundreds of farmers protesting on Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September entered Delhi deviating from the routes approved for a tractor rally and clashed with the police at several locations. One farmer died and 10 others were injured. More than 500 police personnel also suffered injuries in the violence.Iqbal was sent to seven days in police custody by a city court, where the police told the magistrate that he was allegedly one of the main conspirators behind the “well-planned” violence.“There are hundreds of videos. We need to confront him with all these. We need to find out who are the people who came with him and who are they affiliated with….He was one of the main instigators. This was a conspiracy,” the police said in the court.The investigating officer also said that Iqbal’s alleged link to Deep Sidhu also needed to be ascertained.Iqbal denied instigating protesters. “I did not come to cause violence. I reached Red Fort just like that and had not planned to go there. When I reached emotions flared up. Whatever I did is there on my live video. I did not instigate anyone,” he said in the court.A resident of Ludhiana in Punjab, Iqbal Singh was among the eight key suspects in the Red Fort violence case against whom the city police had announced a total reward of ₹6 lakh.“We caught Iqbal at around 11.30pm on Tuesday night from Hoshiarpur following information that we collected and developed through technical surveillance. Iqbal is a Granthi (ceremonial reader) and he used to visit several gurdwaras,” said DCP Yadav.Investigators said Iqbal was visiting the Singhu border protest site near Delhi since November last year. He last visited Singhu border on on January 22 along with thousands of farmers from various place in Punjab for participating in the Republic Day tractor march, they said.“On January 26 around 12.30 pm, Iqbal reached the Red Fort along with other protesters on a tractor. He was among the crowd that allegedly stormed the Red Fort, involved in clashes with security personnel and hoisted religious and farmers union’s flags,” a police officer said, quoting Iqbal’s disclosures to the police.After the violence, Iqbal returned to the Singhu border and stayed there till late night, before leaving for Mohali with other farmers. From Mohali, he returned to his home in Ludhiana and stayed there till November 29.When he learnt that he was one of the suspects in the case, he left his home along with his wife in their car that did not have a registration plate but a religious flag to identify it as the vehicle of a ‘sewadar’. He first went to Amritsar and then to Ropar, where he stayed for the next eight days. On February 7, he went to his sister’s home in Amritsar and left for Hoshiarpur, from where we caught him on the night of February 9,” said a second police officer.The special cell team was following the cellphones of Iqbal’s family members, relatives, and associates close to him. “The clue about his location in Hoshiarpur came when he contacted one of his relatives. Being a ceremonial reader, Iqbal used his links to get hideouts while on the run,” said the officer.The other suspects in the case who are still on the run are Jugraj Singh, identified as the one who allegedly hoisted a religious flag on the ramparts of Red Fort, Gurjit Singh, Gurjant Singh, Buta Singh, and Jajbir Singh. Jugraj, Gurjot and Gurjant also carry R 1 lakh reward each for their arrest while there is a R 50,000 reward each for information leading to the arrest of Buta and Jajbir.(With inputs from Richa Banka)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/third-suspect-in-red-fort-violence-arrested-from-punjab-police-claim-he-instigated-protesters-101612980546728.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||DDA gives nod for eco-friendly revamp of green belt villages in city||With a view to encourage eco-friendly development, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Wednesday approved the Green Development Area (GDA) policy, to regulate infrastructure and other works in villages that are located in the green belt on Delhi’s periphery as well as low-density residential areas (LDRA), where a majority of farmhouses are located.The policy is much needed, experts said, and will help regulate development activities in villages and ensure that they happen in a sustainable and green manner, without compromising Delhi’s green lungs.A total of 70 villages in the urban extensions of the national capital will benefit from the policy, once it is notified, officials in the know of the matter said.As per the Master Plan of Delhi 2021 (MPD 2021), the green belt extends from the boundary of the national capital “up to a depth of one peripheral revenue village boundary”.The policy, which was approved at a meeting of the DDA, chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, will be put in the public domain for suggestions and objections before being sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for notification.Currently, no new construction, either residential or commercial, is allowed in the 47 rural villages -- such as Dhansa, Mitraon, Tikri Kalan, Kapashera, parts of Rajokri, Ghumanhera, Bamnoli and Bijwasan -- that are located on the periphery of the city.A senior DDA official said, on condition of anonymity, “The GDA policy will encourage ‘green development’ and will ensure seamless development of infrastructure and road network within and around GDA.”The new policy, a second senior DDA official said, will allow planned development in these villages and make way for institutions, hospitals and big parks to come up. The policy will also be applicable to the 23 villages that are currently covered by the low-density residential area (LDRA) policy, notified in 2013.As per the policy, there will be a three-graded approach towards the development of land parcels falling in these areas. The policy provides a framework defining a minimum land area required for green development.In Grade 1, a minimum plot area of 600 square metres (sqm) is required, whereas in Grade 2 and 3, the minimum plot area required will be 4,000sqm and 10,000sqm, respectively. “The idea is to incentivise development on agglomerated land parcels of bigger size. The floor area ratio (FAR) permitted will vary from five (for Grade 1) to 60 (for Grade 3), depending on the plot size,” said the second official.The official continued, “The FAR will be much less than what is approved for any development in the rest of the city in a bid to ensure that the green character of the area is not affected.”For instance, in Grade 3, higher education campuses, non-polluting work centres such as cyber and knowledge parks, research and development, agricultural processing and packaging units, cold storage, convention and exhibition centres, concert spaces and stadium will be allowed.The mandatory wooded area shall be increased as per the grade change, with a minimum 45% of the plot area in case of Grade 3 kept aside as wooded/green area.Currently, the MPD-2021 allows the following activities in green belt areas: agricultural use, dairy farms, piggery, poultry farms, biodiversity park, veterinary centre, and police post, among others.On vacant plots in these villages, the DDA has allowed activities such as pre-primary school, nursing home, clinic, dispensary, banks, fitness centres, and coaching institutes, among others.Villagers say with the population in these villages increasing, there is a need for a plan development, so that people can construct houses and earn a livelihood.Bhupinder Bazad, president of master plan committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, said, “There are a lot of warehouses in these villages that are currently unauthorised. As the village population is increasing, residents need space to construct new houses and also look at opportunities to earn a livelihood. The GDA policy is the need of the hour. While we need to protect the green lungs of the city, we also have to provide avenues to villagers for gainful employment.”Now a majority of the villages in Delhi has been declared as urbanised. Three years ago, the DDA started the process to implement the land pooling scheme in 95 urbanised villages that are close to the villages in the green belt.“We can’t rely on farming for a livelihood, as most farmers only have small land parcels with them. In the absence of a policy, a number of farmers are selling their land and unauthorised colonies are coming up on those parcels,” said Pradeep Dagar, a resident of Dhansa village in Najafgarh.Urban planning expert Sabyasachi Das, former planning commission with DDA, said, “It is a good move that the DDA is working on a policy for planned development in these villages. But commercial activity shouldn’t be allowed there, as that will destroy the green belt. There is a need to have strict development control norms. While giving permission for development, the focus should be on creating more green spaces on the plot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-approves-policy-to-encourage-eco-friendly-development-in-green-belt-villages-low-density-areas-101612980488679.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||EDMC scraps new taxes for FY21-22||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Wednesday scrapped all new taxes such as betterment tax, education cess and professional tax, which were proposed by the EDMC additional commissioner in the budget presentation last December for financial year 2021-22.The civic body has, instead, decided to bring more properties under the tax ambit to boost its revenue. It has also decided to approach the Delhi government to ask for its dues of ₹2,985 crore to improve its financial situation.The total budget projection of the East corporation for fiscal 2021-22 is ₹4,653 crore.Presenting the final budget estimates for the financial year 2021-22, leader of the house in EDMC Pravesh Sharma said increasing tax on properties cannot be the only solution to boost revenue collection. “There will be no new tax for the people living (in neighbourhoods) under the EDMC jurisdiction. The public are already suffering because of the coronavirus pandemic, hence, we will not levy any new tax. The proposal of imposing new taxes has been scrapped,” Sharma said.In the initial budget proposals for 2021-22, presented by EDMC additional commissioner Ramesh Verma on December 9, it was proposed to impose three new taxes — professional tax, betterment tax and education cess.Professional tax has already been approved by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation whereby professionals such as doctors, lawyers, architects -- both salaried and self-employed -- will have to pay a tax based on different income slabs. The betterment tax was to be levied against properties, the values of which have been constantly rising because of public infrastructure development works.The additional commissioner had also proposed an education cess of 5% on the annual property tax.Sharma further said there are other ways to bolster revenue so instead of new taxes or hiking property tax, the civic body has decided to bring more people under its tax net. “At present, only 2.5 lakh properties in the EDMC pay taxes while the number of taxable properties is above 14 lakh. So, we will conduct a fresh survey of properties from which tax can be collected and will start special drives to improve tax collection,” Sharma said.He also said that the municipality will mount pressure on the Delhi government to release ₹2,985 crore, due towards EDMC, so that the civic body’s financial health improves.Sharma said that the budget also proposes to install 100 streetlights in each ward wherever there are dark spots.Reacting to the final budget estimates, leader of opposition in the EDMC and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Manoj Tyagi said, “It is not a people friendly budget as there is no new public oriented announcement. They have also not announced new proposals to boost EDMC’s revenue. Blaming the AAP government is wrong as there are no dues for the government to clear. Instead of eying funds from the government, the BJP-ruled civic body should make efforts to increase its revenue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-new-taxes-in-edmc-budget-more-properties-to-come-under-tax-ambit-to-boost-revenue-101612980488006.html

The budget for 2021-22 was approved on Wednesday in a meeting chaired by Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.The DDA, which already has more than 35,000 flats in various stages of constructions, especially in three sub-cities ---Narela, Dwarka and Rohini— has decided to develop civic infrastructure in a big way in the upcoming year.For this, the DDA has decided to spend ₹2,326 crore on land development and civic infrastructure such as roads, sewerage, water supply, power lines and drainage, mainly in the three sub-cities of Narela, Dwarka and Rohini.DDA officials said that of the three sub-cities, special focus will be on Narela, where a majority of its new flats are located. DDA has been struggling to sell its flats in Narela mainly due to its poor connectivity with the rest of the city, said a senior official.The DDA has decided to pay ₹1,000 crore, in a phased manner, to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for the construction of Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor, which is going to be the first metrolite corridor developed by DMRC in the city. The DDA has written to DMRC in this regard last year.Last year, the DDA wrote to DMRC to rework the alignment for its Phase 4’s Rithala-Narela line—one of the two metrolite projects in Delhi—to synchronise it with the development proposed under the ambitious land pooling policy.“We will pay ₹1,000 crore for the project. We have allocated ₹400 crore in next year’s budget for the Metro project. We are focusing on developing Narela in a big way. A concept plan for the development of land parcels in Narela is being prepared by our consultant. The report will be ready by next month,” said a senior DDA official.Another major road transport project for which DDA will pay for is the development of Urban Extension Road-II, which will connect four national highways and provide seamless access between north and north-west Delhi to IGI airport.NHAI, which is constructing the 75km long stretch, had asked DDA to pay for the viability gap funding worth ₹4,000 crore.In its ₹6,738 crore, DDA has allocated ₹500 crore for construction of city’s first Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) project at Karkardooma, spread over 30 acres. The project is aimed at integrated development, including housing, commercial and office complexes, around the Metro station.The DDA has allocated ₹280 crore for the development of the Centre’s ambitious project to develop Bharat Vandana park, which will have replicas of monuments from across the country.While the work on the rejuvenation and restoration of river Yamuna floodplain is going on, DDA has allocated ₹40 crore to revive 41 water bodies in the city.In the coming year, the DDA will start the construction work of four sports complexes—three in Dwarka and one in Rohini—and a golf course in Dwarka, for which ₹400 crore has been allotted.The DDA has allocated ₹1,100 crore for housing projects, which mostly includes projects related to slum redevelopment.AK Jain, former planning commission, “The focus on civic and transport infrastructure is a good move. Narela should be developed as a sustainable, carbon-neutral, smart city. The biggest problem is lack of connectivity with the rest of the city. With DDA agreeing to pay for Metro facility, the area will benefit from it. There is a need to have a comprehensive plan prepared for Narela.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ddaallocates-rs-3-500cr-for-infra-projects-in-next-year-s-budget-special-focus-on-narela-101612980486724.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s fight against pollution set to get smarter||The Delhi government will start in six-seven months its first source apportionment project and real-time monitoring of pollution, tools which will be employed to make better strategies to curb air pollution in Delhi.Source apportionment is the practice of deriving information about pollution sources and the amount they contribute to ambient air pollution levels.The new model was finalised after a meeting on Tuesday between Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and a team of scientists from IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and The Energy Resources Institute (TERI). The scientists made a presentation before the chief minister and said that the new system will not just provide data on the concentration of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in the air, but will also give information on the constituents of these fine particles, a first for the national capital.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Delhi government said, “Source apportionment project in Delhi, along with setting up of an advanced monitoring system of real-time pollution sources will help in monitoring sources and allow Delhi government to take immediate action against these sources.”According to a Swiss based group, IQ AirVisual, Delhi was listed as the world’s most polluted capital city for the second straight year in 2019. The study measured the concentration of hazardous PM2.5, particles that are less than 2.5 microns in diameter and can be carried deep into the lungs, as higher PM2.5 levels could cause deadly diseases, including cancer and cardiac problems. Every winter, the city’s air turns toxic with the air quality mark reaching emergency levels on several days.Explaining the new model, scientists involved with the project said the collection and assessment of data will be done at two levels -- through a ‘super site’ and through ‘mobile air labs’.Advanced air quality monitoring equipment will be set up at the ‘super site’ in different locations where hourly data for pollutants will be recorded. Scientists said these sites will not only provide data on levels of PM 2.5 in that location at any given point of time but will also give details of the composition of ultrafine particles, using which the exact source of pollution can be traced.“These ‘super sites’ will help authorities act immediately against the sources. Apart from short-term action, the recordings will facilitate long-term analysis, helping agencies draw up policies. For instance, the agencies will know which pollution sources are consistently contributing to the pollution levels in an area and action can be taken to tackle it permanently,” said Mukesh Sharma, professor (department of civil engineering), IIT-Kanpur, who led the team of scientists during the meeting with Kejriwal.“Daily variations can depend on temporary things like construction activities or high traffic movement but if it is persistently contributing to the poor air quality in an area then solutions need to be drawn,” Sharma added.Currently, Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC) air quality monitoring stations provide hourly average data on PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year started real-time monitoring at 13 pollution hot spots.At a more micro level, the scientists are also developing ‘mobile air labs’, which will move around the city and record pollution levels and specific sources at a particular period of time.Sumit Sharma, director, earth science and climate change division, TERI, who is also involved with the project, said air quality models will also be used to record details such as from where the pollution is coming and what could be the strategies to control it.“The Delhi government told us very clearly that they have source apportionment studies available with them, but those studies are static studies giving details for a particular period of time. They (government) wanted daily and hourly data of emissions and which sources are contributing to these levels, using which effective strategies can be made to control it,” Sharma said.A senior DPCC official said they have enlisted some recommendations before the team of scientists to tailor-make the technology for Delhi. “We will further improve the system but we can say for sure that this technology will help us monitor pollution sources more effectively,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-fight-against-pollution-set-to-get-smarter-101612980428631.html

This will also provide better and efficient transport services to the general public in the NCR, an official spokesperson from the transport department said.This decision was taken in the cabinet meeting held under the chairmanship of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar here on Wednesday.At present auto rickshaws and taxis registered in Haryana and having contract carriage permits under the NCR reciprocal common transport agreement are not required to pay tax while entering and operating in the NCR states --other than Haryana-- such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and NCT of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-tax-for-taxis-autos-entering-haryana-from-delhi-101612980427489.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||Physical meetings between prisoners and lawyers, family have restarted, HC told||The Delhi government on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that it has resumed physical meetings of prisoners with their family members and lawyer since this month.The submission was made before a bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup J Bhambhani while hearing a plea by gangster Neeraj Bawana, who had sought resumption of the bi-weekly physical legal interviews as well as physical family member visits, as per the jail manual.Currently, family members are allowed to meet prisoners once a fortnight and bi-weekly virtual legal interviews are allowed in the prison in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The plea filed through advocate Rudro Chatterjee and Yashovardhan Oza, has said that while the Delhi government has eased almost all other general restrictions imposed during the lockdown and has even thrown open cinema halls and swimming pools, it was yet to resume the physical meetings for prisoners in jails.Advocate Chatterjee said that even schools and universities have been re-opened and directions have also been passed for physical production of the accused in courts from custody.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal), and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, told the court that the government had resumed both physical meetings with family and lawyers and issued notification in this regard on February 6 and February 8.The court, while recording the statement of Mehra, disposed of the plea after Bawana’s counsel said that he was satisfied with the government’s submission.During the hearing, the court also remarked that when everything including movie halls has been thrown open then why the prisoners lodged in the jails should be deprived of physical meetings.Physical meetings have been stopped in jails across the city from March 25 last year after the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country. It was later partially resumed where an inmate was allowed to meet his family physically once in a fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/physical-meetings-between-prisoners-and-lawyers-family-have-restarted-hc-told-101612980428060.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||Plea before HC seeks ‘independent probe’ into death of man during tractor rally||The Delhi high court on Thursday will hear a plea seeking an independent court-monitored probe into the death of Navreet Singh, a 25-year-old farmer, who had died allegedly due to the overturning of a tractor during the farmers’ rally on January 26.The petition filed by Hardeep Singh, grandfather of the deceased, said the Delhi Police had falsely declared Navreet’s death as “accidental”, without fairly investigating the cause of death.The plea filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee also said that various medical/forensic experts, who reviewed the description of injuries in the post-mortem report, have independently made statements opining that the injuries are consistent with ante-mortem firearm /gunshot wounds, and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the overturning of a tractor.The petition said the grandfather had sufficient reason to mistrust the police and not accept the “hasty and unverified conclusion in the death of his grandson” as no investigation was conducted in the case.It also said the police’s version was unreliable as they have already registered an FIR against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and some journalists for tweeting that Navreet had died of a gunshot wound. The petition said tha when the incident had happened, the police had shown complete apathy; they did not provide Navreet any help or medical aid and instead kept firing tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.The plea sought that the matter be investigated by police officers who are “independent, professional and impartial”.Navreet was the only protester to die during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day after the police clashed with thousands of protesting farmers who had reached ITO from the Ghazipur border. Many of the protesters also reached the Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag there. Several protesters and police personnel were injured in the violence that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-before-hc-seeks-independent-probe-into-death-of-man-during-tractor-rally-101612980426786.html
11-02-2021||Delhi||SC stays HC order directing schools to give free gadgets to poor students||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed a Delhi high court order that had directed private and government schools to provide electronic gadgets to poor students for online classes and to get the cost of equipment reimbursed from the Delhi government, under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.The high court directions had come on a PIL filed by NGO, Justice for All. The petitioner had prayed that a free laptop or mobile phone with high-speed internet be provided to students of EWS/disadvantaged groups who could not attend the virtual classes for want of these gadgets, unlike their well-off counterparts. The petitioners had argued that financial barrier should not be an impediment to the goal of right to free education as guaranteed by the RTE Act.The high court decision of September 18, 2020, was challenged by the Delhi government and the Central government before the Supreme Court.On Wednesday, issuing notice to the NGO Justice For All, on the two pleas, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said, “In the meantime, there shall be a stay on the operation of the impugned order of the high court.”Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the Delhi government, told the apex court that the government was already reeling under a fiscal stress created by the pandemic. The high court decision added to that burden, Singh said. He also pointed out that the order required to be stayed as private, unaided schools were given the freedom to recover the amount spent from the Delhi government.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “We realise that it will be an additional burden.”The high court order had said, “Elementary education is now a fundamental human right as well as an enabling right and, every child, irrespective of his/her financial status is guaranteed the right to free and compulsory education.” It went on to direct private unaided schools and government schools such as the Kendriya Vidyalayas to supply gadgets or equipment of optimum configuration as well as internet packages to EWS/DG students to enable them access online classes.The order noted that Section 8(d) of the RTE Act put an obligation on the state to provide infrastructure, including learning equipment, to children. The court further held that the digital equipment should be provided free of cost to students and the cost for the same would be reimbursed by the state in accordance with Section 12(2) of the RTE Act.Terming the divide created among students by the lack of digital equipment as “digital apartheid”, the high court even went on to advise the Central government to seriously consider investing in digital literacy and infrastructure and to increase its education budget from the current spend of 4.43% of the gross domestic product (GDP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-stays-hc-order-directing-schools-to-give-free-gadgets-to-poor-students-claim-cost-from-delhi-govt-101612980308979.html
