The court also ordered the recovery of the value of disproportionate assets from his movable and immovable properties.At Bangera’s request, the special court suspended his sentence for four weeks to enable him to approach the Bombay high court (HC) to challenge the verdict.As per the prosecution, a case against Bangera and his wife was registered on October 7, 2011, for possession of assets disproportionate to their income from known sources between January 2007 and March 2010.Bangera had joined the income tax department in September 1976, as a stenographer. He was later promoted as an income tax inspector in April 2005. His wife Jayashri worked with the Mineral and Metal Trading Corporation Limited. As such, both of them were public servants.The CBI alleged that during their service, the couple acquired assets worth ₹77.21 lakh against their income of ₹17.2 lakh. Hence, the anti-corruption wing of the agency claimed that their assets were disproportionate to the tune of ₹59.89 lakh in comparison to their combined income.The CBI court had charged the couple for possession of disproportion assets. However, during the trial, Jayashri died in November 2016. Hence, the case against her was dropped and only Bangera went on trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ex-income-tax-officer-gets-3-year-jail-term-for-disproportionate-assets-101614191388052.html

The sanctuary was closed early in January after several migratory and exotic birds were found dead in the area. Deaths among migratory bird species were first reported on December 28, 2020, and the H5N1 virus was ascertained as the cause of death after which all kind of activities, including fishing, grazing and tourism, were stopped in 10-km radius of the lake. The authorities had lifted the ban on fishing in the lake on February 8. The Pong Dam Lake, built on the Beas river in 1960, was declared a bird sanctuary in 1983 and given the status of wetland of national importance in 1994. In 2002, it became a Ramsar site or a wetland site of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Since 1988, 425 bird species have been spotted at the wetland. Most of these birds migrate from their breeding places in the trans-Himalayan region, including Tibet, Central Asia, Russia and Siberia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-months-after-bird-flu-outbreak-pong-dam-reopens-for-tourists-101614191328047.html

The police now suspect that the sailor had staged his own kidnap.Dubey was found with severe burn injuries in the jungles of Gholwad in the Palghar district and died while being taken to a hospital in Mumbai on February 5. On his death bed, Dubey had reportedly claimed that armed men had kidnapped him and demanded a ransom of ₹10 lakh for his release.“The entire drama was meticulously pre-planned by Dubey given his Navy training. We will also take action against the owner of the petrol pump for selling lose diesel,” said Dattatray Shinde, superintendent of police, Palghar.It is clear Dubey was under debt to the tune of over ₹25 lakh and had even approached 13 banks for loans, as per the Credit Information Bureau India Limited (CIBIL) report, said Shinde. He had invested in share trading and as per his dematerialization (DMAT) account, he owed ₹76,000 to a firm, even as he lost ₹18 lakh in the share market, Shinde added.“His last credited amount was ₹34,000 salary from Indian Navy in January 2021. He had just ₹392 as balance in two accounts. Dubey had also borrowed ₹2 lakh from a friend and ₹9 lakh from his in-laws to invest in the share market. However, he lost all money. Dubey was to be married to be on May 22,” Shinde said.The police said that the alleged kidnapper by the name of ‘Irfan’, who spoke to his cousin, was Dubey himself. “We are investigating how Suraj arrived in Gholwad from Chennai, covering 1,480 km, in just a few hours, when it takes over 26 hours. Dubey had claimed he was taken to a hillock by the kidnappers, but we found it is impossible to climb the hill ‘blindfolded’ (as alleged by Dubey), as it is dangerous,” said Shinde.“Dubey had stayed at a lodge in Vellore, 60 km from Chennai, and had paid ₹2,000 as an advance. We also found his name in the hotel register. He checked out on February 1, evening, after getting a ₹1,000 refund. However, in his dying declaration, Dubey told us that he had been kidnapped from outside Chennai airport and driven 1,500 km down to Gholwad in Palghar, where he was allegedly set on fire by three unidentified men. We are probing as to how he travelled from Vellore to Palghar,” Shinde added.officer.Furthermore, the Indian Navy may declare Dubey as an ‘absconder’ for not rejoining the duty on February 1 at INS Agrani, Coimbatore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navy-sailor-bought-loose-diesel-may-have-staged-kidnapping-says-police-101614190728030.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Man shoots himself dead at Defence Colony home||An 81-year-old man allegedly shot himself dead with his licensed pistol at his home in south Delhi’s Defence Colony on Wednesday morning, the police said. The octogenarian, a former diplomat, left behind a one-page note in which he expressed his unhappiness over age-related health issues and wrote that he did not want to live, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police received a call at 7.25am that a person had shot himself at his house in Defence Colony and needed an ambulance. A police team immediately reached the house and rushed the injured man to a nearby hospital, where he died during treatment. “The elderly man had some health issues for which he underwent treatment at a private hospital for nearly a month. He returned home after being discharged from the hospital on Tuesday evening. He left behind a suicide note,” said DCP Thakur.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 2,526 people killed themselves in Delhi in 2019 and of them, 825 ended their lives because of family problems. A total of 130 suicides were due to mental health issues, critical and prolonged illness, etc.“Loneliness, health issues, lack of support system and financial crisis are some major reasons behind suicides. Instead of talking about these reasons, we should focus on the need for a support system comprising family members, friends, relatives, neighbours, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), and others. Such a support system will play a major role in preventing such deaths,” said psychiatrist Samir Parikh, who is the director of Fortis National Mental Health Programme.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

24-02-2021||Delhi||Govt notifies modalities of doorstep delivery of ration, cardholders may opt in or out every fiscal||The Delhi government has notified the policy document that prescribes the modalities of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, meant for the 1.75 million ration cardholders in the national capital.According to the notification document, the scheme will be optional, and beneficiaries of the existing TPDS (targeted public distribution system) may choose to enrol for the scheme or continue under the existing TPDS. Those who are not opting for the scheme shall continue to get their ration as per the existing mechanism and price. “Beneficiaries will be able to exercise the option in the beginning of every financial year,” the document, notified on February 20, said.On January 25, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the scheme will be operational by March.A senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said, “For the full implementation of the scheme, some more documents concerning modalities of processing charges, additional fee, etc., will have to be notified.”The scheme document elaborated the entire process and said foodgrains will be collected from the food corporation godowns by agencies empanelled by the government and sent to mills where wheat will be processed into flour and packed. Similarly, there will be units for cleaning and packing of rice as well. The packets will be delivered to fair price shops and from there, they will be further delivered to residences of beneficiaries who opt for the scheme.The beneficiaries will have to register the receipt of the ration with their fingerprints on the biometric-based electronic point-of-sale (e-POS) machines, which the agencies entrusted with doorstep delivery will carry. The entire operation -- from the godown to the doorstep --- will be monitored via CCTV cameras, GPS-fitted vehicles, e-POS logs, etc, said the document.Delhi has 1.75 million ration cardholders, which translates to 7.16 million beneficiaries. Of the total ration cardholders, 1.51 million are covered under the priority household category of the National Food Security Act, 2013, while 0.17 million are covered under the priority state household category, and the remaining 0.07 million come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, show government records.While those under the first two categories are entitled to 5 kilos of foodgrain a month, those under the third category are entitled to 25 kilos of wheat, 10 kilos of rice and a kilo of sugar every month. These items are distributed to them through 2,010 fair price shops that are currently functional across the city.The doorstep ration scheme was cleared by the Delhi cabinet in March 2018 but could not be rolled out because of legal and administrative issues. In July 2020, the cabinet gave fresh approval to the project.Shailendra Kumar, president of Delhi public distribution system welfare association, said, “In other states, provision for doorstep delivery is limited to elderly beneficiaries, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. The Delhi model will force fair price shops out of business and that will lead to unemployment. The government should be more considerate in this regard.”Saurabh Garg, secretary of the Delhi-based Sarkari Ration Dealer Sangh, echoed similar concerns: “By binding a beneficiary for one full financial year, it also deprives the person of the option to discontinue after a few months. What if beneficiaries have to go to villages and collect the ration there under the central government’s one nation one ration card policy?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-notifies-modalities-of-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-cardholders-may-opt-in-or-out-every-fiscal-101614190669000.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to look into custodial death of Tihar inmate||The Delhi high court on Wednesday was shocked and anguished by the death of an under-trial prisoner, who was allegedly stabbed to death with a knife in November 2020 at Tihar jail, and directed the authorities to update it about the status of the investigation into the custodial death.Justice Prathiba M Singh was hearing a plea by the inmate’s father Ali Sher, who had moved the court seeking a compensation of ₹5 crore for the custodial death of his son, Dilsher Azad. Azad’s counsel, Vishal Raj Sehijpal, said his client was accused of illegally confining a person, extortion and criminal conspiracy in a case lodged in 2019. His bail plea was pending before Delhi high court when he was killed.“I don’t know how something like this can happen. It is shocking. We see such things only in fiction,” Singh said, adding that the CCTV footage on the date of the incident should have been confiscated.“I had visited the Tihar jail once, and they have a very small time period for which they preserve the CCTV footage. Nowadays, we have cloud servers, so the issue of storage space is not there anymore,” the judge said.In his plea, Sher said Azad was an under-trial prisoner at Tihar Jail since September 2019. On November 30, 2020, he received a call from police informing him about the death of his son.The plea contended that when he reached the jail, the prison authorities did not cooperate with him and he was not told the real cause of death. After Sher called a lawyer, he was informed that his son was stabbed to death with knives.The court asked the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, to file a status report, indicating whether an FIR has been lodged in connection with the incident and, if so, the status of the investigation.During the proceedings, Ghose also said “it was a matter of great concern” that something like this had happened in the national capital. He said there were nine stab wounds on the victim’s body.The court further said the report shall also indicate whether the CCTV footage of the cell where the victim was housed has been recovered and preserved and, if yes, in what manner. It also asked whether any charge sheet has been filed in the case and, if so, the status of the trial in that case.The matter would be now heard on March 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-look-into-custodial-death-of-tihar-inmate-101614190667883.html

Ravi was arrested by a cyber cell team of Delhi Police from Bengaluru and brought to Delhi. Muluk and Jacob are currently on transit bail, with Ravi being granted bail on Tuesday after 10 days in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/toolkit-case-shantanu-muluk-s-bail-plea-hearing-today-101614190667338.html
24-02-2021||Other||80 prisoners out on emergency parole fail to surrender back||New DelhiAt least 80 prisoners, who had been granted emergency parole last year at the beginning of the pandemic to decongest the prisons, have failed to return to prison and are currently absconding, officials said. Prison officials said they will write to the Delhi Police with a list of names of all such prisoners who had failed to return after the end of their bail period. Many jail officers, who wish not to be named, said that among the 80, there are many murder convicts too, who were supposed to surrender this month. The surrenders are happening jail wise and so far 80 prisoners had failed to turn up on their set dates, jail officials said.“The process of surrendering began on February 6. The prisoners had to surrender at Mandoli jail, quarantine there temporarily before their transfer to their respective jails. Officials at Mandoli have reported that there at 20-30 prisoners from each sub-jail, who have not yet surrendered. We had chosen Mandoli jail as the surrender point so that even if a prisoner was Covid-19 positive, he/she can be detected early before being allowed to mingle with other prisoners,” said a jail officer. As one of the first measures to decongest jails and ensure social distancing at the start of the pandemic , nearly 1000 prisoners were released on “emergency parole” in April last year. The three jails in Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini collectively hold over 18,000 prisoners. The prisoners were originally supposed to surrender after eight weeks, but the surrender date was extended at different intervals as Covid-19 cases kept rising till November last year. Finally, the surrender process started on February 6, during which jails noted that many prisoners had refused to return. One such prisoner, who had been declared absconding was convict Shamshad Khutkan alias Rahul,31, convicted in the 2010 Dhaula Kuan gangrape case. Khutkan, who was serving life imprisonment in the infamous case, was among those released last year on parole. Khutkan was to surrender on February 20, but had gone absconding. A police team arrested him on February 22 (Monday) after a shoot-out in north Delhi. Police have said that Khutkan refused to turn himself in and was arrested with a pistol, which he used to fire at the police team on Monday. Delhi police on Monday said that Khutkan was involved in at least 12 robberies in the last two months. A second jail officer said that apart from the 80, who have gone missing, there are many elderly prisoners who have informed the prison department that they are waiting till the Delhi high court decides on a plea about the surrender of prisoners above 65 years. A city lawyer has filed a plea requesting the HC to extend the parole for all elderly prisoners. “There are a few elderly ones, who are in touch with us. We cannot call them absconding.” Sandeep Goel, director-general of prisons, Delhi, said,” At this stage, it will not be proper to estimate the number of prisoners who have not returned. The process of surrender is still on. We will be informing the concerned police station if prisoners fails to return.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/80-prisoners-out-on-emergency-parole-fail-to-surrender-back-101614190608951.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||DU likely to adopt combination of entrance test score and class 12 marks for admissions from this year||With the Central government likely to hold a common entrance test for admissions to undergraduate courses at all the central universities, starting this upcoming session, officials at Delhi University (DU) said they are ready to adopt it immediately in combination with the class 12 score of aspirants. The other two central universities in Delhi, the Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia, are yet to take a call regarding any change in their admission process.Last December, the Union ministry of education constituted a seven-member committee to recommend modalities for the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admission to undergraduate courses across central universities in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The same month, higher education secretary Amit Khare also said a common entrance test for admission to all central universities will be implemented in 2021.DU vice-chancellor (acting) PC Joshi, who is also a member of the committee, said, “The modalities of CUCET will soon be finalised and it’s highly likely that it will be implemented from the upcoming academic session itself. DU is also ready to adopt it from this year onwards. We have already sent our proposal to the UGC (University Grants Commission) stating that we want a combination of CUCET and class 12 scores of students for admission to undergraduate courses,” he said.Joshi said the CUCET will be conducted online and will have two components -- an aptitude test and a subject-specific test. “DU won’t have a major issue in implementing CUCET. The National Testing Agency (NTA), which will conduct the test, has already been holding entrance exams for some of the undergraduate courses in DU over the past few years. Besides, we are planning to combine the CUCET score with the class 12 marks of students because we cannot make the Boards (CBSE, state board etc) redundant. We are yet to decide the weightage of these two components,” he said.DU currently follows the merit-based admission process for admission to all undergraduate programmes excluding nine courses for which NTA conducts entrance exams every year. “We are waiting for a nod from the education ministry before making a formal announcement,” Joshi said. In Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), officials said CUCET won’t make much of a difference since the university offers only 10 undergraduate courses in foreign languages. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said, “The NTA is already conducting entrance exams for admission to these courses. So, it won’t be a major issue for JNU to adopt it. However, we are yet to finalise anything in this regard.”Jamia Millia Islamia registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri said the university is working on the modalities. “It’s going to be mandatory for all central universities and we will also adopt it. But we are yet to finalise our proposal. It will only be sent to the ministry after consulting our academic and executive councils. The education ministry is also conducting a conference this weekend to guide universities about CUCET,” he said. Presently, Jamia conducts its own entrance tests and interviews for admission to all courses. Meanwhile, some members of DU’s statutory bodies, the academic council (AC) and the executive council (EC), also said the varsity should have consulted them before taking any decision regarding admissions. “As per the university norms, the administration cannot send any proposal to the UGC or the ministry without consulting the statutory bodies. That is completely illegal. If the university continues to give weightage to class 12 marks, that won’t serve the purpose. The long process of document verification will still be there,” said Naveen Gaur, DU academic council member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-likely-to-adopt-combination-of-entrance-test-score-and-class-12-marks-for-admissions-from-this-year-101614190608148.html

Most students found exams, in both sessions, moderately difficult. Close to 6.6 lakh students had registered for this first cycle of JEE Mains this year.“Questions covered almost all chapters of Class 11 and 12 (CBSE syllabus), however, more weightage was given to Class 12 chapters of mathematics and chemistry. Students found the physics section easier as compared to maths and chemistry in the afternoon session,” said Ramesh Batlish, an expert from a coaching centre. Earlier this year, the Union government decided to conduct JEE Mains in four cycles, between February and May. The decision was taken to ensure that students do not miss out on the entrance exam if the date clashed with other competitive exams. With rising cases of Covid-19 across several cities at present, the National Testing Agency (NTA) ensured strict social distancing norms and all students were called to the exam centres before time, to avoid crowding. “Most of us managed to complete the exam before the given time limit as many found the papers very easy. I’m hoping for a very good score in the exam,” said Ankush Sharma, a JEE aspirant.However, the second session conducted on Wednesday got mixed reactions from students. “Overall, the paper was moderately difficult. Some students found the maths section lengthy compared to the physics and chemistry sections,” said Ajay Kumar Sharma, national academic director, of another coaching institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-session-of-jee-mains-exam-moderately-difficult-students-101614190548047.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Civic bodies stop taking event bookings for parks after NGT prohibits it citing environment loss||All three municipal corporations of Delhi have stopped taking event bookings for parks, including the Ramlila Ground, in the wake of a recent order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) citing environment loss to parks due to the holding of mass public functions such as cultural and religious events, weddings and political rallies. Civic authorities said they are exploring possibilities to “challenge” the order.The Ramlila Ground is a popular venue where major political rallies and religious programmes are organised. It is the ground where social activist Anna Hazare started the India Against Corruption movement in 2011.The NGT earlier this month had directed civic bodies to strictly enforce orders prohibiting weddings, cultural, commercial and other functions at parks. The order was issued while hearing an application that said wedding functions being held in west Delhi’s Vikas Puri Dussehra ground were flouting environment norms.According to civic officials, the bookings for parks and grounds are one of the important revenue sources of civic bodies and the move would adversely affect revenue generation of cash-strapped municipalities. Civic authorities projected a cumulative loss of around ₹3.5 crore a year to the three corporations.Municipal officials said prior to that order, as many as 129 parks and grounds across the three municipal bodies used to be booked for religious, cultural and political events throughout the year.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said there are nearly 47 parks and grounds, including the Ramlila Ground, under its jurisdiction where public and cultural functions used to be organised, generating revenue for the civic body. The NGT order has put paid to bookings this month, he said.“This decision is going to adversely impact our revenue generation. We are eying a loss of around ₹1 crore to ₹1.2 crore a year. We are examining the NGT order and are taking legal advice on whether it can be challenged,” Prakash said. He has also directed the chief legal officer of the civic body to check if Ramlila Ground can be kept open for bookings as, being a ground, it does not fall under the category of “parks”.Similarly, bookings have been stopped at the 64 parks of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and 18 parks of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).Narendra Chawla, leader of the house in SDMC, said before granting permission to anyone to hold functions or events in SDMC parks, the civic body takes an undertaking from the applicant that the ecology of the park is not be disturbed, apart from which a maintenance charge is also realised from the applicant. “We always ensure that there is no permanent digging in the park and no garbage is left behind. There might have been violations in one or two cases, but imposing a blanket ban on all events at parks is not right. With this decision, we are going to witness a loss of at least ₹1.5 crore annually. We are exploring options on whether the order can be challenged,” Chawla said.Nirmal Jain, mayor, EDMC, said, “The civic body is already facing an acute financial crunch and this order will further limit our revenue generation resources. We are looking at a loss of at least ₹80 lakh annually if parks are not leased out for events.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/civic-bodies-stop-taking-event-bookings-for-parks-after-ngt-prohibits-it-citing-environment-loss-101614190488494.html
24-02-2021||Other||Govt introduces contactless tickets on all DTC buses||New DelhiThe Delhi government on Wednesday, for the first time since its inception, expanded its ambitious contactless ticketing service to all its Delhi transport corporation (DTC) buses. The ticketless scheme was introduced by the government in May-June last year during the lockdown in order to cut down on physical human interaction that increased the chances of spread of Covid-19.Passengers can make use of this service through the ‘Chartr’ app. Almost all the buses now have QR code stickers pasted on the back of each seat which can be scanned to make payment through the app. Several buses, though not all, also had posters explaining in Hindi how one should proceed with the online ticket purchase by using the app. HT hopped onto a few buses and , however, found that most passengers still preferred to pay cash and coins and take paper tickets.On Day One of the complete roll-out of the system, at least 1,601 contactless general tickets and 5,015 pink tickets -— the free tickets for women passengers — were issued till 10pm on Wednesday, government record showed. “Till 9pm, the total collection through online transactions of tickets was ₹18,829. As many as 114 daily passes were issued on Wednesday through the contactless ticketing system amounting to a total collection of ₹ 5,150,” said RS Minhas, deputy general manager (PR), DTC. He, however, said the service is currently being run on a trial basis with an aim to fix technical glitches or physical problems faced by passengers or the conductors. Delhi has at least 3,700 DTC buses and prior to Wednesday, the trials were going on only in 128 DTC buses. A similar trial run is also going on in the city’s cluster buses. A senior official of the Delhi integrated multi-modal transit system (DIMTS) limited said at present, trials of the contactless ticketing service is being carried out in 497 of the 2,990 cluster buses in the Capital. “The plan is to formally launch the contactless ticketing system in all the 6,750 state-run buses — 3,760 DTC and 2,990 cluster — from March,” a senior transport official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-introduces-contactless-tickets-on-all-dtc-buses-101614190487422.html

Transit passengers will, however, have to wait for six hours until their reports are out.Meanwhile, some of these affected states have themselves announced restrictions that amount to at least a partial lockdown in an attempt to curb the surge, even as the Centre rushes teams there to deal with a sudden spike in infections.The lockdowns and the restrictions of travellers hark back to the first half of 2020 when most states put stringent measures in place amid the first Covid wave. With cases beginning to decline from October, most states relaxed these. Now, with a second wave threatening to break out, many are reimposing them.On Monday, the Maharashtra government announced a complete lockdown in Amravati district and restrictions on assembly of people in Akola, Washim, Buldhana and Yavatmal districts. Earlier this week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has imposed restrictions on marriages, public functions and gathering at public places across Mumbai.Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand have made negative RT-PCR tests mandatory for travellers from Maharashtra. Maharashtra, meanwhile, requires travellers from Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala to show negative RT-PCR tests.Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the city administration must regulate or closely check passengers coming from states where Covid-19 cases are on the rise again. “It is especially important now because of the multiple new variants of the virus that are now emerging. Most of the new strains spread rapidly even as they may not be as severe in terms of the infection caused to the body. But some form of regulation of incoming passengers is required. On Wednesday itself, Delhi’s active cases spiked by at least 80, which could well be the start of a new gradual spike if precautions are not taken in time,” he said.A Delhi government spokesperson said the decision was taken by the DDMA and an order not he same is awaited by the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/travellers-from-five-states-may-need-covid-negative-reports-to-enter-delhi-from-saturday-101614190487970.html

On Wednesday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 32.5 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 12 degrees Celsius, a notch above what is considered normal for this time of the year. Before this, in 2018 and 2017, the day time temperatures had crossed the 32 degrees Celsius mark. On February 23, 2018, the maximum temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, while on February 21, 2017, the maximum temperature had touched 32.4 degrees Celsius. According to IMD, this was the warmest February day in at least the last 15 years, when the city had recorded day temperature of 34.1 degrees Celsius.IMD scientists warned that the temperature was likely to soar further in the coming days. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that there is a possibility that the maximum temperature could touch 33-34 degrees Celsius in the next two days. “The temperatures are already hovering in the 31-32 degrees Celsius range, there is definitely a chance that the mercury could rise by a few points and reach 33-34 degrees Celsius. Whether it will break the 2006 record remains to be seen,” Srivastava said. He also explained that February this year has been recording higher than normal temperatures throughout and this was primarily because of fewer active western disturbances and clear skies; that has led to sunlight hitting the surface uninterrupted. “Generally, in the month of February we get around six active western disturbances. But this year, Delhi last saw an active western disturbance was on February 4. This prolonged spell without a western disturbance has led to clear skies, causing heating of the ground,” Srivastava said. Meanwhile, the air quality remained in the ‘poor’ zone on Wednesday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 278. On Tuesday, the average AQI was 250, also in the ‘poor’ category. IMD forecast said that there is a possibility of improvement in air quality from February 26, when the AQI is likely to come down to the ‘moderate’ range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/max-temperature-in-delhi-touches-32-5-c-highest-in-15-years-101614190430671.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Eight of 10 most polluted cities this winter were in Delhi-NCR and UP, finds CSE study||Eight of 10 most polluted cities in the country this winter were located in the Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh region, an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows. The CSE’s study, the results of which were released after an extensive analysis of real-time data from cities in different regions, to throw light on the difference between 2020-21 winter and the previous winter, has identified the Delhi-NCR as the most polluted cluster. While Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr and Greater Noida topped the list of most polluted cities in this region, Noida and Delhi were not far behind. Kanpur and Lucknow occupied sixth and ninth positions on the chart, according to the CSE analysis. “Winter is a special challenge when inversion, and the cool and calm weather trap and spike daily pollution. While the northern Indo-Gangetic Plains is the most affected, other regions also experience a rise, but with lesser intensity. But this year, even though the average level of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) during summer and monsoon months was considerably lower than the previous year, due to the summer lockdown, the winter PM2.5 concentration rose in many cities across regions as compared to 2019,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE’s executive director and the in-charge of research and advocacy. She further said, “This bouncing back of pollution, post-lockdown, unmasks the high impact of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to curb the winter pollution.” This analysis by CSE took into account data from 99 cities across the country, where data availability for two consecutive winters meets the minimum criteria for 75% of days between October 1 and January 31. The analysis also showed that in Delhi, the levels of PM 2.5 showed a “stable trend”. Delhi, along with 14 other cities, showed a less than 8% change in pollution levels this winter season as compared to the previous winter. “This analysis has helped to understand the regional differences in winter pollution. Even though there is considerable regional variation, peak pollution episodes increased and synchronized within the regions during winter. At the same time, uneven rise across monitoring locations and contiguous cities pointed to the impact of local pollution,” says Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager at CSE’s urban lab team, sustainable cities programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/eight-of-10-most-polluted-cities-this-winter-were-in-delhi-ncr-and-up-finds-cse-study-101614190429357.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools to assess students up to class 8 on the basis of worksheets this year||The Delhi government on Wednesday directed all its schools to assess students enrolled from nursery to class 8 on the basis of assignments and worksheets sent to them in both online and offline modes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Irrespective of their assessment, the students enrolled up to class 8 will be promoted to the next class, in accordance with a no-detention policy. The directorate of education (DoE), however, has not issued any guidelines for the city’s private schools. “Private schools will follow their own criteria to assess the learning levels among students up to class 8,” said a senior government official, not wishing to be named.With schools remaining closed for these classes since last March and classes being held online, government schools -- where a majority of students do not have access to smart devices and the internet -- are dependent on worksheets or assignments. These worksheets contain both notes and questions. Students can either access them on their class’s WhatsApp group, or parents can pick up hard copies from schools.In a notification issued on Wednesday, the DoE said, “Since no classroom teaching-learning has taken place at the primary and middle-school level, the formal mode of pen and paper assessment is replaced by assessment based on subject wise assignments/projects in all government and government-aided schools.”“All currently enrolled students from nursery to class 8 shall be promoted to the next class in the academic session 2021-22. However, the purpose of the assessment is to understand the impact of alternate learning approaches that needed to be adopted under the prevailing circumstances this year. Further, the data of this assessment will also help the DoE in determining the course content and learning strategies for the next session,” the DoE notification said. Under the no-detention policy, no student can be failed up to class 8.As per the DoE notification, students from nursery to class 2 will be assessed on the basis of the assignments they were given during the winter break and the responses to online or offline worksheets shared with them during the pandemic. Similarly, the assessment of students enrolled in classes 3 to 8 will be done on the basis of assignments and worksheets submitted by them during the pandemic and winter break. Also, another round of worksheets/assignments will be sent to these students between March 1 and March 15. In case students have no digital devices, assignments/projects to such students will be allotted in hard copy by calling their parents to school,” the notification added.Several private schools said they will also assess students on the basis of internal assessments and will also be conducting online exams. Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh, said, “All students up to class 8 will be promoted to the next class in view of the no-detention policy. But we will assess their learning levels on the basis of their internal assessments and final exams that the school will conduct virtually.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “The exams of students up to class 8 are currently on in the online mode. The school will also be assessing them on the basis of their internal exams and assignments. Everyone will be promoted to the next class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-to-assess-students-up-to-class-8-on-the-basis-of-worksheets-this-year-101614190430008.html

24-02-2021||Delhi||Okay with reopening Nizamuddin Markaz for religious purposes, Delhi govt tells HC||The Delhi government on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that it is agreeable to reopening the Nizamuddin Markaz premises for religious purposes, after a plea was filed by the Delhi Waqf Board to open the building, which was kept “out of bounds” since March 31, 2020, after several people who attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation there contracted the Covid-19.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel for the Delhi government, told Justice Mukta Gupta that many of the foreigners who had attended the congregation in alleged violation of social distancing last year have either been acquitted or have been discharged.He said the trials of the remaining people might take time and the court may pass appropriate orders to resume religious activities on the premises since all places of worship were allowed to reopen last June itself.The submissions were made on the plea by the Delhi Waqf Board, through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, who had sought that the entire premises, including the masjid, madrassa and hostel, be allowed to be opened.The petitioner said the police can make necessary arrangements to take photographs, prepare sketches, among others, to collect any evidence for the criminal case registered in the alleged violation of social distancing norms at the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz.On Wednesday, the Centre, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said the Union should be made a party to the petition. This was not opposed by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Waqf Board.The court sought the response of the Centre, Delhi government and the city police after the petitioner said it had given a representation to the authorities on February 16 but no action was taken on it yet.The matter would be now heard on March 5.On March 31, the Delhi Police lodged an FIR against several persons, including the cleric and foreign delegates, on a complaint by station house officer of Nizamuddin police station for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of social distancing norms put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/okay-with-reopening-nizamuddin-markaz-for-religious-purposes-delhi-govt-tells-hc-101614190427434.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps ACB Thane police for delay in FIR against contractor||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday pulled up the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) unit of Thane Police for not registering a first information report (FIR) based on a complaint lodged against a contractor who had allegedly cheated the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to the tune of ₹4.54 crore by under-reporting the advertisement revenue collected by him on the 470 bus stops in Thane city since 2013. A complaint was lodged in October 2018 against the contractor with the ACB, but as no action was taken, the public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the HC in 2019.In December 2019, the court had granted three-months to the ACB to complete its probe and register the FIR, however, the same was not done. After the court rapped it, the ACB assured that it would complete proceedings related to the complaint and register the FIR within one week. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Pravin Wategaonkar, was informed that the contractor appointed by the TMC in 2013 for signboard management on the 470 bus-stops in Thane city, had been appointed based on false financial eligibility details. The PIL further stated that the contractor had defaulted in paying the advertising fees to the TMC since the contract began, hence the civic body had issued a demand notice of ₹27.27 crores in 2018. In light of these submissions, the PIL sought to register an FIR against the contractor for misleading the TMC while securing the contract and also siphoning public money. Wategaonkar explained that though the short payment was only ₹4.54 crore, as per the rules, TMC could recover the amount with a five times penalty. Coupled with interest the amount came to ₹27.27 crore and hence the TMC issued the demand notice of the said amount in 2018. After hearing the submissions, the bench sought to know from the ACB as to why it had not complied with the December 2019 order to which chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare responded that a preliminary report of its inquiry into the allegations had been prepared but the final report was delayed due to the pandemic and hence it could not be completed by March 30, 2020. The HC further stated that as per the stipulation of a Supreme Court judgement the inquiry should be completed within a week and the FIR should be registered soon thereafter and hence the ACB should give an undertaking accordingly. Thakare then assured the court and said that the ACB was giving the undertaking to complete the probe and file the FIR within one week, which was accepted by the HC. Hearing of the PIL has been posted after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-acb-thane-police-for-delay-in-fir-against-contractor-101614190370462.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Transport dept readies command centre to track govt buses in real-time||The Delhi transport department has built a command-and-control centre in Kashmere Gate to track and monitor all Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses in real-time.The centre has been built at the interstate bus terminal (ISBT) in Kashmere Gate and will soon be inaugurated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday after he inspected the facility. “Apart from the command-and-control centre (CCC) at Kashmere Gate, there is a disaster recovery centre, a data centre and separate viewing centres in all depots. The live footage can also be monitored by all depot managers. The CCC shall be manned 24 hours for real-time monitoring of all activities on buses,” Gahlot said.Each bus is now fitted with three cameras, GPS devices, 10 panic buttons, one display panel for the driver, hooter, strobe lights and 2 sets of two-way audio communication devices, one each for the driver and conductor. “All newly inducted buses and to-be inducted buses already have all these systems installed on them which will be integrated with the CCC at Kashmere Gate,” the minister said.All depot managers, drivers, conductors and marshals on board buses have completed their training related to the operation of the installed systems.Delhi currently has around 6,750 buses -- 3,760 DTC and 2,990 cluster buses-- as against the Supreme Court-mandated requirement of 11,000 buses. In case of an emergency, a passenger or driver or conductor can press the panic button. The alert will automatically be sent to the CCC at Kashmere Gate in real-time. The operator at the CCC will filter the alerts and forward the alert to the respective stakeholder such as police, fire and ambulance for a quick response with the GPS coordinates of the bus. An SMS and an email alert will also be sent to the authorities concerned in synchronization with these panic alerts, the government said in a statement. “The objective of the project is to ensure the safety and security of passengers, especially women passengers through IP-based CCTV surveillance cameras, panic button and GPS on the buses of DTC and those under the cluster scheme. After the inspection, I also held a meeting with transport officials to discuss issues related to the functioning of the CCC. I have instructed officials to submit a daily report about data monitoring and operation,” Gahlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transport-dept-readies-command-centre-to-track-govt-buses-in-realtime-101614190368159.html

Hundreds of AAP supporters participated in the roadshow navigating the localities in two-wheelers and trucks, playing music.“I got to know that people have been demanding sewer line in Bawana. It is my promise that I will sanction ₹100 crores for the sewer project here,” said Kejriwal. He added, “The AAP has been actively campaigning against the corruption by the BJP. The MCDs are in a shambles because of their corruption.”“Together, the people of Delhi have defeated Covid-19, the pandemic has created havoc in the lives of the people. We have elections on Sunday, you all must go and vote for AAP. How many of you receive zero electricity bills? 24x7 free electricity has happened only in Delhi. We have worked to make Delhi better in the last six years by improving schools, hospitals, availability of electricity, and water. It is your responsibility to make AAP victorious in the MCD, together we have to change the face of MCD.” While the AAP is in power in the Delhi government, BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls in 2022. The BJP dismissed the allegations as baseless.Delhi BJP general secretary Shri Harsh Malhotra said, “The AAP government has not done any development work in Bawana, Shalimar Bagh and several other areas. Their leaders were unavailable during the Covid-19 crisis. They will get appropriate response from the people of these wards in the bypolls on Sunday. The promise of ₹100 crore for sewer line at this point speaks volumes about the poor condition of these areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-leads-roadshows-ahead-of-mcd-bypolls-blames-bjp-for-corruption-in-civic-bodies-101614190367406.html

The court has asked respondent authorities and the mayor to respond to the PIL within three weeks. However, when HT tried to contact the mayor, her phone was switched off and her office said that she was not available for comment on the issue. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL, was informed that Somaiya had filed several complaints with the Registrar of Companies (ROC), Enforcement Directorate, BMC and SRA for reporting the illegal activities of the company and its directors. He submitted that though the authorities were aware of the illegalities conducted by Pednekar they had failed to initiate any action against her and hence the PIL. The PIL alleged that the company operating from one of the tenements was floated by Pednekar in 2012, but she resigned from it and was being managed by her son. Somiaya submitted that as per Registrar of Companies (ROC) records, the company and several other companies were having their registered address as the ground floor tenements of Gomata Janata SRA Cooperative Society, Lower Parel. He added that another tenement on the higher floor was also occupied as a residence by Pednekar since 2008 and she had submitted her official residential address for 2017 BMC elections as the same tenement, which was incidentally allotted in the name of another person. In view of this, the PIL has sought from the respondent authorities including SRA, BMC and Ministry of Corporate Affairs to initiate action against Pednekar and others and also sought a direction to initiate criminal action against them. Somaiya has also sought to pass appropriate directions restraining Pednekar from continuing her position as Mayor. After hearing the submissions by Somiaya the court asked the authorities and the mayor to respond to the PIL within three weeks and posted the hearing of the PIL on March 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-leader-files-pil-in-bombay-hc-against-mumbai-mayor-101614190307948.html
24-02-2021||Noida||Fight against Covid-19 not over, be very cautious: UP govt||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday warned people against complacency in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases in several states in the country. In particular, they asked people to follow precautions as they did when the virus was first detected in March last year.Uttar Pradesh had seen a decline since the peak of 68,235 active Covid-19 cases on September 27, 2020. Gautam Budh Nagar had a peak of 2,008 active cases on September 13, 2020 and Ghaziabad had it on September 14, 2020 with 2,126 cases. On Wednesday, there were only 59 active cases in Gautam Budh Nagar and 61 active cases in Ghaziabad, while for the state as a whole was 2,190. Deaths too had declined considerably.“People think that Covid-19 is finished (in the state) but that is wrong. People are still getting infected, and it is especially rising in four or five states. So, it is vital that precautions like what were taken up in the months of March to June last year be observed strictly as our state has large population and the population density is also high,” said UP’s additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad.In March, the Union government had enforced a nationwide lockdown that lasted 68 days after which the economy opened up in phases. “We urge that the mohalla nigrani samitis in urban areas and gram nigrani samitis in rural areas be active again so that infection is checked and does not spread,” said Prasad. The samitis were formed to check on infected persons, their home isolation status and even to inform the health department on possible cases and violation of Covid-19 protocols. With fewer active Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, the district had reduced the number of hospitals dedicated to treating the infected -- from 14 to just three.District health department officials said that had an eye on the daily case count and, if need be, could convert private and government health care facilities into Covid facilities with five days’ notice. “We have not witnessed any major spike in cases over the last few months but we are reviewing daily progress. The Covid cases in high case load localities like Indirapuram, Shastri Nagar and Vaishali among others have also decreased. However, we are in a position to tackle any surge and our Covid hospitals can resume Covid-related treatment within five days,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Three hospitals were asked to reduce the Covid capacity by about 50% but they still have Covid facility running. In case need be, we have released the other hospitals on condition that they will come up with Covid treatment in five days if required. Only our acquired facility of Santosh Medical is in operation which is also serving as L2 and L3 facility with 200 beds each,” Dr Gupta, added. The figures of the health department indicate that at least five residential segments of Bhowapur (comprising of locality like Kaushmabi), Khoda, Vijay Nagar I, Pasonda and Kaila Bhatta have no cases reported in the current month till February 23. This is for the first time since last year that these localities have recorded zero cases so far. The district at present has a figure of 167 Covid cases which have arrived in first 23 days of February. The state control room figure of February 23 states that the district has total of 26733 cases which include 26569 patients discharged and 62 active cases besides 102 deaths.The sample positivity of cases saw a decline below 1% in January and also in the current month of February. The figures also indicate that only six segments comprising of Indirapuram (34 cases), Shastri Nagar (35), Vaishali (13), Vasundhara 918), Sadik Nagar (16) and Modinagar (10) have Covid cases in double digits till February 23. “Although there is no spike in UP at present, but people are not adhering to Covid protocols and need to take up precautions like wearing face mask, washing hands frequently and maintaining social distancing. The Covid cases emerged in March last year in Ghaziabad and peaked in subsequent months. So, all precautions must be maintained so that there is no repeat of the scenario,” said Dr Asheesh Agrawal, president of the Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad, while adding that the health department must expedite vaccination process.The Centre has deputed high level multi-disciplinary teams to states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir for supporting them in public health measures for targeted Covid response and management, and effectively tackling the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fight-against-covid-19-not-over-be-very-cautious-up-govt-101614190187409.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B students who discovered closest asteroid to Earth recognised by ASI||Three students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), who had last year discovered the closest asteroid to have crossed the Earth without touching it, have been recognised by the Astronomical Society of India (ASI). Kritti Sharma, Kunal Deshmukh and Harsh Kumar received special mention under the ‘New Discovery Award 2020’ from the ASI. In August last year, the students discovered an SUV-sized asteroid that soared barely 2,950 km above the surface of the Earth. Named ‘2020 QG’, this was then the closest known asteroid to fly by the planet without impacting it. On August 16, the students, who are part of a large international collaboration searching for Near-Earth Asteroids, discovered this object just hours after it passed by the Earth using data from the robotic Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in California. While this record was surpassed by a comet 2020 VT4 discovered by the ATLAS telescope system in November 2020, the students at IIT-B have been recognised by the ASI, one of the largest groups of professional astronomers in the country. “It is nice to be recognised. It encourages us to continue our work in the field,” said Sharma, a 21-year-old hailing from Panchkula in Haryana.“Kunal Deshmukh and Kritti Sharma, students at the IIT-B, play an essential role in asteroid discovery using the Caltech Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in California. They scan images for candidate asteroids in near-real-time as they are taken by ZTF and consequently allow very fast identification of exciting asteroids such as 2020 QG. Fast identification is essential so that other telescopes around the world can perform follow-up observations to determine the orbit of the asteroid. If it were not for their work, 2020 QG would have only been found hours later, losing crucial time for additional observations,” said Thomas Prince, Ira S Bowen, professor of physics; Allen VC Davis and Lenabelle Davis, leadership chair, Keck Institute for Space Studies; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, senior research scientist and director, WM Keck Institute for Space Studies at Caltech.IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “The trio routinely uses the GROWTH-India telescope to image and verify asteroid candidates found in sky surveys, and report the results to the Minor Planet Centre of the International Astronomical Union. Between them, they have discovered over 43 asteroids in the last one and a half years, with more being added each week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-students-who-discovered-closest-asteroid-to-earth-recognised-by-asi-101614190128324.html
24-02-2021||Pune||PMC garden dept claims loss of ₹11 cr since lockdown||The Pune municipal corporation’s garden department is claiming to have sustained losses to the tune of ₹11 crore, ever since lockdown was first announced in 2020. Pune has 200 public gardens. The public gardens opened this year and entry fees are the only source of revenue currently. Ashok Ghorpade, the superintendent of gardens, said, “The garden department used to conduct exhibitions of flowers, fruits and vegetables and sell plant saplings which used to bring in revenue. Between 30,000 and 45,000 saplings a year were sold at reasonable rates to citizens, but this had to be shut down due to Covid-19. We used to organise fort festivals and environment- related events which fetched us revenue. We hardly earned around ₹1 crore during the past 11 months.” “We have lost ₹11 crore since the first lockdown last year,” Ghorpade added. Citizen activist Ramesh Patankar said, “The garden department deserves more funding than any other department of the PMC. The PMC is earning crores of rupees in the name of development charges.The mandate of the garden department must be enhanced and a large number of new gardens must be created to balance the environment which is threatened by real estate developers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-garden-dept-claims-loss-of-rs-11-cr-since-lockdown-101614190068714.html
24-02-2021||Pune||Residents raise safety issues at BRT bus stations||With the Swargate-Katraj BRT corridor finally operational, issues have been raised about safety at bus stations. Pedestrian First, convenor, Prashant Inamdar, has written to the PMPML raising a concern about there being no automatic doors provided at bus stations, which is an essential infrastructural requirement for the BRTS design. “The bus station platform is at a height of about 900mm from the road level. Hence, in the absence of automatic doors, there is a high probability of commuters falling from a height into the bus lane, resulting in a grave injury or even fatality,” said Inamdar. According to Inamdar, the earlier pilot BRTS corridor design for the Swargate-Katraj corridor had separate curb-side bus stops for each direction. “These bus stops were of the conventional type, suitable for bus entry/exit through doorways with steps. Even though this BRTS corridor was working well, PMC decided to dismantle and reconstruct it as per the BRTS design with median bus station common for both directions and level boarding (bus station platform and bus floor at same level). This total renewal of the Swargate-Katraj corridor was done reportedly at a cost of about Rs100 crore. After shutting down the BRTS corridor for years and spending such a large amount of public money, the least that citizens expect is that the new BRTS corridor should be complete and safe in all respects,” he added. Automatic doors are a vital necessity, so that the doors open automatically only when the bus properly docks at the bus station platform, and again close when the bus moves away from the station. Electronic sensors need to be provided at the bus station and on every bus for this automatic operation of doors. PMPML’s divisional manager, BRTS, said, “We are aware of this issue and have written to PMC to work on getting the automatic doors fixed.” In response, a PMC official on condition of anonymity, said: “For automated doors to operate, the PMPML buses should have the radio frequency identification (RFID) system, which is not available in all PMPML buses. There is no point in spending Rs1 crore on something which isn’t used properly by the transport body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-raise-safety-issues-at-brt-bus-stations-101614190067985.html
24-02-2021||Pune||PMC unearths 42,000 properties, adds ₹211 crore to revenue corpus||The property tax department has unearthed 42,000 additional properties which were outside the purview of the tax structure and would now add an additional ₹211 crore to the PMC revenue corpus every year. The tax department has sent notices to all the owners seeking property tax for 2020-2021 with the objective of increasing its revenue collection base in the city. PMC deputy commissioner (property tax) Vilas Kanade said, “This is a record of sorts for PMC as we have added 42,000 additional properties under the property net. The annual property earning of PMC will increase by ₹211 crore. The number of properties identified for revenue collection each year has doubled this time.” The property tax department sought help from the solid waste management staff to look into the rise of usage of new properties where completion certificates were given to occupants. Also, the department focused on those completed residential and commercial projects which were being used and accordingly sent them intimations and notices seeking property tax from them. The civic body has also decided to give a flat at 15% concession in property tax to those occupants who have paid property tax on time. The proposal was unanimously approved by the general body on Thursday which states that if the tax for the next financial year is paid by May 31, the property owners will receive a 15 per cent discount on all taxes levied by the civic body. Citizens who have paid a lump-sum tax during the Covid-19 pandemic from April 1, 2020, to Sept 30, 2020, will receive relief in property tax in the coming financial year (2021-22). In order to avail the benefit, property tax has to be paid by May 31. While presenting the budget for the upcoming financial year, PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar proposed an 11 per cent increase in property tax which was rejected by the standing committee in a special meeting.

24-02-2021||Noida||Tikait to Govt: Be serious about talks on farm laws||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Wednesday asked the Union government to send a representative who had the power to resolve issues concerning the farm laws.This came a day after his elder brother and BKU president Naresh Tikait suggested that Union defence minister Rajnath Singh could end the stalemate between farmers and the government.Thousands of farmers are camping at UP Gate and other borders near the national capital demanding the repeal of the three farm laws, and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). Tikait, who is spearheading the farmers’ protest at UP Gate, said at a rally in Sikar in Rajasthan on Tuesday that a call will be given for going to the Parliament on a date chosen by the ‘Samyukt Kisan Morcha’ (SKM) which is body of farmers’ unions leaders at Singhu border. He also said that about 4 million tractors will also participate from across the country. Tikait returned to UP Gate on Wednesday and reiterated his stand over the call for going to the Parliament and said that any date for it should be given by the SKM. Over the issue of ending stalemate and statements made by Naresh Tikait about Rajnath Singh, Rakesh Tikait said that it could be “anyone” from the government who should engage in talks with the farmers. “We mean to say that it could be anyone that government can send for talks, but they should be given full-fledged powers. They are sending their ministers for talks, but they don’t come with full powers and their powers seem curtailed. Otherwise, they would have resolved our issues by now. We still demand repeal of three farm laws, a new law on MSP,” Tikait told reporters at UP-Gate on Wednesday. “We have not been approached for any talks as of now,” Tikait added. The last talks between the farmers’ union leaders and the government were held on January 22 and thereafter no talks could be scheduled. His brother Naresh Tikait on Tuesday at UP Gate said that Union Minister Rajnath Singh was a good man and had been a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh who understands issues of farmers and can help resolve the stalemate. Rakesh Tikait on the other hand is holding rallies in the National Capital Region and garnering support of farmers, khaps and common man. In his rallies he has maintained that he is looking after consolidating the agitation while the government should hold talks with the SKM over the issue of rollback of farm laws and a new law on MSP. Ever since the protests started in end of November 2020, the farmer leaders so far have not budged and reiterating their demands. The government also put forward a proposal in which they proposed that they were ready to hold the implementation of the three farm laws for a period of one and half years. However, the farmer leaders did not accept the proposal. Meanwhile on Wednesday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar responded to Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait’s call for a second tractor march to Delhi. Tomar said that the government is ready to discuss the demands of the farmers and is committed to the welfare of the farmers. “The government of India is committed to double farmers’ income and work towards agriculture’s welfare. Discussions have been held many times. If they have a point to raise even now, we are ready to discuss,” Tomar told reporters in Delhi. At UP Gate, Rakesh Tikait, before leaving for another Panchayat at Agra on Wednesday, further suggested that vacant parks near the Parliament could be given for farming for crops. “They should form a Parliamentary committee and it should observe farming of crop in the parks near the Parliament and even sell it in market. With this, they will be able to assess if there is any loss or profit in farming,” Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tikait-to-govt-be-serious-about-talks-on-farm-laws-101614189587311.html

24-02-2021||Gurugram||Court awards life imprisonment to mother, son for dowry death||A local court awarded life imprisonment to a man and his mother on Wednesday after finding them guilty of murdering a 24-year-old woman in 2016 over dowry. The police said the deceased, Rekha, got married to one Bhupender Swami, a resident of Dayanand Colony of Gurugram, in July 2015. At the time of the wedding, her father had spent a considerable amount of money on ceremonial rituals and gifts. However, according to the police, Rekha’s in-laws were unhappy with the dowry and started forcing her to bring ₹10 lakh from her father. After continuous torture and harassment, Rekha’s family in March 2016 gave her in-laws a washing machine and ₹2 lakh in cash but this failed to end the harassment and torture, the police said. A month later, Rekha was thrashed by her in-laws and was admitted to hospital, the police said. In June 2016, Rekha’s family members were informed about her sudden death. Her in-laws informed her family members that she had committed suicide. The family members alleged that there were marks on her body and that she was killed by her in-laws for dowry. “They started torturing her from the beginning of marriage and within 10 months, they killed her even after getting additional gift and money,” said Rekha’s brother Vishnu Singh, a resident of Rewari. On the basis of the complaint, a case was registered under sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (dowry) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sector 5 police station against the victim’s husband, Bhupender Swami, father-in-law Hari Kishan, mother-in-law Bimla and sister-in-law Suman and her husband Suresh. KS Rao, counsel for complainant, said that, during the investigation, the police added section 302 (murder) to the charge sheet. “In April 2019, Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the charges against Suman and Suresh and in the meantime father-in-law died a year ago,” he said. Additional sessions judge Ashwani Kumar in his order on Wednesday, observed that the husband and in-laws behaved in an inhuman manner with an innocent girl and were responsible for her brutal death within 10 months of her marriage. Keeping in view the gravity of the offence and other facts and circumstances of the case, the accused do not deserve any leniency from the court. Bhupender and his mother Bimla were awarded life imprisonment and the court imposed a penalty of ₹2.5 lakh on them. At the time of the judgment, Bhupender was in custody and Bimla was out on bail. Bimla was taken into custody and sent to Bhondsi jail from the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/court-awards-life-imprisonment-to-mother-son-for-dowry-death-101614188388838.html
24-02-2021||Gurugram||Warmest day of year so far, visibility up in early hours as severity of fog decreases||The city experienced its warmest day of the year so far on Wednesday, with the maximum temperature touching 31 degrees Celsius during the day. While the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature for the day, the nearest AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi recorded a minimum temperature at 14.2 degrees Celsius, also the highest it has been this year so far.With rising temperatures, episodes of fog have also become less severe over the past two to three days, improving visibility on city streets during the early hours. As per official forecasts, the maximum daytime temperature will hover around 31 degrees Celsius for at least the next three days, while the minimum temperature will also remain between 13 and 14 degrees Celsius.A slight dip in mercury may be felt between February 28 and March 1, as per the IMD’s seven-day weather forecast for Gurugram. Instead of moderate to dense episodes of fog, a light mist is expected to prevail for the next three to four days.Air quality, meanwhile, remained in the poor category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with a reading of 265 on the daily pollution bulletin — slightly worse than the AQI of 246 recorded a day prior. The average level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 263 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Sunday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 301µg/m3.As per official forecasts, pollution levels are unlikely to reach the very poor category (when the AQI crosses 300) as rising temperatures and increasing wind speeds will continue to disperse airborne pollutants. “With each day, the diffusion of pollutants becomes easier due to both vertical and horizontal movement of air, which is a result of warmer conditions setting in. The air is becoming less dense, allowing easier dispersal of pollutants even at lower wind speeds,” said VK Soni, head of the IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to improve marginally and remain in poor category owing to better ventilation conditions over the next five days.”A significant improvement, however, may be felt on February 26, when winds are expected to touch speeds of 12 to 15kmph, up from the prevailing speeds of 8 to 10kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/warmest-day-of-year-so-far-visibility-up-in-early-hours-as-severity-of-fog-decreases-101614188388248.html

The association said that the strike on February 26 was called by a traders’ body and they would not participate in it. “If the government fails to address the problems and consider demands of the industry, then another governing council meeting will be held and the road transport fraternity of India will be compelled to surrender their vehicles and declare a nationwide suspension of transport operations. The demands should have an overarching importance, must be comprehensive in nature, and reflect the voice of the fraternity in totality,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president, AIMTC, in a statement issued on Wednesday. He also said that motor transport congress does not endorse the strike call on February 26, Booking offices of transport companies will remain open and truckers will ply on road. Gurugram-based truckers, however, said that those transporters, who are engaged in retail operations and operate locally, will participate in the strike. “Around two lakh transport vehicles, which operate on a retail basis, will participate in the strike to protest against rise in the prices of diesel, e-way bills and high rate of toll fees in Haryana,” said Hukam Chand Sharma, president, All Haryana Truck and Transport Association. Sharma added that truckers are facing lot of difficulties due to rising fuel prices and norms pertaining to e-way bills. An e-way bill is a system to ensure that goods being transported comply with the GST laws. This helps to track movement of goods and check tax evasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aimtc-distances-itself-from-truckers-strike-but-local-transporters-to-participate-101614188387738.html
24-02-2021||Gurugram||Air pollution higher this winter than previous year, finds report||A report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), comparing air pollution levels between the winter of 2020 with that of the previous year, has revealed that average air pollution was higher this winter in the city. However both Gurugram and Faridabad reported better air quality than Delhi. The institute came to the conclusion after studying granular real-time data of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (15-minute averages) for 99 cities including 49 cities from Northern India from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) official online portal, called Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, from October 1, 2019 till January 31, 2020, and from October 1, 2020 till January 31, 2021. Analysing the data, the CSE report states that 26 cities in the region, including Gurugram, shows an increasing trend in air pollution, recording over 8% increase from last winter. As per the report, Faridabad and Gurugram are in the top 20 cities according to the PM 2.5 levels during the winter.Gurugram was ranked 16 with a 9% increase in the average PM 2.5 levels during the winter and 8% increase in peak levels of PM 2.5. At rank 14, Faridabad reported an 8% decrease in the average PM 2.5 levels during the winter and 14% decrease in peak (seasonal peak of a city is based on mean of the highest daily PM2.5) levels of PM 2.5. The seasonal peak of a city is based on mean of the highest daily PM2.5.Both the cities, however, ranked below other cities of the National Capital Region (NCR), like Ghaziabad (ranked at 1), Greater Noida, Noida, Delhi (which were among the top five cities). Reacting to cities of Haryana reporting lesser air pollution compared to other cities of NCR, S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board(HSPCB) said, “Compared to the last winter season, this winter, we took a lot of steps to control air pollution. We took steps under Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) along with increased night patrolling to monitor industrial emissions. This winter, we also strictly arrested air pollution through banning firecrackers during the festive season. Along with these measures, rainfall also helped in controlling air pollution, especially cities like Gurugram and Faridabad.” Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager for sustainable cities with CSE, said, “The analysis is based on comparison with the previous winter (2019-2020) when the weather conditions were different and rainfall activity was higher compared to the current outgoing winter season. Rainfall activity helps in washing down of pollutants, PM 2.5 in this case. This year, i.e. 2020-2021, we did not witness as much rain, which could be one of the reasons for higher seasonal average.” He added that measures taken by authorities to control air pollution also had a role to play in the decreased data for peak winter pollution. “Peak pollution is usually reported when smog accumulates. With the latest data analysis, we can see that peak has been reducing over the years. When measures like shutting down of construction activities and shutting down of brick kilns through the Grap is imposed, it helps a lot in controlling the peak pollution,” added Somvanshi. Meanwhile, Haryana did not have any cities in the top ten most polluted cities of Northern India, however, eight cities were listed in top 20. Fatehabad saw a jump of 228% in the seasonal average. Meanwhile, Bhiwani and Palwal recorded the lowest seasonal average during the 2020-21 winter with over 60% drop from the previous season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-pollution-higher-this-winter-than-previous-year-finds-report-101614188387154.html
24-02-2021||Gurugram||DTCP to create a database of affordable housing projects in city||A database of residential units and housing projects being developed under the affordable category will be created by the department of town and country planning (DTCP), which, on Wednesday, issued notices to 36 developers, seeking details of 95 such projects they are involved with in the city. Around 40,000 residential units are under various phases of development under this segment, and the department said that more such projects are in the offing as the government has eased many norms related to area under development, project size, car park and commercial aspects. Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said that notices have been issued to developers to submit details of total residential units, units under construction, alloted units, cancelled units and balance units with the developer. “All these details will be compiled and uploaded to a database so that real-time information is available regarding the availability of affordable housing units and ensure balanced growth. We have already received details about real estate projects being developed under normal category,” said Mann. DTCP officials also said that regular updates will also help them keep a tab on projects that are delayed. “At present the department gets information about delays after buyers lodge complaints but real-time data gathering will help in keeping a check on these issues,” said an official, who said that completing projects in time was crucial under affordable category as developers were bound to complete projects in four years under the rules The database of affordable projects, officials said will also help the department in forming policies based on the demand cycle as affordable units have been highest-selling segment during the last two years. The decision to compile this information has been taken as a number of complaints have been received regarding re-allotment of cancelled units by developers without holding draws, said officials. Mann also said that they will also investigate complaints pertaining to developers, charging a premium on allotment of plots under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Awas Yojana, which is meant for affordable category housing.

The police said that the husband was aware of their relationship and the three of them had decided to live together after the woman had eloped with the man last year. The police said that the suspect killed her as she was allegedly giving more attention to her husband. The suspect was identified as Subhash Kumar, of Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. He was produced before a court on Wednesday and taken on one-day police remand. An autopsy of the woman’s body revealed that she was four months pregnant, the police said. According to the police, the woman, identified as Preeti, also an Uttar Pradesh native, had got married and moved to Gurugram in December 2019. However, in February last year, she eloped with Kumar to Rajasthan and they moved to Faridabad two months ago. The police said that on February 17 this year, the woman had called her husband and pleaded with him to take her back as she was being harassed and assaulted by Kumar. When the husband went to meet them, Kumar allegedly threatened to kill himself, following which the three of them decided to live together. They moved to Gurugram on February 18 and rented a room in Jalvihar Colony of Sector 46 and decided to work at a construction site in a residential area. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that in the phone conversation with her husband, Preeti had cried and apologised for leaving him. “Preeti and Subhash often fought with each other and he often assaulted her. They both were finding it hard to make ends meet as they had no work and used to earn money by working at construction sites,” he said. On February 19, the husband left their residence, along with a neighbour, around 3am to find work. “The husband returned home around 5pm and found both the rooms locked from the outside. He broke open the door and found Preeti dead on the floor. He looked for Subhash but he had fled the spot with his belongings. He enquired his neighbours, but they were not aware of his whereabouts,” said Sangwan. A case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 50 police station the same day. The investigation was handed over to the Sector 40 crime unit, which arrested Subhash Kumar from Ghata crossing on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road on Tuesday night. “We had prepared his sketch and had activated our informers, following which he was traced. He confessed to the crime and revealed that he was insecure and could not tolerate the woman giving more attention to her husband, due to which he smothered her to death,” said Gunpal, sub-inspector, CIA-40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-kills-woman-over-insecurities-in-polyamorous-relationship-101614188328266.html

According to GMCBL, the department is planning to restart the women’s special bus service once again after colleges reopen completely. “We have not started the women’s special bus service even after the end of the lockdown because we did not get sufficient number of passengers. These buses ran on lesser capacity even before Covid-19 pandemic, and we incurred losses. We have now decided to conduct a trial run of these buses once colleges and office complexes open up a little more so that we can cater to more passengers,” said Jai Parkash, assistant manager for route planning, GMCBL. He said that if the trial runs are successful with enough number of passengers using the bus service, then the city bus authority will restart the service. However, the official could not give a date as to when the trial run would start.The women’s special bus service, which started in November 2019, was halted during the lockdown imposed last year in March due to Covid-19 pandemic. The bus service, which had female conductors and drivers, was started with the aim of providing a safe transportation service to women, connecting busy hubs like Metro stations with newer and older parts of the city. The bus followed a route from Huda City Centre Metro station till Gurugram railway station, as several girls’ schools and women’s colleges are located along the route. While most bus services have restarted since the end of the lockdown, the women’s special service is yet to resume. The city bus services are available on 24 routes with 153 buses. On Monday, a route 902 was introduced to cater to public commuting within Faridabad, which follows the route from NIT Bus Stand to Bata Metro Station and back to NIT Bus Stand (Mudrika) Via Hardware Chowk, Bata Metro Station, Hardware Chowk, Dabua Colony, Hanuman mandir and KL Mehta College. The bus service starts at 7.15am from NIT Bus Stand and the last bus leaves at 7.35pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmcbl-to-start-trial-run-of-special-bus-service-for-women-101614188327160.html
24-02-2021||Gurugram||Teachers apprehensive of learning gaps among students||As primary school students of classes 3 to 5 returned to classrooms on Wednesday, many teachers found acute problems of learning gaps among students. Teachers said that despite online classes, students with inadequate support systems at home and lack of access to phones and computers have been lagging behind the others.“Many students are now not able to read properly, for they have not attended the school for almost a year now,” said Amarjyoti, a teacher of Class 3 at Sector 4/7 primary school.Jeet, a student of Class 5 at the Sector 4/7 government school, when asked by his class teacher to finish an English exercise of writing his friends’ names along with their qualities, said he could not do so. Jeet, whose father works as a school guard, said, “We don’t have access to phones through which other students study. I am not able to understand what is being taught to me in the classroom.” All exercise sheets in his book were blank.Likewise, Shruti and Lakshmi in Amarjyoti’s classroom, who shifted from private schools, had difficulty in doing mathematics and English exercises, despite attending online classes.Shazra and Uzma, Class 4 students at the primary school in Police Lines also struggled to keep up with the lessons being taught. “They don’t remember mathematics tables and have been facing difficulties in doing multiplication and division,” said Sandeep, their class teacher.For classes 3 to 5, there are only four subjects — English, Hindi, Mathematics and EVS (comprising lessons on history, geography and science) — which are to be covered in three hours, from 10am to 1.30pm, as per the Covid-19 prevention guidelines. However, Sandeep said that since many students were not actively involved in online studies, additional work has to be put in for in-person instruction.Both Sandeep and Amarjyoti said that for two to three days, the focus will be on brushing up the basics. “It is for this reason I asked every student to read a few lines from the chapter to gauge their current situation. Many students have been facing difficulties in reading words, which was not the case earlier when the schools were shut last year,” said Amarjyoti.Teachers said that revisions will help them in identifying students who require more attention and they will be grouped. “Students who need attention will be given exercises to improve their basics, while others will carry on with the routine curriculum,” said Sandeep.On the other hand, a few teachers continued with the curriculum, instead of revision, for a month. Rajeev Gandhi, a teacher of Class 5 at the Sector 4/7 government school, said, “We are going ahead with the syllabus set for January and February on the first day, instead of revision, as students have been taking up online classes for all these months now. Exams are expected to be held in a month or two, so lessons have to be completed.”According to teachers, the extent of learning loss can be estimated once classes operate with at least 80% strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/teachers-apprehensive-of-learning-gaps-among-students-101614188267726.html
24-02-2021||Gurugram||Students of grades 3-5 return to classrooms, lack of distancing a concern||Over 40% of the students in classes 3 to 5 in government schools returned to their classrooms on Wednesday after almost 11 months of online education. However, as the turnout of students was higher than expected, many schools failed to follow social distancing protocols on the first day. In some instances, students who did not have consent letters from parents were also allowed to attend classes.“The first day of school reopening saw a collective turnout of almost 40% in 353 primary schools of the district, which will gradually increase in the coming week. Online classes will continue for students who cannot attend schools,” said Prem Lata, district elementary education officer.During HT’s visit, classrooms in a few schools were packed to capacity and students were found seated with no discernible gaps between one another. Although they wore masks, social distancing norms were not adhered to.At an elementary school in Sector 4/7, a few classes were packed to the capacity. Mahesh Chandra, a teacher of Class 5, while counting the students, said, “The classroom has a seating capacity of almost 40 students, which is almost occupied on the first day. Once other students arrive, additional arrangements will have to be made to accommodate over 15 more students.”A similar situation was witnessed at the schools in Police Lines and Sadar. “All classrooms will be occupied as primary schools will reopen for classes 1 and 2 in March. The turnout in every class will continue to increase. Therefore, classes will have to be run in the usual manner. But we are ensuring that students wear masks throughout,” Sunil Kumar, principal, Sadar primary school.“On the first day, at least 33 of the 54 enrolled students attended the classes. Classes will run in almost full strength by next week. Some students are still in their villages and are yet to return,” said Amit Kumar, head of the primary wing, government school at Police Lines.Kumar decorated the entrance of classrooms with balloons to welcome the students. “Some children are meeting face-to-face for the first time. They had shifted from private schools in October last year,” he said.At a government school in Kadipur, only 20% of the 860 students of the primary classes turned up on the day of reopening. “Many parents wait for a response on the first day. Only after hearing first-hand accounts from neighbours or relatives do they begin to send their child to school. When schools reopened for classes 9 to 12 in December, only a few students attended classes. But now, classrooms are packed to capacity in many schools,” said Sudesh Raghav, principal, government school, Kadipur.Students of primary schools were let out earlier than 1.30pm to avoid a rush at the exit gate. At the government school in Sector 4/7, students were asked to leave in a queue before senior students were let out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/students-of-grades-3-5-return-to-classrooms-lack-of-distancing-a-concern-101614188267161.html
24-02-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru airport installs disabled aircraft recovery kit||Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Tuesday announced the installation of disabled aircraft recovery kit, which will help the airport operator remove a disabled aircraft at the runway, and thereby restoring the operations at the earliest.The transportable kit is capable of recovering Code F-compatible aircrafts during an aircraft incident on the runway, ensuring that runway closure is minimised, Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL), the private airport operator managing and running the KIA, said in a release.The kit, with multiple components, and customised for the Bengaluru airport's requirement, includes ground preparation tools, aircraft lifting, de-bogging, tethering, towing, and all other associated aspects of both narrow- and wide-body aircraft, BIAL said in the release.Last year, the private airport operator had signed a pact with German aircraft recovery kit maker Kunz GmbH to manufacture, supply, commission and maintain this specialised equipment.As part of this agreement, Kunz GmbH will work with BIAL to establish a centre for disabled aircraft recovery training, making the Bengaluru airport the first in the region to have such a facility, as per the release.Disabled aircraft on the runway have the potential to cripple airport operations, resulting in flight delays, diversions and loss of revenue for both airlines as well as airport operators.The effective recovery of all types of disabled aircraft in the movement area addresses key risks and ensures that operations, business continuity and organisational resilience remain unaffected, BIAL said.The Bengaluru airport is the first aerodrome in the country as well as in South Asia to own the state-of-the-art kit.Till now, only national carrier Air India had this facility in the country."The acquisition of this aircraft recovery equipment is an important milestone for us at the Bengaluru airport."Being prepared is the key to running a high-performance airport. This is not only important for the airport, but also for the entire aviation ecosystem as a whole," said Hari Marar, mananging director and chief executive officer, BIAL.Under the scope of the agreement with Kunz GmBh, BIAL has constituted a task force that will undergo extensive hands-on training  both at BLR Airport as well as at the German manufacturer's state-of-the-art recovery training facility in Germany, said the release.Additionally, a quick response recovery team (QRRT) will be formed and imparted with technical knowledge, enabling them to respond to critical situations, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-airport-installs-disabled-aircraft-recovery-kit-101614186851442.html

Almost 25 per cent work of the 2 24x7 water project is complete, but the ducts for optical fibre are not being laid despite being part of the tender.Hemant Rasne, chairman, standing committee, said, “Instead of digging roads repeatedly, ducts should be laid at the same time.”“As I am busy in the budget meetings, I am not able to take its review. But we would ensure that ducts are laid along with the project. After presenting the budget, we will hold a meeting,” he said.Rasne claimed that the administration is saying that there are technical problems while undertaking the work.One of the officials on anonymity, said, “Though the water pipeline would be laid up to 1,800 km, many roads are narrow. If the roads are dug up for optical fibre, PMC would need to do fresh work of roads as almost half the road would get dug for the same purpose.”Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “It is wrong that the administration decided at their level not to carry out the optical fibre ductwork. They never informed us about the issue. As instructed by Fadnavis, we will carry out the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-fails-to-lay-fibre-optical-ducts-as-part-of-24x7-water-project-101614186167124.html

The police found during the search of the child was that the man from whom she kidnapped the infant was not the biological father of the child, according to Krishna Prakash, the commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police. “We found that he had wrongly entered his name as the parent at a hospital in Chakan where a young, unmarried couple had given birth to the child and had agreed to give her up. His wife is in a mental asylum and he had also decided to give up the girl after having fallen into financial trouble,” said Prakash. The woman was identified as Rani Shivaji Yadav (28), a native of Ambejogai in Beed, according to the police.Yadav had taken the child and left for Ambejogai in Beed where she had told her husband and in-laws that she had given birth to the child. She did that to hide the fact that she had miscarried her own child about two months ago, according to the police. The man from whose house the child was kidnapped was identified as Rajendra Prabhakar Nagpure (53), a resident of a room in Vafgaonkar chawl in Chakan, Khed area of Pune. Nagpure works as an installer and maintenance of card swipe machines and his 66-year-old sister was looking after the child, according to senior police inspector Ashok Rajput of Chakan police station. “Her husband had moved back to Beed a few days before the lockdown was announced (in March) and as she did not accompany him, she was stuck here. However, her husband got a pass made and facilitated bus travel to Beed a month later. She fell pregnant then and after reaching seven months of pregnancy, she said she is going to Osmanabad to her parent’s place. We are not yet sure when, but during that time, she miscarried her child and came to Pune and lived with one of her relatives instead,” said senior police inspector Rajput. The woman had learned about a child at Nagpure’s house and had approached him to seek a job as a caretaker, according to the police. “She latched on to him while he had started shifting houses from one chawl to another. The shifting was done on February 16 and when the women in the new chawl asked who Yadav was, Nagpure told them that she was his wife’s sister. The very next day, around 3pm, she picked up the child and left,” said PI Rajput. A case under Sections 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at Chakan police station after her disappearance. BOX: Police to reunite child with biological parents Unbeknownst to the child, she has changed hands from three sets of guardians and is now in the custody of the police and will be handed over to the Child welfare committee (CWC). Until the future of the child is decided upon, she will be in the children’s home run by an NGO in association with the CWC and is located behind Dighi police station. “We have tracked down the biological parents of the child and we will try to get them together. Since they are not married, they will need to be married in order to be in a position to take of the child and be accepted in the society,” said Prakash. The biological parents are students at a local college and had kept their families in the dark about their child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fourmonthold-infant-lands-with-three-illegal-guardians-before-cops-intervene-101614184187875.html

24-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh announces mini bus permit policy||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced a mini bus permit policy and also virtually distributed 3,000 permits to the rural youth as part of his government's 'Ghar Ghar Rozgar te Karobar' mission.Singh said another 8,000 permits would be distributed the rest of the year, taking the total to 11,000. This will generate both direct and indirect employment and there is no deadline for rural youths to apply for the permits.The chief minister directed the Transport Department to create a user-friendly online facility within the next three months for receipt and processing of applications of all bus permits to make the system more transparent and eliminate corruption, according to a government statement.These novel initiatives will go a long way in providing smooth rural connectivity and seamless delivery of citizen-centric services, said the chief minister.He lambasted the previous SAD-BJP regime for issuing “illegal” permits to “chosen people” without due publicity or adherence to legal procedures or rules.Recalling that his government had promised cancellation of all illegal bus permits to ensure that genuine people get the benefit of the scheme, Singh said under the transparent system adopted by the Transport Department, a public notice for mini bus permits was issued for the first time ever in newspapers.People were encouraged to apply online without any hassle, and as many as 12,384 applications were received.Congratulating Transport Minister Razia Sultana and the officers of the department, Singh said that they had set the ball rolling to achieve the five-fold objective of creating employment opportunity for rural youths, making travel safer for women and children, ensuring safer vehicular traffic for travellers and pedestrians, reducing vehicular pollution and doorstep delivery of government services.He said the Vehicle Location Tracking (GPS) Device Project, launched at a cost of ₹15.50 crore would make travel safer for women and children in public transport vehicles.He disclosed that such devices had already been installed in 100 per cent of state-owned PUNBUS buses and 50 per cent in PRTC buses, which would be fully covered in the next six months. Razia said the GPS system would be installed soon in private buses too.The chief minister also referred to the state-of-the-art command control centre at state level and four regional centres to track the vehicles, and said this would facilitate handling of panic button alerts by any woman/child, online challan for over-speeding vehicle, absence of valid insurance and pollution certificate etc.         On the occasion, the chief minister also laid the foundation stone of the Institute of Driving and Traffic Research (IDTR) Kapurthala at a cost of ₹22.50 crore under Mission 'Ghar Ghar Rozgaar te Karobar', with training capacity of 20,000 drivers annually to impart quality training to rural youth, and thus generate employment avenues.        The upcoming training institute, to be managed by Tata Motors, would be equipped with camera based Innovative Driving Testing System (IDTS) to assess the driving skills of the candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-announces-mini-bus-permit-policy-101614174908758.html

The schedule for admission also not been made public as of now. School registration had been postponed till February 17 and as per officials from the Pune Zilla Parishad’s (ZP) education department, there are two-three more schools that still have to register from the district.Education officials have urged parents to keep the documents for registration ready, as the procedure is expected to begin this week.Dinkar Temkar, director, school education department and in-charge of RTE for Maharashtra, said that the online portal for RTE admission will be opening soon. “Registration of schools has been completed now. In a matter of days the online portal will reopen for admissions by parents. Parents should keep all documents handy and ready,” said Temkar.Moreover, as per the RTE portal, there are 14,721 seats in Pune district, this time for RTE admission. Sunil Kurhade, the education officer at the ZP, said that there are a few schools that still have to register.“Once these register, vacant seats will increase up to 16,000 in Pune district,” said Kurhade.Pune district has the maximum vacancy under RTE in the state.There has been a series of delays with the admission process due to a delay with the registration of schools. Mukund Kirdat, city-based education activist and member of the Aam Admi Party (AAP), said that this delay in admission will affect students.“These children are from economically and financially weaker sections and delay in admission is not good for them. Already they struggle with issues like buying a smartphone for online education. This delay in admission makes them late for the initial classes,” said Kirdat.“Many schools delay registration due to non-payment of dues, but the child suffers. Moreover, many schools have opted to register for Class One entry, and not for entry at the nursery level. If a child from the weaker sections gets admitted into Class One, they will face more challenges as they are way behind in their studies as compared to other students,” added Kirdat.RTE status in Pune as of Feb 24*CityNo of RTE schools No of RTE seats vacantAhmednagar4023,013Kolhapur3453,181Latur2381,740Mumbai2905,227Navi Mumbai 621,236Pune98414,721Solapur326 2,217Total (Maharashtra) 9,430 9,6791*Source: RTE portal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rte-admission-process-to-begin-in-matter-of-days-says-the-man-in-charge-101614175726448.html

The budget is just like a cut, copy and paste job. It is a cosmetic budget, which has a good face but intentions are not good," Poonia said.He said that the budget did not mention anything about regularisation of contractual workers and protesting unemployed youth. Overall, the budget has failed to live up to the expectations of people, he added.Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said old announcements made in previous budgets for his own constituency have not even started and new ones have been announced."It has become their hobby to make announcements. They are only misleading people as they do not have a proper budget. This budget is nothing more than a bundle of lies," Kataria said in a press conference.On the other hand, Congress leaders have termed it a holistic budget, which has taken care of all sections of the society.Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma praised the budget, saying that it is an unprecedented one for overall development. He said the budget dedicated to health will fulfill the dream of a healthy Rajasthan.Sharma said several innovations in medicine and health have been announced in the budget. We will present a unique example in the country by bringing a bill in the Assembly to provide Right to Health to All.He described the Universal Health Care scheme as unprecedented from the point of view of health rejuvenation at a cost of ₹3,500 crore from the upcoming financial year. Under this scheme, each family of the state will get the benefit of medical insurance scheme of ₹5 lakh.Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra said that a commendable budget has been presented by CM Gehlot, which is all-inclusive and development oriented.To take forward the state on the path of progress, announcements have been made in the budget keeping the public interest paramount, he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjp-deems-rajasthan-budget-disappointing-ruling-congress-says-its-presented-a-holistic-one-101614172326775.html
24-02-2021||Bangalore||India’s first hearing impaired female biker: I may not hear it, but I feel the wind||“I was born deaf; I only have 40% hearing capacity. When I was in school, kids used to make fun of me because my voice sounded like I was stammering. It was hard, but I never let it get to me. Speech therapy over the last four years has made me more confident,” says Archana Timmaraju, a Bengaluru resident, who is India’s first hearing impaired female biker, and has been riding since 2006. The 36-year-old arts and metal sculpture teacher at Mallya Aditi International School, Bengaluru, is now all set to take on a 650 day motorcycle tour around the world, and cover 94 countries across seven continents, to spread awareness about sign language, and the needs of hearing impaired in India. Timmaraju says, “There are no colleges for the hearing impaired in India. Children are stuck after completing their schooling, and there are hardly any interpreters in colleges. We need more efforts and other methods of communication, like sign language, to be taught at a larger scale to really integrate the community (in mainstream).” Her journey of grit and determination has made many see her with awe and respect her with admiration. “People are amazed when I tell them I’m a rider. I got my first experience of riding when a friend gave me his Yamaha RX 100 bike to train, in 2006. I eventually started riding with other bikers in Bengaluru, and that gave me immense confidence,” she says, sharing how as a hearing impaired woman riding across India she has had her share of naysayers tell her how risky this hobby is. Talking about the challenges she had to face as a hearing impaired female rider in India, she says, “Here it’s more about the problems one faces while applying for the license. I faced difficulties in getting my license since there is a lack of understanding of rules. But eventually, it worked out for me. During my rides, I put a sticker at the back of my bike that reads: ‘Rider is deaf. Failure to cooperate with verbal commands means I am not hearing you.’ Some people make an effort to understand my needs, but I make sure I ride safely, and often keep behind lorries when the terrain is hard.” Timmaraju remains fearlessness, and it’s this attitude that prompted her to ride from Bengaluru to Leh in 2018, along with her colleague Daniel Sundaram. Once back to the city, she start her venture Silent Expedition, to help the hearing impaired in their travels. “I wanted to face my fears, and also make people aware about the problems faced by people in my community. Wherever I go, I meet other hearing impaired riders and try to inspire them to be brave in the face of obstacles. I want more people from the community, especially women, to go on these journeys. If I can do it, everyone can do it,” she concludes.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/indias-first-hearing-impaired-female-biker-i-may-not-hear-it-but-i-feel-the-wind-101614169608843.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Marina, water taxis and more: Mumbai Port Trust signs MoUs worth ₹7,510 crore||Ahead of the 'Maritime India Summit' 2021, the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) has signed 13 different Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)/agreements worth ₹7,510 crore in a bid to boost water transport and tourism in the city. In a press conference on Wednesday, MbPT chairman Rajiv Jalota said that MoUs worth ₹12,000 crore more are also in the pipeline.The agreements include starting water taxis from the domestic cruise terminal (DCT) in South Mumbai for ₹75 crore, introducing harbour cruise tourism for ₹15 crore, developing a marina for ₹370 crore, and shipbuilding and allied activities for ₹1300 crore among other agreements. In talks for decades now, MbPT is looking at starting water taxi services from South Mumbai to Belapur and Nerul soon.“We are looking at starting the services soon. Initially, we will start with 10-50 seater vessels, following which it can be increased as per the response,” said Jalota. The plan also includes services to Rewas and Kashid. A senior official from MbPT said that the charges would range between ₹300- ₹400. “The idea is that it should be in a similar range as normal taxis, otherwise people would not prefer water transport,” the official said.MbPT is also planning Mumbai's first marina for 300 yachts on 8.02 hectares land near the DCT. Jalota also said that MbPT will complete the Mumbai international cruise terminal project by the end of this year. MbPT aims to transform Mumbai into a cruise tourism hotspot catering to 15 lakh cruise passengers by the end of 2030.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the virtual 'Maritime India Summit' to be held between March 2-4. Jalota said that the summit would prove to be a powerful platform to explore business opportunities in the maritime sector. Around 20,000 delegates from 40 countries are expected to take part in the summit, which will look at different themes like shipbuilding, repairs and recycling, inland water transport, coastal shipping, tourism among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marina-water-taxis-and-more-mumbai-port-trust-signs-mous-worth-rs-7-510-crore-101614165688072.html
24-02-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru bikers on a mission: Cleaning up is a joyride!||You would’ve spotted bikers vroom on their mean machines. But here’s a group of bikers who are on a mission to clean the city! Wrappers, bottles and any trash that’s spoiling the beauty of Bengaluru, gets collected in the waste bags carried by these bikers. “On one of our regular trips, my friend and I realised that most places with visitors are littered. So we picked up a few bottles, but two pairs of hands weren’t enough. The need to clean up our city made us involve more people, and in the process was born Bikers Troop Bengaluru (BTB),” says Harshith BK, founder of the biking group. With the aim to make a difference, BTB was formed in October 2020, with 13 members and has now over 100 members with 30 regular riders who go on trips every weekend. They pick a tourist destination where they halt and clean the place. “Our maiden trip was to Skandagiri, last November, where a dozen of us cleaned up the place. More people showed interest to join the initiative, so a Facebook page was made and since then we’ve had many requests,” says Harshith, adding that the group carries their own water bottles to cut down on plastic waste.The initiative has found many takers in the city, as they feel that the initiative not only allows them to travel regularly but also preserve Nature at the same time. Archana Timmaraju, India’s first hearing impaired female biker, is also part of this group. She says, “I read about BTB’s clean-up ride, and got intrigued by their dedication. I believe we all need to be environmentally conscious; so I asked to be added to the group and recently went on an expedition with them. It feels incredible to be able to send out such a positive message to others!” A long list of people have joined these social warriors, on their weekly clean-up drives. The latest drive was conducted at the area around Thottikallu Falls. Kanika P, a travel enthusiast and member of the group, says, “I’ve been travelling regularly, even during Covid-19, and did my first ride with BTB to DD Hills near Bengaluru last November. And since then I’ve joined them on all their rides. I love the vibe and humbleness of the people associated with this group, which feels like a family that is growing by the day. We now have a separate WhatsApp group called Green Troops Bengaluru, wherein we have like-minded people, who are keen to clean the city along with us.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-bikers-on-a-mission-cleaning-up-is-a-joyride-101614167868171.html

He said the team investigating the case will visit the Union territory as the Congress claimed Delkar, 58, was under pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership to join the party.Deshmukh said Delkar has named Patel in his suicide note. “...[Delkar] has also said that he was choosing Mumbai and Maharashtra to commit suicide expecting justice after death. We have received many memorandums raising doubts over the case. Police are investigating if there was pressure from the Centre on Patel and in turn from Patel on local administration to harass Delkar.”Also Read | Post-mortem report confirms MP Mohan Delkar died by suicide: Mumbai PolicePatel was not immediately available for comments, but the BJP rubbished them as baseless. “The Congress is linking the BJP for no reason. Let the investigation take place and truth come to the fore. Why are they jumping to conclusions? As per a verdict by the Supreme Court, the suicide note is also to be subjected to legal scrutiny. The Congress has developed a habit of linking the BJP in everything...,” said BJP leader Madhu Chavan.Delkar, an Independent member of Parliament from Dadar and Nagar Haveli, was found dead in a south Mumbai hotel on Monday. An initial police probe indicated that he died by suicide.Congress leader Sachin Sawant, who held a virtual meeting with Deshmukh on Wednesday, said Delkar had spoken about the harassment in the Parliament during the last session. Sawant said Patel is a former BJP minister and close to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the party’s ideological fountainhead. “[Delkar] was being pressurised to join the BJP and Patel has played a key role in it. The local administration is likely to have been under pressure for similar harassment tactics. If an MP [member of Parliament] is meted with such type of treatment, what would be the fate of the general public.”The Congress has claimed Delkar’s video message and suicide note establish he was being harassed to force him to join the BJP. It has demanded a probe into the political link to the suicide case. “The MP has named administrator Praful Patel in the 16-page suicide note holding him responsible for the harassment he had been facing. The note also has a reference to the harassment being meted out to him on the ‘orders from the top’. The MP had also alleged fake cases were registered against him. He chose Mumbai to commit suicide probably with the trust that he will get justice after death,” the Congress said in a memorandum to Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cops-to-probe-dadra-nagar-haveli-administrator-s-role-in-delkar-s-death-101614166186620.html

24-02-2021||Patna||NMC asks govt medical colleges to exclude non-medical faculties as assessors||The National Medical Commission (NMC) has asked government medical colleges, including Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), to exclude non-medical faculties while proposing doctors as assessors for evaluation of medical institutions.The NMC, in its letter to principals and deans of government medical colleges earlier this month, had requested them to submit details of all associate professors, with six years of teaching experience, additional professors and professors, excluding non-medical faculty members.“…as an esteemed ambassador of the profession and a conscious keeper of excellence in medical education, you nominate faculty in your institution at the earliest,” said Dr Achal Gulati, president Medical Assessment and Rating Board of the NMC, in his letter of February 2, a copy of which is with the Hindustan Times.A few non-medical faculties had previously got enrolled as assessors, prompting the NMC to be specific about excluding non-medical faculties.Some non-medical faculties from Patna AIIMS had even made it to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as member of the selection committee for recruitment of doctors. The UPSC recruits doctors for railways, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), among other institutions of repute.The governing body of Patna AIIMS, which came into existence in 2011-12, on February 18 ratified a proposal to terminate the services of three non-medical faculty members, while letting off yet another in the department of microbiology. All these faculty members were allegedly unqualified on the date of their appointment in 2012-13. Two of the three faculties vetted for termination, still do not possess the basic qualification required for the position they occupy.“We have sent to the NMC, names of our faculty members for assessors,” said Dr Umesh Bhadani, dean, AIIMS, Patna.

24-02-2021||Patna||Bihar plans mutation reform to curb fraud||The Bihar government is planning to introduce spatial mutation along with textual mutation to bring transparency in sale and purchase of land, reducing incidents of fraud and title disputes in line with the practice in Gujarat, Odisha and Telangana, said an official.At present only textual mutation is done in sale and purchase of land, a process, which records the name of the new owner in place of the old. “In common parlance, mutation term is used for textual mutation. After the registry of the land and mutation, the seller’s name is struck out and the name of the new owner, the buyer, is entered in register 2, however, in spatial mutation a real-time map of the land will be issued," said an official of revenue and land reforms department, who was not willing to be named.Additional chief secretary, revenue and land reforms department, Vivek Kumar Singh, said to work on the technicalities of the spatial mutation along with textual mutation, a workshop of experts from Gujarat, Odisha and Telangana was being organised on March 1. “Besides the heads of department, the state information officer of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been invited to participate in the workshop. Kamal Jain of IIT Roorkee and technical experts of National Institute of Smart Government (NISG), Hyderabad, will also take part in the workshop,” he said.Singh said revenue department officials and some circle officers will enlist practical problems they might face in implementing the new process, while another official said the buyer of land will get ‘shudhi patra’ or the name transfer certificate displaying map, plot number along with other details of ‘chauhaddi’ or the four next neighbours of the land under the new process.“With the implementation of the new system, maps of all villages will become real-time, which will not hide any information and common people will not get cheated,” said Ram Surat Kumar, minister, revenue and land reforms.Land getting fraudulently re-registered several times has been a common problem in these parts even resulting in criminal assault and murders.Singh said the IT wing of revenue and land reforms department were working with NIC, which has made a software for smooth implementation of the new process.Also Read: 42.8% children severely malnourished in Bihar: Health minister“For spatial mutation, an authorised surveyor will visit the land register the new demarcations before mutation of the land on the software.

24-02-2021||Delhi||Rented cycle cheapest transport in Delhi but lack of infra a hurdle: WRI||Renting a cycle is the cheapest mode of last-mile connectivity in Delhi, a World Resources Institute (India) analysis has found. The analysis shows renting a cycle costs ₹10 for a five km-ride. The same distance costs ₹20 on the Delhi Metro, ₹60 in an autorickshaw, ₹15 on an air-conditioned (AC) bus, ₹10 on a non-AC bus and between ₹90 to 95 in a cab.The analysis highlighted with traffic levels in cities returning to pre-pandemic levels, it is important to keep the momentum for cycling going. “Cities should explore implementing public bicycle sharing (PBS) systems; a flexible transport service where users can rent a cycle for short periods of time, making it a low-cost, sustainable, and socially distant mode of commute,” said Prateek Diwan, senior project associate, WRI (India).Also Read | Odisha Congress MLAs cycle to state assembly in protest against fuel pricesThe analysis showed cycling mode share (percentage of trips on cycles) was 11% in Delhi and the city ranked fourth after Ranchi (19%), Surat (16%) and Bhopal (13%). The percentage in Delhi was higher than in metropolitan cities such as Hyderabad (10%), Bengaluru (5%) and Mumbai (1%).Despite a reasonable share of commuters relying on it, a lack of safe cycling infrastructure was not letting the mode realise its full potential in Delhi, researchers said.“While this is not to say that people should not use public transport modes, but especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, when there is still an apprehension among people to use mass transit modes, cycling infrastructure can be developed for safe and cheap commuting,” Diwan said.The WRI (India) research noted that when a PBS system is newly introduced in a city, there is a sudden spurt in demand from recreational and curious riders, often driven by promotional discounts. Companies are often unable to sustain this demand and there is a lack of infrastructure for converting cycling into a commuting option.There was a surge in cycle rental when the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and the New Delhi Municipal Council set up PBS models in central Delhi. There were aimless rides around India Gate, Agrasen ki Baoli and Connaught Place and not for commuting between metro stations or between metro stations and workplaces as they were intended to be. This was primarily because even the existing cycling tracks were either encroached upon or were not available as a continuous stretch. The tracks were also poorly maintained.The Delhi government and the city’s municipalities are working on plans to ensure that cycling tracks are marked along major arterial roads. The Public Works Department in December created a 2.5m-wide rubber-coated cycle track and a separate pedestrian path along a 500m stretch of the Ring Road, from Nehru Nagar to Sriniwaspuri.Officials said the beautification drive, which includes cycle tracks, pedestrian walkways and protected bus stands for users, is part of the government’s bigger project to redevelop and redesign roads to meet European standards.“Work is also on for a 3km stretch between Ashram and Moolchand on the Ring Road, which will be redesigned by creating cycling and pedestrian facilities. In the first phase, we will start similar works on two more road stretches in east Delhi,” an official said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced in December that the process of appointing a consultant for redesigning 540km roads to match those in European cities has been completed and a report will be readied by February end.Experts said the government should use the interest among people in cycling because of the pandemic and develop safe spaces for cyclists.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said their analysis has shown that commuters in Delhi were preferring private modes of transportation fearing the spread of infection in shared mass transit modes.“We had seen a major spike in cycling among the middle class, vehicle owning segment, but the government needs to sustain this interest by providing them with safe infrastructure. Once there is a provision of dedicated cycle tracks that are uninterrupted, the demand for cycling will automatically swell. It is a cheaper and healthier option,” said Roychowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rented-cycle-cheapest-transport-in-delhi-but-lack-of-infra-a-hurdle-wri-101614155026206.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Won’t work in Maharashtra: Shiv Sena targets BJP after Puducherry govt collapse||Referring to the collapse of the Congress government in Puducherry, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Wednesday said that the same tactic will not work in Maharashtra. It added that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s desire to topple the Sena-led government in the state will only remain a dream. “Some BJP leaders have said that now that the Puducherry government has been toppled, the Maharashtra government will collapse in March-April. Similar advertisements were made when the Madhya Pradesh government collapsed [in March 2020] and after Bihar assembly polls. In Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry, the Congress was in power. In Maharashtra it is Shiv Sena, therefore nobody should even think about toppling the government... The results in Maharashtra are the will of the people and will not change,” the editorial said.Also Read | Won’t allow sale of Patanjali’s Coronil without proper certification: Maharashtra minThe editorial slammed the BJP and Union government over the toppling of governments, including in Madhya Pradesh. It said that winning over legislators by luring them and using central agencies has become an act of “bravery”. It said that turncoats are being given the “red carpet”, adding that such an atmosphere is detrimental for democracy.In a veiled attack on Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the editorial said that those who disrupt the state government’s work at the behest of the Centre must remember that they can be “thrown away” after use. “Governors are used like curry leaves in food for tempering. [Former Puducherry lieutenant governor] Kiran Bedi was thrown away like curry leaves after use. The one tempering food in Maharashtra should understand this,” the editorial said indirectly referring to governor Koshyari.

In July 2020, Niti Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant visited Sevapuri and held a meeting with divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal and district magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma.“Under the model ideal developmental block project, we set 141 goals, including installation of garbage bins, providing rickshaw carts for garbage collection, construction of community toilets, transformation of government primary and upper primary schools, construction and renovation of panchayat secretariats with Internet connection, registration of people for old age, divyang and widow pension, skill development training and others to achieve desired outcomes,” said Deepak Agarwal, divisional commissioner.Also Read | UP govt doles out thousands of crores on expressways in budget 2021All 87 village panchayats were connected to all-weather roads, had panchayat secretariats, 2,577 garbage bins were distributed in these villages, a community toilet was built in each village and 87 ponds were dug up. Also, 50 local young people interested in fisheries were imparted training by the department of fisheries. Then, 1,136 eligible people were enrolled for old age pension, 174 for divyang pension, 362 for widow pension and 282 for Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana.Agarwal said now that each panchayat secretariat has internet connection and a common service center, locals don’t have to run to block office or tehsil for birth certificate, for their land documents or even for applying for pensions.Under Operation Kayakalp, government primary and upper primary schools have been transformed. Children’s libraries were set up in 124 schools and classroom floors were tiled. Boundary walls were built in 13 schools which didn’t have them and 53 schools were given electricity connection. Drinking water facility was also provided in 23 schools.“The model ideal developmental block Sevapuri project is an outcome -driven project,” said the divisional commissioner. “Out of the 141 goals, 122 have been achieved,” he added.“It is important to note that we have achieved the desired outcomes simply by convergence of various departments’ schemes and funds available with them, without any additional resources,” he said.Ouside Jogiyapur village in the ideal block area, a MNREGA-herbal park has been developed. Medicinal plants of 40 indigenous species such as Kaalmegh, Madar, Shatavari and Ashwagandha have been planted there. Four local women are assigned the task of looking after the park.“Sevapuri developmental block was considered as the most interior developmental block in the district. It has been transformed now. Sevapuri developmental block office is equipped with an auditorium and high speed internet facilities,” said Devesh Singh, a senior employee at the block.Over 2,200 volunteers were roped in to educate the locals about health and sanitation in the villages, said Umeshmani Tripathi, project director, District Rural Development Authority and nodal officer for the model block project.Locals, however, aren’t so upbeat and voice mixed opinions. “Many developmental works have been done in our village,” said Phoolchand Kesari of Amini village.However, another local, Sukharaj Patel, said, “Garbage bins have been placed in the villages to paint a rosy picture. But nothing has changed inside the villages. Lanes still need to be turned into concrete roads. Steps for employment generation should also be taken.”Manoj Kumar, also of Amini village, said, “Wellness centre and other facilities are useful for the locals. In case of any ailment, they consult the health official deployed at the wellness centre. Niti Aayog should also have a concrete plan for employment generation in rural pockets so that people like me don’t remain jobless.”Social activist Panchmukhi said, “Unemployment is a major problem in the area. It should be solved.”Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Agarwal said Sevapuri would turn into a model ideal developmental block by April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sevapuri-in-pm-s-seat-becoming-a-role-model-of-development-101614153406035.html

24-02-2021||Lucknow||UP power corporation seeks change in tariff slabs to get more revenue||The UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) has sought, yet again, reorganisation of existing power tariff slabs applicable to consumers under various categories in a bid that may make power usage costlier for some categories and bring more revenue to the corporation without any direct tariff increase.The annual revenue requirement (ARR) proposal (for 2021-22) submitted by the corporation to UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) has proposed revision of the current tariff structure that would remove or merge some tariff categories and create some fresh slabs if the regulator accepts the proposal.“The UPPCL has filed the ARR with a proposal for changes in current tariff slabs much like the proposal it filed last year and we rejected the same,” a senior official at UP’s power regulator said, adding “We will now examine the ARR before we admit it for consideration.”Last year, the UPPCL had sought a reduction in subcategories/slabs under consumer categories LMV-1 (domestic) LMV-2 (commercial), LMV-3 (public lamps), LMV-4 (institutions), LMV-6(small and medium industries) LMV-9 (temporary supply), HV-1 (non-industrial bulk load) and HV-3(heavy industries).It also proposed an increase in the number of sub-categories under the category LMV-7 (public waterworks) and sought deletion of the entire category LMV-8 (state tube wells) proposing its merger in the category LMV-7. “The proposal is, by and large, on the same lines this year,” the official said.Opposing the proposal, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma on Tuesday filed a petition in the UPERC urging it to reject the UPPCL’s entire ARR which he claimed was based on imaginary figures. “The proposal for change in the consumer categorization is an attempt to get tariff increase through the backdoor,” he alleged. The ARR has put the UPPCL’s total revenue requirement during 2021-22 at ₹81,901 crore that also included an estimated expenditure of ₹62,020 crore on the purchase of 1,20,043 million units (MUs) of electricity during the year.The UPPCL has forecast the distribution losses to 16.64% for 2021-22 against the 11.08% approved by the UPERC in its last tariff order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-power-corporation-seeks-change-in-tariff-slabs-to-get-more-revenue-101614151542311.html
24-02-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: A handsome Vishnu statue amongst the ruins reveals Pune’s tryst with the “Golden Age”||PUNE The study of cultural history is based on nature and scope of evidence, either in textual, material or oral form. No amount of imagination compensates for the lack of evidence. Often, the lack of evidence means a break in continuity of timelines and fragmentation of collective historical understanding. This poses a great challenge to comprehend historical events.Hence, a true “sutradhara” is on the constant look out for new exciting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle to complete the picture.The various coins and coin hoards found in the vicinity of Pune reflect a strong Satavahana and Kshatrapa dynastic presence. A significant discovery was also made in July 1974 at Rajangaon, 30km from Pune, when a Kshatrapa coin hoard of 1,518 coins was discovered. These coins, studied by Dr Shobhana Gokhale, Dr Deo and Dr M K Dhavalikar, consisted mainly of silver coins of the Kardamaka branch of the Western Kshatrapas.Western Kshatrapas were Indo-Scythian by origin and involved in international trade in northern western India. Back in Pune city, excavations revealed terracotta pottery dating to the Vakataka period (5th-6th century CE), above the Satavahana layers. Now, who are these Vakataka folks? Vakataka dynasty is one of the lesser known, but significant dynasties of not just Maharashtra, but India. They are contemporary to the famous Gupta dynasty in the north, of which Chandragupta Vikramaditya is a well-known king. History also informs us of the poet par excellence, Mahakavi Kalidas, spending time in the Vakataka courts in Vidarbha.The proverbial “Golden age” in Indian history has been attributed to this period of Guptas by earlier scholars. Such times are characterised by large-scale development and achievements in various areas. These fields included engineering, art, science, technology, literature, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy. Recently studies by scholars offer more nuanced narrative attributing the golden age not to Gupta alone but to combined Gupta Vakataka age around 5th to 6th century CE. The era saw great strides and achievements in literature and especially art and culture which essentially defined Indian art. Testimony to this golden age is sufficiently found in art sculpture and paintings at Ajanta caves, carrying legacy of Vakataka reign. Recent studies offer a more nuanced narrative attributing the golden age not to the Guptas alone, but to the combined Gupta Vakataka age around 5th to 6th century CE. It was only by sheer luck and presence of mind of Mr Balkawade, that we could preserve the significant marker of the Indian classical age from Pune. The renovation of a 200-year-old Lokhande wada in Kasba peth was in full swing on December 23, 1999. The demolishers hit a stone masonry chamber while digging the foundation 20 feet underground. And to everyone’s wonder, a near intact sculpture of lord Vishnu was exposed.The digging caused some damage to the idol. The owners were reluctant to preserve the damaged sculpture of lord Vishnu and decided to submerge it in river water. Thanks to vigilant citizens, Balakawade was informed. The sculpture is a masterpiece and has immense historical value. It measures 20 inches by 11 inches.The sculpture is a samabhanga sthanaka (standing, balanced on two limbs) and has four arms. The upper hand holds a cylindrical mace and the other hand holds a disc or sudarshan chakra. The lower arm holds a conch or panchajanya shankha in akimbo and the other arm is in partial varad mudra. The end of the mace merges in a small lady-like figure which is the feminine personification of kaumudaki gada, or mace of Vishnu. The other attendant like male figure could be the personification of shankha purusha or conch resting its head. It is interesting to note that Padma, the lotus flower, an original attribute of Lakshmi is absent. The handsome figure is carved in complete relief and has rectangular headgear which is a style attributed to the Kushana Gupta period. The headgear in the rear has a feta-like appearance. An Ekavali ornament is seen around the neck alongwith kundala in the ears. The figure doesn’t wear a yadnopavit, sacred thread across the chest nor has a sri-vatsa symbol of Lakshmi. The figure wears a lower garment and has a long twisted cloth strap, characteristic of Kushana-Gupta period figures. The sculpture has an extension at the bottom to place it in a niche. This handsome Vishnu has calm and classical features which reflect great style and craftsmanship of 4th century CE. The stone is schist or soapstone, black and fine grained. The entire surface of sculpture is polished. How it came to be and where it came from, are many questions which remain unanswered. The exceptional sculpture was saved and is safely preserved with the Lokhande family, today. Marking an important milestone in Pune’s journey it truly is a classical enigma to be admired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-a-handsome-vishnu-statue-amongst-the-ruins-reveals-pune-s-tryst-with-the-golden-age-101614151485138.html

Kerala CM wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging the restriction were inconveniencing students, patients and trucks carrying essential supplies from Kerala to Karnataka, which was against the Central government issued guidelines.“Many people, mainly students, trucks carrying essential commodities and patients going for medical treatment are put to undue hardship at the state borders due to this. Kind note may be taken of the fact that imposing restrictions on inter-state movement of people by states is contrary to the instructions of the Government of India, which are at present holding the field,” Vijayan said in his letter.The letter comes days after Karnataka mandated Covid-19 negative certificates for visitors to check the rise in infections, seen in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Kerala. Karnataka has seen a steady rise in cases, following which the decision to deploy marshals at wedding halls has been taken among other steps to avoid another lockdown. Karnataka reported 383 fresh Covid-19 positive cases on Tuesday, taking the toll to 948,849 and the death toll has climbed to 12,303 with four deaths reported on Tuesday. All four deaths were from Bengaluru, which saw 240 fresh cases of infections on Tuesday.

Passenger traffic last year was 8,016,456 against 29,521,918 in 2019, revealed the AAI data.In the pre-Covid days, CSMIA got an average of 42,000 international passengers per day but this number fell to 18,000 by mid-March last year. Domestic traffic too dropped by 15-20%.Experts believe that it will take some time before air traffic can reach its pre-Covid levels. CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer of Alliance Air, said, “How can the air traffic reach pre-Covid levels when we are not even allowing flights to operate at their full capacity? (It won’t happen) unless state governments ease their respective restrictions, and more people are successfully vaccinated. International flights majorly contribute to passenger traffic; hence air traffic and passenger footfall will significantly increase with opening of the international borders.”However, the pandemic is not the only factor for lower number of passengers at the city airport.

24-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Policy for doorstep delivery of ration notified||The Delhi government has notified a policy document which prescribes the modalities of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme – an initiative that can potentially make monthly ration more accessible to 1.75 million households in the Capital, exempting families from long queues at fair price shops.The document, which HT has seen, said: “The scheme will be optional, and an option shall be taken from the beneficiaries of the existing TPDS [targeted public distribution system] in Delhi, as to whether they want to enrol under the scheme or continue under existing TPDS. Those who are not opting for the scheme shall continue to get their ration as per existing mechanism and price. Beneficiaries will be able to exercise option in the beginning of every financial year.”On January 25, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the scheme will be operational by March.Earlier, the proposed scheme had been designed to automatically include all ration beneficiaries in the city unless they chose to “opt out” of it by responding to a specific text message sent by the food and civil supplies department within a 10-day window, said a report published in HT on February 13.Also Read | AAP springs a surprise, Kejriwal thanks votersA senior government official said, “We received feedback that suggested that the auto-inclusion process, which provided beneficiaries 10 days to opt-out by responding to a text message sent by the government could confuse people as well as agencies entrusted with the doorstep delivery. So, the process has been simplified. Now people will have to specifically give consent for inclusion. The registration process will be rolled out in another week.”The scheme document, that was notified on February 20, detailed the process. It said foodgrains will be collected from food corporation godowns by agencies empanelled by the government and sent to mills wherein grains such as wheat will be processed into flour and packed. Similarly, there will be units for ther cleaning and packing of rice too. The packets will be delivered to fair price shops and from thereon to residences of beneficiaries who opt for the scheme.The beneficiaries will have to register the receipt of the ration with their fingerprints on the biometric-based electronic point-of-sales (e-POS) machines, which representatives of the agencies entrusted with doorstep delivery will carry. The entire operation will be monitored from the godown stage to the doorstep through CCTV cameras, GPS-fitted vehicles, e-POS logs, etc, said the document.Delhi has 1.75 million ration card holders, which translates to 7.16 million beneficiaries, according to authorities. Of the total ration card holders, 1.51 million are covered under the priority household category of the National Food Security Act, 2013, while 0.17 million are covered under priority state household category, and the remaining 0.07 million come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, show government records.While those under the first two categories are entitled to 5kg of foodgrains a month, those under the third category are entitled to 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar every month. These items are distributed to them from 2,010 fair price shops that are currently functional across the city.The project was cleared by the Delhi Cabinet in March 2018 but could not be rolled out because of several administrative issues, some of which even led to stand-offs between the elected government led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and officials in charge of the department. Some of the administrative issues pertained to legal provisions under the food security law, which took more than one year to be resolved, said a senior government official.The project was given a fresh push ahead of the assembly polls in Delhi in February 2020 and a pilot run for three months was conducted in five municipal wards of north Delhi. In July 2020, the new Cabinet gave fresh approval to the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-policy-for-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-notified-101614138405160.html

24-02-2021||Bangalore||Panic over crackdown on illegal explosives led to Chikkaballapur blast||Six people were killed while trying to dispose of gelatin sticks at a quarry site in Hirenagavalli village of Karnataka’s Chikkaballapur early on Tuesday.The government has ordered a CID probe into the blast.Police said panic over a crackdown on illegal explosives led to the blast, adding that the owners of the Brahama Varshini quarry had employed their workers to dispose of the explosives, even though the workers were not proficient in handling them.The unscientific way of handling the explosives, where charges and detonators were kept together, led to the explosion, said police officers after the initial investigation.Also Read: ‘Didn't know what was in bag, says driver who transported explosivesFollowing a similar blast in Shivamogga, chief minister Yediyurappa’s home constituency, on January 22, police had begun a state-wide crackdown on illegal explosives. An investigation by the Internal Security Division (ISD) led to the arrest of a dealer of explosives, who led the police to Brahma Varshini quarry, a source in the ISD said.“It began with the arrest of one Shivakumar in Chintamani (in Chikkaballapur) for storing explosives illegally in his house. He was employed with a quarry in the same place. During the interrogation, he revealed the name of his supplier – Gangoji Rao,” the officer said.Within days, police tracked down Gangoji Rao, who is a licensed explosive dealer. However, he had illegally supplied explosives to several quarries, including Brahma Varshini, in and around Chikkaballapur.Based on the information from the ISD, the local police conducted a surprise raid on the quarry on February 7. After they found violations in the procurement and storage of explosives, the quarry was shut down.“We suspect that fearing further investigation and raids, the owners of the quarry wanted to remove the explosives from the location, and it was done in the most unscientific way. The experts we spoke with said that workers had kept the charges and detonators together. Even cell phone signal could have led to the blast,” he added.Sources said the raid on the Brahma Varshini was part of many raids conducted by the police over a month.ADGP Bhaskar Rao, who was heading the ISD raids, said a total of 20 cases involving illegal explosives were registered since February this year, including 14 by the ISD. “We found several violations such as people without licences dealing explosives, non-scientific methods of storing...We have seized over 100 detonators...,” the officer addedIllegal quarrying in ChikkaballapurAfter studying satellite images sourced from the National Remote Sensing Centre, the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) had identified 532 illegal quarries in the Chikkaballapur district in 2019.The findings were mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report as well, in which DMG was asked to take action against these illegal quarries. According to the report, at least 11.12 crore metric tonnes of specified and unspecified minerals were illegally extracted, causing loss of ₹223.25 crore to the state.The larger pictureOfficials of DMG said there could be more than 2,000 illegal quarries across Karnataka. “There are around 450 licences issued for decorative stone quarries and 300 stone quarries. But there are way more quarries, we estimate it to be around 2,000,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/panic-over-crackdown-on-illegal-explosives-led-to-chikkaballapur-blast-101614137302759.html

24-02-2021||Patna||Nitish Kumar takes on opposition, presents Bihar turnaround story||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday countered the opposition’s narrative with point by point rebuttals and presented the state's growth story under his government amid frequent spats with the leader of opposition (LoP) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha.At one point, when Kumar referred to his experience with the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Tejashwi intervened, asking him to narrate it, Kumar responded: “When I was at the Centre, you were in the lap. I have also taken you in my lap.”He also took on the Congress leaders for pleading for reopening of liquor shops in the state by showing them their party’s membership form to underline that their position was contrary to a clause of their own party’s membership criteria.“It (Congress membership form) says members will not touch intoxicants, but here they are acting to the contrary, though the decision to impose full prohibition in the state was taken following a unanimous decision of all the members,” Kumar said.While giving government’s reply to the debate on motion of thanks to the governor’s address to the joint session of both houses, Kumar spoke at length on his government’s achievements, including the way the state responded during Covid-19 pandemic to record highest testing per million and the lowest death rate, steep fall in the infant and maternal mortality rates, 86% immunisation, and plans for making a self-reliant Bihar. However, the Opposition staged a walkout in the midst of his reply.The CM said the government was working on an agreement with the Tata technical group for skilling the youth in the state in areas such as electric vehicles maintenance, advance welding, 3D printing etc. by setting up centres of excellence in the industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics in the state. “We have also been demanding permission from the Centre since 2007 for ethanol production and there was also a ₹210,000 crore proposal. However, the Centre denied it. Now the Centre has made a policy for it,” he added.Kumar said that the government took every incident of crime seriously, and pointed out that as per the national crime record bureau (NCRB), Bihar was ranked 25th in terms of number of cognizable offences, contrary to what the opposition tries to portray, while responding to Tejashwi’s attack on law and order. “It was 23rd earlier. In a society, wrong doers are always there, but the government has been able to establish the rule of law,” Kumar added.The CM said that the opposition parties needed to take note of the 10.5% growth rate achieved by the state in 2019-20 to realise how far it has come since 2004-05. “The budget size has increased from mere ₹23,885 crore to ₹218,000 crore since then, while the per capita income has increased from ₹7,954 to ₹50,765, resulting in marked improvement in the standard of living and growth in business activities,” Nitish Kumar said.Also Read: Amid price hike, fuel smuggling from Nepal to Bihar in full swingWhen Kumar referred to power supply to every household across the state, Tejashwi intervened, saying there was hardly any production of electricity in the state and the power rates were among the highest. Kumar pointed out that power consumption had reached 5932 mw and Bihar’s move to install pre-paid meters to address billing complaints had been lauded by the Centre. “We are also giving highly subsidized electricity for farming and have been demanding one nation, one power tariff, but tell me if there was electricity in villages before 2006,” he asked.Maintaining that there had been a phenomenal increase in agriculture production and productivity in comparison to 2004-05, Kumar said now the emphasis was on organic farming and climate-smart agriculture to adapt with the changes. “The government is already working as part of its 7 Resolves (Part-2) campaign to ensure water to every farm, while procurement of farm produce has touched record levels. Paddy procurement this year reached 35.59-lakh mt,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-takes-on-opposition-presents-bihar-turnaround-story-101614135273584.html

24-02-2021||Lucknow||Farmers from UP villages to fast, send messages to PM every day from March 1||The Uttar Pradesh Kisan Mazdoor Morcha on Tuesday said it will launch a village-level agitation across the state from March 1 seeking withdrawal of the Centre's three farm laws and guarantee to purchase at the minimum support price (MSP).VM Singh, leader of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sanghatan (RKMS) , which has joined 21 other farmer outfits to form the Uttar Pradesh Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (UPKMM) said: "This new movement will start from March 1, where five people from each village will observe fast every day and record messages to be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi every two minutes. If even 500 villages are covered in one district, then 5000 men will let the prime minister know through the website the voices of the farmers. This will be done to unite the villages."UPKMM was constituted with 22 farmer outfits on February 21 after coordinated meetings with about two dozen farmers 'organizations in Uttar Pradesh.Singh claimed that the RKMS had never disassociated with the farmers agitating against the three farm laws at the different borders of the national capital since November last year"We did not leave the movement. We were against the manner in which the protest turned violent. I had also said that we will come back in the form of a new movement and today after one month we have returned. I believe that if this movement reaches the people within the village, then the farmers will get benefitted," Singh said.At the Republic Day tractor rally, farmers breached barricades and clashed with police at several places in the national capital, after which the RKMS had announced that they were not going to be associated with the farmers' agitation.The RKMS leader further said that the village level agitation is also aimed at sending a message to those who claimed that the agitation is not farmer-driven but hijacked by vested interests."The ministers say that there are no farmers in the protest but when the farmers will send their message from their villages, then will understand that the protest is genuine and that the rights of the farmers should be guaranteed, Singh said.The RKMS leader further extended solidarity to those farmers who were continuing their protest at the borders of Delhi."We wish luck to those who are sitting at the Ghazipur, Singhu, and Tikri border. We are doing our work but we will be different in the form of agitation," Singh said.While speaking to ANI, Singh further said, "MSP is our main right and we should get the guaranteed purchase as per the MSP. If someone buys less than that, then it will be considered an offence."Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/farmers-from-up-villages-to-fast-send-messages-to-pm-every-day-from-march-1-101614131208652.html

But they are investigating further,” Sudhakar said.Also Watch: Karnataka: 6 killed while trying to dispose of explosives in ChikkaballapurPolice have identified three owners of the quarry and legal action has begun.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths. “Pained by the loss of lives due to a mishap at Chikkaballapur in Karnataka.

24-02-2021||Bangalore||SDPI instigated mob, triggered B’luru riots: NIA charge sheet||The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) instigated the mob that triggered the violence in Bengaluru in the late hours of August 11, according to a charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday.The 301-page charge sheet details how the leaders of SDPI, a political group formed in June 2009, planned to use a provocative post by the relative of a prominent politician to stoke communal riots in the KG Halli and DJ Halli neighbourhoods of Bengaluru.“The SDPI in Bengaluru was unhappy with the decisions of the Central government on certain matters i.e, repeal of Article 370, issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), Supreme Court verdict on Babri Masjid case, Triple Talaq, etc. They were waiting for an opportunity to create communal disharmony in the country,” according to the charge-sheet.Three people died after a mob went on a rampage in reaction to a communally charged Facebook post by a relative of Pulakeshinagar Congress legislator, Akhanda Srinivas Murthy.The NIA charge-sheet states that Naveen, the relative of Murthy was entrapped into reacting to a derogatory post. The document says that the SDPI, which had been taking up civic and other issues,was also looking to exploit emotive religious issues such as the Bhoomi Poojan for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. and agitations against CAA/NRC.The charge-sheet states that Fairoz Pasha joined hands with Mohammed Shariff, Muzammil Pasha and other SDPI leaders in Bengaluru and “hatched a criminal conspiracy”. The NIA stated that the group decided to post derogatory messages insulting Hindu gods and the community through Fairoz’s Facebook account. They intentionally selected August 11, 2020, Krishna Janmashtami, to post the message, the NIA said.The NIA added that Fairoz posted video and audio clips of BJP minister Murugesh Nirani that was seen to hurt Hindu sentiments.He tagged Naveen, the relative of Srinivas Murthy. The post by Naveen triggered a violent reaction with a cartoon of Prophet Mohammed and a derogatory insinuation.“This charge-sheet is pre-planned and prejudiced. This is the same thing that happened in Delhi (the Delhi riots case) and this report is a copy-paste of the same report,” Afsar Kodlipet, a senior office bearer of the SDPI in Karnataka, said in a video message.“The person named as accused 1 (Fairoz) is not a SDPI member. We have not got a copy of the charge-sheet and when we get it, will study it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sdpi-instigated-mob-triggered-b-luru-riots-nia-charge-sheet-101614122159391.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Lift the iron curtain at Delhi’s liquor vends||The window behind the grille at the government liquor shop in Tughlakabad extension is usually open by noon. But it comes to life after sundown.Large crowds gather outside the shop jostling for space. A few seconds are all that customers get to shout the name of a drink, pay cash, grab the bottle, and push themselves out of the crowd. There is no time to browse, or check if a particular brand is available in the 30 seconds that customers get before they are shoved aside.“Given the size of the crowd and the madness in the last few hours before the shop closes at 10pm, there is not much room for thinking,” said Shubham Choudhury, a tech executive who lives in Kalkaji.There are other problems. In these peak hours, it’s difficult to pay with a card as shopkeepers accept nothing but cash. Even in the less-crowded afternoon hours, one can ask about specific brands, but stocks are extremely limited, and imported brands are out of the question.“Often it even gets difficult to avail decent whiskeys and light beer,” said Choudhury.The 34-year-old now drives a few kilometres to a prominent private vendor in Greater Kailash – where he gets to choose from a wide range of different varieties of liquor, with salespersons to help with queries. Customers can pick what they want from the shelves, get it billed, and walk out.“That is the kind of experience liquor shops must offer across the city,” he said. The problem is that such shops are few, and only in a few select neighbourhoods.Also Read | Delhi: It’s time for liquor policy to come of ageChoudhury isn’t the only one complaining. Across Delhi, customers say buying liquor in the city is both cumbersome and painstaking -- comparing poorly to the experience in other metro cities that boast of stores where people can choose brands at leisure.In contrast, city residents say that the jostling in front of grilled shops, often with louts and drunks, increases the taboo around drinking, and makes buying of alcohol seem unsafe and feel unpleasant. Little wonder then that some people say they drive to Gurugram and Noida for a better retail experience.“For women, particularly, most government shops are no-go zones. They are very crowded and women do not feel safe,” said Akanksha Nagpal, manager at an audit firm based in Delhi.Arijit Sen, who works with a legal consultancy company, said the biggest concern is the lack of room to explore brands. “In the peak hours, one has to have a certain brand in mind. Then the shop owners often say no, and push another brand as an alternative. One has to quickly decide. Even if one goes in the lean hours, range of stock is a major issue,” he said.Delhi has roughly 720 liquor shops, of which 460 are government shops and 260 are private. Of the 260, around 160 are located inside shopping malls, government records said. All shops have to renew their licenses annually. In addition, roughly 1,043 restaurants, hotels and pubs serve liquor on their premises.Mumbai has 1,190 liquor shops and Bangalore has 1,794, said a Delhi government report prepared in January.But people with knowledge of developments say the lack of choice at liquor stores is more systemic, and involves the sale of unregistered brands – from which the government generates no revenue by way of excise or sales tax. In the Capital, for example, there are at least 30 brands of whisky and other hard liquor that are not sold anywhere outside the city.Moreover, neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have higher density of liquor shops per population, ensuring ease of access and less crowding. The distribution of the shops is not even, creating demand-and-supply gaps that encourages illicit liquor, sale of non-registered brands and bootlegging.“Around 70 municipal wards in Delhi (out of 272), especially in the northwest peripheries and the rural belt in south, do not have liquor shops. They also lead to excessive crowds at liquor stores in other areas which definitely affect the customers’ buying experience,” said a senior official in the excise department who did not wish to be identified.Another pain point is the scarce availability of imported liquor. Imported liquor and a wide range of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) can be found mostly in malls and some prominent private stores, but only a handful of government shops – for instance, those located in Connaught Place and Khan Market. “The range of stock for any shop – government or private – depends on the nature and scale of demand it witnesses. So, that is something more market-driven,” said the excise department official.To be sure, the city has taken major strides in modernising the liquor business in the past two decades.In 2003, a policy facilitated the entry of private enterprises. It forced the government into improving the quality of service in neighbourhood shops. In 2010, a new policy drafted for malls allowed liquor stores and departmental stores to have liquor sections – through licenses under L-10 and L-12 categories.“These are the kind of shops preferred by women, consumers of imported liquor, and people who like more choices… there have been some major game changers in the front of improving the liquor buying experience for people in the city,” said Bhub Singh, a member of the Delhi Alcobev Retailers Association, a group of 107 prominent retailers based in the city.In 2010, the government allowed department stores and large chain stores to stock beer, wine and light alcoholic drinks. By 2019, there were at least 125 such stores across the city stocking alcoholic beverages. “It was of immense help. People who look out for beer and wine could pick up liquor while doing their groceries or running errands,” said Ankita Singh, who works with an advertisement company.But two years ago, the government ordered the liquor counters shut, citing violation of license norms concerning maximum cap on carpet area. Officials said people had opened stores overnight to just sell liquor and applied for licences under the L-12 and L-12/F categories –which concerns departmental stores.The matter went to the Delhi high court which issued a stay order on December 24, 2019. In March 2020, the government did not invite applications for L-12 and L-12/F licences for 2020-21. This too went to the Delhi High court, where the government said that a new policy would be drafted to plug loopholes in the system. This time, the court dismissed the plea filed by a collective of departmental stores who could not renew their licenses.Pankaj Singh, a departmental store owner in east Delhi’s Patparganj, who used to have an L-12 license, said, “It would be great if the government opens liquor license applications again for departmental stores. However, the government should reconsider the condition regarding 2,000 square feet carpet area. It will end up making the policy favourable for only big players.”There are other problems too: a four-tier licence system for liquor stores, a complex maze of excise duty slabs that clubs roughly 80% of the IMFL in a single category, and a need for rationalisation of the registration process for foreign brands.The government says it is working on a solution. In September 2020, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia set up a three-member expert committee to draft a new excise policy. In January, recommendations were shared publicly and since received 14,000 responses from industry stakeholders and the general public which are currently being reviewed by a group of ministers, said the excise official quoted above.A Delhi government official said the city government intends to bring back liquor counters in departmental stores and reduce crowds with an equitable distribution of outlets.Under the proposed policy, departmental stores in the city that have a carpet area of more than 2,000 square feet will be able to apply for licenses to sell wine and beer. The proposed policy also says the shop should be functional for at least two years or be part of a chain that has existed for more than two years with an annual turnover of at least ₹1 crore for non-liquor items.“New licenses will be issued in a fashion that ensures more equitable distribution of shops across the city,” said the official.Until then, most consumers have to contend with that dreaded window grille.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lift-the-iron-curtain-at-delhi-s-liquor-vends-101614116909366.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges scam in SDMC schools||The House meeting of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) witnessed chaos on Tuesday with councillors of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shouting slogans against each other on Tuesday.AAP councillors alleged a “scholarship scam” by the civic body and demanded an investigation in the matter, apart from an explanation from the House on the issue.The move was immediately opposed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party .The AAP councillors then proceeded to enter the well of the House, displayed posters related to the alleged scam and raised slogans against the SDMC ruling authorities. To counter it, BJP councillors also raised anti-government slogans. The House was adjourned twice before being finally adjourned to the next date.Leader of opposition and AAP councillor Prem Kumar Chauhan alleged that there were irregularities in payment of scholarships to SC/ST students of SDMC schools between the financial year 2013-14 and 2018-19.“It is a scam worth at least ₹5.7 crore, where annual scholarship was not paid to SC/ST students between 2013-14 and 2018-19 despite the fact that the Delhi government released this amount every year. The money never reached students and it was pocketed by the civic officials,” Chauhan alleged.He also said that an enquiry in this connection is already going on by the anti-corruption branch, but there is a need to seek an explanation from the BJP-ruled civic body and fix responsibility.“We were demanding a discussion on the issue and an explanation from the mayor. But our demand was rejected so we expressed our displeasure. BJP leaders have been protecting corrupt officials because they themselves benefit. BJP councillors opposed our move and created ruckus because they never wanted a discussion on this,” Chauhan said.According to SDMC officials, SC/ST students are given ₹500 scholarship annually by the government. In municipal schools, it is disbursed by the civic body after the funds are released by the government.Chauhan also demanded that taking moral responsibility, the SDMC mayor should resign from the post.Leader of the House, Narendra Chawla refuted the claims of involvement of any councillor or political executive in the alleged scam.“The AAP is in the habit of levelling baseless allegations. When I asked them to submit proofs regarding their claims of a scam, they had none. They just display placards not proofs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-alleges-scam-insdmcschools-101614116605106.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Rape convict on parole nabbed for ATM break-ins||A 34-year-old man convicted in the infamous 2010 Dhaula Kuan gang-rape case was arrested for 12 ATM break-in thefts that he had allegedly committed along with his associates in December and January, while being out on parole, police said on Tuesday.Shamshad alias Khutkan, a resident of Faridabad, was arrested on Monday from near the Gokalpuri Metro station when he arrived there to meet his associate. Shamshad allegedly fired at the police party during his attempt to flee. The shot missed the target and nobody was hurt. Police personnel then overpowered him and snatched away his firearm before he could fire again, the police said.During the interrogation, Shamshad disclosed that he is a life convict in the 2010 Dhaula Kuan gang-rape case.He was released on parole on April 20, 2020, as a part of the exercise to decongest jails in view of Covid-19. Parole was later extended due to the ongoing pandemic till February 20 (Saturday). However, Shamshad did not return to the jail on the proscribed date, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah.Police said after being released on parole, Shamshad joined a Mewat-based interstate gang of robbers. He along with others of the gang allegedly committed 12 ATM break-ins in Delhi, between December 2020 and January 2021, and fled with cash amounting to ₹1.35 lakh.“The gang members used to spray black paint on CCTV cameras after entering the ATM booths. They used to open the ATMs with the help of a gas cutter and remove the cash cabins,” the officer said, adding that the remaining five suspects have also been identified.Shamshad was previously involved in around 16 criminal cases, including attempt to murder, abduction, rape, arms act and cattle smuggling, in Delhi and Haryana.In the 2010 gang-rape case, on the night of November 23, Shamdhad and his four associates abducted a 30-year-old BPO executive while she was walking home with a colleague around midnight, in Moti Bagh near Dhaula Kuan, after being dropped off by an office cab from their Gurugram office.The five men grabbed the women, threatened them with a countrymade pistol and tried to force them into their vehicle – a Tata 407 mini truck. They put the 30-year-old woman into their vehicle while her friend managed to escape after a brief struggle. The five men took turns to rape the woman in the moving vehicle before dumping her at an isolated stretch in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri.The police had cracked the case in a week using some key clues provided by the survivor. Police had used the clues to identify the truck as well as the suspects.The first arrest in the case was made on December 2, when the police caught Shamshad and Usman from Haryana. The other three were caught between December 4 and 6. Police filed the charge sheet on February 2, 2011, and on October 20, 2014, all five accused were awarded life imprisonment by a Delhi court.It was after this incident that the Delhi Police ordered all call centres in Delhi-NCR to drop women employees home safely and to also provide them security while travelling at night. Police also instructed PCR vans to be visible on roads and one officer to remain outside every such vehicle at all times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rape-convict-on-parole-nabbed-for-atm-breakins-101614115636207.html
24-02-2021||Kolkata||CBI team questions TMC MP’s wife||Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers questioned Rujira Banerjee, wife of Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, in connection with a multi-crore coal smuggling case on Tuesday.On Tuesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who happens to be the aunt of Abhishek Banerjee, visited his house.The CBI team, including two woman officers, reached the house moments after the CM left. According to CBI officials privy to the development, Rujira was questioned for around an hour by the CBI team and the entire proceedings were captured on video. The questioning took place a day after the central agency questioned Menaka Gambhir, Rujira’s sister, in connection with the same case.Also Read | BJP's Rakesh Singh, named by Pamela Goswami in drugs case, arrested in KolkataCBI officials haven’t ruled out the possibility of questioning the two sisters again. They said the statements of Rujira Banerjee and Menaka Gambhir were being matched. “The statements given by Rujira Banerjee and Menaka Gambhir would be matched and verified before further steps are taken,” an official said on condition of anonymity.CBI officials said that at least two bank accounts, one of a London-based bank and another of a Bangkok-based bank, had come under scanner; transactions worth huge amounts of money had been done using the accounts, they said.The CBI had on Sunday visited the residence of Abhishek Banerjee to serve notice to his wife for questioning. The agency had also summoned Banerjee’s sister-in-law for questioning in the case. On Monday, Rujira Banerjee responded to the CBI and sent a letter saying: “Though I am unaware of the reason for me being called for questioning on the subject matter of the investigation, you may visit my residence as per your convenience between 11 am and 3 pm tomorrow i.e 23 February 2021.”On Sunday evening, Abhishek Banerjee tweeted a photo of the notice the CBI left at his residence. “...if they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they are mistaken,” he wrote.CM Banerjee said she was not intimidated by anyone, adding that “a tiger cub is not scared of fighting cats and rats”.The episode triggered another round of sparring between the BJP and the TMC ahead of crucial assembly polls. “Bhaipo (nephew) will now land in jail. More clinching evidence would surface once the diary of Anup Majhi (prime accused of the coal smuggling case) comes out,” said Suvendu Adhikari, former TMC heavyweight who has joined the BJP. “...They are dragging family members now {into cases}. We are politicians and can fight..,” said Firhad Hakim, a state minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-team-questions-tmc-mp-s-wife-101614112914032.html
24-02-2021||Chandigarh||Amritsar train tragedy: Govt acts against 4 MC officials; too little, say victims’ kin||Even as the Punjab local bodies department has acted against four Amritsar Municipal Corporation officials (2 now retired) for lapse in the 2018 Dussehra train tragedy that claimed the lives of 61 persons, the victims’ families have expressed their dissatisfaction over the move terming it “too little, too late”. As per the department’s recent order, secretary Sushant Bhatia and superintendent Pushpinder Singh have been debarred from getting any promotion for two years, while pension of former superintendent Girish Kumar and then inspector Kewal Krishan will be deducted by 5% for the same period. There was also a fifth official (now retired), Kashmir Singh, who was chargesheeted along with the four, but he was acquitted as allegations against him were not proved, the order reads. Joint director (local government) Rakesh Kumar confirmed the development.Terming the action as “mere eyewash”, the victims’ families said they were already expecting “mild punishment” as the departmental inquiry was deliberately delayed. “It was because of the lackadaisical approach of the authorities concerned, including the MC officials, police and the railways, that 60 people were killed and more than 100 injured. The punishment should have been exemplary so that no official dares do such a blunder again. Cutting 5% from the pension and stopping promotions for two years is no punishment,” said Deepak Kumar, who lost his father Gurinder Kumar to the tragedy.He added, “Earlier, the railways had submitted a chargesheet against the event organisers without making any arrest. The accused against whom criminal action was recommended are roaming free.”During the departmental inquiry, the inquiry officer had assigned the probe to retired additional district and sessions judge Amarjit Singh Katari after finding replies of four of the chargsheeted officials unsatisfactory. Katari had submitted the inquiry report to the department in June last year, recommending action against the four.The department had given those indicted in the probe 15 days to present their side. Katari in the final report had stated there was ground for “big punishment”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-train-tragedy-govt-acts-against-4-mc-officials-too-little-say-victims-kin-101614111162843.html
24-02-2021||Chandigarh||No need for leadership experiment in Punjab: Sunil Jakhar||Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Monday announced chief minister Amarinder Singh will lead the party in the 2022 assembly elections. Navneet Sharma spoke to Jakhar about the announcement and speculation that it has been made to pre-empt central leadership’s efforts to rehabilitate Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet in July 2019 following differences with Singh. Edited excerpts: What prompted you to make the announcement?I have stated the obvious. It stands to reason. One of the major reasons for this clean sweep in civic polls is his leadership. ...people, especially of urban areas, have voted for peace, amity, and brotherhood in Punjab and his ability to have maintained that. They have put their faith [in him] also as he will maintain it in these troubled and testing times when the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and SAD [Shiromani Akali Dal] are hell-bent on polarising the state. I have only articulated the people’s feelings.Also Read | Delhi to make negative RT-PCR test must for passengers from 5 statesDoes not the high command normally make such announcements?I know my limitations. I am here because the high command has appointed me to look after the party’s interests. They are the real authority. If I had taken the name of anybody else, then it would have amounted to crossing the line. Amarinder is here as the choice of the high command. I am only reiterating their choice. I realise that my decisions need to be endorsed by the central leadership. There are disgruntled elements trying to create an impression that Jakhar is challenging the high command whereas I am only articulating the choice of people. Punjab is leading the fight for saving not just the federal structure but democracy. In such a situation, one cannot think of having a novice. You need a seasoned leader. This is not the time to experiment. People want to be led with a firm hand by someone who understands nuances, especially the way Punjab is being treated by the Centre.Is not it a bit early as the elections are still a year away?We are in election mode. To think that we have romped home and sit back would be an illusion. I think we have to prepare. There are 40 seats where the Congress has not done well.Your move is being seen as an attempt to prevent the rehabilitation of former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu as deputy chief minister or as the state unit chief?He is most welcome to take any position that is given to him by the high command and Amarinder Singh. There is no attempt to stall anyone’s induction. There should be no ambiguity. The sooner the party organisation is put in place, the better it is. Now is the time to decide whatever position Sidhu or any other leader is to be given. Let us not squander away the advantage we have. It is a stepping stone. We need to build and capitalise on it.What role do you see for Sidhu in the elections?Amarinder, Sidhu, and the high command have to settle this. His popularity is there for everybody to see. Where he needs to be adjusted, (Congress’s Punjab in-charge Harish) Rawat has said he will accommodated in accordance with his capabilities. We should make the most of him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-need-for-leadership-experiment-in-punjab-sunil-jakhar-101614110681846.html
24-02-2021||Other||Shiv Sena minister named in suicide case puts up show of strength, irks Maharashtra govt||With Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) turning up heat on state forest minister from the Shiv Sena, Sanjay Rathod, in connection with the suicide of a 23-year- old Pune woman, the minister put up a show of strength in his stronghold in Vidarbha region. The senior Maharashtra minister, who represents Darwha assembly constituency in Yavatmal district, was unreachable for the past 15 days after the woman’s death. Nationalist Congress Party NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and pointed out that the episode is maligning the image of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. An irked Thackeray ordered the local administration to take action against those responsible for violating the Covid-19 norms after Rathod’s supporters gathered in large number at Washim as the minister made his first public appearance after his name was linked to the case. Thackeray has asked state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar to seek a report from the district collector and police superintendent on the matter. CM ruled out sacking Rathod and said he would wait for the outcome of the investigation being conducted by Pune police. Rathod is in controversy after a few audio tapes that went viral following the TikTok suicide. BJP alleged that Rathod was in a relationship with the woman and was responsible for her death. An influential leader of Banjara community that has strong presence in several parts of Vidarbha, Rathod made his public appearance at Pohradevi temple in an important place of worship for the Banjara community in Washim district. Hundreds of his followers, almost all from Banjara community, gathered there from Yavatmal, Washim, Nanded, Jalna and other districts of the state, defying the Covid-19 norms in the presence of a huge police bandobast. They resorted to sloganeering. He was flanked by his wife Sheetal, giving a clear message that his family is supportive of him amid the controversy. Rathod told the media that he was not guilty and truth would come out in the investigation. Talking to media persons he said that there was an attempt to finish his political career. “All allegations against me in the case were baseless. CM has ordered an inquiry into the matter. It should be thoroughly investigated so that the truth comes out. My family and community are with me,” he said. Tuesday’s huge gathering at the temple was seen as a show of strength, and the minister wants to signal that he is a strong leader of the Banjara community and if CM tries to drop him from the cabinet, it will affect the Sena in the coming days. The meeting between Thackeray and Pawar took place after Rathod’s show of strength. According to an NCP minister, Pawar reached Varsha on Tuesday around 7pm and both the leaders said to have discussed the issue in detail. Pawar told CM that Rathod should not have organised the “show of strength” as it will not go down well among the citizens at large. Pawar told Thackeray that there must be some action in the matter, the NCP minister said. “CM has taken serious note of reports of overcrowding at Pohradevi in Washim. If social distancing rules are not followed, then the administration should take action against,” stated a release issued by CM’s office. Political analyst Hemant Desai said “Rathod could get axed. Staging a show of strength when he is under cloud in a serious case would not go down well with people. Thackeray may do well by sacking him.” Opposition parties, particularly BJP, strongly criticised MVA government and especially the Shiv Sena, for not taking any action against the minister. The opposition demanded an inquiry against the minister and his removal from the cabinet. BJP leaders Chitra Wagh and Pravin Darekar said that the minister was putting pressure on the state by organising such a show of strength. “CM should not be a victim to such tricks,” they said. BJP has demanded for a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation for the “fair probe”. In a letter to Thackeray, Maharashtra BJP’s vice-president Prasad Lad said, “After Rathod resorted to the show of strength on Tuesday, the investigation by state police is unlikely to be without any prejudice. The entire case needs to the probe by CBI.” Another BJP leader, Atul Bhatkhalkar, said, “Unless the minister is arrested by lodging a case against him, there would be no fair probe.”The woman was died by suicide on February 8. The Maharashtra Police reported it as an accidental death case and dismissed any foul play. However, many audio clips allegedly linked to her death, moreover, alluding to the involvement of the state minister, went viral on social media. In one of the clips, one person is heard making suggestions to suppress the case. BJP has alleged that it was Rathod. A four-time MLA, Rathod is an influential Sena leader from Vidarbha. He is also very popular among the Banjara community, which has a sizable population in west Vidarbha region. Rathod was appointed as minister of forest in Thackeray’s cabinet in 2019. He is also the guardian minister for Yavatmal district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-minister-named-in-suicide-case-puts-up-show-of-strength-irks-maharashtra-govt-101614110503246.html

Sidhu quit the state Cabinet in July 2019 following differences with Singh.Jakhar’s announcement came four days after he launched the “Captain for 2022” campaign as the Congress swept the civic polls in the state amid anger in Punjab over the three central farm laws passed in September. The Congress’s central leadership generally makes such announcements.The declaration came amid the talk of attempts to appoint Sidhu as the state unit president or re-induct him into the Cabinet as the deputy chief minister. Congress’s Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat, who has praised Sidhu’s crowd-pulling ability and usefulness for the party, has been dropping hints about an “important role” for him, particularly in the state unit.Also Read | Punjab: Out of 4,000 schoolteachers tested, 13 found positive for Covid-19Sidhu, who is known to be close to top Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, appears to be keen on heading the state unit ahead of the assembly polls. People aware of the matter said Singh has not been amenable to having Sidhu as the state Congress chief or the deputy chief minister.“There have been efforts by the central leadership for quite some time to accommodate Sidhu, who also wants a position that gives an impression in the state party that he is next in line in the party’s succession plan, but there may be issues as he joined the party just four years ago. The chief minister has made it known that there are many other capable party leaders,” said a Congress leader on condition of anonymity.The relations between the two leaders have been frosty since Sidhu joined the party. Rawat has been trying to bring about a rapprochement and the two met over lunch over two months ago to break the ice due to his efforts.Rawat said they have been working on it and things have become better. “But we have to take everyone on board,” he said, expressing hope of a positive development next month.Sidhu and Singh were immediately unavailable for comments.Ashutosh Kumar, a political science professor at Chandigarh’s Panjab University, said Singh is a strong leader and Jakhar’s move could not have been made without an understanding. “It is an assertion of Amarinder’s authority after the civic poll results to check an ambitious Sidhu.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/the-politics-behind-capt-for-2022-gambit-101614110442912.html

The department officials, who had last week directed all school heads and block primary education officers to ensure that mask norms are strictly followed in all schools, are themselves flouting the norms. A visit to the education department, situated on the second floor of the deputy commissioner’s (DC) office, revealed that none of the employees were wearing masks during office hours. The violators included staff members of all branches-- administrative, accounts, general, mid-day meal and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan office. When asked, the employees said that it was difficult for them to wear masks for eight hours at a stretch as their shift starts at 9am and ends at 5pm. An employee, requesting anonymity, said, “We are maintaining social distancing and take care to be seated away from each other. We do wear masks when we move out of our branch.”District education officer, elementary, Rajinder Kaur, said, “I will direct all employees of both offices to follow the Covid-19 norms and if anyone is found violating the safety protocols, strict action will be taken against the employee. Wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing are important to keep the virus from spreading. Negligence on the part of staff members will not be tolerated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-edu-dept-officials-don-t-practise-what-they-preach-flout-mask-norms-101614110025137.html

As of February 21, Mumbai had 7,276 active cases of Covid-19, of which 4,851 were asymptomatic and 2,149 were symptomatic. “Though active cases have increased in the city, almost 80% of the symptomatic patients are mildly or moderately infected who can take treatment at home only. But if anyone wants to remain isolated from family members, we would keep them in CCC-1. So, for a time being, we are keeping 24 CCC-1s open,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. BMC has 336 CCC-1 facilities which have a total bed capacity of 46,712. On February 21, 400 of these were occupied by mildly symptomatic patients. “I am getting quite a few patients but as most of them are mildly symptomatic, I am suggesting they get treatment at home,” said epidemiologist Dr Lancelot Pinto. According to BMC, of the 11,205 beds in hospitals dedicated to Covid treatment, only 3,329 beds were occupied on February 21. “We have been instructed to test all symptomatic patients coming to our OPD [outpatient department] or emergency ward. But so far, we haven’t seen any sudden severity of cases,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital. City doctors said no one should delay treatment as that could aggravate the infection. “Patients should be vigilant and report symptoms such as cough, chest congestion, cold and breathlessness on an immediate basis. This will help the expert to determine the underlying cause and suggest appropriate treatment. Ignoring symptoms can land patients in trouble. Also, do not self-medicate. Only take medication prescribed by the doctor,” said Dr Rajratan Sadawarte, chest physician at Kohinoor Hospital. “There are no shortages of essential medicines like Remdesivir and oxygen in the state. As we have already dealt with the peak of the pandemic, we have learnt tactics which will be useful now,” said DR Gahane, joint commissioner of Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-care-centres-reactivated-in-all-wards-in-mumbai-101614110022634.html

The board’s chairperson Dinkar Patil said that students and parents should not believe in rumours that are doing the rounds on social media. “We are currently making all the necessary arrangements for conducting exams as usual, that is in the offline format. Considering the high number of students and the different places from where they write exams, online exams do not seem feasible,” said Patil. He added that the exact guidelines with respect to the exams will be declared at a later date. “There are two months to the exams and we will keep a tab on the Covid-19 situation in the state. Any changes or modifications in the existing format will have to be thought of only if needed later,” said Patil. With schools in Mumbai remaining closed, parents and teachers, over the past few days, have been requesting the state education department to give 50% weightage to internal assessments for Class 10 and 12 exams. Several parents have also requested for online exams. Around 1.5 million students appear for the HSC (Class 12) exam, while over 1.7 million students write their SSC exams (Class 10) from the state every year. While the board conducts these exams in February and March every year, this year they have been pushed for later months owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown. While HSC exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, SSC exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-10-12-exams-to-be-held-offline-maharashtra-board-101614109783775.html

She then approached the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), which admitted the error and suspended a clerk over the issue.“At first, MSEDCL authorities asked me to pay the ₹80-crore bill and said they’ll look into the issue. But I refused and demanded justice. I asked MSEDCL to conduct a meter test and check the reading. I was however, scared that MSEDCL would disconnect my power supply,” said Naik.Vijay Sinh Dudhbhate, public relations officer, MSEDCL (Kalyan), said there was a technical error in the case. “We had given the contract to private agencies to take readings of the meters. The agencies then submit the readings to us for final billing. The consumer has actually consumed only 10,7784.75 units and a clerk had negligently entered 107,785,075 units, thus generating a bill of ₹80-crore,” said Dudhbhate.The corrected bill is ₹86,890, said Dudhbhate. After investigation, we have suspended the clerk with immediate effect and issued show-cause notices to the officials concerned. We’ll also file a complaint with Nallasopara police station against the private agency who has been given the tender to conduct the readings each month. The consumer has agreed to pay the corrected bill and we sincerely apologise for the error,” said Dudhbhate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-power-firm-suspends-clerk-after-teacher-gets-80-crore-power-bill-101614109782480.html

After a two-hour long meeting with municipal commissioner Pradeep Kumar Sabharwal, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, joint commissioners Swati Tiwana, Kulpreet Singh and other MC officials, Sinha visited Gorsian Kadar Baksh village, the proposed site for the modern dairy complex. A high-powered committee formed for shifting the dairy units out of the city limits had proposed the name of Gorsian Kadar Baksh village for setting up a dairy complex. The committee in December last year took the decision of shifting the dairies to Gorsian Kadar Baksh village and a report in this regard was sent to the principal secretary of department of local government, Punjab. During his visit, Sinha spoke to the villagers and met the sarpanch. Later, the officials also met district development and panchayat officer (DDPO) to discuss the modalities of transferring the land. As per information, there are over 400 dairy units in Haibowal dairy complex and around 130 in Tajpur road dairy complex. The administration has been contemplating shifting of these dairy units as their owners dump dairy waste and cow dung in the Buddha Nullah. Earlier, the state government had also planned to establish effluent treatment plants (ETP) to deal with the waste generated under the ₹650-crore project sanctioned by the state government. But the move was shelved and it was decided to shift the dairy units outside the city limits. On the other hand, Joginder Malhotra, general secretary of Tajpur road dairy owners’ association, demanded that arrangements to deal with dairy waste and cow dung should be made in these complexes. The plots should also be made available at reasonable prices, he stressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decks-cleared-for-shifting-dairy-units-out-of-ludhiana-city-limits-101614109602500.html

24-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department violating norms for promotion of faculty: UGC||Noting that the state higher education department was violating norms set by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for promotion of teachers, the apex body has sought the state’s response to complaints of irregularity in promotions through the Career Advancement System (CAS). In a letter to the director, higher education, issued on Sunday, the UGC said promotion and recruitment of teachers are governed by its regulations and are mandatory in nature. “All universities are advised to strictly comply with them and cannot be overlooked at any stage in any circumstances,” said the letter. While Dhanraj Mane, director, higher education, Maharashtra, was unavailable for comment, OP Gupta, principal secretary, higher and technical education department, refused to comment as he had not received the letter from the UGC. The UGC’s action is in response to a complaint received from the National Forum for Quality Education (NFQE)—a teachers’ association on the matter. In July last year, the NFQE along with the Prahar Vidhyarthi Sanghtna and All India NET and SET Teachers Organisation (AI-NASTO) had written to the UGC alleging the state higher education directorate was not promoting NET/ SET teachers despite competing tenure and being eligible for CAS. The teachers’ groups had alleged biased treatment and arbitrary promotion of faculty members that violate the guidelines set by the UGC, the central body governing all universities and colleges in the country. The UGC’s Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education Guidelines, 2018, makes provisions for recruitment and promotion of faculty under CAS. “Central assistance on account of the seventh pay commission is around ₹1,200 crore. The state may forfeit such huge financial assistance because of such contemptuous act of concern officials in promotion of faculty members in colleges and universities,” said Kushal Mude, convenor of AI-NASTO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-violating-norms-for-promotion-of-faculty-ugc-101614109362392.html

He also directed officials to work out how many departments can be given work-from-home facilities to reduce the number of employees visiting Mantralaya. “Let us work out a new way of working, with which we’ll be able to work in full capacity and the threat of coronavirus will also be less. All the Mantralaya unions must work together and see how two shifts can be made to carry out daily business,” he said in the meeting, as per a note from his office. The order from CM comes three days after he requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to look at formulating a policy for staggered working hours during the 6th Governing Council of Niti Aayog. During a meeting with representatives of Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers Federation and other Mantralaya unions held at his official residence Varsha, CM said that Mantralaya employees and officials must be treated as frontline workers and should be given priority in getting vaccinated. “Looking at the rising Covid-19 cases, all Mantralaya employees and officials must be treated as frontline workers and given priority in vaccination,” Thackeray further said. He also said that the temperature of all persons visiting Mantralaya should be checked and arrangements must be made for conducting antigen tests of those with symptoms. “There should be a permanent facility to conduct antigen tests. People who have come in contact or are infected will not be able to enter the premises,” the statement from his office added. GD Kulthe, chief advisor of the Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers Federation, welcomed CM’s decisions. “Having two shifts is largely possible and can be done in at least some of the departments. Such steps have to be taken looking at the situation. In the past two days, 75 employees have tested positive. We can have shifts from 8am to 2pm and 2pm to 7pm. We are deliberating on how it would be done,” Kulthe said. Vishnu Patil of the state government employees’ union, who was present in the meeting, also backed the idea. The state is also deliberating on limiting the number of visitors in Mantralaya. The number of visitors has increased in the last few months, Patil said, adding “We have demanded that visitors should be stopped for some time now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/work-out-two-shifts-for-mantralaya-staffers-maharashtra-cm-101614109302533.html

24-02-2021||Mumbai||School fee hike: Maharashtra education dept to form divisional fee panels this week||After receiving several complaints from parents about fee-related issues in private schools in the state, the education department has decided to constitute the divisional fee regulatory committees this week. A set of parents from across the state met state education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Monday and the minister assured them the government shall take strict action against schools which are found violating fee related norms. “We will act against schools wherein we have received complaints with respect to violation of rules. Similarly, as mentioned before, a committee is being formed to suggest changes and revisions in the state’s fee regulation act,” said Gaikwad in a statement issued on late Monday evening. The minister also promised parents that fee regulatory committees will be formed at the district and the state level to address complaints with respect to fees more effectively. The committees have been inactive since 2018 after the previous ones were dissolved.On February 18, HT had published a detailed analysis underlining the need to strengthen the state’s fee regulation act. Parents said they expected some concrete decisions from the meeting, but were majorly disappointed. “All we got were promises which have been given many times in the past too,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association. In 2018, the then BJP-led state government brought about an amendment in the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. The amendment allowed schools to hike fees by upto 15% once every two years. It also allowed schools to declare fees for the next 5-10 years when a child gets admission in Class 1, thus undermining the role of parents and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) in fee related decisions. The act was called out for its pro-privatisation and pro-management stance and its passage was followed by protests from parents across the state. While the resistance slowly faded away as the government turned a blind eye, the concerns raised then are now becoming major hurdles in addressing fee related disputes in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/school-fee-hike-maharashtra-education-dept-to-form-divisional-fee-panels-this-week-101614109062444.html

The statement from the minister came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) clarified that it has not certified any traditional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19.Patanjali launched the product on February 19 in the presence of Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari. On Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) expressed shock and dismay at what it called is a “blatant lie of WHO certification” for Patanjali’s Coronil tablet. The global health body had earlier tweeted that it had not given any certificate to Coronil. “WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment COVID-19,” the global health body said on February 19.Deshmukh, in a series of tweets on Tuesday, said that IMA has questioned the drug trials for Coronil, and WHO has refuted claims that it has certified it. He added that launching such drugs hurriedly and the endorsement by two Union ministers is “deplorable”.“The IMA has questioned the said ‘clinical trials’ of #Coronil & WHO refuted the false claims made by #Patanjali Ayurveda for giving any certificate regarding its effectiveness for #Covid19 treatment. Launching such a drug hurriedly and being endorsed by two senior Central Union Ministers is highly deplorable. Selling of #Coronil without proper certification from competent health organizations like #WHO, #IMA and others will not be allowed in Maharashtra,” Deshmukh tweeted.Meanwhile, Patanjali Ayurveda claimed that it has the proper certification from the relevant authorities to sell and export the product to 158 countries across the world. SK Tijarawala, spokesperson of Patanjali Ayurveda, said, “Coronil has received the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CoPP) from the Ayush section of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as per the WHO certification scheme. This empowers us to sell the product across 158 countries. The public is under the misconception that WHO has not certified it, but WHO never certifies any product. It sets a protocol for clinical control trials on modern medical parameters. Once that is cleared Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and Ayush Ministry gives its certificate, and we have those certificates. If the minister does not have this knowledge, we can give him proper details,” said Tijarawala. He claimed that Coronil is “declared to treat, prevent and deal with the effects of long-term corona”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wont-allow-sale-of-patanjali-s-coronil-without-proper-certification-maharashtra-min-101614108822379.html

The MMRDA has allocated ₹2,900.35 crore for the 22-km MTHL, expected to be operational by mid-2023. The authority has also allocated ₹100 crore for the proposed Swargiya Balasaheb Thackeray grand memorial and ₹260 crore for the Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial proposed at Indu Mills in Dadar. The budget amount is less than 2020-21 at ₹15,819 crore and 2019-20 ( ₹16,909 crore). The MMRDA officials said while the budgets for the last two years were higher, the revised estimates were much lower. For instance, the revised estimate for 2019-20 was ₹10,088.31 crore and for 2020-21 was ₹9,851.92 crore. “The February-March is the expected expenditure, however, the figures are revised periodically as per the actual expenditure,” said BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA. The authority has also revived a plan to construct a pedestrian bridge from City Park in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) to the Maharashtra Nature Park (MNP), for which it has allocated ₹77 crore. It has also allocated ₹120.20 crore for the Mumbai Monorail and ₹200 crore for the refurbishment of both, the Western Express Highway and Eastern Express Highway. It has allocated ₹60 crore for the Chheda Nagar improvement project. Another ₹60 crore has been allocated for the Kalanagar junction improvement project. While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the south-bound arm of the flyover, 80% of works have been completed on the rest of the project. The MMRDA has also allocated ₹405 crore for the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), a multi-phase plan to build new lines, expand the existing ones, replace aging trains and rebuild busy stations and ₹776.85 crore for the Mumbai Urban Infrastructure project (MUIP), that include road improvement projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-announces-12-969-35-crore-budget-for-mumbai-infra-works-101614108582636.html

The above areas however, reported a growth rate of more than 0.24%. Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Jogeshwari and Andheri top the list in terms of the highest number of active cases. According to the state health department data, there are 6,119 active cases in the city, as on Tuesday.BMC has attributed the steep rise to restarting of local trains for all, a large number of social gatherings such as weddings and non-compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour.While the daily numbers have gone up, the number of cases on a month-on-month basis is still less. According to BMC’s data, over 11,000 Covid-19 cases were reported from January 1-22, which went down to over 10,000 cases from February 1-22. Kishore Gandhi, assistant civic commissioner from Mulund, said, “Restarting of locals and weddings are general factors behind the rise. Another reason is that the maximum population in T ward, under which Mulund falls, resides in buildings. The city is currently getting new cases from here.”Ajit Kumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner, Ghatkopar, said, “In Ghatkopar, many cases have come up after people attended marriage functions. Also, as the citizens in Ghatkopar are from better socio-economic backgrounds, more families are also getting tested. This results in increase in cases.”In the case of Bandra, local Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said that citizens are flouting Covid-19 norms. “The reason for the spike in Bandra is mainly because people are conducting house parties and restaurants are packed. The onus lies on citizens also to follow Covid-appropriate rules,” said Zakaria.Meanwhile, on Tuesday the city reported 643 cases and eight deaths. This took the tally to 320,523 and toll to 11,454.The city’s recovery rate is 94.24% with 302,094 recoveries, while the mortality rate is 3.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bandra-chembur-khar-see-highest-growth-rate-in-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-101614108403470.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Five BJP corporators switch sides, Sangli civic body gets NCP mayor||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost some of its power in the Sangli civic body after at least five BJP corporators defected to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. In the mayoral election held on Tuesday, NCP nominee Digvijay Suryavanshi defeated BJP candidate Dhiraj Suryavanshi as five BJP corporators voted in favour of NCP, while other two others abstained from voting. Congress’ Umesh Patil was elected as deputy mayor.The result has come as a shock for the BJP as the party had a clear majority in the 78-member civic house of Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation. The BJP had won 41 members, while the NCP and the Congress had won 15 and 20 seats, respectively, in the corporation polls held in 2018. Two independent candidates also won the polls. Recently, with the death of Congress corporator Haroon Shikalgar, the party’s tally reduced to 19.Outgoing mayor Geeta Sutar’s term ended on February 21, and polling for the position was held on Tuesday. Digvijay Suryavanshi of the NCP received 39 votes against 37 for BJP’s Dhiraj Suryavanshi.Ahead of the election, BJP’s seven corporators went incommunicado, creating trouble for the party. The BJP had even sent the rest of the corporators to Goa to prevent the possibility of cross-voting.This is the second jolt to the BJP in western Maharashtra within two months after the legislative Council elections for Pune division graduates’ constituency held in December last year, in which NCP’s Arun Lad defeated BJP candidate Sangram Deshmukh by a margin of 48,824 votes.The defeat was embarrassing for the BJP as the seat got vacated after the party’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil was to assembly from the Kothrud constituency in Pune in the 2019 Assembly elections. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said that the BJP is going to be booted out from western Maharashtra and the results of the mayoral election of Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation proves the same. “The result of the Pune graduates’ constituency election was an indication that the BJP is going to be deported from western Maharashtra and today’s mayoral election results proved it. By accepting the MVA, the people of the state have made it clear that the BJP’s “achchhe din” (good days), a slogan used by the BJP during the general election held in 2014, will never come back in Maharashtra,” said Tapase.BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari alleged that the NCP misused power and money for cross-voting. “NCP engineered cross-voting by using power and money as they are desperate to come to power in local bodies. What they tried to do during the recently-held gram panchayat elections has been repeated in the mayoral polls of Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation. We will also be holding an internal probe to ascertain the cause of defeat and take further action accordingly,” said Bhandari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-bjp-corporators-switch-sides-sangli-civic-body-gets-congress-mayor-101614108343490.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC permits bail for ISIS recruit Areeb Majeed, rejects NIA’s appeal||Six years after being arrested for allegedly travelling to Syria to join the Islamic State (ISIS), Kalyan resident Areeb Majeed will finally be released on bail. The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday paved the way for Majeed’s release on bail after it rejected the appeal filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) challenging the March 2020 order of the special NIA court granting him bail.The HC said the special court’s decision to grant bail was based on the fact that the under-trial had already been detained for a long time and the trial would not be completed anytime soon. The HC, however, imposed strict conditions on Majeed and asked him to initially report to the local police station twice a day. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while pronouncing judgement in NIA’s appeal, observed that though the punishment for Majeed, if convicted, would be from five years to life imprisonment, the slow pace at which the trial was proceeding did not give any indication of it being completed any time soon, hence the special court order was upheld partly. “Looking at the pace with which about 51 witnesses have been examined, which took more than five years for the NIA court, there is clearly no likelihood of the trial being completed within a reasonable time in the near future. Therefore, we are of the opinion that on this aspect, no error can be attributed to the impugned judgment and order passed by the NIA Court, while holding in favour of the respondent,” observed the HC. Majeed was booked for offences punishable under section 125 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 16, 18 and 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, on November 28, 2014, and was arrested the next day. While in prison, he had applied for default bail which was rejected and his subsequent bail applications on merit were also rejected. It was only in March 2020 that the special NIA court had granted him bail on the grounds that he had already been in jail for six years and the trial would be delayed. NIA had then challenged the bail in the HC. The NIA, while challenging the bail, had submitted that there was no provision for bail under the UAPA, and the accused persons including the respondent (Majeed) formed an unlawful association to promote terrorism in Iraq, Syria and India. NIA, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, had submitted that Majeed had allegedly returned to India to carry out such terrorist acts in the country, including blowing up the Mumbai Police Headquarters. Singh had also argued that granting bail would impact the trial as 107 witnesses were yet to be examined. While answering to the objection of the NIA that the release of Majeed would prejudice the trial, the HC held that as the under-trial was well-educated, had observed proper decorum while arguing his case before the NIA court as well as the current bench, and had admitted that going to Syria was a mistake, imposing strict conditions would not be harmful to the society at large and would not adversely affect the trial proceedings before the NIA court. The court also observed that the family of the under-trial were well-educated. In light of these observations, and the Supreme Court order wherein it had stated that the rigours of the provisions of UAPA for granting bail would melt down where there was no likelihood of the trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone exceeded a substantial part of the prescribed sentence, provisions like section 43-D (5) of the UAPA could not be used for denial of bail, the HC upheld the NIA court order. While holding that the bail granted by the NIA court on merits was not sustainable, the HC said, “On the second aspect of the matter, pertaining to the long pendency of the trial and the respondent having already undergone incarceration for more than six years, we are inclined to uphold the impugned order on the said ground. Yet, we intend to impose further stringent conditions on the respondent while upholding his release on bail.” While ordering Majeeds release on a personal bond of ₹1 lakh, the court directed him to appear before the local police station twice a day for two months and thereafter once a day and so on. The court also restrained Majeed from speaking to the media about the trial and ordered him to cooperate for the expeditious completion of the trial. The court also asked Majeed to provide his residential address and surrender his passport to the police and warned that in the case of his failure to report to the police station, bail would be cancelled.Dr Ejaz Majeed, father of Areeb, while speaking to HT, said, “We are thankful to God for Areeb’s release and we are waiting for the formalities to be completed. It is too early to comment on how we are going to celebrate his return home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-permits-bail-for-isis-recruit-areeb-majeed-rejects-nia-s-appeal-101614108342374.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Second leopard at Mumbai’s SGNP gets a radio collar||A six-year-old male leopard at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) was radio-collared and released into the wild on Monday. Earlier on Saturday, Savitri became the first leopard in Mumbai to be radio-collared, named after the social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule. This is a part of the first phase of leopard radio-collaring work being carried out at SGNP, which is aimed at tracking and understanding the animal’s movement, said park director, G Mallikarjuna. A total of five leopards will be radio-collared in the first phase. The leopard, radio-collared on Monday, has been named Maharaj after Chhatrapati Shivaji. The two-year-long project to radio-collar leopards was initiated in 2018 when the park authorities signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Wildlife Conservation Society – India (WCS). “We are hoping that this activity will help us understand leopards better,” said Mallikarjuna.The collars work by sending signals via satellite, which researchers can then use to investigate where the animal is and what it is doing.The key goals of this project are to obtain knowledge on how humans and leopards interact with each other, and how each adapts to the presence of the other. The collars will help gather information on how leopards move across major roads such as Ghodbandar Road and understand their use of space and time in the SGNP landscape. This data will then help provide management recommendations concerning the way these big cats move in the landscape and conflict mitigation based on the results of the study.Dr Vidya Athreya, from WCS, said, “This project at SGNP will give us more insights as in Mumbai, a high density of people lives in such close proximity to big cats. It will also help us track their pathway and understand how they cross busy roads such as the Ghodbunder Road. This will then help us manage them better to bring down mortality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-leopard-at-mumbai-s-sgnp-gets-a-radio-collar-101614108223530.html

But the account holder concerned had never issued the cheques,” said a police officer from Powai police station.On checking the records, the involvement of two bank employees surfaced. An inquiry revealed that a scale 1 officer Pawan Tankala and clerk Harshada Bhosale were behind these siphoning off of funds.The bank manager Tiwari then approached the police. The police have booked Tankala and Bhosale under sections 408 (criminal breach of trust by an employee), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.

24-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress decides to adopt aggressive approach; to press for separate state farm law||Maharashtra Congress on Tuesday decided to adopt an aggressive approach, in a bid to regain its old glory in the state, and press for separate laws for farmers to negate the contentious farm laws passed by the Centre. It also plans to push for reservation for Muslims and expose the Narendra Modi government on its failure on various fronts, including rising fuel and domestic gas prices.The party, in its parliamentary board meeting on Tuesday, also decided to take a call on joining hands with the two other ruling parties for the local body elections.The newly appointed parliamentary board comprising of 32 members met for its first meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday. The meeting under the chairmanship of Maharashtra president Nana Patole was attended by party state in-charge HK Patil, party’s legislative leader Balasaheb Thorat, former chief ministers Ashok Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde, Prithviraj Chavan, state ministers, among others.In a bid to strengthen its base, the party leaders decided to launch Sankalp Abhiyan, an outreach program under which leaders will reach out to the voter base, including farmers.“Under the Sankalp Abhiyan to be implemented for the next six months, state leaders will go to the people and farmers and explain about the anti-people policies of the Modi government. We will explain the gravity of the farm laws passed by the Centre. We have asked the leaders to stay with the farmers and the common people during the campaign,” said Patil.The board also passed four resolutions on contentious issues related to the people. The party passed resolutions demanding revocation of the farm laws passed by the Centre and creation of separate farm laws in the state, disbursement of funds for statutory boards in the state, and rightful reservation to Marathas and Muslims. They also passed a resolution for the allocation of funds for OBCs, VJNT and other backward classes.Patole said that the contentious farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year, have to be opposed strongly by Congress, but they will press for separate farm law in Maharashtra to safeguard the interest of the farmers. “We will not allow the central law to be implemented in the state. Congress will press for the separate law in Maharashtra to negate the central laws,” he said.Five municipal corporations, two district councils and more than 90 nagar panchayats will face polls in the next few months. The board discussed the alliance with other ruling parties. Patole said that the decision about the alliance will be taken by talking to the local leaders in respective local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-decides-to-adopt-aggressive-approach-to-press-for-separate-state-farm-law-101614108162341.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC seeks survey report of Banganga Tank allegedly affected by construction activities||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, government of Maharashtra, to conduct a survey of the Banganga Tank at Malabar Hill — a state-protected heritage structure, after the trust responsible for the tank alleged that piling and construction activities undertaken by developers nearby had affected the natural underground water, flowing into the tank.The directions were issued after the court was informed that construction activities were permitted provided the developers fulfilled eight conditions laid down by the directorate. The survey report has to be submitted to the court in a sealed cover on March 1.On Monday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a petition filed by the board of trustees of the Temples Charitable Institution and Funds of Gaud Saraswat Brahman Community, which takes care of the administration of the Walkeshwar temple and the Banganga Tank in the temple complex, was informed by advocate Devendra Rajapurkar that the tank was a state-protected monument and a grade-I heritage structure. Rajapurkar submitted that the extensive piling and construction activity undertaken by developers near the tank was severely affecting the monument and the underground water streams flowing into the tank were being contaminated. He also submitted that there was an inflow of muddy water as well as accumulation of mud in the water of the tank in huge quantity.The court was informed that the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums had issued a stop-work notice to the developers as they had failed to get permissions to commence piling and construction work. Senior advocate Dr Milind Sathe for the developers, however, submitted that after the stop-work order was issued the developers had submitted a proposal and reports of technical experts to the directorate. After perusal and scrutiny of the same, on January 22, 2021, the directorate had lifted the stop-work order and permitted the resumption of piling and construction work provided the developers fulfilled eight conditions laid down by it. Dr Sathe added that the development activities were being carried out in strict compliance with the conditions.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the issues raised in the petition were serious, the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums should depute an officer to undertake a survey of the tank and ascertain whether the allegations made by the trust were true and whether the developers were complying with the eight conditions.The court also directed that the officer should also ascertain whether the quality of water in the tank was being affected by the development activities and to submit a report of the above directions in a sealed cover and posted the hearing of the petition on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaihc-seeks-survey-report-of-banganga-tank-allegedly-affected-by-construction-activities-101614107982443.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Lack of penetration does not mean it wasn’t rape, says Bombay HC||Reiterating that lack of penetration does not necessarily mean that there was no rape, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday upheld a 10-year prison term handed down to a 74-year-old resident of Paithan in Aurangabad district, for raping his adopted daughter.According to the prosecution case, the survivor was alone at home with the accused on December 16, 2016, as her adoptive mother had gone out of town to attend a wedding. She alleged that she woke up in the night, as the 74-year-old started touching her inappropriately.He then undressed and also forcibly removed her clothes and tried to penetrate but could not. She further alleged that the next night, he again sexually assaulted her, but could not penetrate.In this backdrop, Paithan police swung into action and arrested the man after the survivor disclosed her ordeal to one of her teachers, who then reported the matter to the police. The 74-year-old was prosecuted for raping the minor.On July 10, 2019, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted him for rape and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was, however, let off in all the Pocso charges, as the prosecution failed to prove the age of the survivor, who was reportedly 14 years old at the time of the attack.The convict had moved the HC in appeal. It was argued on his behalf that the girl was being used by his wife’s brothers to settle their personal scores over a property dispute. His lawyer submitted that there was no evidence of rape as even the survivor said there was no penetration.The single-judge bench of justice MG Sewlikar, however, refused to accept the contention. The judge noted that the medical evidence suggested that there was no penetration, but the girl was candid enough to admit it and did not try to improve her version.The court quoted the Supreme Court’s view reflected in Tarakeshwar Sahu’s case of 2006, holding that the word penetrate means “to find access into or through, pass through” and held that in the case at hand, penetration was complete so far as the convict was concerned. In this regard, the court took note of the fact that semen stains were found not only on the clothes of the 74-year-old but also on the clothes of the survivor.“From the observations made in this decision by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, even an attempt at penetration into the private part of the victim would be enough to attract the provisions of sections 375 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said justice Sewlikar. “It is evident that even if there is no penetration, it does not necessarily mean that there was no rape,” the single judge bench reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lack-of-penetration-does-not-mean-it-wasn-t-rape-says-bombay-hc-101614107862188.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Ramp up Covid-19 safety efforts to September 2020 level, Uddhav tells MMR||Amid concern over the spike in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday directed Mumbai as well as other civic bodies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to ensure that its preparation and infrastructure should be at par with their efforts in September last year — the peak of the outbreak. He also asked the civic bodies to ensure strict implementation of Covid-19 protocol rather than imposing more curbs such as lockdown to contain the spread of the virus, reiterating that he was not keen on re-imposing a lockdown.Thackeray held a review meeting with the commissioners of MMR’s nine municipal corporations on Tuesday in the wake of the upsurge over the past two weeks. Further, he held a separate meeting to discuss the situation in Mumbai. The civic bodies have been told to take the upsurge very seriously and not to tolerate laxity in mitigation measures. The municipal corporations have also been told to ramp up health infrastructure to match the capacity of the beds seen during the peak of the pandemic in September last year.Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported fewer cases for a second consecutive day after a spike in cases over the earlier three days. A total of 6,218 new cases and 51 deaths were reported on Tuesday, taking the state tally to 2,112,313 and toll to 51,857. Like in the state, Mumbai reported a drop in cases for a second consecutive day by reporting 643 cases, taking the tally to 320,532 and the toll to 11,454 with eight new deaths reported on Tuesday. Pune city remained on top in the daily caseload on Tuesday by logging 679 cases, while other major cities like Nagpur city (544), Amravati city (515)continued to report a high number of cases. According to state officials, the municipal corporations have also been directed to take strict actions against managements violating norms at super-spreader events like wedding ceremonies by taking criminal action against them. They have also been told to ensure that the people follow Covid- appropriate behaviour stringently.“People in these cities, surrounding the financial capital of the country, are not in favour of another lockdown, which may badly hamper the economy and livelihood. The state government also wants to resort to imposing curbs as a last resort after tapping into another measures. As part of it, the CM has asked the local bodies for preventive measures such as penalising people for not wearing masks, overcrowding at public places and violating the protocol. Crowding in limited numbers would be fine if people followed Covid-appropriate behaviour and help contain the spread. The corporations have been directed to get their act together in this direction,” said an official from the health department.Meanwhile, ICMR’s director general Dr Balram Bhargawa clarified in his weekly briefing that there was no direct link between the recent surge in cases in Maharashtra and other states and mutant virus strains N440K and E484Q of Covid-19. “These two strains have been detected in other countries too and are not specific to India. The E484Q strain was earlier detected in four sequences in Maharashtra as early as March and July last year. N440K mutation was reported on 13 difference occasions between May and September last year in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. The Maharashtra upsurge cannot be attributed to the currently discussed point mutations. The situation is, however, constantly monitored,” the ICMR statement stated. The upsurge in five districts (Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana) of Vidarabha was 306% in two weeks as the daily caseload rose to 1,364 on February 22, from 705 on February 8. It was 429% (52 to 275 cases) in two weeks in four districts of Aurangabad (Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli), the district which share boundaries with Vidarbha. During the period, the rise was 189% (327 to 946 cases) in other six districts of Eastern Vidarbha, while it was just 57% in five districts (Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Ahmedabad and Jalgaon).The upsurge reported in MMR, which comprise nine cities, including Mumbai and Thane, was 93% (daily caseload rose from 705 to 1,364) between February 8 and February 22. It was 91% in Pune division (Pune, Solapur and Satara districts) during this period.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state government’s advisor on Covid-19, said the upsurge witnessed in western Vidarbha can spread out to other parts if micro containment measures were not taken. “Initially the transmission was from cities like Mumbai, Pune to peripheral and rural areas and took about 5-6 months, but this time it is from rural areas and may take only one month. It is spreading to the neighbouring districts of Marathwada from Vidarbha and if the micro containment measures are not taken, it will spread rapidly to other areas. If it spread rapidly to other parts, we will have to go for the lockdown and bring back the number of commuters in trains down by restricting them only to essential services,” he said.More districts imposed curbs on movement in the wake of the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. After Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal in Vidarbha, Jalna district administration announced to keep schools and colleges (except Class 10 and 12) and weekly markets shut till March 31. The district administration has also decided to conduct antigen tests on super spreaders. Meanwhile, the turnout for the vaccination drive improved on Tuesday as 42,319 heath care workers and front line workers were inoculated at 671 centres across the state. The total number of beneficiaries stands at 948,483, including 634,865 HCWs and 313,618 FLWs. Of them, 79,788 are HCWs who have been given a second dose of the vaccine.Additional municipal commissioner of BMC, Suresh Kakani, said, “We are approaching summer season, which required more use of air-conditioning units, water coolers. Due to this, we should not find ourselves at the receiving end of an untoward incident in the middle of a pandemic.”Kakani said that the upsurge in Mumbai is also because of the rise in the number of commuters to more than 2 million after travel was allowed to all from February 1.The chief minister also directed BMC to strengthen its vigilance system to ensure Covid-19 rules are followed at public places and at public gatherings, wedding ceremonies, bars, pubs, restaurants, and gardens. “We have been asked to take the list of all bookings at marriage halls, banquet halls, gymkhanas, and cinema halls, for any kinds of gatherings. This will make it easier to regulate them by organising frequent inspections at the time of the ceremonies or gatherings, the CM said” according to Kakani.BMC aims to generate support from Mumbaiites to ensure everyone is wearing masks, instead of relying on clean-up marshals alone to fine people not wearing face masks. BMC will now start more awareness campaigns across the city. A senior civic officer said, “If someone is not wearing a mask in a local train, his fellow passengers should point out to him that it is important to wear a masks. We need to build more awareness in people.”As of Tuesday, Mumbai has 13,131 beds for symptomatic covid-19 patients, 1559 ICU beds, and 8,057 oxygen beds, which will be increased in the coming week. Kakani also said that they have aggravated action against people who violated Covid-19 protocol. “We took action against 23,000 people and establishments today, against 15,000 yesterday, for not wearing masks, allowing consumers more than the allotted percentage.

Delkar was found dead in a hotel in south Mumbai on Monday afternoon.The senior police officer said that Delkar has left behind a 15-pages suicide note which he had written on his official letterhead. The initial inquiry revealed that the handwriting in the letter is his, however, the police have roped in the handwriting expert for establishing the same.“A team of forensic expert visited the place of the incident and scanned the entire place. Also, a panel of doctors conducted the post-mortem at the Sir JJ Hospital and concluded the cause of death as a suicide. A detailed report is awaited,” the officer said. Police sources said that the doctors have opined that the MP may have taken the extreme step early in the morning on Monday.The body has been handed over to the family for final rituals. As the family is in grief, we have not called them for enquiry. But we will speak to them soon and record their statement if required, the officer added.Police sources said that Delkar has named few people in the suicide note claiming they were harassing him. However, the police are tight-lipped about the content of his suicide note. Delkar had come to Mumbai on Sunday evening from Silvasa as he had some case in Bombay high court.Delkar and his driver Ashok Patel had stayed at the fifth-floor rooms in the Hotel. On Monday at around noon, the driver knocked Delkar’s room’s door. On getting no response he informed the hotel management who tried to open the door using spare keys, but in vain as the door was locked from inside. Delkar’s driver then called his employer’s family and informed them. They tried to contact him by calling on his cell phone, but in vain. “Delkar’s driver, who stayed at the next room, went to his room’s gallery and by climbing the pipeline entered Delkar’s room whose gallery window was open. The driver discovered Delkar was hanging by the ceiling using his shawl. And then the police were informed at around 2pm,” said a police officer.Police are also checking the CCTVs of the hotel to know if anyone met him on Sunday night, and are scanning the phone call details of Delkar, his WhatsApp chats, and also checking with whom he spoke to last time before taking the extreme step. The police, for now, have registered an accidental death report and is further investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/postmortem-report-confirms-mp-mohan-delkar-died-by-suicide-mumbai-police-101614107682061.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Virar,Thane bullet train stations realigned to save mangroves, NHSRCL to HC||The Bombay high court on Tuesday accepted the submission by the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), wherein it was informed, that as per the request of the state and central environment ministries, they have decided to bring down the number of mangroves that needed to be removed for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. The corporation further informed that though the number of mangroves to be cut in Thane, Mumbai and Palghar districts to make way for the project was more than halved, the undertaking of the compensatory plantation would not be reduced and around 2.6 lakh mangroves would be planted. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the interim application in the writ petition filed by the NHSRCL, was informed by advocate Prahlad Paranjpe that as per the directions of the Maharashtra State Coastal Zone Management (MCZMA) and ministry of environment, forest and climate change, to reduce the number of mangroves to be removed for the bullet train project, the corporation had realigned the Virar and Thane bullet train stations. The directions were issued on March 29, 2019. Earlier in 2019, the NHSRCL had filed a writ petition in the Bombay HC seeking permission to cut 53,467 mangroves that were present on the 155-km stretch of the 508-km long corridor which passed through the coastal region of Maharashtra. The mangroves that were sought to be cut were situated over a stretch of 21-23 km of coastal land and over which the elevated line would pass. While making submissions in the application, Paranjpe submitted that following the directions of the authorities the number of mangroves to be removed was brought down to 21,997 which was achieved by realigning the Virar and Thane bullet train stations. Paranjpe further submitted that though the number of mangroves to be cut was brought down the corporation would abide by its previous commitment of afforestation in the ratio of 1:5 and would be planting 2.6 lakh mangroves as a compensatory plantation. He further submitted that in light of this the NHSRCL wanted to amend the number of mangroves sought to be removed in the petition as well, hence the same should be allowed. As none of the contesting parties which included the state of Maharashtra, MCZMA and MoEFCC objected, the court allowed the amendment and directed NHSRCL to amend the petition and said that it would hear the petition next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-virar-thane-bullet-train-stations-realigned-to-save-mangroves-nhsrcl-to-hc-101614107442452.html
24-02-2021||Mumbai||Autos, taxi drivers must get meters recalibrated by May 30: Maharashtra government||As minimum fares of autorickshaws and black-and-yellow taxis are set to increase from March 1, the state government has given autorickshaw and taxi owners till May 30 to get their meters recalibrated. There are 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis and 2,00,000 autorickshaws operating in Mumbai. The meters of these vehicles are calibrated based on tariffs fixed by the authorities. Every time the fare is revised, meters must be recalibrated, which only certain vendors are authorised to do by the transport authorities. In the past, all autorickshaws and taxis could not be recalibrated in the stipulated period, which led to disputes between commuters and drivers. On Monday, the Maharashtra government announced that the minimum fare of autorickshaws would increase from ₹18 to ₹21. Thereafter, the per-kilometre rate will increase to ₹14.20 from the present ₹12.19. Similarly, the minimum fare of black-and-yellow taxis will increase from ₹22 to ₹25. Thereafter the per-kilometre rate will increase to ₹16.93 from ₹14.84. The government has given vehicle owners and drivers till May 30 to recalibrate their meters. “The price hike will be implemented from March 1. Autorickshaw and taxi drivers will have to get their meters calibrated by May 30. From June 1, the updated fare should be visible in meter readings,” said state transport minister Anil Parab. Autorickshaw and taxi drivers and owners have questioned if the May 30 deadline is feasible. “There are limited centres for calibration and testing. The testing of metres is also a time-consuming process, which will lead to delay in the calibration and testing work,” said Akhlakh Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver and resident of Vikhroli. Autorickshaw unions have said the government is likely to set up additional testing centres to facilitate the recalibration process. “During the previous fare hikes, temporary set-ups for testing meters were made by the government. This is likely to happen this time as well. The recalibration can be done instantly, but the testing of the meters takes time. All autorickshaws in the city should be recalibrated by June.” said Shashank Rao, leader, Mumbai AutorickshawMen’s Union. The state transport department said on Tuesday that it would ensure all autorickshaw and taxi meters are recalibrated and tested by May 30. “The department will make sure and undertake steps to recalibrate all autorickshaws and taxis by the deadline,” said state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, which works to safeguard the interests of consumers, has written to Parab suggesting the fare hike be postponed by six months. It has also asked the government to reconsider the fare hike for the per-kilometre rate. “The Panchayat has asked the government to reconsider the decision of per kilometre increase of ₹2.09 for autorickshaw and ₹2.01 for taxis. Rickshaw and taxi fares have not increased in the last five years. There is no doubt that this fare hike is mandatory. Rickshaw and taxi owners need financial assistance in this current difficult situation. However, the entire economy has come to a standstill and many have lost their jobs and many are facing salary cuts. As the purchasing power of the average consumer is drastically reduced, the daily consumption of autorickshaw and taxis by the customers will naturally decrease,” says the letter written by Shirish Deshpande, chairman, Mumbai Grahak Panchayat. The Panchayat in its letter has also a revision in a fare increase. “To achieve the objective of increasing the income of autorickshaw and taxi drivers, one rupee increase in per kilometre fare could be given and in rest per kilometres 75 paise increase. The government should implement the fare hike in two phases. Further, the minimum fare could be increased by ₹2 instead of ₹3 and the per kilometre money increase should be suspended for a year,” says the Panchayat in its letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/autos-taxi-drivers-must-get-meters-recalibrated-by-may-30-maharashtra-government-101614107322389.html

Travel pass is a digital process of travel which will eliminate the lengthy physical documentation work, thereby saving time for passengers, airport operators as well as the airlines.“Travel pass enables passengers to create a ‘digital passport’, verify their (Covid-19) test/vaccination, meets the regulations and share test or vaccination certificates with authorities to facilitate travel. It also enables passengers to find accurate information on travel, testing and (eventually) vaccine requirements for their journey,” IATA said on Tuesday.IATA carried out trial runs for travel pass app with Singapore Airlines in the last quarter of 2020. This year, it carried out trials with airlines like Emirates, Qatar Airways amongst others. After running these trials, IATA has declared to globally roll out the travel pass from next month.IATA said its travel pass is a digital solution that addresses challenges of fraud paper certificates and hence has been built with data security, convenience and verification as top priorities.As per IATA, integrated registry of travel requirements in the app will help passengers in getting precise information on travel and entry requirements for all destinations. It will also include a registry of laboratories and in due course it will also provide details of nearby vaccination centres. This will make it more convenient for passengers to find testing centres and labs at their departure city which would meet the requirements of their destination.The association also said that this platform will also enable verified labs and test centres to securely send test results or vaccination certificates to passengers.Specifying the importance of using the travel pass, IATA said, “The travel pass is modular and interoperable, it is based on standards, it is proven and trusted.”The association also said the travel pass can be used for contactless travel – that will continue long even after the pandemic. Assuring privacy in the travel pass app, IATA also said that passengers will have the sole right to share their data and they can delete their data anytime on their app.BOX:Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has facilitated the distribution of approximately 43 million doses of vaccines to 8.5 million doses in India and 34.5 million doses across the globe. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented by the airport saw the terminal register an average cargo processing time of just 10 minutes for domestic delivery and 25 minutes for international (right from goods acceptance to dispatch at the ramp). CSMIA has distributed approximately 113 tons of vaccines to over 57 destinations. This includes over 29 international and 28 domestic destinations. The city airport also witnessed the highest export of vaccines to Dhaka (nine million doses), followed by Morocco (with six million doses) and Brazil (with four million doses).On the domestic front, a total of 2.1 million doses of vaccines were distributed to Raipur, Cochin and Guwahati.

Indore, which has 660 active cases, highest in MP, is witnessing another wave of Covid-19 infection as in the past two weeks the number of positive cases jumped by 82 per cent on Monday.The local district administration and health officials said the situation is under control but it can turn from bad to worse if people don’t get alert.The cases increased as people are not following the home isolation rules and visiting public places in large numbers without masks. People are also not maintaining social distancing, said Manish Singh, collector Indore.Covid-19 contact tracing in-charge, Dr Anil Dongre said, “The number of cases is increasing as many families are getting infected with the virus. At least 10-12 families are testing positive for the infection daily. They even don't follow Covid-19 protocols. Sometimes, we received complaints of people not following home isolation and roaming outside.”Also read: Rakesh Tikait holds out threat of Parliament siege if farm laws are not repealed“Recently, more than 20 people got infected after attending a party. How we will stop them? If people don’t get serious, the condition can turn serious like April and October last year when the positivity rate was recorded 12-13 per cent," he added.A resident, Ekta Yadav, who raised the issue of violation of home isolation in her locality a few days ago, said, “People are not showing seriousness about Covid-19. They might be fortunate that they didn't get affected due to the infection but they should at least think of others. Even, the administration and police stopped penalising people for violating guidelines.”Jitendra Singh Yadav, a social worker from Indore, said, “It is easy to blame people but the authorities will not accept that they were not doing anything to ensure the implementation of guidelines. People get serious only when authorities showed seriousness about any issue.”Indore has registered the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in Madhya Pradesh along with those getting infected from the virus. As many as 931 patients died while 58,860 cases have been reported so far from Indore.According to the Madhya Pradesh health department report, as many as 259,721 positive cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/authorities-blame-locals-after-indore-witnesses-spurt-in-covid-19-cases-101614106151010.html

24-02-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula court issues attachment warrant to SBI branch||For failing to comply with an order of paying compensation, the Panchkula civil court has issued a warrant regarding attachment of movable property to a State Bank of India (SBI) branch here.Panchkula civil judge (senior division) Hitesh Garg stated in his order that “SBI through its branch manager was ordered by the court to pay plaintiff Anil Kumar an amount of ₹32,000, but the sum has not been paid.”“These are to command you to attach the movable property of the SBI through its branch manager, R/o SCO 14, Sector 10, Panchkula, as set forth in the schedule hereunto annexed, or which shall be pointed out to you by the said SBI through branch manager,” the order mentions.The court has directed to return this warrant on or before March 15, 2020, with an endorsement certifying the day on which and manner in which it has been executed or why it has not been executed.In August 2018, the court had ordered that the petitioner having an account with the SBI had obtained a housing loan from the PNB Housing Finance Limited. He wanted to settle the loan within a short span of time, hence he issued cheque of May 25 that year in favour of PNB Housing Finance Limited amounting to ₹15 lakh from his account maintained with the respondent.However, the said cheque was dishonoured with remarks “kindly contact drawer/drawee bank and please present again”, the court stated. The bank also imposed a penalty. Later, the plaintiff sent the amount from another account.The court observed that since the applicant has enough deposit in his account to honour the cheque, by dishonouring it, the respondent (bank) has adopted unfair practice, which amounts to deficiency in service.This petition was opposed by the bank, which stated that the cheque was sent to the centralised clearing cell of SBI, Sector 17, Chandigarh, and the same was returned by the clearing cell.In the same year, the court had passed the award in favour of the petitioner and directed the respondent to pay ₹20,000 as compensation and ₹11,000 as litigation expenses.However, the bank did not comply with the order, following which the court issued the attachment warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-court-issues-attachment-warrant-to-sbi-branch-101614106122557.html
24-02-2021||City||Odisha woman arrested for marrying multiple men through different Aadhaar ID||A 32-year-old woman of Odisha's Sundargarh district has been arrested by police in Kalahandi district on charges of marrying multiple men and duping them.Kalahandi superintendent of police Dr Vivek M Saravana said the police arrested Elee Mahanta of Sundargarh district following complaints that she married at least three men after the death of her husband."She assumed multiple names after the death of her husband Kumudbandhu Patel in 2011. She then prepared an Aadhaar card in the name of Sindhumati Munda in September 2013 and married a person named Rajendra Das the same month. After the marriage, she visited her relatives at village Sarangarh of Chhatisgarh where she met a 51-year-old woman named Manju alias Mina Gutpa who taught her how to cheat people in the name of marriage," said Saravana.A few years later, she divorced Das and got a new Aadhaar card in the name of Elee Mahanta in May 2018. She again married another person.Also read: BJP's Rakesh Singh, named by Pamela Goswami in drugs case, arrested in KolkataIn June 2020, she again got a new Aadhar card made in the name of Mamata Agarwal and married a man called Bikash Jain of Kalahandi district in October. “Her associate, Birbal Sharma, played the role of a mediator in the marriage and took ₹4 lakh from Bikash's family members as his mediation fees. The gang also arranged a visit of the groom's family to Sundargarh and made it look like as if she belonged to some Marwari family," said the SP.Police said the modus operandi of the gang was to target elderly or divorced men. "While Elee used to be the prospective bride, the three others used to act as her mother, father and uncle. They used to share the loot. When we raided the place, we found all of them there," said the SP.The investigating officer of the case, Binita Toppo, said from the preliminary investigation it has been found that the woman married four times. "We suspect the number may rise further. Many people, who were cheated by them, are not approaching us fearing social stigma. We urge them to register a complaint,” said Toppo.Apart from Mahant, others who were arrested include Birbal Sharma (60), Manju alias Mina Gupta (51) and Sraban Soni (36).Police officials said the case seemed to be straight out of Sonam Kapoor-starrer 2015 Bollywood movie 'Dolly ki Doli' wherein Dolly, a young con artist, marries men from different religions and runs away with their wealth on the night of the wedding. Her entire family consisted of con artists. After conning several rich men, she gets media attention and labels her as "looteri dulhan".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-woman-arrested-for-marrying-multiple-men-through-different-aadhaar-id-101614105900757.html

We will consult medical experts and decide as the situation develops.”After showing a downward trend, the number of weekly cases jumped from 131 between February 8 and 14 to 187 between February 15 and 21 — an increase of 43%. This is coupled with a steady rise in the number of active cases, which crossed the 200 mark on Monday for the first time in a month. The city’s weekly positivity rate has also seen an uptick from 1.4% to 1.9%.In Punjab, which too has seen a significant surge, the government has restricted the number of attendees at indoor gatherings to 100 and outdoor ones to 200 from March 1. The state government also directed deputy commissioners to impose nigh curfew in hot spots, if required.Ruling out the night curfew in Chandigarh, Parida said: “We have taken a soft approach so far, and succeeded in controlling the pandemic in the city. We will follow the same approach.” However, the administration, if required, could impose restrictions on gatherings.More focus on vaccinationParida said the administration’s focus would be on vaccination for now. “We have health facilities to control the spread. For increasing the vaccination rate in the city, we will step up the awareness campaign. It is already being done in different departments,” he said.The administration is also examining several steps being taken in other states for increasing the participation of frontline workers in taking the vaccination. Options, such as allowing one-day leave for vaccination or restricting financial help extended to employees in case of infection if they have skipped the shot, are also on the table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-surge-in-covid-cases-chandigarh-admn-mulls-curbs-101614105942252.html
24-02-2021||Noida||Greater Noida resident loses ₹1 lakh to man posing as friend||Greater Noida: A man has been allegedly duped of ₹1 lakh by an unidentified person who impersonated as his friend and asked for the money on the pretext of a medical emergency. Niranjan Kumar Saini, a resident of a high-rise in Greater Noida West, has filed a complaint at Bisrakh police station. According to Saini, someone contacted him last week over phone and identified himself as his old friend “Sharma ji”. “I knew Sharma Ji for several years. He is a good person and owns a factory in Noida Sector 10. The caller said that one of his family members was injured in an accident and is admitted to a private hospital in Gurugram,” he said.Saini said that the caller informed him he had brought ₹2.5 lakh cash and he needed some more money. “He asked me to pay ₹20,000 through a UPI ID for medical bills. I believed him as his voice resembled to Sharma Ji and I made the payment,” Saini said. The suspect again called and said that the charges of tests are high and he needed more money. “I paid ₹85,000 to the person in multiple transactions. Next morning, I again transferred ₹15,000 to the suspect’s account online,” he said.The complainant said he smelled foul play when the suspect said that he had not received ₹15,000. “The suspect sent me an unscrupulous URL and asked to click to recover the unsuccessful transaction amount. I shifted my account’s rest of the amount to my another account and then clicked the link. I found that the link was meant to steal money from my account,” Saini said.Later, he contacted his friend Sharma Ji to enquire about the matter and found that he had not made any such request. Police registered a case against an unidentified person on Monday. Munish Chauhan, station house officer of Bisrakh police station, said, “A case has been registered under Section 66-D of IT Act.

24-02-2021||Noida||Yamuna pollution impacting avifauna at Okhla Bird Sanctuary, says Noida forest department||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department has urged the irrigation department of the Delhi government to ensure that sewage generated in the national capital is treated before being discharged in Yamuna, stating that the “excessive pollution” in the river is causing adverse impact on avifauna at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS).Officials from the forest department have said the number of migrant birds at the sanctuary -- situated along the downstream of Yamuna -- has dropped due to the pollution in the river. They suggested to the Delhi irrigation department to build sewage treatment plants to minimise the “adverse impact” on the habitat health.The officials said that while the forest department is yet to get the water samples from sanctuary tested to assess its quality, the wetland has started to stink and the presence of oil and grease in the water is visible.“Thousands of migrant birds arrive at the 400-hectare lake in the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. Sewage from several drains is released every day into Yamuna causing adverse impact on the birds here. Due to the excessive pollution in the river, the birds are leaving the sanctuary. It is thus requested to ensure that all the drains are treated using sewage treatment plants prior to their release in the river so that waterbirds are not affected,” PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar, has said in a letter (dated February 22) to the Delhi irrigation department. According to the Asian Waterbird Census-2021, the number of birds at OBS went down to 8,068 against 8,776 last year and 12,212 in 2019. The water quality of the river around Okhla barrage has been worsening. As per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC’s) report, the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in Yamuna are nil since 2018. The DPCC report also pointed out that biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), the minimum oxygen levels required to decompose the chemicals present in the water was ten times the standards in November 2020. The UP forest department also in February last year had the water samples from the sanctuary tested and found that the DO levels at the sanctuary were well below the required norms. The BOD at OBS in February 2020 was 14mg/l while at Okhla barrage it was 58 mg/l in the same month, against the standard limit of 3 mg/l.Spread over 400 hectares, of which 80% is water body formed due to the Okhla barrage build over Yamuna river, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary is home to a number of water and terrestrial birds and is Noida’s only eco-sensitive zone.“There is no source of pollution in the sanctuary. There are about 19 drains in Delhi which release effluents directly into the Yamuna and the pollutants reach here without being treated. Due to this, the wetland’s water is polluted,” said Arvind Mishra, regional forest officer at the sanctuary.Officials of the Delhi irrigation department could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Stating that healthy bird population is a direct indicator of the habitat health, Delhi-based conservationist Bikram Grewal stated that water quality has direct impact on the bird population.“If the water is polluted due to presence of chemicals, oil, etc., then it will definitely have impact on the avifauna especially the waterbirds. Due to high level of pollution in Yamuna, there are several indicator bird species which are not seen anymore. Now, we don’t see species like skimmer and osprey, which is an eagle that fishes in fresh water, around Delhi,” said Grewal.Environment activist and Manoj Mishra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, an organisation founded to revive and protect the river and its floodplains, said that Yamuna after Wazirabad in Delhi is “nothing but a lifeless nallah”.“The water that one sees at the Okhla sanctuary is not Yamunua’s water but is sewage being generated from houses and industries of Delhi. Question is how much someone would treat a sewage. The river is anyways lifeless because it still continues to receive untreated sewage and effluents,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yamuna-pollution-impacting-avifauna-at-okhla-bird-sanctuary-says-noida-forest-department-101614105280998.html
24-02-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad to increase Covid-19 testing by 25%||Ghaziabad: Considering the recent spike in coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in several states and the re-imposition of stricter restrictions, the district health department in Ghaziabad has decided to ramp up Covid-testing by about 25% as a precautionary measure. Officials said they have received directions to ensure quality testing, tracking and contact tracing as part of Covid-19 management.Since last year up to Tuesday, the Ghaziabad district has registered a total of 26,727 Covid-19 cases, as per the state control room figures of February 21. This figure includes 102 deaths and 68 active cases. The testing in the district has seen a decline with a daily average of 2,014 tests conducted up to February so far, 2,433 in January, 3,323 in December, 4,057 in November, 4,065 in October and 3,928 in September. “We have now planned to increase testing by about 25% of our existing average daily testing. The caseload has come down considerably, besides which few people are opting to get tested. Further, we released a number of our lab technicians (from their Covid duties) who then went back to urban primary health centres which were opened for attending to the general public,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of the district.“As of now, we have about 20 teams available with us for testing and some more lab technicians will be roped in to increase testing by about 25%. We will be able to do this in another week or so. In light of directions from the divisional commissioner (Meerut), we will increase testing as well as take up stricter measures for Covid-19 management,” Dr Gupta added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls. According to the official figures of the state portal provided by the health department, the sample positivity rate in the current month is about 0.33%, with 150 positive cases emerging from a total of 45,417 Covid-19 tests in the month so far.Sample positivity denotes the positive cases which have emerged from the total testing.Likewise, the sample positivity has been running well below the 1% mark since January when it stood at 0.74%. In the past year, the district started with a positivity of 6.94% in the month of March last year, and it spiked to its highest at 19.93% in the month of June.It was 5.92% in September 2020, and thereafter a gradual decline has been seen in subsequent months. Since the first case last year to February 22 of the current year, the overall sample positivity stood at 4.04%, according to official figures, with 29,616 positive reports from 733,940 tests conducted so far.“Although there is no spike or surge being seen in the district as of now, the health department should increase testing to at least 5,000 per day with a wider coverage. They must also test people who are returning from states which are witnessing a spike in cases. Above all, the vaccination should be expedited on a daily basis or at least every alternate day. Otherwise, it will take a long time to administer the vaccine to such a large population,” said Dr Asheesh Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Over the issue of vaccination, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to conduct a final mop-up round on February 25.“Since there has been a spike in cases in several states, we need to take extra precautions. Side by side, our vaccination is going on swiftly with 714,500 healthcare workers having received the first dose and 101,936 of these have taken up the second dose. About 458,234 frontline workers have been given the first dose,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). “Now, the final mop-up round will be on February 25 when the left out healthcare and frontline workers can come to get the first dose. If they fail to turn up, they will be moved to the age-appropriate groups under the third category and will have to wait for the vaccine,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-increase-covid-19-testing-by-25-101614105221699.html
24-02-2021||Noida||GB Nagar: 2000 health care workers’ names missed in vaccination drive||Around 2,000 health care workers (HCWs) from Gautam Budh Nagar did not find their names on the beneficiary list for the Covid-19 vaccination phase 1 drive from January 16 to February 5.The district administration has now sent their names for an unscheduled special inoculation drive.District magistrate Suhas L Y said that the health department and the Noida chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) received reports that several HCWs in private hospitals and other medical institutions did not figure in the phase 1 list. “We have sent a list of names of these people to the government to be included on the Co-WIN portal. Once they are reflected on the portal, we’ll have a special inoculation drive for them,” he said. He said the health department had been asked to find out how the lapse happened. Of the 24,453 HCWs listed for vaccination, 16,863 turned up to get their shot.Dr NK Gupta, the president of IMA-Noida, said that doctors, nurses, paramedics, technical staff and sanitary workers, were among those who did not get a chance to be vaccinated. “Many private hospitals submitted their data late or did not submit it in the right format due to a communication gap. We got at least 25 calls a day on this issue. The private hospitals approached us when names of some of their employees did not figure among the beneficiaries,” he said. GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said, “The state government had restricted editing on the portal from the first day of the vaccination drive. Once the government approves the list we sent, we will get access to the Co-WIN portal and will be able to upload the names.”The central government had developed Co-WIN to track beneficiaries and alert them of their vaccination dates and centres. While phase 1 was devoted to HCWs, phase 2 included frontline workers such as police, paramilitary and district officials too, while phase 3 will have people over 50 and/or those with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-2000-health-care-workers-names-missed-in-vaccination-drive-101614105221114.html

The Authority chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari directed shops to vacate the space immediately. She directed the authortiy’s accounts department to gather all details and upload it on their website.“We will soon start a drive to evict them and free the government property of those, who are defaulting on the payment of the rents of their respective commercial space in the prime areas across the city,” said Indu Prakash Singh officer on special duty of the Noida authority.Since the 1980s, the authority allotted commercial spaces in multiple sectors on monthly rent. In 2019, the authority audit found pending rent to the tune of ₹100 crore from over 750 establishments. Since then, the authority issued notices to defaulters to pay their dues. Officials said many were yet to comply.“Some approached the Allahabad high court for relief on many grounds. Unless there is a court order, we will evict them. But we are yet to fix a deadline for this,” said Singh.According to the authority, 104 shops in sector 31, 458 in sector 62 and 226 in sector 110 had defaulted.“Our teams will go to the site daily, click a picture to ascertain if these spaces are being used or not. If these are still being used then we will vacate and process of recovery will be started,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cancels-allotment-of-300-commercial-properties-due-to-financial-dues-101614105161076.html
24-02-2021||Noida||Farmer leader Sardar VM Singh forms new group||Ghaziabad: A new group of farmers has emerged under the banner of Uttar Pradesh Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (UPKMM), which has planned to send five messages every day from each of the villages in the state to the Prime Minister. The new group has come to the fore to change the form of the ongoing farmers’ agitation demanding repeal of three new laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP), the group’s leaders said. Sardar VM Singh, a prominent farmer leader who heads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, on January 27 decided to withdraw from the UP Gate protest site after incidents of violence were reported in Delhi on Republic Day during the farmers’ rally, the call for which had been given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha at the Singhu Border. After the incident, however, farmers’ leaders had distanced themselves from the violence, saying that their ranks had been infiltrated by “outsiders”.Then, Singh had said that he will soon come up with another mode of protest to ensure that the demands of the farmers are considered and fulfilled. The UPKMM was formed on February 21, comprising 22 different farmers’ organisations. Singh made public the modalities of the agitation during a press briefing held in Delhi on Tuesday.“I never said that I was withdrawing from the ongoing agitation. The agitation will remain the same, but we are not with anyone whosoever is responsible for the violence. So, we have now changed gears and our demands will be for Uttar Pradesh. If the government has spoken to the farmers earlier, they should hold talks with us for farmers of UP. In fact, we have demanded talks. We have promised that we will have no ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from our side and will hold talks on every clause one by one. Either they make us understand or they understand our point of view,” Singh said. The UPKMM said that there are about 86% small and marginal farmers across the country who have no means to come to Delhi for protests and are also facing issues due to rise in cost of production of their crops. “Each day, five farmers from a village will sit on a relay hunger strike from 9am to 5pm. At 11am, they will be given information on the three new farm laws. At 3pm, every person fasting will record a brief message while giving his introduction to the Prime Minister. This way, the voice of every farmer will reach the PM,” UPKMM said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement said that the relay fast will be for the rollback of three farm laws and a new law on MSP, and will go on till the time every grain of wheat is not purchased on MSP. He said that farmers protesting on various borders will continue their agitation and the UPKMM will continue their agitation as per the new format. “Our protests will start March 1. We have 75 districts in the state and even if we imagine that 500 villages get covered in every district, then you can imagine the number of messages which will be sent to the PM every day from every village. If the PM says that MSP will remain, then we will get the rate of wheat on MSP and will continue to protest till every grain of wheat has been purchased on MSP,” Singh said. The UPKMM has also planned that farmers will collect a handful of grain from every house and will hold a bhandara (community kitchen) every week so that they gel well with each other. They added that besides the relay fast against the centre, farmers in 47 districts of UP will hold simultaneous protests to demand the increase in price of sugarcane which will finally benefit farmers and labourers working in fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmer-leader-sardar-vm-singh-forms-new-group-101614105100978.html
24-02-2021||Pune||Three officers leading garbage dept exit with health issues||The absence of leadership in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s solid waste management department is adding to the garbage woes of residents. At present, there is no independent officer handling the position of department head at a time when garbage collection and processing has been hampered in the city. Residents in the suburbs have complained of garbage problems at various locations. Due to health issues faced by joint municipal commissioner Dyneshwar Molak, the charge was given to the deputy municipal commissioner Sanjay Gawade. However, he was also admitted to a hospital. Following that, the charge was given to Ajit Deshmukh, and he too was quarantined and hospitalised due to the Covid-19 infection. A total of three civic officers faced hospitalisation after assuming charge of solid waste management, putting the department in a state of array. At present, an additional charge has been given to property tax department head Vilas Kanade. Anti-encroachment department head Madhav Jagtap is also handling garbage issues. Earlier, Suresh Jagtap was independently handling the solid waste department. Last year, he was appointed as the additional municipal commissioner. Currently, no officer is willing to take an independent charge of solid waste management. It is one of the most important but despised departments in the civic body. The garbage generation has increased after merging 11 villages into the PMC. At present, the city generates around 2,100 tonnes of garbage per day. In Wadgaonsheri, Viman nagar, Kharadi, Kondhwa, Vadgaon budruk area, Hadapsar, the garbage is piling on the roadside. Dr Kunal Khemanr, additional municipal commissioner said, “It is true that work has hampered but the garbage has not piled up. At present, we have given an additional charge to Vilas Kanade. Deshmukh will soon resume work in the solid waste department.” Pune generates around 2,100 tonnes of solid waste per day. Of that, the civic body has the capacity to process around 1,500 tons of garbage at different processing plants. The remainder of the garbage is kept in the Ramtekdi area for segregation and further processing. As per the solid waste department’s information, the civic body collects garbage with the help of 160 trucks. There are 563 containers and 116 compactor buckets dispersed around Pune city. The ward wise average is 350 to 750 gms per capita per day. The construction and demolition waste generation are around 150-180 tonnes per day. The garden waste generation is around 50-60 tonnes per day whereas the biomedical waste is around five to six tonnes per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/absence-of-leadership-at-pmc-solid-waste-department-results-in-garbage-piling-101614104621527.html
24-02-2021||Pune||Woman killed in fire at cloth store in Pune||A woman was killed in a fire at a cloth shop in Pradhikaran, Akurdi in the early morning hours of Tuesday. The shop located in Sarda plot was completely gutted in fire, according to fire brigade officials. The deceased woman was identified Bharati Nandlal Sarda (68), she was residing on a floor above the cloth shop that she owned, according to fire officials. “We received a call from a neighbourhood resident called Digvijay Shelke at 3:10am. The shop is located behind Mhalsakant school in Jaihind chowk in Pradhiaran, Akurdi,” said an official of Pradhikaran fire division of Pimpri-Chinchwad fire brigade. While the fire brigade officials cannot confirm the source of the fire, the suspicion based on the starting point of the fire was that the fire may have started because of a short circuit. Three fire units one each from Bajaj, Pradhikaran, and Sant Tukaramnagar divisions were rushed to the spot. A team of 15 people worked for around two hours to completely douse and cool down the area. Sub fire officer Suryakant Matpati was leading the operation. The body was then handed over to Pimpri-Chinchwad police who took it for post-mortem. A case of accidental death was registered by the local police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/woman-killed-in-fire-at-cloth-store-in-pune-101614104501973.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||New push for plan to rid Minto Bridge of flooding||The Delhi government’s plan to develop an independent drainage system under the Minto Road railway bridge, which inundates almost every time the city is battered by a spell of heavy rain, has been delayed by at least six months, senior officials involved in the project said on Tuesday.The plan has been delayed because at least two tenders floated by the public works department (PWD) to appoint a consultant for the project received a poor response, forcing the agency to call for fresh bids this month.The Minto bridge underpass lies at the key traffic junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Marg and Swami Vivekananda Marg (formerly Minto Road) and leads to Connaught Place on one side and New Delhi station, Old Delhi and Daryaganj on the other.In July last year, water-logging under the Minto bridge claimed the life of a 56-year-old man whose van got stuck in the flooded underpass. In July 2018, when two Delhi transport corporation (DTC) buses were submerged in the flooded underpass and 10 people had to be rescued, the Delhi high court directed all agencies concerned to coordinate efforts and prepare a plan to prevent such instances in the future. However, a lasting solution is still elusive. Every monsoon, the government deploys high-power pumps in the area to clear rain water.According to a senior PWD official, the existing drainage system, a deep barrel drain, on the stretch was constructed during the British-era.“The road stretch that falls under the Minto bridge does not have separate sewage and rainwater drains, unlike most areas in Delhi.A deep barrel drain here doubles up as a sewage and stormwater drain and leads directly to the Yamuna river. Usually, the sewage first flows to a treatment plant before being discharged into the river and the rainwater drains or stormwater drains empties in the river directly,” said the official.A second official in the department said the problem has been aggravated by the increase in the volume of sewage over the years because of which even during light rains, the Minto bridge underpass is deluged.If this third tender is successful, the appointed consultant will have to submit the detailed project report (DPR) in three months and will have to provide consultancy service for six months during the execution of the project, stated the tender document seen by HT. The consultant will also have to conduct a topographical survey and do a feasibility study.“The department floated the first tender for the project on September 21 last year. But, we received only one bidder. The second tender, floated around two months later also met a similar fate. Now, we have floated a fresh e-tender to appoint a consultant who will conduct a feasibility study and prepare a detailed project report (DPR),” said a senior PWD official on condition of anonymity.“Waterlogging under the Minto Road railway bridge is an almost inevitable monsoon event in the capital. The problem lies in the natural gradient of the land, the heritage bridge that cannot be easily re-engineered, and the larger issue of Delhi’s choked and dysfunctional drainage system. Accordingly, PWD is looking for a modified water drainage system at Minto road during monsoon,” read the tender document.It further stated that due to low lying areas near Minto road the problem of water logging is persistent during monsoon. “However, since a few years the water-logging problem has increased. PWD wants to do a conditional assessment study of the existing drainage system near Minto road to take further actions to improve the water-logging problem,” the department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plan-to-stop-waterlogging-under-minto-bridge-delayed-govt-to-float-new-tender-this-month-101614104201953.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||All parties agree to support proposal to save new Chandni Chowk Hanuman temple||All political parties in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday came to a consensus to “support” a proposal to grant legal status to a makeshift structure that has come up in place of a recently-demolished Hanuman temple on the central verge of main Chandni Chowk road.The decision was taken in an all-party meeting called by north corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Tuesday.The original temple was demolished by the north civic body on January 3 on Delhi high court orders as it fell in the course of the redevelopment work. The makeshift structure was set up by locals on the central verge of the main road in Chandni Chowk on Thursday.Also Read | North MCD to pass a proposal for legal tag to makeshift temple in Chandni ChowkThe proposal to grant legal status will be brought in the house meeting on Thursday and then sent to the Delhi government for final approval before implementation.Prakash said, “The consensus to save the makeshift Hanuman temple was agreed to at the joint meeting. We all agreed to support the decision with a positive mind. Being in majority, we could have passed the proposal on our own, but we want to take everyone on board. We will send the proposal to the Delhi government and also to the religious committee for the final nod, so that legal status can be granted to the temple.”Although the opposition parties supported the cause, but they also blamed BJP–ruled civic body for not taking their consensus before filing an affidavit in the high court, which could have saved the structure could have been saved.Vikas Goel, leader of Opposition in the north corporation, said that the Aam Aadmi Party supports the decision to pass a proposal for saving the makeshift structure in Chandni Chowk but the civic agency, if wanted, could have also saved the original temple from demolition.“We have always been in support of saving the temple, but it was the north municipality that demolished it. The BJP is just doing politics on the temple issue. Rather than filing an affidavit in court, they could have given justification for not demolishing the structure,” he said.Mukesh Goel, senior Congress leader and councillor, who also attended the meeting, said that his party was in support of the proposal to save the temple.“We also want new structure to remain at the place it has come up. It is anyway not encroaching upon the main road. However, the BJP, if they wanted, could have saved the original temple from demolition.Meanwhile, vice president of Delhi Congress Mudit Aggrawal also wrote a letter to the lieutenant governor and requested him to grant legal status to the makeshift temple for the sake of the faith of residents of Chandni Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/all-parties-agree-to-support-proposal-to-save-new-chandni-chowk-hanuman-temple-101614104200711.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||SC panel to meet today to decide fate of trees that face axe in Metro expansion||After a petition before the high court sought a change in the alignment of Metro Phase 4, to save over 11,000 trees that may otherwise be felled, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), set up by the Supreme Court, has called a virtual meeting of all stakeholders on Wednesday to hear the petitioners’ grievances.In a petition before the Delhi high court, it was submitted that for the construction of three of DMRC corridors —Janakpuri-RK Ashram, Maujpur-Majlis Park and Aerocity-Tughlakabad—the Metro had sought permission to cut 11,454 trees.On February 11, the high court asked the CEC to “consider as representation” the plea, which contended that felling over 11,000 trees for the Metro construction would have an adverse effect on the ambient air quality of the national capital, where pollution is already at critical levels. The petitioners also sought a change in alignment of Metro Phase 4, from above ground to underground.In a notice issued on February 15, CEC member secretary had called the Delhi chief secretary, principal chief conservator forests (PCCF), public works department (PWD) engineer-in-chief, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) member secretary, as well as representatives of the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC) and ministry of housing and urban affairs, to hear the grievance of petitioners.The CEC on Wednesday will also look into DMRC’s request for permission to divert forest land under the Forest Conservation Act (1980), for the construction of the upcoming corridors under Phase 4.“The copies of all relevant documents may be emailed to CEC in advance with a copy to all parties concerned. The petitioner and respondents may join the meeting with the identity of participant/user agency name,” the notice for virtual meeting read.Last year, the DMRC had run into trouble with the Delhi forest department for carrying out digging work on the stretch between Vikaspuri and Peeragarhi Chowk, which was marked as a deemed forest land without due permissions. The forest department had issued a restraining order to the DMRC asking it to stop all construction on the stretch till the required permissions were granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/11000-trees-face-the-axe-for-dmrc-phase-4-sc-panel-to-hold-meeting-of-stakeholders-today-101614104142545.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up advisory board to implement disability rights act||The Delhi government has set up a state advisory board on disability to assist the government departments in the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.The 45-member board will be chaired by the social welfare minister and will play a key role in addressing problems faced by persons with disability and making the city disabled-friendly.Apart from principal secretaries of departments such as health, education, employment, public works etc, the government has nominated AAP MLAs Praveen Kumar, SK Bagga and Sharad Kumar as members of the board.The board will make suggestions to departments to develop accessible infrastructure or address issues faced by persons with disability, while availing of medical treatment, education and employment, among others.With 14 new disabilities being recognised under the new Act, disability rights activists say a lot of people faced problems in getting disability certificates until last year.Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said, “The advisory board will help in addressing the concerns of people with disabilities. The number of disabilities covered under the Act has increased from seven to 21. The board will assist in preparing comprehensive guidelines for smooth implantation of the Act, inclusive education, and address issues related to certification. We will soon have a board meeting.”Delhi is now among the few states and union territories such as Mizoram, Goa and Chandigarh to have a state advisory board on disability.Disability rights activists say the demand for the advisory board, which is mandated as per the Act, has been a long-standing one. There have been a lot of issues concerning people with disabilities ever since the new Act came into force.Dr Satendra Singh, professor at University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS), said, “It is good that the government has constituted the board, as there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed. A lot of people, especially those with disabilities that have now been added to the list, faced difficulty in getting certificates. They also faced a lot of problems during the pandemic, especially the lockdown. There was no state commissioner for disability in Delhi for months. These issues could have been taken up by the advisory board had it been there.”Preeti Mohan, founder trustee and CEO of Silver Linings, a non-profit organisation working for blind people, has been appointed as a member of the board. Mohan, who is visually impaired, said, “There is a need to provide equal opportunity to people with disabilities and for that, inclusive schooling is essential. With the help of technology, we can make it possible for children with disabilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-up-advisory-board-to-implement-disability-rights-act-101614104142000.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||Schools, parents split over in-person exams||How best to conduct exams this year, is the question that is vexing both private schools and parents in the national capital with neither party agreeing with the other.While parents students of classes 9 and 11 are reluctant to send their children to school for their annual examination and want exams to be held remotely, schools are advocating in-person examinations, terming them more “reliable” and in accordance with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) directions.The CBSE, on February 11, directed all its affiliated schools to conduct annual examinations of classes 9 and 11 in the offline mode, after taking all Covid-19 related precautions. But parents are not for it. They would rather that the exams be held online, so that children can take them remotely, without fear of infectionOn Tuesday, a group of 30 to 40 parents and students gathered outside KR Mangalam World School in Greater Kailash-2, protesting against the school’s decision to conduct in-person examinations for these classes, even though it had already conducted the exams online. “The school has conducted exams online before the CBSE directions came. Now, the school is asking us to send our children for in-person exams. Why should our children appear in exams again risking their safety? said a parent of a class 11 student.When contacted, school director Jyoti Gupta said, “The school is following the CBSE directions and not taking any decision on its own. The major issue right now is that students are out of practice when it comes to writing for three hours. They have been attending online classes and appearing in exams in the online mode throughout the year. Taking all this into consideration, the school has also decided to give 50-50 weightage to both offline and online exams. If parents still have objections, then we can’t help it. We have no means to proctor the online exams.”Some schools have decided to give an option of online exams after receiving requests from parents but, simultaneously announced incentives to those who will choose the in-person mode. For instance, Bal Bharti Public School in Pitampura has decided to give additional 10% marks per subject to such students. “We released a Google form to ask the preference of students and their parents and 70% of them have opted for the online mode. But the school has given an open offer since in-person exams are more challenging this year -- students have not taken any such exam throughout the year,” school principal Meenu Goswami said.The Indian School in Sadiq Nagar has given parents a choice between date lines for offline exams. School principal Tania Joshi said, “Many of the parents are still not in favour of offline exams, but they simply cannot rely on online exams either. We have given them two date options -- children can appear in offline exams either in March or in April.”Delhi parents’ association, on Monday, wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting the government to intervene. “At a time when coronavirus cases are rising in several states and there is a fear of a second wave across the country, what is the point of offline exams? In some cities, the administration has ordered schools shut again in view of rising Covid-19 cases,” said Aprajita Gautam, president of the association.Recently, Pune administration ordered all schools shut till February 28 after Covid-19 cases increased again in the city. In Mumbai, where schools have been physically closed since March last year, the state board is yet to take a decision on the mode of conducting exams.A senior Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The Delhi government has already instructed all its schools to conduct exams in the offline mode, in pursuance to CBSE directions. The mid-term exams for classes 9 and 11 will start from March 20 in government schools. The government doesn’t come into the picture when the CBSE issues directions to its affiliated schools. Schools are bound to follow the CBSE directions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/online-or-offline-parents-schools-disagree-on-mode-of-exam-for-classes-9-and-11-101614104080805.html
24-02-2021||City||In last budget before elections, Tamil Nadu blames Centre for fall in revenue||Tamil Nadu’s deputy chief minister and state finance minister, O Panneerselvam, on Tuesday presented a revenue deficit interim budget that blamed the Central government for the fall in revenue and talked up the achievements of the government over the past five years.This is the last budget of AIADMK led state government as the state heads for assembly polls in April- May. The party has partnered with the Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the Union government to contest the election.Tamil Nadu’s debt was ₹4.87 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020. Since the state was affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is likely to go up to ₹5.7 lakh crore by the end of March 31. State finance secretary S Krishnan in a post-budget conference said that the debt is within permissible limits.Also Read: India hasn’t changed its mind on Chinese investment, will make no exceptionsPanneerselvam’s ruling AIADMK blamed the central government led by their ally the BJP for delaying payments to the state. The deputy CM also said that the share of central taxes for Tamil Nadu which was ₹32,849.34 crore in 2020-21’s budget has been reduced to ₹23,039.46 crore in the revised estimates 2020-21. To be sure, revenue suffered in the course of the current fiscal year on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.Panneerselvam cited the 15th Finance Commission’s report which noted that there is an increasing trend of levying cesses and surcharges by the Central Government which grew from 10.4% in 2011-12 to 20.3% in the received estimates 2019-20. He said the cesses do not form part of the divisible pool of taxes.The commission “has not made any categorical recommendation of merging cesses and surcharges in the basic rate of tax or of including them in the divisible pool as demanded by the many states including Tamil Nadu, which is very disappointing,” Panneerselvam said, reiterating his appeal.The finance minister also specified that the Commission has recommended state-specific grants of ₹4,784 crore as performance-based incentives to Tamil Nadu for specific sectors including health, education, judiciary and statistics. Following Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s union budget presentation on the same, he urged the centre “not to utilise the 15th Finance Commission recommended grants to substitute their share of funding for Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. This would be a major deviation from past practice.”He said that he ‘personally urged’ Sitharaman in the pre-Budget meeting held on January 18 that all cesses and surcharges should be merged with the basic rate of tax “so that the states receive their due share as devolution from the central taxes.” Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami also raised the issue with the centre. “Despite this...the agricultural infrastructure development cess has been levied by further reducing the basic excise duty on petrol and diesel.”In a budget speech that ran for more than two hours, Panneerselvam reiterated his government’s achievements, proposals and projects and announced new ones. Computer science will be taught to students from class 6 to 10, he said. School education has been sanctioned ₹34,181 crore in 2021-22. ₹13,352 crore was spent to bring Covid-19 under control, the minister said. The state has allocated ₹19,420 crore for health. Tamil Nadu is expected to register a positive growth rate of 2.02% against India’s negative growth rate of 7.7% in 2020-21, Panneerselvam said.Following the chief minister’s announcement in the assembly in February, farm loans worth ₹12,110 crore owed to co-operative banks by 16,43,347 farmers were waived. A provision of ₹5,000 crore was announced for the scheme. “It is ambiguous if they will clear all loans,” added Maalan Narayanan. “Though it was meant to be a vote on account, the budget has initiated new projects. This is improper; what if the government doesn’t return. What happens to these works?”Panneerselvam expressed confidence in the house that the government will return. “Tamil Nadu’s people will trust only a government headed by Edappadi Palaniswami,” he said in his concluding remarks.DMK and Congress MLAs walked out after the speaker did not allow them permission to raise issues at the start of the budget speech. Tamimun Ansari of Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK) cycled his way to the budget session condemning the fuel price rise. “Before the election, knowing that work cannot be finished, they have floated tenders worth ₹40,000 crore and emptied state coffers,” the DMK’s Duraimurugan told reporters. The assembly will reconvene next on February 25 until February 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-term-s-last-budget-aiadmk-complains-of-reduced-share-from-centre-101614097529862.html
24-02-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Why groundwater is an invisible, but crucial resource||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken up a unique project to revive a water percolation pond in Handewadi, in southeast Pune. This spot is right at the gate of the Dada Gujar Madhyamik Vidyalaya. The pond itself was perhaps made as a village tank several decades ago with support from Dada Gujar. The pond revival and redesign is being done by PMC with technical advice from ACWADAM, and participation of Mission Groundwater, a civil society initiative. Rainwater from Handewadi flows into this percolation pond. Two newly constructed filtration pits will screen out leaves and rubbish flowing in with the rainwater. In addition, three small springs bring water naturally percolating in the surrounding area into the pond. Two recharge shafts are constructed to direct the pond water into the aquifer below, that is rock layers with numerous cracks and air bubbles that retain water. The project is expected to be ready before the monsoon this year, as informed by PMC engineer Shramik Shevte, who took the initiative for the project. The recharged groundwater is likely to benefit several housing societies and commercial enterprises with borewells using water from this aquifer. Managing groundwater in cities Percolation tanks and recharge pits are common in watershed development projects across rural India. However, cities too need to take up watershed and groundwater management in a scientific, systematic manner, and quite urgently for many reasons. First, the increasing population in Pune directly increases the demand for water. Thousands of housing societies have borewells. Dr Himanhsu Kulkarni, director of ACWADAM, estimates that nearly 20% of Pune’s water needs are met by groundwater. Though PMC’s 24x7 water supply project is expected to distribute water more equally across the city through new pipelines which will also curb leakages, the dependence on groundwater may not go away. Second, erratic rains are common with climate change and we might not get enough of rain in some years. Dam water stocks may not be enough in drought years. Third, climate change may also lead to heavy rains and without appropriate physical structures. Floodwaters can cause damage as well as just run off very rapidly without much percolation. Instead, with stream restoration and groundwater recharge structures created, floodwater run-off speed can be reduced and percolation increased. Fourth, a more just approach is needed than bringing water from further and further away, such as in the Bhama Askhed project. Increasing urban demands can deprive farming and other rural communities of their water resources. Pune should wisely manage the water it draws from the existing dams as well as the resource it is literally sitting upon – groundwater. Improved groundwater management requires good information about the resource, as well as appropriate rules and programmes for groundwater recharge and use. Unlike rivers and streams that are visible in the cityscape, extensive studies are needed to map underground aquifers. Studies show that Pune’s current plot-based rainwater harvesting voluntary programme should change to a comprehensive area-based approach. Protecting open vegetated areas like Bavdhan and Vetal tekdi, which are natural recharge zones, should be a priority. Recharge structures should be set up at places where the rock structure is such that it would hold water, as in Handewadi. Further, the concretisation of streams and nallahs should stop. Corporators sometimes promote nallah concretisation mistakenly believing it helps the neighbourhood. In fact, concretisation is more likely to cause flash floods and reduce groundwater recharge. Instead, discretionary funds could be used to restore nallahs as natural streams. We also need new rules to govern use of groundwater in cities. The Handewadi project should spur a larger public initiative on groundwater in Pune. The government, technical agencies like the Central Ground Water Board and GSDA, experts like ACWADAM, and the public will need to collaborate, deliberate and innovate to develop sustainable, participatory groundwater management in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-why-groundwater-is-an-invisible-but-crucial-resource-101614065195498.html
24-02-2021||Delhi||How riots and the pandemic tore apart the lives of children of north-east Delhi||Mohammad Kaif was preparing for his class 12 exams last February when communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi, where he lived with his family. Overnight, the 19-year-old had to forget all about exams as he and his family were forced to flee for their lives, to their village in Uttar Pradesh.Kaif, a resident of Mustafabad, aspired to become a doctor until last year. “We fled to our village the same day our neighbour was killed by a mob. Later, my family did not allow me to return to Delhi, to appear for the exams in the first week of March 2020. Then, before we could even think of returning to discuss my case with the school, a nationwide lockdown was announced. My entire year got ruined. I finally completed my class 12 this month through distance learning mode.”A year after the violence, Kaif is uncertain about his future. “Things have changed in the past one year. I could not study properly due to the circumstances. My father is also not keeping well. His work — he rents out bulldozers — was severely hit by the violence and then the pandemic. There is so much uncertainty around; I’m thinking of doing a course in the distance learning mode this year,” he said.Also Read | Multiple strands, piles of evidence: Inside the Delhi riots probeAs many as 53 people were killed and more than 400 injured in the riots that broke out in parts of north-east Delhi on February 23, 2020. Police have registered 755 cases related to the communal violence that was allegedly triggered by protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Like Kaif, hundreds of children in these parts are struggling to string together their lives interrupted by violence, even a year after the riots.Apart from seeing their neighbourhoods and schools laid to waste by rioters, many of them also lost their loved ones — including their parents — to the violence. Several children said they could not focus on their studies throughout the year.Arsh Malik, 18, a resident of Yamuna Vihar, failed in two subjects in the class 12 exams. “My tuition centre was set afire by rioters at a time when my exams were on. Several people, I knew died in the violence or were injured. Those were disturbing times. I could not study well for the exams that happened a week after the riots. Now, I’m thinking of enrolling in the distance learning mode,” he said.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had to postpone several exams for both classes 10 and 12 after the violence broke out. The board resumed exams from March 2 onwards, but it could not conduct the postponed exams as by then, the Covid-19 pandemic had hit the city. Students were finally promoted last year on the basis of alternative assessment schemes.A 2005 UNICEF report on “Childhood Under Threat” said children are among the first and worst affected by conflict, whether directly or indirectly. Even if they are not killed or injured, they can be left with deep emotional scars and trauma from direct exposure to the violence or from dislocation, poverty, or the loss of loved ones, said the report.Also Read | Man held over death of constable during Delhi riots granted bailIqra, a class 11 student who lost her two brothers, Amir Khan (30) and Hashim Ali (19), in the riots, said, “People have started referring to us as ‘that family that lost two sons in the danga (riots)’. That has become our identity now. I am glad that my class 10 exams were cancelled, and we were promoted; otherwise, I would have failed. How do you concentrate on studies with so much tension around?”For the riot-hit children, the Covid-enforced lockdown was another bolt from the blue. Anjum, whose Khajuri Khas house was burned down by a mob, said, “We were left with nothing; not even a piece of cloth. We also lost the only smartphone we had and there was no way for any of us – myself or my siblings – to attend online classes. We could only resume studies in October after a person donated us a mobile phone.”Neetu Chaudhary, an official at the Arun Modern School in Brijpuri, one of the four schools that were attacked and damaged in the violence, said their student strength reduced by nearly 40%, post the riots and the Covid-enforced lockdown.“It took us months to bring back our school to its former status — the construction work is still going on. Now that the school has reopened for classes 9 to 12, we have another task at hand - instilling confidence in parents. We had to request the police to deploy some personnel during school hours so that their fears are allayed,” she said.Officials at the other three schools affected by the violence — DRP Convent Public School, Victoria Senior Secondary School, and Rajdhani School — said a large number of their students were yet to return to school. Farooq Ahmed Nawab, whose family owns both Rajdhani and Victoria schools, said, “The student strength has reduced by almost half in both of schools in the past one year. We are struggling to even manage the operational costs.”Also Read | Delhi riots: Police seeks report on plea seeking FIR against Kapil MishraParents and family members of children in riot-hit areas said the violence has left them traumatised and they are unable to shake it off. Imrana (32), who lost her husband to the firing in Subhash Mohalla during the riots, said her two children are now highly irritable and stubborn.“Even today, loud noises scare them and they get angry over the smallest of things. Being a single parent has been challenging as I have to discipline them, while still being mindful of the trauma they’ve been through,” she said.Fifteen-year-old Shifa Naaz, a class 10 student in old Mustafabad and the eldest of eight siblings, lost her father Mudassir Khan (30) to the riots. The loss has scarred her siblings more, she says. “My younger sister (12) refused to even see our father’s body for the last time. Since then, she has become highly irritable. The younger ones often dream of our father and cry. It is difficult to see them like that. Managing finances has also been challenging for our mother. Every day, I feel emptier and weak,” the 15-year-old said.Experts said a timely intervention is required to bring these children out of their trauma. Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IBHAS), said the riots, followed by the lockdown, might have led to “conduct disorder” among children. “Conduct disorder is identified by emotional as well as behavioural disturbances. It’s very important that these children are given a chance to express themselves. For kids above 8 years of age, the verbal expression is still easier but for those below that age, verbalising their trauma is a challenge. So, intervention by NGOs, child rights bodies, families, and schools is essential,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/how-riots-and-the-pandemic-tore-apart-the-lives-of-children-of-north-east-delhi-101614057335291.html
