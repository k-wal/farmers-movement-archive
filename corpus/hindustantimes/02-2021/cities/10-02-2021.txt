The price of one litre of petrol is now ₹94.12, while one litre of diesel is ₹84.63.There has been a 92 paise increase in the cost of petrol and 96 paise increase in the diesel price over the period of one week.

The increase in fuel prices was seen after two day days.With the constant increase in the fuel prices, transporters have called for an all-body meeting on Saturday to decide the course of action. They have stated the constant increase in fuel prices is impacting the business of small transporters.Decisions on agitation regarding the increase in fuel prices will be taken on Saturday.“There is acute pressure on us to call for a protest against the insensitivity of the government towards their plight, as the rising fuel cost is making their operations economically unviable,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).Earlier, the AIMTC had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on diesel and petrol in Maharashtra, to extend relief to the road transport sector.“There is no immediate relief from the government. The fuel prices are constantly increasing. Maharashtra government should reduce VAT on both petrol and diesel in the city. This will bring some relief to the citizens,” said Aarti Singh, a Vikhroli resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-prices-in-mumbai-at-record-high-petrol-94-12-a-litre-diesel-8463-101612981750687.html

The court’s direction came after it learnt that the medical certificate of the bail applicant’s mother was forged and had the stamp and sign of the medical officer and civil Surgeon of Osmanabad civil hospital. The court on Thursday also imposed a cost of ₹5,000 on the man. A division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Nitin Borkar, while hearing the bail application earlier on January 19, was informed by advocate Priyal Sarda that the man was seeking temporary bail for six months so that he could take care of his mother who was suffering from breast cancer and diabetes. The bench was further told that the applicant was the only son, and hence his application should be allowed. A medical certificate of the mother issued by Osmanabad civil hospital dated October 27, 2020 was submitted before the court to prove the genuineness of the claim. However, the court doubted the certificate and directed the public prosecutor to inquire. Subsequently, the civil surgeon of Osmanabad civil hospital filed a report stating that the medical certificate was not issued by the hospital. The report further mentioned that there was no record to even remotely indicate that the said patient (applicant’s mother) was examined by any doctor of that hospital. The inquiry also revealed that the applicant was not the only son and had a brother, aged around 40 years, who was residing with the mother. The mother, in her statement to the police, admitted that she did not have any documents to show that she was undergoing treatment from the civil hospital and said that she had obtained the certificate to get her son released for a temporary period. She, however, has not revealed how she got the certificate in question.After hearing the submissions and perusing the inquiry report, the court on Thursday observed that the mother had admitted that she was not suffering from cancer. In light of this, the court said, “It is clear that the said certificate has been fabricated.” The bench also observed that the stamps of medical officer and civil surgeon have been misused by the person who had fabricated the certificate and hence directed the civil surgeon, Osmanabad has been asked to lodge a complaint at the police station and submit a report of the same to the court by February 26. “A clear attempt has been made to mislead this court,” the bench held.The bench rejected the interim application and imposed a cost of ₹5,000 on the applicant to be deposited within three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-man-whose-mother-faked-illness-101612981749345.html
10-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department defers RTE admissions||The Maharashtra education department has postponed the online application process for admissions under Right To Education (RTE) quota to give the schools a few more days to register and verify their data for the 25% seats reserved under the quota for academic year 2021-22. “The department is likely to announce a revised schedule in the next few days. Parents will be notified about the same and the online admission portal would then open for registrations,” said an official from the civic education department which conducts RTE admissions in Mumbai. The education department had earlier planned to open applications for the quota from February 9. While the registration process for parents was expected to continue until February 26, selected candidates were asked to submit their documents between March 9 and March 26. However, with several schools eligible for admissions under the quota still not registering for admissions, the department has extended the deadline for the same, thus postponing the entire admission schedule. In Mumbai, only 232 of the 360 eligible schools have registered so far. This year, there will be only one lottery for admissions under the quota. After the lottery, a waiting list will be released in accordance with vacant seats in schools across the state. Students can then claim admissions against vacant seats. In case there are seats vacant even after admissions under the waiting list are over, remaining students can be allotted on a lottery basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-defers-rte-admissions-101612981687555.html
10-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Film director arrested in porn racket case||Property cell of the Mumbai crime branch on Wednesday arrested film director Tanvir Hasmi from Surat in connection with the pornography racket.Hasmi is the ninth accused to be arrested in the case that involves allegedly luring Bollywood newcomers under the guise of small roles and force them to act in porn films by using agreements signed by them to their disadvantage.Hasmi and the other eight accused were produced before a magistrate on Wednesday. Five of them, including the mastermind of the racket, producer-director Rowa alias Yasmeen Khan, were sent to judicial custody, while others, including Hasmi, model-actress Gehana Vasisth, Khan’s husband Shaan Banerjee alias Dipankar Khasanvis, and Umesh Kamat, were remanded to police custody till February 15.Property cell conducted raids at a bungalow in Madh of Malad (West) on February 4. Hasmi’s name came to the fore during the interrogation of Vasisth and other arrested accused. He would allegedly accept obscene videos from Vasisth and others and later sold them to several mobile app owners, said police inspector Kedari Pawar of the property cell.Vasisth runs a production house and allegedly makes obscene videos and sends them to other arrested accused Kamat. Kamat who worked as a coordinator with a UK based production house forwarded them who later uploaded on their website, added a police officer.Vasisth’s legal and press team has, however, maintained that “Vasisth (aka Vandana Tiwari), is completely innocent and she is not involved in the porn movies racket. She had only shot erotica and there is no pornography in her work.” Meanwhile, another first information report (FIR) has been registered by the Malwani police station following a complaint lodged by a model alleging that she was forced to act in pornographic films by some accused arrested by the property cell, including Rowa Khan. The complainant, a 29-year-old model, has alleged Khan asked her to sign a contract and later forced her to perform an obscene act under duress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaifilm-director-arrested-in-porn-racket-case-101612981627681.html
10-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks Centre’s nod to reopen CoWIN for HCWs to register for vaccine||Maharashtra health department has asked the Centre to reopen the centralised app CoWIN to healthcare workers (HCWs) so that those who have not registered themselves may do so. In Maharashtra, around 500,000 of the 1,500,000 registered HCWs at government and privately-run medical facilities have not registered on CoWIN, which is managing the nationwide vaccination drive. “We have sought permission from the Central government to reopen the app for registration of those HCWs who did not or could not register earlier. Once the approval comes through, the app will be open for registration since vaccination is not permitted without it [registration]. Even for walk-ins, registration on CoWIN is mandatory,” said Dr Dilip Patil, state surveillance officer. Across the state, many HCWs who registered themselves on CoWIN have reported that their names are missing on the app. For instance, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra, registered on CoWIN in November 2020, but learnt his name was missing when he tried to avail a walk-in vaccination at a centre in Pune. Other HCWs like Dr Bhondwe cannot re-register since the deadline for applying on CoWIN was on January 12. Dr Bhondwe said the deadline also came as a surprise. “We were earlier told there would be no deadline for registration on the app. But it was suddenly closed [on January 12],” said Dr Bhondwe. Some doctors chose to not register initially but would like to do so now. “I did not know if the vaccines will have any adverse effects and there was also lack of clarity on who can get vaccinated. Having seen there aren’t any severe adverse effects, I would now like to get vaccinated,” said a doctor from VN Desai Hospital requesting anonymity. Health officers said there is growing interest among HCWs in vaccination although the current turnout in the state stands at 67%. “Not even 1% beneficiaries suffered minor side effects, like fever and body ache. So far, we haven’t received any complaints about severe side effects. This has helped boost the confidence of HCWs,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-centre-s-nod-to-reopen-cowin-for-hcws-to-register-for-vaccine-101612981327787.html
10-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges await final word from local bodies before reopening||Despite the state government announcing that colleges can reopen starting February 15, colleges are still waiting for permission from local civic authorities. According to the reopening guidelines shared by the University of Mumbai (MU) on February 5, colleges should get permission from the local collectors office and as yet, no such intimation has been received by any college.“All department heads at our college got together recently and we have chalked out a plan to ensure bringing back staff and students in a phased manner. A letter to this effect has been sent to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as well as the local collector’s office, and we are waiting to hear from them before announcing re-opening of the institute,” said Neha Jagtani, principal in-charge, RD National College, Bandra. She added that the institute has decided to first start calling back final-year students who need practical classes, then slowly move on to first and second-year students.Last week, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that colleges can reopen starting February 15 with not more than 50% people on campus at any given time. On February 5, MU released a circular stating guidelines as prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) on phased reopening of colleges.For starters, colleges have been asked to give first preference to PhD and research candidates and final-year students to attend physical lectures, while continuing online lectures for the rest of the batches. Other than these batches, online classes will have to remain functional for the other batches, states the circular.The MU circular also clearly states that colleges in the containment zones should not be allowed to start at present, and therefore, the university has asked for colleges to seek permission from the collector’s office before bringing students back on campus. “Ever since the state government and the university declared about reopening of colleges, we have been receiving calls from several students and parents for updates. Many are still unsure if they should be sending their children to college. And we are currently helpless because we cannot start the college until the local authorities notify us,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college on condition of anonymity.While permission to reopen college is one worry, a handful of colleges with hostel facilities are still waiting to hear from the government on when their hostel premises will be surrendered by BMC. “Our hostel was used as a quarantine centre by the civic body. While the hostel is vacant at present, we need a clear signal from the local collector before we can sanitise the premises and only then can we call our students back,” said Dr RK Srivastava, professor and head of department, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education (SIMSREE).At present, the state government is also yet to clarify whether teachers and students will be allowed to travel by train during peak hours (7am to 12 noon and 4pm to 9pm). Colleges said they will officially announce reopening only once these ambiguities are cleared by the respective authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-colleges-await-final-word-from-local-bodies-before-reopening-101612981147632.html
10-02-2021||Mumbai||Employee ID card must to get Covid vaccine: Mumbai civic body||After an incident in which a doctor tried to get his family vaccinated out of turn, employee identification (ID) cards will be mandatory for beneficiaries. To ensure no unauthorised candidate avails Covid-19 vaccine, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed vaccination centres to check employee ID of potential beneficiaries. The civic body is also collecting hospital-wise data of healthcare workers (HCWs) who have registered on the centralised application CoWIN with their employee ID number for cross-verification. Last week, a doctor from Amravati came under the scanner when he included 19 family members and friends in the list of HCWs to be vaccinated at the hospital where he works. This is in violation of the Centre’s guidelines, according to which the first phase of the vaccination drive is for HCWs from public and private medical facilities followed by frontline workers (FLWs) in the second phase, which is currently underway. Each beneficiary receives two shots and all beneficiaries are being vaccinated for free. To prevent situations similar to what happened in Amravati, BMC is adopting measures to verify beneficiaries’ identities. Until now, beneficiaries could verify their identities by showing government-issued ID cards such as Aadhaar and PAN cards. However, now they will have to show their employee IDs. “As the immunisation programme has not been opened to the public yet, all probable beneficiaries must show their employee IDs at the vaccination centres to get inoculated. We have issued instructions to all vaccination centres,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. BMC has also asked public and private hospitals to submit lists of names of HCWs who have registered on CoWIN app for vaccination with their employee ID numbers. “If we do not find the match in the data, we will ask hospitals for a clarification,” said Kakani. He also requested the public to inform the civic body if they hear of any illegal vaccinations. No such violations have been reported in Mumbai so far. Dr Archana Patil, director at the Directorate of Health Services said hospitals would be trusted to provide accurate data of HCWs upon registration. Health activists said that since employee ID was not needed to register for vaccination on CoWIN, some may have misused the facility. “There are thousands of small local hospitals and clinics. The CoWIN app, therefore, should have added the option to include individual employee IDs of the staff which could have stopped such illegal activities,” said health activist Dr Abhijit More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/employee-id-card-must-to-get-covid-vaccine-mumbai-civic-body-101612980967862.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Three arrested for ₹500-crore plot sale fraud||With the arrest of three persons from Sector 39 on Tuesday, the police busted a gang that illegally sold plots in Sushant Lok-1 and Sushant Lok-3, on forged documents, by taking advantage of the high real estate value in the city that attracts investors from other states as well as abroad. It is estimated that the gang, between 2019 and 2020, duped more than 200 unsuspecting buyers and made over ₹500 crore.According to police, they had received at least nine complaints in 2019 and 20 in 2020 from people who alleged that their plots had been sold on forged property documents. Three of the seven gang members who were arrested were identified as Ranveer Kumar of Kapurthala, Rahul Prasad of Jalandhar and Kavita Rani alias Ria Sehgal of Ludhiana, all from Punjab. The police said the other suspects have been in Dubai for the last six months and the suspected kingpin, Sanjay Kathuria, is a repeat offender who had been jailed in the city twice. He had been living in Ghaziabad for the last four years, the police said.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the gang members were well versed in the real estate business. They used to travel to Gurugram when Kathuria allegedly called them to appear as a relative of the plot owners, to complete the registration of the property. “Kathuria was out on bail in 2018, after spending more than six months in jail. Four cases were registered against him at the Sushant Lok and city police stations. He was declared a proclaimed offender by the court in 2019. He moved to Dubai in early 2020 and was operating from there after collecting more than ₹400 crore,” he said. The complainants told the police that unidentified persons had forged documents and sold their plots in Sushant Lok-1, and sectors 56 and 57 to residents of Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Noida, for ₹2 crore and had taken a token of ₹1 crore each plot. In one such incident, one Rajeev Kaul, who has been living in Qatar for the last 12 years, had bought a 180 square yard plot from a developer in February 1992. “I visited Gurugram in October 2019 to get the physical possession letter and a no-objection certificate from the developer. I wanted to start construction on the land but in December 2019, I was informed by a real estate agents that my plot was recently sold by someone on my behalf and the papers of sale deed and some bank cheque lists are being circulated in the market for resale of the same. I was shocked as this was not in my knowledge and I immediately informed the police,” he said. Kaul alleged that all the documents he had submitted to the developer had been leaked and shared with the suspects. The developer concerned could not be reached for comment.Similar cases were reported by people living in other states and countries and more than 29 cases have been registered at the Sushant Lok and Sector 29 police stations. “In many cases, the suspects had broken the gates and locks of the houses and had taken possession of the property. They stayed there posing as relatives of the owner and later sold these plots for crores. In five cases, they had even built two-bedroom apartments and had sold them for ₹5 crore,” Sangwan said. The complainants were paying regular maintenance to the developer and had submitted their identification documents and current addresses as well, which were allegedly leaked to the suspects. Sangwan said a few bank employees and staff of the developers may be involved in the scam and they will be identified soon. “The amount made by the suspects was shared with the close aides, bank staff and developer’s employees. The major share was kept with the kingpin,” he said. The police said during a preliminary investigation, it was revealed that suspects were involved in such frauds in Noida and Ghaziabad as well. The complainants stated that they went to the suspects’ addresses, which was mentioned in the document but did not find them there. The police said that upon their visit to their addresses in Punjab, they were informed that they were history-sheeters and have been jailed several times. There were multiple cases of fraud against them and that they were absconding for many months. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that Sangwan and the crime investigation agency of DLF Phase 4 were allotted the case. Within a month, the Sushant Lok police arrested the suspects. “The suspects confessed to the crime, revealed their modus operandi and shared details of all the gang members and defined the role of each member,” he said. The police recovered forged allotment letters, forged identity cards and forged rubber stamps from their possession. Cases were registered under sections 419 (impersonation), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Sushant Lok and Sector 29 police stations. According to the police, there have been at least 250 cases of plot frauds in the city in the last year. In most of the cases, victims were senior citizens, whose plots and houses were acquired fraudulently. Rao said that the practice of signing an agreement and finalising the deal on stamp paper should be avoided, and that buyers should get the property registration done as per norms. Also, before buying any property, one should check the land with the local revenue officer and other authorities concerned. “The suspects mostly targeted vacant plots, possession of which were taken but remained vacant. They conducted reconnaissance of the areas and prepared a blueprint, based on which forged documents were prepared. They contacted the property dealers of the area and sold the plots,” he said. The police said that they have informed the directorate of the enforcement department (ED) regarding the fraud and sent them a set of documents for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-arrested-for-rs-500-crore-plot-sale-fraud-101612980786793.html

10-02-2021||Mumbai||Unauthorised changes at Khar home: Kangana Ranaut to apply for regularisation||Actor Kangana Ranaut, while withdrawing her appeal against the Dindoshi civil court order, which dismissed her plea against the notice issued to her by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in 2018, informed the Bombay high court (HC) that she would apply for regularisation of the alleged unauthorised changes made in her Khar residence and hence was withdrawing the appeal. The bench has restrained the civic authority from taking coercive action till the regularisation application was considered.On Wednesday, a single bench of justice Prithviraj Chavan, while hearing the actor’s aural was informed by senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf, that in response to the query by the bench in the previous hearing, the actor had decided to file a regularisation application before the BMC in connection with the structure.After hearing the request, the bench permitted the withdrawal and said, “The appellant (Ranaut) is permitted to apply for regularisation before the BMC within a period of four weeks,” and directed the civic authority to decide the same expeditiously.The court further added that in the event of the application having an adverse outcome the BMC would have to wait for two weeks thereafter, to enable the actor to file an appeal. The court said that till then the BMC officials would not take any coercive action.The actor had approached the HC after the Dindoshi civil court on December 22, 2020, had dismissed a notice of motion filed by her against the 2018 BMC notice for the alleged irregularities at her Khar home which is located at the junction of 16th and 18th road. The actor has allegedly combined the three flats in the said building into one unit without proper permissions from the civic authority.In January 2019, the actor had approached the Dindoshi civil court challenging the notice and sought restraining orders to the BMC from taking coercive steps. The court had ordered both parties to maintain the status quo. However, on December 22, 2020, the civil court while dismissing her notice of motion had extended interim protection against coercive action for six weeks to enable her to file an appeal before the high court.In her appeal, Ranaut had sought extension of stay on the demolition notice by BMC and said that the action against her was nothing but “vendetta” and sought time from the court to inform, regarding her application for regularisation of the alleged illegal portion of her premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/unauthorised-changes-at-khar-home-kangana-ranaut-to-apply-for-regularisation-101612980548089.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to convene internal audit meeting to look at Covid expenses, tighten spending||The Delhi government is scheduled to convene a meeting of its internal audit department on Friday, with an aim to tighten the expenditure lists submitted by various departments for the upcoming budget and to scrutinise expenses incurred by departments during the Covid-19 pandemic, said a senior government official in the know of the matter.Earlier this week, the Delhi government had called for the meeting of the internal audit department via a circular that said the agenda of the meeting will be a discussion of problems faced during an internal audit, need for training, periodicity of audit and developing ways to select the expropriate expense heads for audit.A senior official in the finance department said, on condition of anonymity, “The aim of the meeting is to develop ways to tighten the lists of planned and unplanned budget expenditures submitted by several departments for the fiscal 2020-21 budget. More than 100 departments have so far shared their estimates. This year, in light of loss of revenue caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, departments have been told to prioritise projects and keep budgets tight.”The official further said, “The other aim is to develop ways to better scrutinise expenses incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially after department heads were allowed to incur certain expenses, without necessarily getting each file cleared by the finance department.”In September 2020, the government had allowed the heads of departments and secretary ranked officials to authorised departmental expenses of up to ₹1 crore without sending the file through the finance department. For expenses exceeding ₹1 crore, they were authorised to send the files directly to the ministers concerned and forward a cabinet note on the matter.“In any case, departments were exempted from the ritual of compulsorily getting all expenses cleared through the finance department, which was often time-consuming. The decision was taken in light of the emergency that the Covid-19 management entailed. Those expenses have to be internally audited now,” the official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-convene-internal-audit-meeting-to-look-at-covid-expenses-tighten-spending-101612980489434.html

The incident was reported at 9.43am. Mini blasts were heard across Versova. Nearby houses also reported cracks due to the vibrations caused by the blast. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, investigations will be undertaken to ascertain the legality of the structure. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar said the BMC had taken action twice in the past against the godown. “I request the citizens to submit a written application about cylinders kept in the nearby areas. We’ll visit the spots next week and take action. Any business activity, where the storage of hazardous materials is involved, should not be carried out in residential areas. If authorities have given such licenses, l will have them cancelled,” Pednekar said. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator, Ranjana Patil said, “All types of illegal businesses were running in the premises. The BMC should ensure that such illegal businesses are not carried out in future.” A Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB)officer said, “We will investigate whether the structure had permission to operate. The four persons who are injured are the workers at the godown. But we will get complete details after we record their statements.” The Mumbai Police said they will file a case after getting the preliminary report on the incident. Siraaj Inamdar, senior inspector from Versova police station said, “We are awaiting more details from the Mumbai Fire Brigade and BMC. Once we get it, we will book the culprits.” Meanwhile, a resident Dhawal Shah of the Andheri Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens’ Association said, “There is serious need of additional fire station in Andheri (West). In the last two months, eight fire incidents have been reported in Andheri and there is one fire station which is far away at Irla. One additional fire station was proposed at Link Road in Andheri West, but it is not constructed for the last 25 years.” Shah added, “For residents of Versova, Lokhandwala where the population of around five lakh reside, there should not be any more delay in construction of additional fire station to ensure timely firefighting is conducted in fire like that of Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/versova-fire-4-injured-mumbai-mayor-warns-of-action-against-storage-of-hazardous-materials-101612980430228.html

The decision on travel restrictions was taken following an observation made by a three-member team under National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), its director Dr Sujeet Singh, who was in state from Friday to Monday to take stock of the Covid-19 situation. The team pointed out that why the state is not imposing travel restrictions for travellers coming from Kerala. The team had visited Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Yavatmal and pointed out that these areas have a high positivity rate.Similar travel restrictions are already in place for four states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat since November 23.With a total 983,376 cases of Covid-19, Kerala has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases across the country after Maharashtra. It still has the highest active cases — 64,346 — among all the states. On Tuesday, it recorded 5,980 cases, highest in the country. In the last one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 0.6% every day, according to www.covid19india.orgAround 27,826 out of every one million people in Kerala have tested positive for coronavirus, it stated.“Following the powers conferred under Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in the capacity as chairperson, state executive committee, I hereby issue orders to extend the SOP (standard operating procedure) for all the passengers arriving in Maharashtra from the state of Kerala with immediate effect, after careful consideration of planning and containment areas and availability of health infrastructure for strict implementation by the concerned authorities,” states the order issued by the chief secretary Sanjay Kumar on Wednesday.“The passengers travelling in flights from Kerala will have to carry RT-PCR negative test reports before boarding and will have to produce the same on landing at airports in Maharashtra. The RT-PCR sample collection should have been done within 72 hours before the scheduled time of landing at airports in the state,” said Anoop Kumar, secretary relief and rehabilitation (additional charge).Those not having RT-PCR test reports shall have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test at the concerned airports at their own cost. They will be allowed to go home only after undertaking the tests. Those tested positive will have to be treated as per the existing protocol, he said.Kumar further said, “The passengers travelling in trains will also have to produce the RT-PCR negative test report, but the collection of samples should have been done within 96 hours before the scheduled arrival. Those not having negative reports will be screened for symptoms and body temperature at the railway stations, and those having symptoms shall have to undergo antigen tests.”Those coming by roads will have to undergo screening at border check posts. Those with symptoms will have to undergo antigen tests. If found positive, the traveller will have to be admitted to Covid centre and will have to bear the cost of the treatment, he said.“Kerala has highest per day growth in daily Covid-19 cases and a traveller from the state has the potential of spreading the virus in Maharashtra. Considering this, we have decided to bring in travel restrictions for Kerala as a precautionary measure,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-extends-travel-restrictions-for-kerala-after-rise-in-covid-cases-101612980127471.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Experts call for more exits, better enforcement to curb driving on the wrong side||Lack of enforcement, long distances for taking a U-turn and flawed road designs, besides the callous attitude of motorists, are among the key reasons that lead to wrong-side driving in the city, road safety experts said. To tackle the issue, they highlighted that proper enforcement by the police and appropriate road designs are imperative to prevent the offence, which has often led to fatal accidents in the city. Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert with Nagarro, said that one reason why drivers choose to take the wrong carriageway is the long distance between two exits on many stretches. “Stretches of the National Highway-48, Sohna Road and Golf Course Extension Road have a common problem. At certain parts of these stretches, the distance between two exits is nearly three to four kilometres. A lot of road users, hence, drive on the wrong side to avoid travelling the extra distance and to save time. Authorities need to rectify this and create exits for motorists at short distances,” said Bhatt. She said that proper road design audit will help identify the causes behind wrong-side driving and it is also essential for authorities to first collect data correctly and subsequently analyse them.“Another problem is that exact data on wrong-side driving is not available publicly and the police do not share the exact data with external agencies. With proper data on violations, wrong-side driving areas can be identified, and corrective measures can be executed,” said Bhatt, who was also a member of now-defunct Haryana Vision Zero, a programme commissioned by the state government to work on preventing deaths on roads.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that wrong-side driving is also a behavioural issue that stems from poor enforcement. “One of the major reasons behind wrong-side driving is that motorists are aware that in most cases, there will be no consequences due to lack of enforcement. Even though there are stringent penalties, now, for someone getting caught, the problem is that enforcement is either erratic or only carried out for short periods. For the rest of the year, the situation remains as is,” said Sewa Ram. Ram said that the Gurugram police should place signage at spots where the practice is rampant to caution commuters of the consequences and the penalties. CCTV cameras or marshals can ensure greater supervision, he said. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have started registering criminal cases for wrong driving. “Earlier we were challaning the violators, but since the issue is getting serious day by day, we have started registering criminal cases against the offenders. This is the only way to control the rising wrong practices. We have registered seven cases this month and have directed all the teams to ensure the offenders are booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/experts-call-for-more-exits-better-enforcement-to-curb-driving-on-the-wrong-side-101612979106487.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Wrong-side driving can attract FIRs in Gurugram||The police have decided to register FIRs against people found driving on the wrong side of the road in the city, under Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that pertains to rash driving. Following the decision, the police on Tuesday registered FIRs against a man and a woman in Sector 5 and Sector 40, respectively. The police said that since January 1, more than 20 people have been injured and 16 have died in accidents that were caused by wrong-side driving. Police commissioner KK Rao said they have started a drive against wrong-side driving and anyone found violating the rules will face criminal charges. “The incidents of wrong-side driving are increasing across the city, leading to accidents, but the drivers do not take the issue seriously as they were only given challans till now. The drivers who take short routes to save time often end up speeding. Rash driving suspects will now be booked under the IPC and criminal proceedings will be initiated against them,” he said. The police said that even if personnel are not deployed on a particular stretch, criminal cases may be filed through random checking of CCTV cameras.On Tuesday, a 22-year-old man was severely injured after a speeding Santro being driven on the wrong side of the road allegedly rammed his motorbike ahead of a U-turn on the New Railway Road. According to the police, the collision took place around 6pm, when Ritik Singh, a first-year student of a private college in the city, was returning to his residence in Civil Lines. After the collision with the car, he fell on the road due to the impact and suffered severe injuries, said police. The police said that Singh called his brother and informed them about the accident. In the meantime, three men in the car, who were allegedly inebriated, threatened him not to report the incident to police and fled the spot, leaving him bleeding. His brother took him to a private hospital and informed the police. Singh said he took down the registration number of the car and shared it with the police, following which a case was registered. “The men removed my motorbike from the spot and parked it near the bushes to mislead police. The car was speeding and the driver, talking to his friends, did not even notice me and rammed my motorbike,” he said. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC was registered against them at the Sector 5 police station. Police said the car has been traced to a resident of Charki Dadri. In another incident, a 67-year-old woman was injured after a speeding i10 being driven on the wrong side of the road hit her while she was walking outside her house in Sector 40 on Tuesday evening. The victim, identified as Neelam Malhotra, was rushed to a private hospital in Sector 31 and had suffered injuries. The passersby caught hold of the woman driver and informed the police but before the team could reach the spot, the suspect fled the spot. A case under sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC was registered at the Sector 40 police station.The driver has been identified but is yet to be arrested, said police. Rao said that teams have been directed to conduct investigations and file the challans against the suspects, at the earliest, in court. “The suspects will face trials in court and might get six-month imprisonment along with a fine. Even if the violators are not responsible for accidents, they will be booked as it could be the likely cause of the accident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wrongside-driving-can-attract-firs-in-gurugram-101612979107203.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Commuters at Kherki Daula don’t have to maintain minimum FASTag balance||Commuters at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, and other toll plazas across the country, will not have to worry about maintaining a minimum balance in their SMARTags, as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Wednesday decided to remove the mandatory minimum threshold amount for the FASTag account, which was paid by the user in addition to a security deposit. The payment of toll fees through FASTag will become mandatory from February 15. The NHAI, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said that the decision has been taken in order to increase the FASTag penetration, ensure seamless movement of traffic and reduce avoidable delays at the toll plazas.The problem, NHAI said, arose because the issuer banks had fixed a minimum amount value for the FASTag account due to which users were not allowed to pass through the toll plaza despite having sufficient balance to pay the toll. The authority said that this caused vehicles to get stuck at the toll plazas. “It has been decided that the users will now be allowed to pass through the toll plaza, if the FASTag account/ wallet balance is non-negative. After crossing the toll plaza, if the account balance becomes negative, the bank can recover the amount from the security deposit, which should be replenished at the time of the next recharge by the user,” the direction issued by NHAI read. NHAI officials said that penetration of FASTags was around 80% at Kherki Daula and this step will benefit commuters. A senior official of the Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire, said that removing the minimum balance norm will help commuters as a large number of them have functional FASTags but without minimum balance. “This will reduce jams and delays at the plaza,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/commuters-at-kherki-daula-don-t-have-to-maintain-minimum-fastag-balance-101612979048908.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Cap on social gatherings removed, but 50% rule remains||The district administration on Wednesday, retaining the 50% capacity rule for gatherings, lifted the ceiling on the number of persons allowed to attend events in closed spaces. So far, a maximum of 200 people were being allowed, irrespective of the 50% capacity rule. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who is also the chairperson District Disaster Management Authority, issued an unlock order on Wednesday, stating the standard operating procedures (SOP) for areas outside the containment zones. On January 27, in a directive issued by the union ministry of home affairs (MHA), states were asked to issue specific guidelines for regulations on social, religious, sports, entertainment, education, cultural or religious gatherings. The order issued by Garg stated that all gatherings in closed spaces will be restricted to 50% of the hall capacity i.e. 500 persons in the hall capacity of 1,000, 250 in halls with a capacity of 500 and 100 in halls with a capacity of 200. “The district has adopted the MHA guidelines where gatherings are permitted with certain regulations based on the closed space capacity,” said Garg. In open spaces, there will be no limit on the gatherings. However, it has to be ensured that there is sufficient space for people to follow social distancing norms, the order stated.In other public spaces, swimming has already been permitted in public pools, but SOPs for the same are awaited. Increased seating capacity has also been allowed in cinema halls and regulations on interstate and interdistrict travel being done away with. Although the instances of SARS-CoV-2 infections have declined in the city, activities are still restricted in containment zones and will remain in force till February 28, said officials. On Wednesday, 28 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed, taking the tally to 58,419. Due to a decline in test positivity rate and higher recovery rate, the number of active cases is at 351. Of these, 30 are seriously-ill patients, four are in district Covid care centres, while remaining 317 are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cap-on-social-gatherings-removed-but-50-rule-remains-101612979047617.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Sadar Bazar road to be off limits for vehicle on a trial basis||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will start a week-long trial of restricting vehicular movement on a 600-metre stretch in Sadar Bazar on February 22, commencing a redesign project that has been on the cards since 2019. Officials said that depending on the outcome of the trial, the MCG will take a call on enforcing the no-vehicle rule permanently, by installing hydraulic barriers and redesigning the area. MCG officials said that the trial will be executed on the 600-metre stretch between Jama Masjid and the Head Post Office.Set up in the 1930s, Sadar Bazar is the city’s oldest market with more than 1,500 shops. It is heavily congested and the narrow lanes compound the matter. On weekends, the daily footfall is around 20,000. As per MCG officials, more than 90% of the street users in the market are pedestrians and the redesign is being done to create equitable space for them. Sadar Bazar’s redesign has been on the cards since August 2019, with the then MCG commissioner Amit Khatri citing the example of the redesign of Karol Bagh market by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC). In Delhi, a 700-metre stretch of the market was turned into a vehicle-free zone, following which the MCG planned to implement similar measures at Sadar Bazar. For the trial, the MCG will place temporary barriers at the entry and exit points to ensure no vehicles can pass through. Besides, the MCG is also setting up a dedicated vending zone for street vendors in the market.“A few months ago, we had launched an urban street design competition, which also included remodelling the 600-metre stretch at Sadar Bazar. We’ll be incorporating around 70% of the elements from the design plan which secured first place in the competition. The remaining 30% has been modified by the MCG to suit the needs of the people visiting there,” said Jitender Garg, joint commissioner, MCG.Garg said that certain elements, such as the allocation of parking space or the design of street vending zone, in the design proposals that were awarded the second and third places are more suitable to the on-ground requirements.“Initially, the redesigning will be done for one week only. Depending on its success we’ll take a call on making it a permanent feature along with few modifications if needed,” said Garg.He further said that he would hold a meeting with around 15 representatives of various associations of Sadar Bazar to explain the design model and apprise them of the week-long trial.“While we support MCG’s initiative for making the market a no-vehicle zone, we’ll need clarity on whether this may lead to a reduction in visitors or have long-term gains. A majority of shopkeepers are under heavy losses due to the coronavirus outbreak. Any further loss due to a reduction in customers will be a major setback for us. So, the implementation has to be done keeping this perspective in mind,” said Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Traders Association. Garg said that the steps towards the trial have already started, with the MCG seizing items of around 25 street vendors who were encroaching the pathway and issuing notices to around 20 shopkeepers for allowing street vendors to be stationed outside their premises.In December last year, the ministry of housing and urban affairs had carried out Streets for People Challenge at a national level, with the MCG anchoring the competition in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sadar-bazar-road-to-be-off-limits-for-vehicle-on-a-trial-basis-101612979048214.html
10-02-2021||Gurugram||Work on Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram to be done by August: NHAI||Work on two phases of Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram will be completed by August this year, as more than half the key works on the stretch have been completed, highway authority officials said on Wednesday. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that barring one plot near Kherki Daula, work on the entire stretch is going on at a fast pace and that the Gurugram portion of the 29-kilometre-long road would be completed in the next few months. Several key road projects have been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and issues related to land acquisition. On Tuesday, Gurugram’s member of Parliament and union minister of state, Rao Inderjit Singh, had called upon the union transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, to discuss the Dwarka Expressway and shifting of Kherki Daula toll plaza. The Dwarka Expressway will connect Kherki Daula and Shiva temple at Mahipalpur in Delhi. The road will have a toll plaza near Bijwasan and will reduce traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. The road project is being developed in four phases with two each in Gurugram and Delhi. The ₹7,000-crore project was handed over by the Haryana government to the NHAI in 2016, after multiple delays. “The deadline for phases three and four of Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram was December 2020, but due to lockdown, the work suffered delays as large number of workers migrated. Now, the situation is under control and work is going on at a good pace. The only minor hiccup is the transfer of a plot at Kherki Daula, which, if expedited, could help in early completion,” said a senior official, who is not authorised to speak to media. The official said that work on phases 1 and 2 is also expected to be completed in time.Rao Inderjit Singh said that timely completion of the Dwarka Expressway, Sohna Road, U-turn at Ambience Mall is their top priority. “Dwarka Expressway has been a work in progress for the last decade and the project needs an early conclusion. I also raised the issue of shifting of Kherki Daula toll plaza as the concessionaire has earned more revenue than the money spent on constructing and maintaining the expressway,” he said. Shifting of Kherki Daula toll plaza has been delayed due to land litigation at Panchgaon. It has been a long-standing demand of the thousands of residents of developing sectors and people working in Manesar-based factories. Singh also said that he informed Gadkari that work on flyovers at Bilaspur Chowk, Kapdiwas Chowk and Bawal Chowk had progressed only on paper in three years. “I also raised the need for foot overbridges on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, as there are frequent accidents. I was assured by Gadkari ji that all these issues would be taken on priority and resolved,” said Singh. The union transport minister directed the officials to review work on these projects every 15 days and apprise him the status of work and completion timelines, said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/work-on-dwarka-expressway-in-gurugram-to-be-done-by-august-nhai-101612979046484.html

10-02-2021||Pune||Content writers accept love-letter orders before Valentine’s day||Writing a letter to a loved one may be de rigueur on Valentine’s Day, February 14, but in 2021, a new trend has emerged – outsource the task to a professional writer. Abhijit Sonawane and Amruta Desarda, who run Saarad Majkur, a content writing firm in Navi peth have introduced the concept: ‘”You love someone and we will write a love letter for you”. A post of the concept went viral on social media. “We launched this concept on Saturday (February 6). An idea came while I was having a discussion with my wife Amruta regarding the charm of writing love letters in this era of social media. We came up with a thought of writing a letter for people and posted it on Facebook,” said Sonawane. In the last four days the couple has received 30 phone calls and they have already written 10 letters. “Calls which we are receiving are from different age groups – one I received from Satara - a boy broke up with his girlfriend and he wanted us to pen down a letter through which he can patch up again.” “In one case, a person above 40 said he had written many letters to his soulmate during college, but after marriage he has not written any. Now for this Valentine’s Day, he wants us to pen down his feelings for his wife,” added Sonawane. The firm is open to write letters in three languages – English, Hindi and Marathi, and charges ₹1,000 per letter. The letter will be typed on a coloured paper and it will be delivered in a heart-shaped box with a chocolate. “We are comfortable in all three languages. Our main purpose is our clients feelings should be conveyed in proper words and it is our sole purpose,” explains Desarda, who is lawyer by profession, but left her profession for the love of writing and joined Sonawane, who left journalism in 2015 to open his content writing firm. Sachin Sasar, a senior clerk at a city hospital and a client of Saarad Majkur, says, “In my 38 years I had never written a letter to my wife as I never managed to pen down my feelings. When I heard this concept from mutual friend, I thought I will give it a try and letter has come out really well. It will be a unique gift to my wife.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/content-writers-accept-love-letter-orders-before-valentine-s-day-101612977306240.html

Now that the area has widened in past few years, installation of six new systems will help to monitor air quality in a better way,” said an official from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Pune, on condition of anonymity.Along with Pune, MPCB has also decided to add 41 new stations across the state. Currently, there are 101 air inspection quality centres in the state out of which 78 centres are manual and 23 are monitored via continuous ambient air quality monitoring system.According to officials, there are also other criteria like controlling industrial smoke, vehicular emission, biomass burning which should be checked to improve air quality.The urbanisation and increase of vehicular movement have deteriorated the air quality of the city. “MPCB undertakes preventive measures to control air pollution, but lack of public support has made things harder for us. In the coming days, we will also launch a few more programmes in the city to raise awareness about air pollution,” said the official quoted above.Last year, in the same initiative, Pune city had received funds of ₹62 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-to-get-six-more-air-quality-monitoring-systems-101612977187575.html

10-02-2021||Delhi||R-Day violence: Dead farmer’s kin move Delhi HC for court monitored SIT probe||The family of a 25-year-old man, who died after his tractor overturned at Central Delhi’s ITO during the protesting farmers' tractor parade on the Republic Day, moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the incident.The petition, which is likely to be listed for hearing on Thursday, is filed by deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather who has sought enforcement of his right to fair investigation and justice as well as the right to know the truth about his grandson’s death.According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour from the pre-agreed route for the march.The police had claimed that the man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned.However, the petition said that as per eye-witness accounts reported in the media, Navreet was driving his tractor past the Andhra Education Society in New Delhi, and he was allegedly shot by policemen, due to which he lost control of his tractor which thereafter collided with some barricades and overturned.The plea, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Soutik Banerjee, Mannat Tipnis and Devika Tulsiani, sought for a court appointed and court monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising police officers with a demonstrably impeccable record of professional integrity, honesty and efficiency, to carry out time bound investigation into the death of the petitioner Hardeep Singh’s grandson Navreet Singh.It also sought a direction that the SIT shall file periodic status reports before the court to ensure a time bound court monitored investigation.“The petitioner’s grandson was lying in a critically injured condition under the overturned tractor, however, despite the presence of a large number of police men including senior police officials in the vicinity, no attempts were made by Delhi Police to provide immediate critical medical intervention to save the life of the petitioner’s grandson.“Instead, the Delhi Police resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent other protestors from reaching the site where the tractor lay with the petitioner’s grandson’s body underneath. No efforts were made by the Delhi Police to cordon off the site of the incident and to collect time sensitive material evidence from the site, which was allowed to be erased and destroyed,” the petition claimed.It alleged that no steps, as mandated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, were taken by the police after the unnatural death of Navreet to carry out inquest proceedings.“In the face of such apathy and hostility by the Delhi Police, the body of the petitioner’s grandson was recovered by other farmers and later handed over to the petitioner’s family, who took the body to their native place in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh,” it said.The plea said that the entire incident was captured by multiple CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity, however, the police cited technical difficulties and did not facilitate the farmers in viewing the CCTV footage.It said the victim’s post mortem was conducted the next day at the District Hospital in Rampur but the video or x-ray reports were not shared with the family.It said the medical/ forensic experts who have reviewed the description of injuries in the post mortem report have independently made statements, reported by various media houses, opining that the injuries are consistent with firearm / gunshot wounds and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning, as has been repeatedly asserted and announced by the Delhi Police.“The haste with which the Delhi Police has made public statements declaring the incident to be an accident, as well as registered FIRs against senior journalists who have pursued the possibility of Navreet Singh’s death having resulted from a firearm injury, inspires no confidence in the petitioner that the Delhi Police would conduct a fair and honest investigation into the death / murder of his grandson,” it claimed.The petition has arrayed Home Department of Delhi government, SHO of IP Estate police station here, SHO of Bilaspur police station in UP and Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur as parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-violence-dead-farmer-s-kin-move-delhi-hc-for-court-monitored-sit-probe-101612975406665.html

Excerpts from the media interaction at SPPU campus.What has been the role of Ayurveda in Covid prevention?We have not only carried out profile and chemical studies, but have also started pre-clinical studies. It is been conducted in department of biotechnology (DBT), department of science and technology (DST), department of pharmaceuticals (DPT) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) laboratories and other government of India organisations. What we found is that these candidates have developed very good anti-virus activity against Covid-19, some of the plants are as effective as Remdesivir. The initial trend is encouraging for our research work. Another interesting study which we found is that Ashwagandha is equally effective as Hydroxychloroquine. It is also a randomise control trial. The purpose of the consortium is also to take this research study at a further level.Your observation on increased demand for Ayush products during the Covid periodDue to large-scale sensitisation and steps taken by Ayush towards mitigation of Covid, the commerce of Ayush has increased. In the last one year, the Ayush sector has seen 44 per cent growth. Some of the products have seen tremendous growth with 500 to 700 per cent post the Covid outbreak. For example, Chavanprash products have seen 700 per cent of growth, Ashwagandha export increased three times than the previous periods. These figures underline the fact that converting research outcome with public acceptance into commerce will benefit all. Generally, students prefer to pursue career in modern medicines than Ayurveda. What is the way forward? It is a popular myth. In this academic year after the NEET exams, many states reported vacant seats in medical colleges and some of the premium Ayurveda institutions were filled up. It is true that in general students prefer MBBS course which is normal, but it does not mean that Ayurveda courses are not in demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ayush-products-see-44-rise-in-sale-post-covid-outbreak-vaidya-rajesh-kotecha-101612972985581.html

A lot of scope is seen based on science. We are into 114 studies as of now and these studies were robustly designed. They have given us results with effective human resource. If we upgrade these studies then it will be an asset for our country.

The civic officials credit the narrowing of gender gap to awareness programmes targeting young and middle-aged women. In 2019, the sex ratio in Pune city had seen a drastic drop to 904. It was 932 in 2016 and since then the drop in sex ration was registered. Dr Kalpana Baliwant, PMC assistant health chief responsible for the implementation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) in the city, said that the department has undertaken various awareness initiatives to improve the sex ratio scenario.“We are targeting women who are middle-aged and working professionals. These women are in a position to take a decision and are also influencers in their respective families and neighbourhood. Hence, we decided to change the target audience for awareness campaigns,” said Baliwant.The official said that the health department is also holding awareness campaigns at IT companies, government offices and other workplaces targeting women staff.“We should focus on women who are influencers in the family. We have made short films showcasing how our societies are changing. How girls are more independent now. Positive stories of changed narration are the base. This will help us change the mindset of people with respect to the girl child. And will also help and encourage the birth of a girl child,” said Baliwant.City-based women rights activist Kiran Moghe welcomed the improved sex ratio of Pune city.“The improved sex ratio is the proof that effective implementation of the PCPNDT act by the health department can work wonders. It is important that the awareness work continues and this positive change further reflects this year as well,” said Moghe.

Small exporters are not coming forward and only big players are exporting. As there is uncertainty about the lockdown in many countries, it is creating a challenge for grape producers and exporters.”Khapre added, “This year, the grape quality is very good and grapes are in enough quantity. Daily, 50 to 60 containers are going to Europe. At least 15,000 metric tonnes of grapes have been exported this year. But, due to the uncertainty, farmers need to pay extra transport costs. Only supermarkets are on in Europe and retail and wholesale markets are closed, which also affects exports.”Nanasaheb Patil, a farmer from Nashik district who is also director of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration (Nafed), said , “Export of grapes is going on, but for the last few days farmers are getting lower prices. Even the transport cost increased this year.”Vineyard owner Vilas Gangurde said, “This year, the production is better of good quality, but due to the uncertainty, I prefer to sell the produce in local markets instead of exporting.”Maharashtra is a major grape producer in the country with at least three lakh hectares under grape cultivation. Average grape exports from India are around 2.5 lakh metric tonnes more than 70 per cent of which is from Maharashtra.Where the grapes goIndia exports grapes to the Netherland, Russia, UK, Bangladesh, Germany, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malyasia, Canada, China, and Denmark, besides other countriesYear Quantity in metric tonnnes exported2017- 18 1,88,2212018- 19 2,46,1332019-20 1,93,6902020-21 15,000 metric tonnes (only to Europe; figures not available for other countries)Source: Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15000-metric-tonnes-of-grapes-exported-so-far-but-covid-issues-in-europe-raise-challenges-for-exporters-101612958462209.html

Swapnil Kolte-Patil, 32, had created his identity as a promising literary figure in a short span of time through his historical novel and poems. He died in a road accident at Uruli Kanchan on Solapur highway when another vehicle hit his two-wheeler on January 27. Kolte-Patil’s friends have taken the initiative to sell his newly published novel “Mukaddar” that narrates the life of Mughal ruler and emperor of India (1658–1707) Aurangzeb. According to the young writer’s friend, “Mukaddar” was published just a few days before Kolte died in the accident. They feel that his writings are the only memories of him and his family needs support. Kolte-Patil is survived by his wife, two children and an elderly mother. His fellow writers and publisher have been encouraging people to buy his newly published book and the funds collected will be deposited in the name of Kolte-Patil’s 10-year-old daughter and three-year-old son. “We had kept a target of selling 5,000 copies of “Mukaddar” in a month. Except for the printing cost, money collected from the sale will go to his family. Sharad Tandale, the publisher of the book, has offered to not take any commission. We are managing distribution of the book to check expenditure. As most writers do not earn enough for a decent living, we all have come together to support his family,” said Abhishek Kumbhar, writer. According to the publisher, 5,000 copies of “Mukaddar” were sold in just 10 days and 5,000 more copies are being printed. Kolte-Patil became known in literary circles after his poem collection “Unad” was published. He was also popular as a “shahir” (ballard poet). “We had started to work on a novel named “Sheredakkhan”. It would have been our first novel together. I am working on this book. Meanwhile, we are taking steps to help his family and secure the future of his two kids,” said Ketan Puri, writer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/literary-fraternity-in-pune-helps-young-writer-s-bereaved-family-by-selling-his-book-101612957562918.html

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party bagged 56 divisions, while BJP secured 48 divisions and MIM won in 44 divisions and Congress won in two divisions, in the 150-seat civic body. The BJP's strength has come down to 47 following the death of one of its members. The saffron party, which gave run for TRS money has also decided to put up its candidates for both Mayor and Deputy Mayor, its chief spokesperson K Krishna Saagar Rao said. "BJP is contesting for both Mayor and Deputy Mayoral positions in the spirit of democracy and to oppose the opportunist, dubious election of TRS party's design to attain Mayor position through backhand deal with AIMIM. TRS did not get people's mandate to run GHMC, the mandate was fractured and leaned massively towards BJP," he told PTI. TRS sources said their Mayoral and Deputy Mayoral candidates names will be given to its members in sealed covers. The Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs, who have their vote in the city are ex-officio members of the corporation. Besides, MLCs and Rajya Sabha members, who have their vote in the city, have to give an option, choosing the GHMC, to be able to vote, official sources said.

10-02-2021||Bangalore||Inadequate public transport forces dependence on pvt vehicles in India: Experts||Rapido, a mobility startup, on Wednesday launched two-wheeler motorcycle rental services across six cities in the country, including Bengaluru, that allows continuity of services for its growing number of users in urban centres.The launch indicates how startups are cashing in on the increased demand for private vehicles as the preferred choice for commuting in the face of a steady decline of public transportation services usage for reasons that include time, poor connectivity and fears of contracting Covid-19, which remains as potent a threat in urban centres as it was a year before.With fares ranging from ₹99 for 10km to ₹599 for 60km, the services offered are not just cheaper than other available commute options, including four-wheeler cab aggregators, but are also a more effective mode of transport in congested and overcrowded urban centres where two-wheelers are preferred to easily navigate traffic snarls, narrow roads and save time among other advantages.Also Read | 2020 worst year in history for air travel demand: IATAThe services were launched in Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Jaipur.“In the last few months, we have noticed a rising need for multi-stop, affordable and easily accessible rides among customers, especially our high usage customers. With Rapido Rental, we aim to address the need of such users who have a use case of multi-point travel,” Aravind Sanka, co-founder, Rapido, said in a statement.Other startups like Vogo and Bounce have also seen a surge in demand for their two-wheeler shared services in cities like Bengaluru that beat 414 other cities across 57 countries to win the title of having the worst traffic globally in 2019.The list by Tom Tom, a Netherlands-based global provider of navigation, listed Mumbai, Pune and New Delhi as the other Indian cities who made it to the top 10 of the list in 2019.A 2020 report by Tom Tom to gauge the return of congestion in the post-pandemic world, pointed out that road traffic in India’s four biggest cities--Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Pune--have crawled back to pre-pandemic levels after almost a year of lockdown.Delays in completion of key mass-transit projects like Metro, suburban rail and shortcomings in reviving fledgling public buses are weighing in on the rapidly shifting dynamics of city commutes across the country. A process that has hastened since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.V.Ravichandar, a Bengaluru-based urban infrastructure expert, said that authorities can soften the impact of delays in construction like that of the Metro by augmenting bus services as a viable transport option.“Emphasis on public transportation whether it be through bus fleet augmentation or expediting the Metro construction overall has taken a back seat, leaving the space for private cars which leads to traffic jams and associated problems,” he said.In a city like Bengaluru that is situated over 820 sqkm, the Metro, which accounts for the highest public expenditure, barely transports 500,000 of the total 10 million population at the peak of its usage. Most of the city’s IT corridors like Whitefield, Outer Ring Road and Electronic City are yet to be connected by Metro, forcing professionals in India’s IT capital to pursue, what is possibly, an irreversible trend of dependence on private vehicles.The other problem experts have often raised is the lack of a coordinated approach and strategy to connect or intertwine different modes of transport to make it more transition.Dependence on private vehicles has also given a free hand to authorities to appropriate tree-felling to widen roads, albeit in pockets, that shifts bottlenecks rarely addressing the real problems faced by millions living in unplanned and rapidly growing urban centres across the country.The rapid erosion of green cover, heightened construction activity to house the large number of migrant workers among others and increasing number of private vehicles on city roads have also contributed to deteriorating quality of life due to pollution.While electric mobility has seen increased adoption, it does not have the answer to physical vehicles on the road, lack of parking spaces and other problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/inadequate-public-transport-forces-dependence-on-pvt-vehicles-in-india-experts-101612946102211.html

The petitioners, a 36-year-old man and 17-year-old girl, got married on January 21, 2021 as per Muslim ceremonies but against the wishes of their family members. Justice Sarin observed that the petitioners cannot be deprived of their fundamental rights because their family members were against the marriage.The court in its judgment referred to Article 195 of Muslim Personal Law saying that a Muslim girl on attaining the age of puberty was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice.Article 195 of the Muslim Personal Law says, “Every Mohomedan (Muslim) of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage. Lunatics and minors who have not attained puberty may be validly contracted in marriage by their respective guardians. A marriage of a Mohomedan who is (of) sound mind and has attained puberty is void if it is brought about without his consent.”The court therefore observed that the girl, being over 17 years of age was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice as both the petitioners are of marriageable age as per the Muslim Personal Law.The court also directed Mohali SSP to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and security of the couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/muslim-law-allows-minor-girls-to-marry-on-attaining-puberty-punjab-and-haryana-hc-101612944075257.html
10-02-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: Pune’s history goes back 2000 years… Satavahana era revealed||So far, the story of Pune has taken us through obscure lanes of prehistoric and proto-historic periods, where we witnessed the activities of early Punekars. But, until recently there has no discussion about the “historical” man who inhabited the landscape in the form of some significant material evidence. As we saw in previous pieces, the historical period for India begins when the evidence of readable script and significant material remains is noticed, which coincides with foundation of Buddhist and Jain religion in sixth century BCE. For the Deccan region, which Pune is part of, the sporadic Ashokan inscriptions dating to third century BCE form the first evidence, but the rise in number of settlements can be seen during Satavahana period which is the first empirical dynasty rising amongst various ruling clans in the Deccan. The Satavahanas find mention in Puranas and are known to rule from latter half of second century BCE to third century CE. They are also credited with extending patronage to various Buddhist caves in the region and several inscriptions in Brahmi script are found in rock-cut caves in western Maharashtra. Numismatists (studying coins) and epigraphists (studying inscriptions), have helped us refine the chronology of the various Satavahana rulers as well as the important contemporary dynasties and their vassals. The principle town and capitals during that period were Junnar, Nashik and Paithan, where excavations have yielded archaeological remains of these times. For the sake of ease, although approximately, the politically reigns of important dynasties have been used to classify certain periods of history. But, it doesn’t mean all the evidence found from that period is due to direct patronage or belongs to the political rule. There had been reports of Satavahana period habitation sites or early historic sites in the vicinity of Pune till 2002-2003. Such sites have been reported from Junnar, Songaon, Inamgaon, Pavana valley, Shirval, near Indapur, etc. But, the humble town of Pune was never thought of supporting any early historic remains. Bhosari explorations had also yielded remains of pottery from this early historic period. Senior historian, Pandrang Balkawade has been traversing the bylanes of Kasba peth of Pune for years now as he went to work, or daily visited Bharat Itihas Samshodhak Mandal for study of medieval history. Being a scholar of archival study, one may imagine him getting lost in the glorious folds of chronicles of Maratha history, but not particularly observe anything significant amongst the mundane rubbles of new constructions being erected in the old Kasba peth area. But, inquisitive Balkawade noticed the foundations pits dug for new building yielding unusual amount of potsherds and ceramics, which definitely seemed to be of older origin (2002-2003). Intrigued by the discovery, he invited Dr Rajguru and Dr Vasant Shinde of Deccan College to conduct an enquiry into these rather unusual finds. As discussed in my earlier writings, conducting a full- scale excavation in a bustling old town is an uphill task. But, the salvaging operation was done as part of an “Urban excavation” to study the archaeological material in the pits. The entire study area was located to right bank of the river Mutha. The studied pits were located in the foundations at Ashtekar wada, Lawalekar wada, Tapare wada and two pits in Kagajipura. which was a medieval settlement manufacturing paper from Shaiste Khan’s occupancy of Pune in 17th century CE. The area that was encompassing these scattered pits was roughly 10 hectares. Later, from 2004 to 2006, some more pits located in Pawale chowk, Kasba Ganpati temple, Satatoti chowk, Jogeshwari temple, Shaniwar peth and assorted locations were studied. Dr Joglekar’s team’s study later reconfirmed that these were not the scattered sites, but a continuous township which was occupied permanently. Geographically, the two main southern tributaries of river Mutha, Ambil and Nagzhari flow to the river and the seasonal flood deposits of these streams and river have alluvial terraces on the base basalt bedrock. These natural terraces were secured and selected for occupation by the historical inhabitants for security and to access the river water. Dr Rajuguru and his team of geo-archaeologist who studied the strata and hydrology noted that in this part of the Holocene period, the area saw better rainfall and better vegetation which led to an increase in the number of permanent habitation sites. This was seen all across the Deccan and especially along river banks. The deposits were in the layers of approximately three metres of which 1.3 metres dated to the Satavahana era (second century BCE to third century CE). Like in the case of many historical archaeology excavations, the pottery and ceramics were reported in large numbers. They not only help us date the historical layers, but also provide an insightful peep into the food habits, cooking processes and manufacturing techniques of those times. We shall see these types and their significance in the next part of this column. Apart from the pottery, there were many shell bangles, beads, terracotta animal figurines, terracotta beads were reported. Terracotta beads might have been used in slings or in ornaments. A rotary quern which was seen in early historically sites, possibly a Roman influence, were also found. The later versions used for grinding grains are seen in many rural households even today. Skin rubbers known as vajri in Marathi were found (ancestors definitely paid attention to personal hygiene!). Medieval, colourful glass bangles were found in excavations Metal objects, minor antiquities were reported from the site. Some bone points sharpened that can be used on arrows hunting were found. Many animal remains including bones of cattle, goat, rat and wild animals such as Nilgai and Black buck were reported. Fish bones were reported pointing to fresh water fishing activity. A brick wall made of the early historic period bricks (more than foot long) were found at Ashtekar wada marking a significant structural find. Busting the previous theories of Pune originating in Rashtrakuta times or even during Maratha period in 17th century, the study of evidences from these pits changed the history of Pune forever and took it back 2,000 years ago to Satavahana times! It also informed us that Pune was under continuous occupation for the last 2s000 years. And yet another significant highlight of this “salvage excavation” will be revealed where we trace Pune’s international connection in the next column!

10-02-2021||Patna||Bihar budget: Builders seek lower registration rate, amnesty for illegal flats||Ahead of the Bihar budget, builders and real estate players have demanded a reduction in registration charges on property sale deeds, increase in urbanisation and region-wise building bylaws to give fillip to construction activity in small towns in the state.In a presentation before deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad recently, builders and members of state CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India) put forth a slew of demands to seek incentives from the state government.“Our main demand from the government is that registration cost of sale deeds of properties, especially apartments, should be lowered in urban areas as the rates are very high. Those purchasing flats have to pay 10% in registration cost and another 5% in GST, which amounts to 15% for legalising the documents and possession. In other states including Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, the registration cost is much lower, hovering around 3 -5%. Registration rate reduction will only add to the volume of registration,” said Manikant, state president, CREDAI.Several builders seemed to back the argument that a reduction in registration charges will encourage more registrations and reduce litigation. “It’s in the interest of the state government to reduce registration charges so that more properties get legalised and litigations are reduced. Registration should not be seen as a medium of revenue alone,” said another builder, not wishing to be quoted.In this fiscal year, the state registration department has earned ₹3,000 crore till January end as against the target of ₹4,500 crore. The shortfall is attributed to Covid, impact including economic contraction and an overall slump in the real estate sector.The builders lobby is also demanding greater urbanisation in Bihar with region-wise building by-laws tailored to suit construction activity in cities like Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Purnia and Bhagalpur apart from other small towns.They argue that existing building by-laws have strict specifications for construction like wide roads, drainage, sewerage among others which constraints projects in smaller cities.“There should be region-wise building by-laws tailored to the infrastructure available in smaller cities so that parameters and specifications are less strict. This will help builders to take more projects in smaller cities and lead to higher urbanisation,” Manikant added.Also Read:Bihar juvenile board tells minor to plant 20 trees in school as punishmentThe builders association has also sought an amnesty scheme for apartments facing action for violation of building by-laws. “There are a large number of apartments categorised as illegal because the builders violated by-laws in. But these buildings are already occupied and no water connection or roads is making them suffer. These constructions could be legalised through an amnesty scheme,” said Narendra Kumar, another builder who was in the meeting.“We are hopeful that some incentives for builders will come in the state budget,” said Kumar.The budget session of the state legislature will start from February 19 and the budget will be presented on February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-budget-builders-seek-lower-registration-rate-amnesty-for-illegal-flats-101612938784441.html

Moga deputy superintendent of police (City) Barjinder Singh said that Narinderpal Singh Sidhu, the husband of Moga ward number 9 candidate Paramjeet Kaur, ran over his Mitsubishi Pajero SUV on the two Shiromani Akali Dal workers, killing Harminder Singh on the spot, while Jagdeep Singh succumbed to injuries at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC), Ludhiana, on Wednesday morning. Harminder belonged to Moga town and Jagdeep was a resident of Tarewala village in the district. Sidhu was arrested along with two Congress supporters, Jasmail Singh and Pamma. A search is on for Sidhu’s son Jaslovepreet Singh and five other Congress workers. All nine Congress activists have been booked under Section 302 (murder) and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at the city police station. Departmental inquiry against police personnel at spotAccording to police sources, the incident took place in the presence of the police at 9.15 pm on Tuesday. Two police control room (PCR) personnel and the in-charge of the Focal Point police post were present at the crime spot.When contacted, Moga senior superintendent of police Harmanbir Singh said, “A departmental inquiry has been initiated against the police personnel present at the spot. If any negligence is found, strict action will be taken against them.”Argument led to scuffle before murder Ward number 9 in Moga is reserved for women. Sidhu’s wife Paramjeet Kaur of the Congress is pitted against Kulwinder Kaur of the Shiromani Akali Dal. Gurbhej Singh Kular, the husband of the SAD candidate, was campaigning for her with his supporters when both sides had a confrontation on Tuesday night. DSP Barjinder Singh said, “Both sides had an argument that led to a scuffle. In a fit of anger, Sidhu ran over his SUV on the two Akali workers. Besides impounding the Pajero, a Mahindra Bolero SUV was also confiscated from the spot. The other accused will be arrested soon.” We condemn the incident: Congress MLA Makhan Singh Brar, the area in-charge of the SAD, said, “After campaigning, Kulwinder, her husband and supporters were standing on the street when Sidhu, the husband of the Congress candidate, started abusing our workers. Our workers exercised restraint and didn’t reply but Sidhu and his supporters brought about 10 vehicles and ran over two of our workers.” Moga Congress MLA Harjot Kamal Singh said, “The party has nothing to do with this incident. It is the result of personal enmity. We do not support any violence and condemn this incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moga-congress-candidate-s-husband-mows-down-two-akali-activists-held-101612938481872.html
10-02-2021||West||At Bengal rally, JP Nadda says ‘development possible only when Mamata leaves’||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) national president JP Nadda on Wednesday said that ‘kamal’ was the way ahead in West Bengal, which is slated to hold assembly elections later this year, reported news agency ANI.Promising development in the poll-bound state, Nadda said “development will be possible only when Mamata Ji leaves and lotus blooms.” He was addressing the party’s 'Cha Chakra' program at Hariatara village ground in Kharagpur.Taking a swipe at chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government, the BJP chief said that those who won the elections in the name of 'Ma, Mati, Manush', are now engaged in "dictatorship, appeasement and strongarm tactics".The remark came a day after Banerjee had urged the people to show the door to BJP, saying, "Bidai dao, bidai dao, BJP ke bidai dao... They have turned India into a crematorium. They want to turn Bengal into the same. We will not allow this. In the coming days, 'Maa, Mati, Manush' will emerge victoriously."Nadda drew a contrast between PM Narendra Modi’s plan for the state and Banerjee’s governance alleging, "On one side there is Narendra Modi who wants the advancement of Bengal and on the other is Mamata Banerjee who is trying to stop all development projects."He said that ₹25,000 crore has been allocated for road construction and upgradation in Bengal in the Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month. "We will ensure all-round development of West Bengal," Nadda said.On Tuesday, Nadda accused the TMC government of threatening Bengal's culture. "Under Mamata Banerjee's rule, the rich culture and heritage of West Bengal are under threat. Only the BJP can protect these. The insider-outsider culture is not the real culture of Bengal,” he alleged adding, that the TMC was pitting people against one another by branding them as outsiders, and termed it “shameful.”With the assembly elections nearing, the BJP has launched three rathyatras since February 6. The roadshows will cover the 294 assembly constituencies in the state, of which the BJP targets to win at least 200 in the polls due in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/at-bengal-rally-jp-nadda-says-development-possible-only-when-mamata-leaves-101612936950136.html

The JJB also instructed Gopalganj DFO to provide trees to the boy and directed his school headmaster to submit a compliance report on the boy after 20 days.The minor was caught by Uchkagaon police on the charges of carrying liquor and was sent to a remand home. JJB found him guilty and awarded punishment.“As the boy is too young, the board decided not to send him to a reform home, as it could affect his studies and he could feel isolated. However, spreading awareness will bring him closer to the society and make him more responsible. It will give him an opportunity to reform himself, which is the ultimate goal of law,” the magistrate noted.Also Read: BJP now backward oriented, says MLA overlooked for ministerial post in BiharThe juvenile board said that a harsh punishment was not always the best way to reform a person, especially when one is of tender age.

The mangrove cell has cleared up and restored around 1.5 hectare (ha) of mangroves in the area. The removal of establishments on the salt pan lands was a consequence of a complaint received by the state mangrove cell from the salt commission.Neenu Somaraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell), said that joint action against illegal establishments was taken along with the salt department, police and local administrators. “The action was prompted by a complaint from the salt commission about encroachment on salt pan lands,” said Somaraj. The mangroves have been restored.

10-02-2021||Delhi||Govt defends 30-day notice period for interfaith unions||The Centre on Tuesday defended the 30-day notice mandated for interfaith couples under the 1954 Special Marriage Act (SMA), arguing before the Delhi high court that the waiting period was fair and reasonable.The submission was part of an affidavit by the Union ministry of law and justice before a bench of chief justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh in response to an interfaith couple’s plea.The couple contended that the 30-day period – meant to invite objections to the match – violated their right to privacy and impinged on their fundamental rights by discouraging them to get married. The plea also sought registration of their marriage with immediate effect.But the Centre disagreed, saying the intention behind the provision was to adequately safeguard the interest of parties involved.It said if any person raised an objection to an interfaith marriage within 30 days, the marriage officer shall not solemnise the marriage until he inquired into the objection.“It may not be possible to verify the credibility of such a person if at least 30 days period is not given as mentioned in section 7 of the Act,” the ministry said.The ministry also countered the petitioner’s submission on violation of right to privacy. “Though right of privacy is now a part of fundamental rights but it is not an absolute right,” the affidavit read. The matter will now be heard after two weeks.The central government’s response came days after the Allahabad high court, in a separate case, ruled that public display of notices to invite objections to an interfaith marriage violated the rights to liberty and privacy.The Centre was silent on the Allahabad high court’s January ruling and instead cited a 2007 Kerala high court verdict to justify its stand. The Kerala HC had said the 30-day period was a matter of substance and a mandatory clause.The SMA, which allows solemnisation of marriages without religious customs or rituals by way of registration, regulates interfaith marriages in India.The 30-day notice period is a particularly controversial provision because activists say it puts hurdles in interfaith relationships and encourages vigilantes to scuttle such unions.In many states, notices with names, addresses and other details are displayed at marriage offices and sometimes even sent to the houses of the applicants 30 days prior to the scheduled date.The development comes amid a nationwide debate on interfaith relationships, and love jihad, a term used by right-wing groups to describe unions between Muslim men and Hindu women.Two states, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, have already instituted strict anti-conversion laws that ban religious conversions by force, allurement or marriage – a provision that can be misused to target interfaith couples.The plea before the Delhi high court sought a specific direction to the Centre and Delhi government to decide the objections, under the act, on the basis of undertaking and certificates issued by any government hospital or any other authority. The plea also sought doing away with the 30-day notice period requirement and registration of the marriage of the petitioners.But the Centre denied that the provisions violated any constitutional rights. “The conditions relating to solemnisation of special marriage mentioned under the Act is in consonance with the intention behind the Act,” it contended.In its January 13 verdict, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court held that the public display of notices to invite objections to an interfaith marriage was no longer mandatory. It gave the choice to the couple to decide whether they wanted such noticed to be displayed.The SMA mandates an elaborate process to register a marriage. First, one of the parties has to give a notice to the marriage officer of the district where at least one of the parties has resided for at least 30 days.This notice, which includes details such as names, date of birth, age, occupation, parents’ name, address, and phone number, is then entered in the marriage notice book and the officer puts it up in the office.Anybody can then raise objections on various grounds. If no objection is raised within 30 days, then the marriage can be solemnised. If objections are raised, then the officer has to inquire into the objections, and can then decide whether to solemnise the union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-defends-30-day-notice-period-for-interfaith-unions-101612907360001.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Rajya Sabha passes Bill to regularise unauthorised colonies in Delhi||The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to regularise unauthorised colonies in Delhi which is expected to benefit 1.35 crore people.The bill replaces the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 which was promulgated by President Ram Nath Kovind on December 30, 2020.Minister of state (Independent Charge) of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said Delhi’s population has increased from 8 lakh in 1947 to 1.6 crore in 2011. “Exponential growth has led to serious stretch on resources leading to vast gaps in demand and supply.” However, the government has followed a three-pronged approach to address the urbanisation needs of Delhi through three schemes.“A total of 1.35 crore of its (Delhi) citizens will benefit from three schemes, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana which is expected to benefit 50 lakh people; the ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahan Makaan’ under the PMAY (Urban) is expected to benefit about 10 lakh people; and, under the land pooling, 75 lakh people are expected to be benefitted, which are under various stages of implementation.”The minister said the PM-UDAY was implemented towards the end of 2019 and in spite of the fact that nearly one year was lost on account of the pandemic, 3.82 lakh registrations have been done and authorisation slips, conveyance deeds, have been issued to 4,035 households.“The DDA has also finalised the control norms which are expected to trigger re-development in these 188 colonies. Under the in situ rehabilitation of JJ clusters, out of total of 675 JJ clusters in Delhi, 376 are with DDA; 7,500 EWS houses for three JJ clusters in Kalkaji Extension, Jailorwala Bagh and Kathputli Colony, Shadipur are under construction and some of these are at a very advanced stage of completion,” he said.The ordinance amended the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second Act, 2011 that was valid till December 31, 2020 and extended the deadline till December 31, 2023. The 2011 Act provided for the regularisation of the unauthorised colonies that existed in the national capital as on March 31, 2002 and where construction took place till June 1, 2014.The ordinance also amended the 2011 Act to provide that the unauthorised colonies will be identified for regularisation in accordance with the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019 and the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Regulations, 2019. This meant that unauthorised colonies that existed as on June 1, 2014 and had witnessed 50% development as on January 1, 2015 will be considered eligible for regularisation.The minister also said that under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna 1.11 crore homes have been sanctioned; and the remaining will be sanctioned within the next few days. “And, I give an assurance to this House that well before 2022, all the 1.12 crore homes will not only be sanctioned, but a bulk of them would have already been received by the beneficiaries,” he said.Responding to questions by the members why the government took the ordinance route earlier, the minister explained, “If the winter session of Parliament had been convened, there would have been no need for this ordinance. But it could not be convened for reasons which are entirely beyond the control, certainly, of my ministry. We did not want a situation to arise in the intervening period. For instance, if we had not brought the ordinance and had waited for this session to take place, there are a number of authorities at different levels in the governing structure of Delhi which could have started sealing properties and started a large number of other actions which would have caused inconvenience to the citizens of Delhi.”In 2019, the Union Cabinet had cleared the plan to give ownership rights to 40 lakh people living in over 1,700 unauthorised colonies in national capital Delhi. The government said the landmark initiative would address major problems being faced by the residents of unauthorised colonies such as lack of ownership and transfer rights, provision of basic infrastructure and civic amenities. The government said the decision, once implemented would provide people with a legitimate claim to the property, encourage property holders to invest in safe structures and improve the living conditions in these colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rajya-sabha-passes-bill-to-regularise-unauthorised-colonies-in-delhi-101612906471467.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||No Covid death in Delhi first time since May 11||No fresh Covid-19 death was recorded in the national capital on Tuesday for the first time since May 11, a landmark in Delhi’s tumultuous pandemic fight that has experienced three waves of infections – the latest one in November being the deadliest – as hopes of defeating the public health crisis are emboldened with a roll-out of vaccines.So far, 10,882 people have died of Covid in the city since the death of a 69-year-old woman from Janakpuri was reported on March 13. According to government data, the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a day (8,593) was recorded on November 11, and on November 18, the city recorded the highest number of single-day deaths (131).The numbers have been improving since then.Hundred new cases in Tuesday’s bulletin, reported from 56,410 tests conducted the previous day, took the case tally to 636,260, but active cases were down to 1,052. The day’s positivity rate (confirmed infections among tests conducted) dipped to 0.18%. It was 15.33% recorded on November 15 – the highest since June 27 (15.37%) – and has been on a decline since then.The most striking statistic, however, was zero deaths.“Good news for Delhi residents, there have been no deaths due to Covid-19 today. Congratulations to Delhi residents, the number of Covid-19 cases have gone down, vaccination drive is going on at full speed. Delhiites have fought a difficult war against corona but we still have to maintain all precautions,”chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.“Today, no death has been reported due to Covid infections. Delhi’s collective will is gradually winning over the infection. I congratulate the people of Delhi for taking proper precautions and our health care and frontline workers who have fought this battle tooth and nail,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.New deaths usually reflect infections that took place three-four weeks ago.Delhi, which was one of the earliest hot spots in India’s Covid-19 outbreak, is the only region in the country that has reported three distinct waves of infections. The first started in mid-June last year, and peaked when the seven-day average of daily cases touched around 3,400 in the last week of June. This receded by the end of July when it dropped to around 1,000 daily cases. The second wave started at the end of August, rising until mid-September, when average daily cases touched 4,174 for the week ending September 17. This again dropped to 2,574 in the week ending October 9, before the onset of the third wave. The third wave raged through October and November.Delhi recorded 96 Covid-19 cases on January 27, the lowest in over nine months, and the first time the daily count stood below the 100 mark. On Friday and Sunday, two deaths were reported in the national capital, same as on February 2.In the past nine months, Delhi has gone through three peaks of daily Covid-19 deaths. It recorded 129 deaths on June 12. This came 90 days after the city recorded its first death in March. The second peak in daily deaths came on September 29 (109 days after June 12) and October 10 (120 days after June 12), when Delhi recorded 48 deaths. The third peak of 131 deaths came just 39 days after October 10.The first peak of the seven-day average of deaths came on June 16, when the number was 84. The second peak was on October 2 (42 deaths) and the third on November 24 (116 deaths).Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in November last year, Kejriwal said that even after a peak of 8,593 daily cases, the Capital’s health care infrastructure did not collapse under the surge of infections, something that was noticed in several metropolises across the world, including New York City.He said the fundamentals of the “Delhi model” that his government devised to fight the pandemic — testing, home isolation, public data, hospital beds, and plasma therapy — remained strong, and the situation did not go out of control because of the robustness of this strategy.“The number of cases of Covid-19 has declined considerably and so have the deaths. This is because of a number of reasons – many have already been exposed to the infection and several others have now been inoculated. Also, fewer patients with the disease have been brought in from neighbouring states in the last few months... However, a few deaths will continue to happen in those who are immunocompromised, have other severe conditions, and in general are not in good health,” said Dr BK Tripathi, professor of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.More than 12,700 people received coronavirus vaccine shots in Delhi on Tuesday in the fourth week of the inoculation drive, the highest single-day turnout by numbers till date, officials said. The turnout was over 70%, a marked improvement from the figures a day before — 9,740 (54% turnout).At the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital, which has been the largest Covid-19 hospital in the city, no deaths due to the infection were reported for three days in a week. “Our doctors are overjoyed. They have seen the worst and now it is great that the situation has improved so much that no deaths were reported in the hospital for three out of the last seven days. And, today, no deaths were reported in the entire city,” a senior doctor from the hospital said on condition of anonymity.The development came on a day the Centre said seven states and Union Territories reported no new Covid-19 deaths in the last three weeks, while 15 did not register any fatality in the past 24 hours.Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep have reported no new Covid-19 deaths in last three weeks, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. Addressing a press briefing, he said India was the fastest country to reach 6 million vaccination doses of Covid-19 in 24 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-covid-death-in-delhi-first-time-since-may-11-101612905894386.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Windows to Madame Bovary||It’s midnight. Her fourth-floor house is quiet. Her daughter, husband and ma-in-law are sleeping. She settles down on the durrie by the window, lights a diya, pours herself a glass of red wine, and opens her much-scrawled copy of Madame Bovary. Sugandha Sehgal, 36, teaches this novel to grad students. An assistant professor in Delhi University’s Jesus and Mary College, she has taken leave from work to finish her doctoral thesis on “bodies out of context: politics and aesthetics of social media feminism.” Late last month, she shifted from her longtime house in Delhi’s Dwarka to Gurugram, in Sector 62, Golf Course Extension. Trying to strike a friendship with the new home, she tells us on a WhatsApp video chat how she is experiencing its windows and balconies at different times of the day and night.11.30 pm: “I have been teaching Madame Bovary to university students for years. A line in it—“The window, in the provinces, replaces theatres and promenading”—rings very true for me as I sit for hours by the window, gazing at the changing spectacles of everyday life. After putting my baby to bed, on weekends after the wine, I like standing in the balcony, and looking at the moon. In fact, the moon is visible from every part of this house, which is more like a glass-house with its too many windows. I remember stepping into my bedroom a couple of nights back, when the curtains were open and the moonlight was streaming straight into the room.”2.00 pm: “From the study’s window, I see the Millennium City’s underbelly, with an army of laborers building a residential luxury tower brick by brick. Seeing them, I see pure physical labor, making me wonder what it would mean to build palatial houses for others to live in.”9 am: “Every morning, my daughter’s first request on waking up is ‘Mumma, can I see the red slide?’. I then show it to her in the playground outside from our bedroom balcony, and each time she is thrilled to discover that the slide hasn’t vanished overnight.”5.30 am: “The scenes from all the windows at this hour are about the wind howling, reminding me of Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. I don’t know what this wind tries to say but she has a song of her own that she sings everyday by my windows.”Sunset hour: “I haven’ seen the sun setting in this house so far. Maybe I don’t care for sunsets. I actually prefer looking out of the windows after the sun has set and it is already dark.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-windows-to-madame-bovary-101612901287741.html

BMC’s standing committee has approved contracts worth over Rs152 crore for purpose. According to the information given by BMC, about 32-km length of nullahs will be cleaned in island city, for which BMC will incur expenses around Rs12.19 crore. In the eastern suburbs, more than 100km of nullahs in eastern suburbs and 140km in western suburbs, which will cost BMC Rs21.03 crore and Rs29.37 crore, respectively. As per the civic body’s schedule, it has to complete 70% of the desilting before the monsoon, another 20% during the monsoon and the remaining 10% after the end of the season. Additionally, BMC also approved the contract for the cleaning work of Mithi River at Rs89.66 crore. Eight percent of the cleaning work will be done before monsoon, while the remaining 20% after that. During rainfall, the runoff flows through the water entrances located along the city’s roads, through the laterals and into the underground drains, which connect to the nullahs in the suburbs before finally draining out into the sea. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed that the desilting work will kick off in the city in a timely manner only because BMC elections are scheduled early next year. BJP corporator and standing committee member Bhalchandra Shirsat said, “The cleaning is starting on time this year, and it is a good sign. But we should not forget it’s been done on time only this year to ensure there is minimal flooding owing to elections in 2022.” Meanwhile, BMC’s standing committee on Monday approved the appointment of contractors for addressing the problem of flooding at 58 spots, including Gandhi Market (Matunga), JK Mehta Road (Santacruz), Cargo complex (Andheri East), Lokhande Marg (Chembur), Gautam Nagar (Deonar), Chandavarkar lane (Borivli) and Mahesh Nagar (Goregaon).

The move will allow the civic body to make the required decisions to construct the project, subject to further approvals from the committee at each stage, as required. The standing committee approved the formation of a special committee under the chairmanship of the civic commissioner to oversee the project. It also approved the administration’s request to allow IDE Water Technologies to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the desalination plant, after the firm submitted an unsolicited proposal to the civic body for this project. “IDE Water Technologies submitted an unsolicited proposal to BMC for this project. As the original proposer of the project, BMC has asked the firm to submit a project report. Following this, competitive bidding will take place via the Swiss challenge method, for construction of the project. A DPR is expected to be completed in eight months, after which it is likely to take 30 months to construct the plant,” a statement issued by BMC on Tuesday read. In the Swiss challenge method, if an interested party submits a project proposal, the government publishes the report, and invites bids for other interested parties, either to come up with better ideas execute the project based on the existing plan. After the standing committee’s permission to appoint a panel under the chairmanship of civic commissioner under the Maharashtra Infrastructure Development Enabling Authority Act 2018, BMC will submit a proposal to the state to form the committee for the project, and a government resolution will be issued by the state for its formation. Mumbai has witnessed 10-20% water supply shortage in the past few years, owing to delay or uneven rainfall. The city receives water from seven lakes located on the outskirts. While the availability of water in these lakes depends on the rainfall in their catchment areas, the city’s water demand has only increased, and will continue to rise in the future. A committee of experts appointed by BMC in 2016 had submitted its report — Towards Equitable and 24x7 Water Supply for Greater Mumbai — in December 2018. The report concluded that by 2041, Mumbai’s demand for water is estimated to go up from the present 3,750 million litres per day (MLD) to 6,424 MLD. To meet the growing demand, BMC decided to construct a desalination plant with a capacity of 200 MLD of water, which can be expanded to 400 MLD per day in the future. The total cost of the project, is estimated to be ₹1600 crore for constructing a plant with a capacity of 200 million litres, and ₹1920 crore to upgrade it to 400 million litres in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbais-first-desalination-plant-gets-bmc-panel-s-goahead-101612900618714.html

On Tuesday, the state culled around 100,000 lakh poultry birds in Navapur, in addition to the 137,305 poultry birds culled till Monday, taking the count to nearly 238,000. The state recorded 1,291 bird deaths on Tuesday, of which 1,266 are poultry birds. The total number of bird deaths caused by avian influenza has risen to 41,504. On Tuesday, NIHSAD confirmed the H5N8 strain was the cause of death in poultry in Navapur, said officials from the state animal husbandry department. “We have received reports of confirmation of bird flu from ICAR-NIHSAD for 12 other poultry farms. Sample reports of four farms were received on Monday and eight on Tuesday that have confirmed avian influenza,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. The official said 100,000 poultry birds were culled in Navapur on Tuesday. Culling is done within a one-kilometre radius of the affected poultry farm and is started only after receiving a confirmation from NIHSAD. “We are trying to complete the culling process as early as possible because the virus is spreading. The district administration has been directed to survey the affected poultry farms to determine the total number of birds to be culled after fresh confirmation reports,” said the official. The number of poultry birds to be culled in Navapur may go up close to half a million, officials said. Navapur is known for raising egg-laying poultry birds for commercial production and has 27 such poultry farms.

Wholesale prices that had been hovering around ₹20- ₹25 per kg at APMC market last week shot up to ₹40-42 per kg on Tuesday. The retail prices have soared from ₹30-35 per kg to ₹50-55 per kg. The shortfall in supply is attributed to unseasonal rains last November. Digambar Raut, a wholesale onion trader, said, “There were sudden rains in November last year when the plantation was in progress. The rains affected the new crop production, while the old crop is still being used. The arrivals are hence low now. Around 125 vehicles arrive in the market daily carrying onions. Today only 75 arrived. We are getting stock from Pune and Nashik. The situation is not expected to improve soon.” Vinod Kadam, a retailer in Sector 9, Vashi, said the higher prices are affecting their businesses. “The increase in price has started affecting our business. People who were buying 2-4kg of onions are now purchasing only 1-2kg. The quality of the onions is good and that combined with the shortage is likely to push up prices further,” said Kadam. Anil Sonawane, a farmer from Pune said, “The produce though effected, the present one is of very good quality. There is a shortage but it is not as if people will not get onions. Hopefully, the farmers will get a better deal this time due to hike in prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/supply-hit-onion-prices-rise-in-mumbai-101612899958680.html

The BJP leader has also alleged that the Thackeray government has been shielding the Shiv Sena legislator. Sarnaik did not respond to repeated calls and messages from HT. His office said he does not want to speak on the matter. Somaiya, in a press conference on Tuesday, said two 13-storey buildings with 113 flats in Thane had violated the FSI norms for which Thane Municipal Corporation in 2012 levied a fine of ₹3.33 crore. The buildings in Vihang Garden complex were constructed by a company owned by Sarnaik in 2007. Somaiya alleged the legislator neither paid the fine for regularisation of construction, nor the interest accrued on it. “In fact, in a recent order by the state government, the interest has been waived and he has been allowed to pay just 10% of the fine amount. The total amount due, including interest, comes to ₹11 crore, against which he has been allowed to pay just ₹25 lakh. This is completely illegal. I have, in my 53-page complaint to Lokayuta, demanded a probe and a case be registered against Sarnaik,” he said. “The owners of the flats have not been able to sell or transfer their flats in the absence of the occupancy certificate. We are fighting to safeguard their interest,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kirit-somaiya-claims-shiv-sena-mla-didn-t-pay-fine-to-thane-civic-body-101612899358517.html

The councillors from Sindhudurg’s Vaibhavwadi Municipal Council, were considered Rane’s supporters. They were inducted into the Shiv Sena by party chief and state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on Tuesday. One of Rane’s close aides said the six were unlikely to get a re-nomination in the next civic polls, and hence they joined the Sena, hoping for party tickets. Uday Samant, state higher and technical education minister from Sena, who hails from Konkan region, claimed that the councillors joined the Sena because they wish for Vaibhavwadi’s development. “The corporators realised that only the Shiv Sena can develop the region and hence joined the party,” said Samant. Reacting to the development, Rane’s son and BJP legislator Nitesh released a video in which he called the defection a “Valentine’s Day gift” to the Shiv Sena. “When Ranesaheb [Narayan Rane] called Uddhavji to sign the file related to the setting up of the medical college [which Shah inaugurated on Sunday], he responded positively. As Uddhavji won’t take anything from us, we decided to send our six councillors as Valentine’s Day gift to the party,” said Nitesh.

Taunting Shah for his remark that he does everything in broad daylight, an editorial in mouthpiece Saamana stated that even the Sena believed in the same philosophy. “The Shiv Sena openly joined hands with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to form a government. However, we would like to know how come [former Maharashtra CM] Devendra Fadnavis took oath secretly in the morning if the party believed in doing things in broad daylight?” it read. After fighting polls together, the Sena broke ties with BJP in 2019, as the latter refused to share the top post with the its long-term ally. On Sunday, Shah had refuted reports that he had promised to share the post of CM with the Sena for an equal term. “They [Sena] said I had promised them [that both parties would share the post] in a closed-door meeting at Matoshree. I never do anything behind [closed] doors. Everything is done in daylight,” said Shah. He also questioned Thackeray for keeping quiet over the issue while campaigning for the Assembly polls, when it was openly said at different platforms that Fadnavis would occupy the top post. The editorial also read that instead of making misleading claims, Shah should concentrate on the Uttarakhand glacier disaster and farmers’ agitation. The mouthpiece also alleged that all attempts were being made to topple the state government, but they did not succeed. It also took a jibe at Shah for saying BJP would have finished the Sena. The editorial said those who wished the Sena’s end have themselves vanished from the political scene. Meanwhile, BJP asked the Sena to introspect. “The Sena fought the polls in alliance with us and then formed government with the Congress and NCP – the same parties they had attacked.

In an order issued by the home ministry, additional chief secretary Rajeev Arora said, “...During suspension, his headquarters will be the office of RTC/Bhondsi, Gurugram.”Earlier in the day, the court of additional sessions judge Sundeep Singh granted Kumar an interim bail and asked him to join investigations within three days. The next hearing of the case will take place on February 16. While issuing the bail order, the court, with reference to observations made by the Supreme Court in the cases of “Arnab Manorajan Goswami versus the State of Maharashtra (2020)” and “Romila Thaper versus Union of India (2018)”, and by Justice Krishna Iyer in State of Rajasthan Versus Bal Chand (1977), said that “...when both parties are equally influential and there is no likelihood of petitioner absconding on account of his regular long standing service in the police department…his ‘right to liberty’ deserves to be protected. More so, in a case which neither warrants any recovery nor any custodial interrogation.”On Monday, the court had stayed his arrest for a day, asking the state to file response to the bail application. The FIR in this regard was lodged under Sections 294 (obscene act), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Ambala Cantt police station on Sunday. In his complaint, Kapil Vij had alleged that while he was attending a birthday party at Sirhind Club in Cantt where Kumar was also invited, the officer “under the influence of alcohol and without any provocation” started abusing him and his family, and threatened him of dire consequences. Kapil Vij had further alleged that Kumar had said that as he is DIG vigilance, nobody could harm him. He also accused the cop of making obscene gestures at him while leaving.While appearing for the accused/petitioner in the case, his counsel Satinder Singh Garg argued that there was no assault as alleged, no specific mention of the obscene words/act which were uttered and after the alleged criminal intimidation, no violent act was done by Kumar. Garg also placed four photographs, out of which three purportedly showed that Kumar was not having alcohol and fourth purportedly showed the complainant (Kapil Vij) sitting at a table with a glass of drink in front of him. It was also alleged that the complainant was misusing the position of his brother Anil Vij and had rudely told Kumar to serve him at the party.However, public prosecutor Rajesh Dhull and Vij’s counsel Priya Sharma contended that if granted bail, Kumar would try to influence the witnesses and as an officer on duty, he was armed with a service revolver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dig-accused-of-assaulting-vij-s-brother-suspended-court-grants-him-bail-101612898699158.html

The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia acted on the plea of Jangir Singh and three others who had contended that the advertisement issued for the recruitment is tailor-made to re-employ retrenched Physical Training Instructors (PTIs). It was argued that the minimum age limit is 18 years and maximum age limit of 57 years. It was further stated that the condition of experience in physical training is totally arbitrary and discriminatory as six marks for every year have been given to those who worked as PTI in the education department of the state and only one mark for every year to those who worked as PTI under private organisations. The PTIs had served for a period of 10 years before their selection was set aside in September 2012 and therefore, in comparison to the private employees or the private organisations, only one mark is to be given for every year, subject to maximum of 10 marks, the court was told. It was further argued that to pacify retrenched employees and in order to gain the votes, the state government took a conscious decision to accommodate and to adjust those retrenched PTIs, the court was told. The high court, taking note of submissions, asked government to not to proceed with the recruitment and respond to the issues raised in the plea by March 18. It was on April 8, 2020 that the apex court had set aside 1983 PTIs’ selection and asked the state to complete process within five months. A single judge bench of Punjab and Haryana high court had in September 2012, set aside the selection of these teachers in 2010 as it found the process vitiated. They were recruited in pursuance to a 2006 advertisement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-haryana-from-proceeding-with-teachers-recruitment-101612898339558.html

10-02-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccination in Maharashtra: Registration for third phase likely to begin from March 1||Maharashtra is expecting registration for the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive to begin from March 1 and actual vaccination in due course thereafter. The state government, meanwhile, has directed the administrations of districts with high positivity and mortality rates to take measures to contain them. It has also continued restrictions on the Maghi Ganeshotsav festival, beginning on February 15, by banning processions, religious and cultural programmes and capping the height of idols to 4 feet for public celebrations and 2 feet for domestic ones. The guidelines issued by the home department have also restricted the gathering of revellers in the pandal to 10 people, while only five people have been allowed for immersion of the idol.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government has not received any instructions from the ministry of health and family welfare for registering beneficiaries of the vaccination in third phase. He said they expect the registration of comorbid people and citizens above 50 years of age to begin from March 1 and their vaccination in the third phase may begin accordingly.Tope said the state government has been increasing the number of vaccination centres every week and it has reached 652 till Monday. “We have inoculated 468,293 health workers, of the 1,054,000 registered on CoWIN app, and 41,453 frontline workers out of 547,000 registered till Monday. We have enough stock of two vaccines, the centres are well-equipped and the staff is well trained. Although the Centre has not informed us about enrolment for the third phase, we expect it to begin by March 1,” he said.High number of cases, mortality rate in some of districts has become a cause for concern for state authorities as it was pointed out by the central review team, which visited these places over the weekend. Districts such as Nandurbar (10.68%), Satara (9.21%), Amravati (8.91%) have reported a high weekly positivity rate, against the state rate of 4.51%. Similarly, as many as 11 districts have clocked a high case fatality rate (CFR) of more than 3%, when the state’s rate stands at 2.52%. Ratnagiri (13.64%), Bhandara (7.69%) and Gadchiroli (7.32%) reported highest CFR, as per the health department figures as on February 4. In some districts, such as Parbhani (286), Ratnagiri (527) and Nandurbar (921), the weekly testing per million is too low.“The districts with the high CFR have been directed to strictly follow the updated protocol of treatment. Death audit committees have been reactivated and the administrations have been directed to strictly follow the 3T principle (tracking, tracing and testing) to contain the spread of the virus. They have also been told to not lower their guard,” Tope said.According to officials from the health department, the high rate of growth and mortality in these districts is owing to weak public health infrastructure. “These district administrations failed in proper management of ventilators and ICUs and also lagged in tracing and testing of patients. The clinical management cannot be upgraded in a few months when it’s poor for years in these districts. The state government should pay more attention for the upgradation, but at the same time the district administration should go for ample number of tests,” an officer said requesting anonymity.While the state government has announced to relax the curbs on train timings for the general public, experts say the decision over it should be taken in gradual manner. “There is no rise in cases in MMR despite opening up the trains for all in staggered manner, but cases have not fallen like they do in Delhi. We have been recording 300-400 cases in Mumbai daily, while in Delhi they hover around 100. Corporations in MMR have been taking due care by continuing with aggressive testing and strict implementation of the protocol. More relaxations in the timings for rail commuters can be given in calibrated manner after two weeks,” said Dr Avinash Supe, head of the state-appointed deaths audit committee.In another round of vaccination on Tuesday, 23,721 health care workers (HCWs) and frontline workers were inoculated at 515 centres across the state. Of them, 11,378 were frontline workers and 12,343 were HCWs. The total number of beneficiaries has touched 536,197, which include 481,607 HCWs and 54,590 frontline workers.The turnout for the drive dropped to 45.76%, as at least 51,500 beneficiaries were targeted to be vaccinated on Tuesday. The turnout remained low as around 10 districts took a break from the drive. The highest number, 7,735 beneficiaries, were reported in Mumbai, followed by Thane (3,935)and Palghar (1,421).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-in-maharashtra-registration-for-third-phase-likely-to-begin-from-march-1-101612898098322.html

Speaking at a private hotel in Phase 9, senior SAD leader and former member of Parliament, Prem Singh Chandumajra, promised to establish underground parking at all parks in the city and make Mohali electricity-pole free. He added that all pending projects will be completed and local area committees will be formed to monitor development activities in the city. The former MP said that some projects which will be completed include the underground gas pipeline project, shelter homes for street dogs and starting of a local bus service. He added that free education will be provided to family members of Mohali residents who lost their lives during the farmers’ protest. Chandumajra said that the SAD government started all projects, but the mayor at the time was under pressure from cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and could not see to their completion. He also said that there is no question of an alliance with former mayor Kulwant Singh, as he has backstabbed the party. Moreover, our direct contest with Congress and Azad group is nowhere in the picture, he added. Others present on the occasion were Charanjeet Singh Mann, political adviser of SAD president, former councillors Kanwaljit Singh Ruby and Harmanpreet Singh Prince and other local leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-releases-25-point-manifesto-for-mohali-mc-polls-101612897318448.html

The polling booths of different constituencies of the PU senate are to be set up in Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. Last month, the varsity had informed the office of the Vice-President of India, who is also the PU chancellor, that the process has been initiated by seeking permission from the six state governments.In a letter to PU, the department of higher education has said that the varsity should strictly comply with the safety norms whenever the polling is held. The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 senators are nominated by the chancellor, two are from the Punjab legislative assembly, six are ex officio members and the remaining 47 are elected.No response from other states yetPU has not received any response from other five state governments so far for setting up polling booths for elections. After writing to them for permission, the varsity has also sent two reminders to these states. An official of the university confirmed that the response from other states was awaited. The varsity has said that the final election schedule will be proposed after the permission from the respective states.Conduct senate polls immediatelyThe Punjab government in its letter has also directed the varsity to conduct the senate polls immediately as the elections are already delayed. Former senator Navdeep Goyal said, “It is a good development and varsity should announce the dates of senate polls soon as it is already functioning without a governing body.”Polls delayed due to pandemicThe polls were earlier scheduled to be held in August last year, but were postponed twice by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. The last senate polls were held in 2016. The four-year term of the previous senate had ended on October 31 last year. The term of the syndicate, PU’s executive body, also ended on December 31.

10-02-2021||Mumbai||Only 87 of 82,884 showed side effects of vaccine in Mumbai||Amid the preparation for the third phase of vaccination for the general public, the data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revealed that a mere 87 of the 82,884 Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries as of Monday – only 0.10% in the ongoing phase one and two for healthcare and frontline workers – reported minor side effects or adverse effect following immunization (AEFI). Minor side effects include fever, weakness and bodyache, however, no major side effect has been reported in Mumbai yet, BMC officials said. The civic body has urged everyone to undergo vaccination in the coming days and have also started walk-in vaccination for the ongoing two phases. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, told reporters, “I have taken the vaccine, and would like to inform everyone that the vaccine is completely safe for every citizen. So far, the complaints are only of minor side effects. No major adverse effects have been reported yet.” According to the BMC’s data, topping the vaccinations is Bhabha Hospital, followed by Rajawadi, where more than 22,000 healthcare and frontline workers have been vaccinated. When the vaccination started in the city on January 16, there were nine vaccination centres, however, they have increased to 21, as of Monday. In the coming days, the BMC plans to rope in private hospitals, as in the phase three, it plans to vaccinate three million citizens who have comorbidities or are above the age of 50. The BMC has also shortlisted 13 private hospitals and will add more in the coming days. In total, the BMC has received 100 application from private hospitals. Dr Sachin Jain of Khar’s Hinduja Hospital said, “I took the first dose of the vaccine on January 16, and I was among the first few healthcare workers to be vaccinated. On Saturday, I will take the second dose. I would like to convey to everyone that the vaccine is completely safe to be administered. Many have reported minor symptoms such as fever or weakness post vaccination, but that is after every vaccination. Whenever the vaccine is made available for the general public, I hope everyone takes it. Twenty countries are taking vaccines from us, and hence it has to be safe to administer.” On Tuesday, 6,310 healthcare workers were vaccinated followed by 2,881 frontline workers. One more vaccination centre – Mulund Covid-19 jumbo centre – taking the total to 22 vaccination centres. As of Tuesday, the BMC has vaccinated 89,194 individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-87-of-82-884-showed-side-effects-of-vaccine-in-mumbai-101612895997549.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Valentine’s plans: Tripping outside Delhi over weekend||If you thought that Delhi University students are going to spend this Valentine’s by dating virtually, bundled up in their blankets and PJs, you stand corrected! Youngsters have decided to make up for the time lost amid the pandemic by taking their bae to the nearest hill station around the Capital, for a pitch perfect Valentine weekend!Students have spent weeks picking out the most hygienic property around hill stations, even if it means denting their pockets; all this to enjoy a perfect Valentine’s Day amid the pandemic. “The pandemic has been a bummer and I’ve not been able to meet my GF in the longest time. If campus had reopened, I could have proposed to her in college or given her a surprise. But that can’t be done now. I wanted to do something special for her on Valentine’s Day and so planned to take a short trip to Himachal Pradesh. While we can’t exactly go backpacking in Europe this year, a two day trip will be a great break from all the stress due to the upcoming exams and the never ending online classes. Travelling and having great experiences with your friends is what college is all about, and Valentine’s is the perfect opportunity,” says Pranshu Nain, a student of Ramjas College.Some students have tapped into their entrepreneurial abilities, and are coordinating Valentine’s Day trips for their batchmates this year! “A lot of students have reached out to me to help them plan their trip for Valentine’s Day. The famous spots are the hill stations. I help them curate a package that’s budget friendly and also hygienic, with properly sanitised hotels and buses that keep in mind social distancing whole seating passengers. I’m getting around 10 requests for bookings on any average, every day. And 50 plus students have already paid for their trips. But, we aren’t allowing stag entries; it’s either only girls or couples. The activities on the hill station will include bonfire, trekking, dancing — the whole Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani filmi experience. In fact, we are even going trekking to the same places as that movie,” says a DU student, on condition of anonymity, while busy organising trips for campus couples.But what about #singles then? Are they not planning to celebrate their singlehood by taking an all boys/girls trip? “Of course we will! Me and my friends are planning to go to Rishikesh around that time. We’ll be celebrating our singlehood. I’ve even got hoodies printed with the line - Swag se Single. I doubt if anybody will wear them though,” laughs Hemant Sehrawat, a Master’s student in DU.

10-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body shortlists 7 more hospitals for Covid-19 vaccination drive||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has shortlisted seven more private hospitals for the third phase of the vaccination programme. In the third phase, the BMC expects to vaccinate 3,000,000 senior citizens above the age of 50 and those with co-morbidities. Last month, the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a trust of private hospitals, approached the BMC, seeking permission to allow them to inoculate general public. Following which, BMC issued a Google form to private hospitals asking them to submit details about their immunisation department. As HT reported earlier, around 100 private hospitals filled up the forms, of which the civic body had shortlisted 13. An addition of seven private hospitals takes the total count to 20. “Our team is auditing the details submitted in the forms every day. So, we will keep adding the numbers if they have mentioned all the details sought in the form,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.By next week, the BMC plans to begin physical inspection of hospitals to ensure the requisite infrastructure for inoculation is in place. “We are arranging for the teams and shortlisting the names of the hospitals. Once, we are done with it, we will start our inspection which is required before giving the final approval,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-shortlists-7-more-hospitals-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101612895577522.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||In a first, Delhi inoculates over 12,000 people in a single day||For the first time in the national capital, over 12,000 people were vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a single day on Tuesday. A total of 12,717 health-care and front-line workers received the shot across 183 vaccination sites in Delhi.This is an increase of 2,977 beneficiaries over Monday’s 9,740 -- the highest number of people to be inoculated in a single day so far.The uptick in numbers was largely owing to a special drive conducted to vaccinate police personnel -- some of the vaccination sites were exclusively kept aside to cater to them. At one such site at Lok Nayak Hospital, 57 of the 100 people who had been called in, received the shot. “Today, we started vaccinating front-line workers at our hospital. Of the 100 people who were called in, 57 turned up. Currently, we do not allow front-line workers to walk in out of turn,” said one of the senior doctors at the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Health-care workers can walk in at any vaccination site and get the shot even if their names are not on that day’s list of beneficiaries. That benefit hasn’t been allowed to front-line workers yet as the Delhi government started administering the shot to front-line workers only last week.However, Tuesday’s vaccine coverage rate – proportion of people who received the shot among those targeted -- was just 69.1%, which, in comparison to previous vaccination days, is not all that remarkable. There were several days in the past when the city had seen a coverage rate of over 90%.Two districts – north and north-east – saw over 100% coverage, with north-east registering 150%. “That was because of more front-line workers getting the shot. Over the past two days, nearly 80% of those who received the vaccine at out sites were front-line workers. We are coordinating with the heads of departments and they are in turn motivating and following up with their employees. This has resulted in the higher numbers,” said a senior official from the district, not wishing to be named.Others, however, say there is a need to get front-line workers motivated.“The hesitancy among health-care workers has been addressed to some level. Initially, there were fears of adverse reactions but as time went by, more and more people came forward to get the shot. But, now we have hit a wall with the front-line workers-- many are unwilling to get the shot. We will be following a similar strategy to motivate them as well,” said another district official, also on condition of anonymity.To address vaccine hesitancy among health-care workers, the senior faculty members at medical colleges and senior hospital staff had started taking the shot out of turn, in order to motivate their colleagues.On Tuesday, the lowest coverage was in south-west district that saw only 49.5% of the targeted people receiving the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-a-first-delhi-inoculates-over-12-000-people-in-a-single-day-101612893658257.html

Petitioner Baljeet, represented by advocates Benipal Naginder and Aditi Pundhir, has claimed that Bajinder had participated in the tractor rally on January 26 and was missing since then.On Tuesday, the bench told the senior superintendent of police, Jhajjar, to render all possible assistance to the Delhi Police to locate the man, advocate Naginder said.The court also asked the police, represented by Delhi government’s standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, to file a status report before the next date of hearing on February 17.The police have also told the court that they have not arrested any such person in connection with the violence on January 26.The tractor parade on January 26, held by farmers to highlight their demands to repeal three new farm laws, had turned violent as police clashed with protesters. A section of farmers had also reached the Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag there.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over two months now against the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fir-registered-to-trace-man-who-went-missing-from-tractor-rally-police-tell-hc-101612893657398.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||SC stays AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s arrest in casteist slur case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted protection from arrest to Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who is facing multiple criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly calling the Yogi Adityanath government ‘casteist’.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy issued notice on Singh’s petition, challenging the action of a trial court in Lucknow which proceeded with the case against him issuing summons without obtaining sanction from the chairman of the Rajya Sabha under Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Senior advocate Vivek Tankha who appeared for the AAP MP said the sanction granted by the Uttar Pradesh governor refers to Section 197 of the CrPC whereas approval ought to have been granted under Section 196 CrPC. Since the petitioner is an MP, permission of the chairman of the Rajya Sabha ought to have been obtained before prosecuting the petitioner, Tankha added.The bench felt that the issue required consideration and sought response of the UP government in two weeks. The case against Singh in which summons were issued was registered on September 1 last year at Hazratganj police station, Lucknow. Singh was accused of spreading enmity and hatred among groups or communities of society, criminal intimidation under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) contained in Sections 153A, 153B, 501, 505(2).Till the next date of hearing, scheduled in the third week of March 2021, the bench stayed the arrest of the MP. The order said, “In the meantime, we direct that the petitioner be not arrested in Crime No. 221 of 2020 under Sections 153A, 153B, 501, 505(2), IPC registered at P.S. Hazratganj, Lucknow.”Singh held a press conference last year where he alleged that 63% people surveyed in the state called the government “casteist”. The survey was commissioned by Singh.Following the press conference, multiple FIRs were registered against the AAP MP. The apex court also issued notice on a separate petition moved by Singh on clubbing the multiple FIRs pending against him across the state arising out of the same incident.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement said attempts by the UP government to defame their Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh have “miserably failed” with the Supreme Court on Tuesday granting protection to him from arrest over the alleged cases of hate speech.“With the order of the Supreme Court, it has become clear that the cases registered against Singh by the Yogi government at 13 different locations were entirely baseless. Taking note of this, the Supreme Court has also questioned the non-clubbing of all the cases filed against Singh together,” the AAP said in a statement.Singh later tweeted saying, “Satyamev Jayate! Hon’ble Supreme Court has issued a notice to the U.P. Government, prohibiting my arrest, I am sure justice will prevail. My respect to @VTankha, he presented my case with sheer honesty and justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scstays-aap-mp-sanjay-singh-s-arrest-in-casteist-slur-case-101612893599692.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Govt to question Tata Motors over ‘faulty’ mileage of company’s electric car||The Delhi transport department has issued a showcause notice to automobile giant Tata Motors for deficiencies in delivering promised mileage for its electric vehicle model — Tata Nexon.This notice has been issued after the state transport department received complaints on this car variant.“It has been informed that while the model is specified to provide 312 kilometres range on a single charge, the vehicle owned by the said customer has never provided a range of more than 200 kilometres on a single charge. The vehicle owner has further informed that he has duly followed various advice of the dealer but no improvement was noticed, despite best efforts,” read the showcause notice issued by the transport department on February 8.Tata Motors has now been directed to appear before the deputy commissioner transport on February 15. The transport department, according to the notice, is considering de-listing of the model - Tata Nexon EV - from the eligible e-vehicles for the purpose of subsidies given by the government under Delhi’s Electric Vehicle Policy, 2020.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said under the government’s ongoing “Switch Delhi” campaign the department is also reviewing the efficacy of EVs available in the city’s markets.The complaint was filed by one Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Dalip Vihar, Najafgarh, multiple times, the first of which was on January 25. He said he bought the vehicle on December 3, 2020, and soon after leaving the showroom at Safdarjung Enclave, the car stalled on the way. The dealer suggested that he update the software and the car restarted, he said.“On January 9, 2021, a major accident was avoided after the car got stuck in the middle of the road. My family faced a harrowing time in the car. I spent a huge amount of my hard-earned income to buy this vehicle - Tata Nexon XZ+ - which costs over ₹15 lakh. I thought of the environment when I took this zero-emissions vehicle, but i have only faced hardships ever since,” Kumar said in his complaint.Senior transport department officials said action will be taken in case the allegations are found to be substantiated after the hearing.“The department is likely to constitute a committee of EV experts to verify the claim of range given by this car model and the issues conveyed by this complainant,” said KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport).A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company is in receipt of the notice and that it is taking all possible measures to address the concern.“The range at single full charge (312 km) for the Nexon EV is basis the certification received from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), which is the official body that independently tests all mass produced vehicles under standard/defined test conditions before they can be offered to customers. As with conventional vehicles (with IC engines), the actual range achieved in EVs is dependent on AC usage, individual driving style and the actual conditions in which the vehicle is driven,” the spokesperson said.“The range achievement is also a function of familiarity with the new technology, and customers report improvements upwards of 10% within 4-6 weeks of familiarity. Since its launch a year ago, the Nexon EV has consistently grown in popularity to become India’s highest-selling electric vehicle with nearly 3000 families enjoying the pleasure of owning and driving it. We receive several positive testimonials from our customers and are encouraged to see them exploring places with Nexon EV and sharing their experiences,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-question-tata-motors-over-faulty-mileage-of-company-s-electric-car-101612893599124.html

Had a meeting with their experts. We will work with them to implement it in Delhi. If we know source of pollution on real-time basis, it will help us take immediate action (sic).”While the technology to carry out real-time source apportionment of pollution already exists in the country, the team of scientists headed by IIT-Kanpur will be effectively implementing this project in the national capital.Mukesh Sharma from IIT-Kanpur, who is heading the project, confirmed that the team made a presentation before the chief minister on Tuesday and the complete implementation of the project might take around five to six months.“The real-time monitoring of pollution sources will help the Delhi government to take immediate action against these sources. The chief minister has directed senior officials to work on the matter and also to submit a proposal before the cabinet. After the cabinet clears it, work will start in full swing,” the Delhi government said in a statement.The statement added, “This technology will also clarify the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at a particular spot. It will also help to study the real-time effect of vehicles, dust, and smoke from factories. Based on the results obtained, the Delhi government will be able to take the necessary action to curb sources of pollution.”A senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said the team of scientists, headed by professor Mukesh Sharma, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur, has given a presentation on the technology.“The project is still in its initial stage. We have suggested a few recommendations to the team and we are hoping that in a few months, we will be able to implement the project in Delhi,” the official said, wishing not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-meets-with-experts-says-will-launch-project-to-identify-real-time-pollution-sources-101612893598572.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Vaccine wastage at 4.1% for Covidshield, 17.5% for Covaxin in Delhi||In its ongoing vaccination drive against Covid-19, Delhi has recorded a wastage rate of 4.1% for the Covishield vaccine and 17.5% for Covaxin, said a senior Delhi government official, citing a report prepared by the health department on Tuesday.“For Covishield, Delhi’s wastage rate is 4.1%. That means, for every 1,000 doses administered to beneficiaries, 41 doses went waste. For Covaxin, the wastage rate is 17.5%. However, these rates are lower than the national average at this stage – it is 6.3% for Covishield and 25.8% for Covaxin,” the official said.While Covishield is the Indian variation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and is manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech, an Indian firm.Delhi was supplied around 264,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin in the first batch, with which the vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16. Currently, the vaccination drive is open to health workers and front-line workers and Delhi has so far vaccinated 131,935 beneficiaries, government records showed.“The central government has set a permissible limit of 10% of dose wastage, irrespective of which vaccine. Earlier this month, the central government had asked states and Union territories to assess the vaccine wastage,” said the official quoted above.For higher wastage of Covaxin, government officials cited two reasons – higher number of doses per vial, creating difficulties in management as all doses have to be administered within four hours of a vial being opened; and relatively low turnout at centres administering Covaxin.A second senior health department official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Across states, wastage rate is higher for Covaxin because each vial of this vaccine has 20 doses, unlike Covishield vials that have 10 doses each. Once a vial is opened, all doses have to be administered within four hours. So clearly, wastage management is difficult for the centres administering Covaxin.”Of the 184 vaccination centres in Delhi, 151 are administering the Covishield vaccine and 33 are administering Covaxin. Each centre has a target of 100 shots a day. On Tuesday, 12,717 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Delhi – of whom 10,694 were administered Covishield and 2,023 were administered Covaxin, government data showed.“The other problem is the relatively low turnout at centres administering Covaxin. The trend has been so since the launch of the drive (January 16),” said the second official.Delhi government records show that the 33 Covaxin centres collectively recorded a turnout of 61.30% on Tuesday against 70.82% for the Covishield centres. On Monday, turnout for Covaxin was 43.58%, against 56.48% for Covishield. On Saturday, Covaxin centres collectively logged 30.15% turnout against 58.32% for those administering Covishield, government records showed.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “For wastage, the central government has set a permissible limit of 10%. The wastage of Covaxin doses is clearly way above that mark. I would recommend that it is better to have vials with fewer doses. Also, Covaxin centres will have to make an extra effort to increase turnout. There is a need for intensifying campaigns and adopting a multipronged strategy to address vaccine hesitancy. Higher turnouts will reduce wastage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccine-wastage-at-4-1-for-covidshield-17-5-for-covaxin-in-delhi-101612893597345.html

Locals reported the matter to the police after which the Delhi fire service (DFS) was also alerted. Firefighters and policemen rescued five occupants from the building in an hour-long rescue operation.The collapse has triggered concerns over old buildings in the area and North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to conduct a survey of all old buildings in the locality.Atul Garg, director, DFS, said seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot to carry out the rescue. “Police, Delhi Disaster Management Authority officials and ambulances were called to the spot. A total of five occupants were rescued, of whom only two had sustained injuries and required hospitalisation,” Garg said.The police identified the two injured as Mohammad Nazeem, 30, and his 60-year-old mother Jarima and said they had sustained only minor injuries. They were taken to Hindu Rao Hospital from where they were discharged after treatment. The other three who were rescued did not suffer any injury.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said the reason for the collapse is being looked into. “Prima facie, it looks like the building collapsed because of its age -- portions of it were dilapidated,” the officer said.The collapse triggered a scare among residents whose houses are also similarly aged, prompting . the north civic body to order a survey of such buildings on Tuesday.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash visited the collapse site and directed officials to speed up debris removal.He further asked officials to survey all old buildings to identify those that need repair or are too dangerous for habitation. The area is congested with narrow lanes, which increases the risk factor.“This was a 70 to 80 years old building in Sadar Bazar area, which is very congested. Taking a cue from this incident, I have ordered a fresh survey of all old buildings especially in the Old Delhi area. Those that need repair, will be repaired urgently but buildings that are beyond repair should be evacuated and demolished so that similar accidents do not happen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-injured-in-building-collapse-in-sadar-bazar-police-say-building-was-over-80-years-old-101612893539091.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||Seven samples from Delhi Zoo test positive for bird flu||As many as seven samples of bird droppings collected from the Delhi zoo have tested positive for bird flu. A brown fish owl, which had died at the zoo in January, had also tested positive for avian influenza, but since then, no other case was reported from the zoo until now.Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, on Tuesday said seven serological samples of bird droppings were collected from four different parts of the zoo, frequented by birds, earlier this month.“These samples were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, on February 3 for testing. All samples are positive for the avian influenza virus,” Pandey said.The zoo director said all safety measures and protocols set by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC), and Delhi’s animal husbandry department to prevent the spread of avian flu are being strictly adhered to by the zoo.“As per protocols, the surveillance will continue and samples collected would be sent for further serological examinations. The Delhi zoo is already closed and will continue to remain so until further orders,” Pandey said.In January, six bird samples from the Delhi zoo were sent to NIHSAD, Bhopal, but they were all negative for bird flu. These precautionary tests were prompted by the death of a brown fish owl at the zoo enclosure, the carcass of which had tested positive of H5N8 avian influenza.Samples of dead crows collected from the Red Fort in Delhi had also tested positive for bird flu earlier this year and the historic monument has been closed to public since then. The Delhi government, as a precautionary measure, had prohibited the import of chicken into the national capital in January, but the directive was reversed after the scare was brought under control.In a statement issued by the Union ministry, authorities have been directed to use a disinfectant spray of lime juice, Virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite, and a foot bath of potassium permanganate, at regular intervals.“Chicken feed to raptors and entry of vehicles inside the zoo have already been stopped, which is being further reinforced and intensified. Movement of staff and workers in the zoo is also being restricted,” the ministry statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/seven-samples-from-delhi-zoo-test-positive-for-bird-flu-101612893538474.html
10-02-2021||Delhi||One village, 10 people, 8 days- Farmers’ formula to maintain a show of strength||On November 26, thousands descended at Delhi’s border to protest against three contentious farm laws that had been passed by the Centre in September last year.Fast forward 77 days and the Capital’s borders continued to remain chock-a-block on Tuesday, with protesting farmers managing to continue their ‘show of strength’ at the protest sites against the three new farm laws — courtesy their novel “one village, 10 people and eight days” formula.A majority of the protesters said that their eight-day rotation helps them maintain a balance between the ongoing movement and their work. Many others also find it a way to counter “anxiety and depression” among the agitators.Under the “one village, 10 people and eight days” rule, at least 10 people from each village of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh (UP) participate in the ongoing agitation for eight days and then are replaced by another set of people from the same village. This way, farmers shuffle between their villages and the protest site after every eight days.Darshan Pal, a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a group of several farmer organisations protesting against the three new farm laws across the country, said that the idea behind rotating protesters regularly was to avoid “stagnation”. “People from different villages have left their trolleys at the protest site. They come and go in small cars or tractors and use the same trolleys during their stay at the protest sites. There are trolleys from different villages across all districts in Punjab at the Singhu border.”Also read 'Farm laws not religious scriptures that cannot be changed': Farooq AbdullahAlso read: Eye on mahapanchayats, Samayukt Kisan Morcha to decide future of farm stir todayFarmers generally shuttle between their villages and the protest sites -- Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur -- on Sundays. Pargat Singh, a protester from the Tikri border, said he has returned back to his village in Ferozpur in Punjab on Sunday after spending eight days at the protest site. “It looks like the protests are going to continue and that’s why it’s important to keep protesters motivated towards the cause. The rotation recharges protesters. They can take care of their families, fields, and cattle back home while also participating in the movement. Besides, it helps countering cases of depression among farmers. So many protesters have already died by suicide after getting disheartened during the protest,” he said.A 52-year-old farmer died by suicide at the Tikri border on Saturday. He had left behind a suicide note blaming the government for delay in resolving the farmers’ issues. Last month, a 42-year-old farmer from Rohtak ended his life at the same border and in December last year, a Sikh preacher died by suicide at the Singhu border over the ongoing agitation.Protesters at the Ghazipur border said they are encouraging more people in their villages to visit the protest site. “Even if protesters travel back to their homes for work, people assume that the protest has started to weaken. That’s why this rotation is necessary to maintain sufficient strength at the protest sites all the time in order to keep the spirit of the movement high,” said Akshit Chaudhary, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar.Also watch: Delhi violence: 2 farmer groups withdraw from protest, condemn R-Day chaos||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-village-10-people-8-days-how-farmers-maintain-show-of-strength-at-delhi-borders-101612893357947.html

The new road links will not only reduce the traffic load on arterial roads such as Ring Road but also make it easier to travel between various zones of the city.The four projects are National Highway 709B (Akshardham to Eastern Peripheral Expressway to Saharanpur bypass), Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway to KMP interchange via Kalindi Kunj bypass (part of Delhi-Mumbai expressway), Urban Extension Road (UER)-II and Dwarka Expressway.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which is executing the four projects said while work on some has already begun, on others it will start this year.Of the four projects, UER-II and Kalindi Kunj bypass were planned by the Delhi Development Authority and the Delhi government’s Public Works Department decades ago. But they got stuck due to technical and land acquisition related issues, said senior DDA and PWD officials.Decongesting East DelhiThe 31.1km corridor between Akshardham and EPE, part of national highway 709B, will start from Akshardham flyover and pass through densely populated areas such as Geeta Colony, Shastri Park, Khajuri Khas, etc. Of the 31.1kms, 14.7km will be in Delhi and the entire stretch will be elevated, officials said.Though tenders for the project were floated in January 2019, the project got delayed as the ministry of road transport and highways asked NHAI to reassess the financial viability of the project and explore options to bring down the cost. The direction came as the ministry was focusing on prioritising highway projects after evaluating them financially.After the evaluation, the total cost of the project has been revised to ₹2,388 crore from the earlier estimate of ₹2,820 crore. A senior NHAI official said, “We have opened the financial bids for the project. The work on the 31.1 km stretch will be done in two packages. Based on the financial bids, we have declared the contractors for the two packages. The work will be awarded soon.”The official added, “The work should start in 4-5 months. Some clearances such as environment, fire, setting up a temporary bitumen plant, etc has to be taken.”Kalindi Kunj bypassWork on the 59km corridor connecting Delhi Noida Direct Flyway to Western Peripheral Expressway on the Delhi- Mumbai expressway will start in the next few months. A senior NHAI official, who is associated with the project said, “The work will be awarded soon and the process to apply for various clearances will start. We are hopeful that the work will start from May.”To be constructed at a cost of ₹3,580, it will include Kalindi Kunj bypass project, which was conceived by Delhi Public Works Department in 2002. The PWD could not complete it due to land issues between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments.Of the 59kms, nine kilometres will be constructed in Delhi. An NHAI official said that the entire stretch in Delhi will be elevated. The project will provide seamless connectivity to commuters from east and north Delhi going towards Faridabad or Gurugram. This will take the vehicular load off the Mehrauli-Badarpur road.Dwarka expresswayWork on both the Haryana and Delhi sections of the 29km Dwarka expressway has begun. An official said NHAI has finally got all the necessary clearances for the project. “The deadline for the project is September 2022,” said another official.Urban Extension Road-IIThis was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 as a third Ring Road. Planned by the Delhi Development Authority in 2016, the project was transferred to NHAI in 2017 by the Centre as there was inordinate delay in the execution of the project due to land acquisition issues.NHAI, which invited the bids for the ₹7,715.6 crore project in December 2019, asked DDA to pay for the viability gap worth ₹4,000 crore, as the project is turning out to be expensive.Senior NHAI and DDA officials said that the matter was under discussion for some time to find a solution to the problem. It is learnt that the two agencies have reached an understanding to make the project financially viable. A senior DDA official said, “It is an important project and efforts are being made to expedite it. The resolution to the issue regarding funding has been found.”An NHAI official said, “The bids were invited in December 2019 . Once financial issues are finalised, we will start work.”The UER-II project, which has been in planning for over a decade, was finalised by the DDA in 2016 in a bid to decongest the city. The 75.71km-long project will connect four national highways ( NH-1, 10, 8 and 2) and provide seamless access between north, northwest Delhi and IGI airport and Gurugram. Of the 75.71-kms, 43kms (Approx) will be constructed in Delhi.Experts hopefulTransport experts say that the construction of these projects will ease the traffic load on inner-city roads, as people can move from one part of the city to the other without coming to the centre of the city. S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and road safety, at CSIR-CRRI said, “The problem of non-Delhi bound traffic entering Delhi has been resolved to a large extent with the construction of eastern and western peripheral expressways. The other projects such as UER-II, Kalindi Kunj bypass, etc only further provide a buffer and reduce traffic load on city roads, as people coming from north Delhi need not to go through central Delhi to go to IGI airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nhai-to-start-work-on-crucial-decongestion-projects-in-delhi-this-year-101612893357385.html

10-02-2021||Pune||IMA holds hunger strike in Pune over Ayurveda surgery move||Pune: To oppose the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) gazette which allows students of Ayurveda to practice 58 surgeries, doctors of Indian Medical Association (IMA) staged a relay hunger strike in the city on Tuesday. It was a part of the nationwide strike organised by IMA from February 1. Prof Dr JA Jayalal, national IMA president, who was in the city on Tuesday, said that any operative procedure is a delicate operation which carries a thin line between life and death. “The modern medical surgeon does intense study in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology and Anaesthesia. Surgeons carry out hundreds of surgeries under experienced and wise professors in the surgical streams before getting the post graduate degree. To perform gastrointestinal and laparoscopic surgeries, the surgeon spends a few more years, which cannot be compared with the Ayurveda curriculum where the basic concepts are different,” said Jayalal. He said that mixing of allopathic surgeries with Ayurveda will hamper the growth and very existence of the ancient branch of Ayurveda. “An Ayurveda PG student after completing this course can perform surgeries from various specialised branches of Modern Medicine. It means the same student can perform appendectomy, kidney stones, ear surgery, can operate cataract, is allowed to gall stone surgery and is qualified to do dental extraction. “Such a wide choice is not allowed legally to even general surgeons of modern medicines,” said Jayalal. He said that the Ayurveda vaids will be given a “MS Degree” which will confuse the patients about discipline. IMA will take this fight ahead until the CCIM notification is withdrawn. “We are not fighting for losing patients. We are fighting against the mixing of disciplines which can affect the life of patients,” said Jayalal. Dr Arti Nimkar, president, IMA Pune chapter, said that the notification of CCIM should be withdrawn. “The four committees of National Medical Commission (NMC) should be dissolved immediately, which are formed for such ‘mixopathy’. Students of medicine and junior doctors are also protesting with us against ‘mixopathy’,” said Nimkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ima-holds-hunger-strike-in-pune-over-ayurveda-surgery-move-101612884656929.html

10-02-2021||Pune||Maharashtra to probe 27 sub registrar offices for property registration violations||The Maharashtra state government initiated an in-depth probe of doubtful cases of property registration of unauthorised constructions and illegal plotting. As many as 3,00,000 documents registered at 27 sub registrar’s offices during the last three years are being searched. The action comes after complaints were made to Mantralaya alleging illegal registrations taking place in the city in connivance with officials. Inspector-General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Pune (IGR) Omprakash Deshmukh said, “There were complaints regarding registration of properties of some unauthorised constructions and illegal plotting. The complaint was limited to one or two sub registration offices, but we are verifying and investigating all the 27 offices under our jurisdiction. We are investigating all documents and the investigation is in progress under my supervision and a report will be submitted to the government soon. If the court has stayed a land transaction, then only the IGR office can take action. We are not the department which carries out title verification as it does not fall under the act. It is the responsibility of the property owners to ensure that all their documents are legally verified and authentic.” Despite repeated attempts state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat could not be reached for comments. The issue of investigating the sub registrar’s office gained momentum after an alleged complaint of registration of flats ignoring all norms was brought to the notice of Mantralaya. Following the complaint, the revenue department ordered an investigation into such type of cases and over 3,00,000 documents are being investigated, officials said. The IGR office had formed squads which are investigating the RERA number of the real estate developer, and whether the construction of a said project has got a principle approval from the government and whether the land was parcelled into pieces separately before being sold out. The investigation will continue until March 31 taking into account the voluminous number of documents. The investigators are unearthing details like how the land was divided into small pieces of one guntha each and then sold to the buyers in violation of the rules showing irresponsibility in the discharge of duty. 1,000 bogus registrations investigated in 2020 Earlier, the state government had set up a probe committee to investigate scores of bogus property registrations in violation of the Real Estate Regulation and Development (RERA) Act, 2016. The government had received many complaints in this regard especially that of 1,000 such bogus registrations at the sub-registrar office, Hadapsar on a single day. The government issued government resolution (GR) ordered the inspector general of registration and stamps (IGR) to constitute a squad to investigate the complaint made before the state. The IGR later submitted the report to the state government on December 1, 2020. The squad comprises of deputy inspector general of registration Govind Karad, acting DIG (headquarters) Bharat Garud, joint district registrar of stamps Vijay Bhalerao and joint district registrar Udayraj Chavan. According to the information available, a number of complaints were related to the registrar office (Haveli No 3) in Magarpatta-Hadapsar where scores of documents were registered in complete violation of the Rera act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-to-cover-27-sub-registrar-offices-for-property-registration-violations-101612869657144.html
