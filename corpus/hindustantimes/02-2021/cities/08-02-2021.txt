Five of them are master cadre teachers of Government Senior Secondary School, Sekhewal, who were found infected during the health department’s mammoth testing drive initiated in government schools of the district. The sixth is a teacher from the Government Senior Secondary School, Chaunta, who had got herself tested after she developed Covid-19 symptoms. GSSS, Chaunta, principal Rooma Rani said the school premises has been sanitised but the school has not yet been closed. “We have a strength of 750 students and 550 have been attending school after the state education department allowed schools to reopen. We have 22 teachers and all of them will go for testing on Tuesday. We have not closed the school but have sanitised the school premises. Our students and teachers are following distancing and mask norms,” she said. From the Sekhewal school, the health department team had collected 51 samples, including those of Class-IV employees and mid-day meal workers, on February 6 as part of its drive. The department started the drive after more than 40 teaching and non-teaching staff and 27 students of eight government schools in the district tested positive in the last one month. GSSS Sekhewal principal Naresh Kumar said all infected teachers have been sent home and asked to remain in isolation. The principal added that samples of 250 students and four more teachers were collected from the school on Monday. “Though there was some hesitancy among students and teachers, we counselled them and told them how early detection can help control the spread. More students will be tested on Tuesday,” Kumar added. At Government Primary School, Dashmesh A, where one teacher had tested positive last week, 12 teachers got themselves tested on Monday.

The state-level task force on Monday held a meeting wherein officials from Chandigarh administration, UT health department and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, discussed the Covid-19 vaccine’s low coverage in the city. An additional site will also be set up at the Panjab University’s dental college and hospital where faculty and students will be inoculated and the institute could also be used for inoculation of those residing in Sector 38 (West) and adjoining areas, officials said. The administration also directed the health authorities to step up the education and awareness drives, mostly among the less-aware groups, in favour of vaccination. The UT has only been able to cover 27% of its health workers even after three weeks have passed since the vaccination drive was started. The authorities have also been directed to gear up to administer the second dose to those who have received the first jab. “The number of beneficiaries to be covered needs to go up and in the coming days, we will be targeting around 2,400 people in a day, so that the first phase of the vaccination can end by the third week of this month,” Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-double-daily-vaccination-capacity-101612808694162.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||50-year-old man found stabbed to death, wife under police lens||A 50-year-old man was stabbed to death at his Patel Nagar home in the early hours of Monday, the police said. The man’s wife has alleged he was stabbed by a thief, a claim the police said was suspect.Senior police officers said a couple living in an adjacent room did not hear any commotion or screams of either the man, or his wife or two children, all of whom were sleeping in the same room. The wife’s role is now being probed, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said the police control room received a call at 2.30am, reporting that a man had been stabbed by a thief. A police team found the body of Shiv Kumar (50), on the bed with a stab wound to the neck. The caller was a security guard who claimed he was sleeping in the adjacent room when Kumar’s wife alerted them about the murder, Singh said. “Kumar’s wife claimed she was sleeping on the floor with her two children when a thief entered the house and stabbed her husband. The clothes from the cupboard were strewn on the floor. However, the guard next door heard no commotion,” he added.A case of murder was registered at the Patel Nagar police station and investigation teams have been formed. A forensic team also visited the crime scene and lifted evidence. “There are certain vital clues which the investigation has revealed and the teams are developing them. We will crack the case soon,” the DCP said. Police said Kumar worked as a manager in the office of his relative, who is into a business of vehicle spare parts. Kumar was also the caretaker of the building where he lived. The police have learnt that the woman is Kumar’s second wife and the couple have two children, aged 10 and five. “The elder child has also claimed that his father was killed by a thief. But there are discrepancies in the statements of the mother and son,” said a police officer associated with the investigation, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/50yearold-man-found-stabbed-to-death-wife-under-police-lens-101612808575163.html

If the PM wants the next round of talks, we are ready for it. But we urge the PM that he should hold the meeting with us, understand the concerns of the farmers, and end this deadlock. Multiple rounds of meetings with the Union agriculture minister have yielded no results so far,” said Satnam Singh Sahni, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba group), at the Singhu border.Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Modi said the farm laws should be given a chance, while reiterating that MSP will continue and doubling down on the government’s commitment to modernise agricultural markets. “MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain in the future,” the PM said.However, protesters and prominent farm leaders were unmoved by the assurances and demanded that the government ensure legal provisions to “protect farmers from businesspersons.”BKU (Tikait) faction national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, “There are no laws now, so businesspersons loot farmers. Authorities have tried to taint the movement by various means. The movement is not led by political leaders, but farmers who demand the repeal of these laws. There will be no business over hunger, and this is what we are fighting against,” said Tikait, who has been leading the farmers’ agitation at Ghazipur border.A farmer from Punjab’s Moga Sadhu Singh said, “Nobody knowingly consumes poison. When we know that the new farm laws are poisonous, why is Modi ji asking us to consume it. We (farmers) know what is good for us and we are fighting for our rights. We will leave only when the laws are repealed”On Monday evening, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of the 40 farmers’ unions, issued a press statement, condemning the Prime Minister’s “aandolanjeevi” remark.“SKM condemns the insulting of farmers by prime minister. Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is andolans that have liberated India from colonial rulers, which is why we are proud to be aandolanjeevi,” the statement read.“The PM’s FDI approach is dangerous too, even as we distance ourselves from any Foreign Destructive Ideology,” the statement continued. “SKM stands with constructive democratic processes, which uphold basic human rights anywhere in the world and expects similar reciprocation from all likeminded citizens all over the world because “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” the farmer group said in their statement.Avtar Singh, another farmer leader from Uttarakhand camping at the Ghazipur border, said, “We had voted for this government for ‘acche din’ and jobs. But we got these laws in return. There was no need to pass these laws during the pandemic with no consultation and we will continue the agitation till the laws are repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andolan-gave-india-freedom-farm-leaders-slam-pm-s-speech-101612808515461.html
08-02-2021||Chandigarh||₹8.65 lakh looted at gunpoint from co-op bank in Chandigarh||A masked man robbed ₹8.65 lakh at gunpoint from an unguarded cooperative bank in Sector 61, Chandigarh, on Monday. The broad daylight robbery took place at Chandigarh State Cooperative Bank, which is operating from shop number 15 in the Sector-61 market right next to a police post. The man, covering his face with a handkerchief, entered the branch at noon, pretending to be a customer seeking information about his account. He walked out with the bank’s cash bag within two minutes, said police. There were four employees present on the premises when the accused, who seemed to be in his early 30s, walked in. He shoved them and then pulled out his gun, pointing it at peon Amarjit Singh, who was sitting at the cash counter. He told him to hand over the cash bag, while threatening to shoot all of them. “We have got some leads, and will arrest the accused soon,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. A case under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Arms Act has been registered on the complaint of branch manager Anuradha Awasty. The bank had initially claimed that ₹10.5 lakh were robbed, but later after cross-checking their registers, the missing amount was found to be ₹8.65 lakh.No security guard, CCTV cameras not working There was no security guard deployed at the bank. There are CCTV cameras at both the entrance and inside the bank, but police said they were not working since February 4. “It seems the accused had conducted a recce, and was aware of the non-functional cameras and absence of guards. He also knew where the cash is kept, and thus was able to orchestrate the crime in just two minutes,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (south). Police have taken into possession the bank’s digital video recorder and are scanning the footage of cameras installed in the vicinity. Suspicion on man who committed robbery at Mohali bankTwo men had looted ₹4.8 lakh at gunpoint from an all-woman branch of Punjab National Bank in Phase 3A, Mohali, on June 17 last year. The two of them along with two aides were later arrested.Based on the description provided by the cooperative bank employees and the modus operandi, Chandigarh Police have zeroed in on one of the men involved in the Mohali robbery. He is out on bail, and as per police is aware of the area as he stays in close vicinity.

08-02-2021||Delhi||Work on Anand Vihar RRTS station begins; it will be a multimodal hub, say officials||The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has started construction of the Anand Vihar station on the Regional Rapid Transit System’s Delhi-Meerut corridor with the NCRTC officials stating that the station will be developed as a multimodal hub.On the 82km Delhi-Meerut corridor, there will be 22 RRTS stations, of which four will be in Delhi, including the one at Anand Vihar. A NCRTC spokesperson said, “We have commenced the construction work on Anand Vihar RRTS station. Activities such as soil investigation, identification and diversion of utilities are underway. Tunnel boring work is expected to start in the second half of the year.”Anand Vihar is an important transit point in the national capital as it already has a railway station, an interstate bus terminal, and two metro corridors ---the Blue Line (Vaishali to Dwarka) and the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar). Another NCRTC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have started the work to construct the RRTS station at Anand Vihar which will be developed as a multimodal hub. The station will be connected to the railway station, the two metro stations and the interstate bus terminal to provide seamless connectivity to users.”Officials said the Anand Vihar RRTS station has been designed to seamlessly integrate with Delhi Metro corridors. “The construction of this station will be technologically complex as RRTS trains will pass underneath the DMRC’s line 4 (Blue Line). Anand Vihar RRTS station’s concourse level entry will be adjoining the Delhi Metro entry. Further, the RRTS station will have multimodal integration with Anand Vihar railway station, the Anand Vihar ISBT and the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation’s Kaushambi bus adda,” said the official.Apart from Anand Vihar, NCRTC has also started construction of stations at Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar, both part of the 82km corridor to Meerut.The agency is also constructing a 1.35km long bridge over the Yamuna in Delhi, which will be almost parallel to the existing Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway. “That bridge will connect the Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar RRTS stations,” the official said.The section over the river will be around 626 metres long. “The bridge will be constructed using box girders. It will have 32 piers and each span over these piers will be 44m long. The work on the well foundation, for the construction of piers, has started,” the official added.  “All construction activities are being carried out following the prescribed guidelines to avoid any adverse impact on the floodplains. Various eco-friendly measures will also be taken during the construction. The muck and debris generated would be disposed of systematically and no dumping will be done on the floodplains,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-anand-vihar-rrts-station-begins-it-will-be-a-multimodal-hub-say-officials-101612808455297.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cooperative Housing Finance slashes interest rates to 6.75%||The Delhi Cooperative Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DCHFCL) has slashed interest rates on housing loans from 7.45% to 6.75%, minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said Monday.The move comes barely three days after the Delhi government reduced the circle rates, the minimum price at which a property can be bought, by 20% across all categories of properties. “The direction to reduce the interest rates of housing loans disbursed by DCHFCL was given by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” said Gautam.Rajesh Goyal, chairman of the corporation, said the DCHFCL interest rate is now much lower than that offered by private banks.“The reduction in interest rate will bring down the loan payment instalments from ₹803 per lakh to ₹760 per lakh. The corporation is planning to soon launch an attractive housing loan package for the middle class and the economically weaker sections,” he said.On Friday (February 5), the Delhi government had reduced circle rates of residential, commercial and industrial properties by 20% for a period of six months, a move that experts said will boost the real estate market and as well as the revenue for the government..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cooperative-housing-finance-slashes-interest-rates-to-675-101612808454009.html

The over ₹7,700 crore-project, which was conceived by DDA in 2016 but later handed over to NHAI in 2018, failed to take off due to financial issues. NHAI, which invited bids for the project in December 2019, asked the DDA to pay for the viability gap funding worth ₹4,000 crore, as the project was turning out to be costly. A senior DDA official said the solution to the financial viability has been worked out. A senior NHAI official said, “It is an expensive project. We are exploring possibilities to make it financially viable.” However, a senior DDA official said, “The financial viability issue has been resolved.” The NCT of Delhi is a massive metropolitan area where five national highways ( NH-1, 2, 38, 310 and 324) converge. Delhi has over 10 million registered vehicles and faces a major challenge to curb severe traffic congestion and rising air pollution.Of the total 75.71-kms, 43kms (approx) will be constructed in Delhi. The total cost of the project has been estimated at ₹7,715.6 crore. This includes the cost of constructing highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh from UER-II.UER-II was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. The DDA, which had planned the initial project, couldn’t implement it due to land acquisition-related issues mainly in Khanjhawla, Najafgarh and other rural villages.The road will start from NH-1 near Mukarba intersection, cross NH-10, Rohini, Dwarka, NH-8 near Rajokri and end on NH-2, as per DDA’s initial plan. Later, NHAI added two highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh. The Sonipat road link will connect UER-II with Barwasni bypass (near Sonipat). An NHAI official said this road will help reduce traffic load on NH-1, as this will provide an alternative route between Delhi and Sonipat.The road towards Bahadurgarh bypass will be an additional road link connecting Delhi, Bahadurgarh and Rohtak. An NHAI official said, it will help in decongesting the NH 10 section between Outer Ring Road and Mundka. Currently, the only road link connecting west Delhi, Dwarka, Gurgaon, IGI Airport, Dhaula Kuan and South Delhi is NH 10 section between Peeragrahi (Outer Ring Road) and Bahadurgarh bypass.To decongest the city, especially the Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, experts say that it is important to develop road infrastructure in urban extensions so that traffic coming from north and northwest Delhi doesn’t have to take Ring Road to reach south Delhi or the Delhi airport.Transport expert S Velmurugan, the chief scientist at CSIR-Central Road Research Institute, said, “The Eastern and Western peripheral expressways act as a broad buffer, as Delhi-bound traffic doesn’t have to enter Delhi now. The third ring road will just add one more layer of buffer and ease traffic on Ring Road and Outer Ring road, as traffic from north and northwest Delhi need not come to Dhaula Kuan to go to IGI airport or Gurugram.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-nhai-working-to-expedite-work-on-delhi-s-third-ring-road-101612808453313.html

The appointments are being made on an experimental basis, on the directions of the ministry of home affairs, officials in the know of the matter said. To start with, 2,000 ex-forces personnel will be posted at 13 PSUs (public sector undertakings) across the country, including thermal power plants and coal fields. An order, dated February 5, 2021, issued from the office of the director-general of the CISF, said the ministry of home affairs has directed the deployment of ex-servicemen in the CISF in the ratio of 75:25 (75% CISF staff and 25% contractual staff) at selected units by engaging 2,000 ex-forces personnel in different posts on an experimental basis. The order, seen by HT, mentions 13 PSUs at which these veterans are to be posted. The locations include South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh; Anpara thermal power plant in Uttar Pradesh; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in Nazira, Assam; and Raichur Thermal Power Station in Karnataka. So far, none of the 13 selected locations is in Delhi. The order further states, “The deployment in these selected units in the above ratio will be reviewed by MHA after six months and 12 months for considering further expansion of such deployment at other units.” The force is also inviting applications from eligible candidates. Deputy inspector general (operations) Anil Kumar Pandey said these personnel will be used for “non-core” duties.“They will be unarmed and assist our men. They will be deployed at places that are not sensitive from the security point of view,” Pandey said.However, an officer who is not authorized to speak to the media, said the appointments of ex-servicemen will be done on four posts – constable, head constable, assistant sub inspector and sub-inspector. Only those below the age of 50 years will be considered for appointment, based on their fitness, and provided they match the physical requirement, the officer said. “For the post of sub-inspector, ex-servicemen who have served in the rank of subedar or above will be considered. Similarly, naib subedar and above will be considered for the post of assistant sub-inspector and havildar and above will be eligible for the post of head constable.

The security arrangements in these places will now be taken care of by personnel belonging to the police districts concerned, senior police officers privy to the development said.Hundreds of personnel from various Delhi Police units such as crime, police control room (PCR), railways, vigilance, economic offences wing (EOW), licensing, headquarters, and police training college (PTC), were mobilised to the three borders points on security duty during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 and the chakka jam call on February 6.On Monday, special commissioner of police (operations and licensing) Muktesh Chandra issued a message, referred to as TPM, to all the units and their heads regarding the withdrawal of the internal mobilisation done for the farmers’ rally and law and order duty. The entire staff have been told to return to their respective units from Tuesday.“The available resources in the districts concerned will now be used to maintain law and order and security at the farmers’ agitation sites. They will be assisted by personnel from the paramilitary forces,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Rajeev Ranjan said, “The situation at the Singhu border is under control and peaceful.

08-02-2021||Delhi||DTC puts on hold recall of buses given to Delhi Police; says will release more if needed||Days after the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) started recalling all its buses given to the Delhi Police on “special hire”, after over 45 of them got damaged during the clashes between farmers and police on Republic Day, the state transport utility has now paused the recovery of more buses on the request of the police and has also stated that additional buses will be given as per the demand raised by the force, senior officials said on Monday.The decision was taken in a “emergency meeting” chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Monday to resolve the impasse between the police and the DTC with regard to the deployment of buses, senior officials who attended the meeting said. The meeting was also attended by chief secretary Vijay Dev, transport commissioner Ashish Kundra, special commissioner of police Sundari Nanda, state home secretary BS Bhalla and DTC managing director Vijay Bidhuri.On February 3, the DTC, on the directions of the Delhi government, had started recalling all its buses with immediate effect after at least 45 buses, used by the police to ensure law and order during the tractor rally on Republic Day, were damaged in the ensuing violence.On February 4, Delhi Police sent a stern letter to the DTC asking it to review its decision. Special commissioner of police Robin Hibu had written to the DTC stating that if any untoward incident happens in Delhi, then the corporation may be held accountable and that the decision to recall all its buses would amount to obstruction in maintaining law and order.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday, “The Delhi Police had taken 576 DTC buses on special hire of which around 350 have been returned so far. It has been decided that no more buses will be recalled by the DTC as of now. Also, it was clarified that the DTC will not deny any bus to the police. Maintaining law and order is extremely important.” He, however, said the only difference from the previous practice will be that the DTC solely cannot release its buses to the police going forward. “Any request to deploy buses on special hire will have to be approved by the Delhi government. That means the DTC will have to take Delhi government’s approval,” the minister said.A second senior official who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity, said a middle path was worked out during the discussion wherein the DTC said it would stagger the release of buses to avoid any inconvenience to daily commuters.Delhi currently has around 6,693 buses --3,760 DTC buses and 2,933 concessionaire-run cluster buses, as against the Supreme Court-mandated requirement of 11,000 buses. According to the socio-economic survey that was conducted between November 2018 and November 2019, the preferred mode of transport for 63.62% of Delhi residents is “public bus/school bus/chartered bus”, while only 6.18% take the Delhi Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dtc-puts-on-hold-recall-of-buses-given-to-delhi-police-says-will-release-more-if-needed-101612808333474.html
08-02-2021||Chandigarh||Questions raised on legality of nod to Chandigarh flyover project||Senior architects and urban planners, including members of the expert heritage committee (EHC) and master plan committee (MPC), have questioned the legality of approval granted by the sub-committee of Chandigarh heritage conservation committee (CHCC) to the Tribune flyover project.In a letter to the UT adviser, experts have slammed the administration for the “preposterous mechanism adopted to bypass the necessary checks in the system to protect Heritage Grade-1 (site)”.At the centre of their objection is the CHCC sub-committee concurrence to remove mango trees on the Purva Marg in the industrial area for flyover construction. The trees are protected under law and are part of Heritage Grade-1 sites, which also include Capitol Complex and Sukhna Lake. The CHCC and its sub-committee, as per their legal mandate, are not authorised to allow changes/modifications in these sites, the letter states. The letter signatories include former UT chief architects Sumit Kaur and Renu Saigal (also members of EHC and MPC), former Punjab chief architect SL Kaushal, former Haryana chief architect Ashwini Sabharwal, former principal of Chandigarh College of Architecture SS Bhatti (EHC member), EHC and MPC member Madhu Sarin, EHC member Chand Nehru and MPC members Jeet Kumar Gupta, KK Kaul and Namita Singh.The letter comes in the background of recent claims made by a technical committee set up by the UT adviser, which claimed: “Keeping in view the recommendations given in the master plan from heritage point of view, the concurrence of CHCC sub-committee was obtained from construction of FRU (flyover, roundabout and underpass) as well as cutting of trees falling in the mango orchard (heritage zone).” Recently, the UT urban planning department had also categorically denied granting any “approval/concurrence” to the project.MPC is an 11-member expert committed constituted by the UT administration in December 2009 to formulate the master plan for Chandigarh. During the drafting of Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, the Union home minister at the instance of the Prime Minister asked for a committee of experts to be constituted to examine the original concept of the city and how its heritage buildings should be protected, preserved and maintained. Consequently, the EHC was constituted under the chairmanship of the UT administrator.CHCC was constituted by the UT administrator as per the decision of the ministry of home affairs in April 2012. Its mandate was set by the EHC.Mango groves Grade-1 heritage siteThere are three heritage grades (1, 2 and 3) in the city, comprising 13 heritage zones. In Heritage Grade-1, no changes/modifications are allowed except for prolonging their lives. It includes heritage zones 1 (Sukhna Lake, Capitol Complex, wildlife sanctuary), 2, 7 and 9 (belt of Mango Grove along Purva Marg).“Being placed under Heritage Grade-1, they (mango trees) deserve the same protection as inter alia Sukhna Lake and Capitol Complex,” the letter states. “Moreover, the mango orchards, which constitute ‘Open Spaces’ are inviolable and were declared so as to prevent them from being diverted to other land uses. Constructing a flyover and uprooting the mango trees irrefutably flouts the CMP-2031,” the letter states.Chandigarh Master Plan 2031 states: “No interventions be permitted either on exterior or interior of the heritage building or natural features falling under the Heritage Grade-1 unless it is necessary in the interest of strengthening and prolonging the life of the buildings/or precincts or any part or features thereof.”Beyond heritage conservation panel mandateThe mandate of the CHCC sub-committee is to advise and assist the department of urban planning in “handling minor issues of routine nature.”“Interfering and part-destruction of Heritage Grade-1 is beyond the scope of the sub-committee. We are shocked to see the preposterous mechanism adopted to bypass the necessary checks in the system to protect Heritage Grade-1, and hope this sub-committee is not used to procure permission for part-destruction of the Capitol Complex or Sukhna Lake in the near future,” states the letter.The experts have also suggested a “comprehensive mobility plan” and a “public transport strategy” mutually agreeable to Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab for resolving the city’s traffic woes.Project so farMarch 2019: Foundation stone laid by UT administrator VP Singh BadnoreNovember 2019: Civil work contractor approved; Punjab and Haryana high court stays tree removalDecember 2019: UT adviser forms technical committee to examine public suggestions and alternativesDecember 2020: Technical committee rejects all alternatives, UT admn decides to go ahead with flyoverJanuary 2021: Urban planning department says project does not have its requisite “approval/concurrence”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/questions-raised-on-legality-of-nod-to-chandigarh-flyover-project-101612808275482.html

08-02-2021||Other||75% pedestrian facilities unsafe, in violation of norms: Study||New Delhi:At least 75% of Delhi’s pedestrian facilities do not follow international standards of road safety, according to a survey by independent researchers which found that spaces meant for pedestrians were either encroached by people to feed birds or by the authorities to plant trees and place other obstructive installations. The researchers, who are alumni from IIT-Bombay, School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and IIT-Kanpur, studied 60 traffic refuge islands in Delhi and NCR towns. They found that 57 of them were not safe for pedestrians.Traffic refuge islands are large platforms constructed at big intersections where pedestrians do not get enough time to cross over to the other side while the signal is green for them. The islands provide a safe space for pedestrians as they wait between carriageways for the traffic to clear. To be sure, in 2019, nearly 46% of the total 1,463 road accident deaths in Delhi were that of pedestrians, according to data provided by Delhi traffic police. There are over 10 million registered vehicles in Delhi. “These spaces are made in a triangular pattern so that it can hold maximum number of pedestrians. If you look at international standards of road safety, road owning agencies are not permitted to use any space. But here, we have found that these open spaces have been wrongly used for road beautification,” said Sumukhi Surendran, an independent researcher who works on traffic and road safety issues and led the survey in Delhi. The researchers studied pedestrian infrastructure in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Ghaziabad between October 15 and December 31.The survey found that at least 12 traffic refuge islands in central Delhi were beautified with saplings, statues or other installations, leaving little space for pedestrians to wait while the traffic signal was green for the vehicles.The safety report also found that in cases where the traffic islands were not encroached, the space was being used by local residents to feed birds and street animals. Globally, the urban design guidelines mandate that every large intersection where the time taken by pedestrians to take a complete round of the intersection is greater than three minutes, requires agencies to have refuge islands. These islands are meant to hold maximum number of pedestrians safe from the fast moving traffic. For instance, in China’s Beijing these traffic refuge islands have slopes so that pedestrians standing on the traffic island don’t face the risk of suddenly falling onto the moving traffic.In Delhi, traffic refuge islands in areas such Govindpuri, Nehru Place, CR Park and Connaught Place were found “unfit for use” because grains and bits of food was laid out for birds. Also, 32 of 50 road dividers and 12 out of 25 zebra crossings in Delhi were found in violation of the international road safety norms. “Large trees were planted on dividers in areas near Dilshad Garden, Vivek Vihar, Uttam Nagar, Greater Kailash and Jasola Vihar...which were turning out to be safety hazards for pedestrians and motorists as it blocked the view of the incoming traffic and signals. Zebra crossing in many areas was ending in Metro pillars or encroachments,” the report read. The report highlights that when a pedestrian is crossing the road, the view of the traffic signal and the incoming traffic should be clearly visible to them. “No installation or plantation should be made over or around the traffic signal. While planting saplings on the road dividers, the agencies must ensure that the canopies of the trees, once it attains the adult age, should not block the view of incoming traffic,” the report read. Maximum of these problems were found on roads under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The civic body did not respond to repeated requests for a comment on the matter. The Public Works Department which also maintains large stretches of roads also refused to comment on the findings of the study. Delhi traffic police said it conducted a similar survey in 2014, listing out inaccessible pedestrian facilities and conducted a series of meetings with road maintaining agencies asking them to fix the faults. “We conduct regular meetings with local authorities to ensure that public spaces remain accessible to commuters, especially pedestrians. If trees are not pruned and posters are found blocking the view of traffic signals, such information is also shared with the civic agencies,” the traffic police said in a text response. Raghu Shaurya, a resident of south Delhi’s CR Park, who has been wheelchair-bound for over a decade, said even in upscale neighbourhoods of the city, the public facilities are not designed for people. “Road dividers and footpaths here are so high that even a normal healthy person will find it difficult to access it. Their solution for everything is to create footover bridges. Why should those on foot risk their lives and sweat extra only so that the cars can zoom faster? Every developed economy is now moving towards developing facilities that put pedestrians first,” Shaurya. Experts also agree that civic agencies need a better understanding of safe urban designs. “The problem is that there are so many agencies and even within an agency there are several departments that have little coordination among them. Aesthetics are important but so is the purpose of traffic refuge islands, zebra crossings and dividers. You cannot in the name of beautification defeat the whole purpose of a public facility. Experts need to be more actively roped in by the civic and road owning authorities before making such decisions,” said Sewa Ram, from School of Planning and Architecture. Gurugram-based urban design and infrastructure expert Khushbu Prasad said a thorough audit of road infrastructure and public spaces should be conducted. “In 2012, when the Delhi Metro construction was on, we conducted a survey for the Delhi government and found that many zebra crossings were ending with Metro pillars. Our public spaces are designed only for cars, pedestrians feature way down in the hierarchy,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/75-pedestrian-facilities-unsafe-in-violation-of-norms-study-101612808213586.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Noida sees first body donation to govt institute||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar district on Monday saw its first cadaver donation to any government institute, with doctors calling it “momentous”. Ram Khiloni Agarwal, a 72-year-old retired irrigation engineer from Sikandrabad district who died at a private hospital in Noida on February 5, wished his body be donated for medical purposes. Agarwal’s cadaver – called the first teacher for medical students – was brought to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, from his residence in a hearse van following rituals held by the family, doctors said. “It is the first ever cadaver that we received through donation, and it will help our first year MBBS students to understand the human body and give a hands-on experience of anatomy,” said Dr RK Gupta, director, GIMS. The doctors said that the body will be embalmed and preserved for five years. According to Dr Ranjana Verma, head, anatomy department at GIMS, the cadaver was received through an NGO , with which the donor had pledged to give his body for science. “There is a shortage of cadaver and we often receive it from other medical institutes like AIIMS that helps the new medical institutes. This is the first time that we have received through donation. It is a momentous for our college,” said Verma. She said that though GIMS is not able to maintain the cadaver to student ratio which is four cadaver for 100 students, more awareness is required to encourage people to take such pledge. On Monday, upon receiving the cadaver, the students of GIMS expressed their gratitude to the family through writings and letters, the doctors said. “Due to traditions of different cultures, it is often difficult for people to take such a pledge to donate their bodies for such a higher purpose. Though people are coming forward,” Verma said, adding that GIMS will soon start pledge forms for cadaver donation. “We will upload body donation form and information regarding body donation on GIMS website in near future,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sees-first-body-donation-to-govt-institute-101612808033261.html
08-02-2021||Noida||‘We never said MSP is going away, we are demanding new law on MSP,’ says Rakesh Tikait||Ghaziabad: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said Monday that he disagreed with the comments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rajya Sabha over the issue of minimum support price (MSP). He also reiterated that all farmers stand together, and that the ongoing agitation will benefit small farmers.On Monday, PM Modi, besides other matters, spoke on issues related to farmers during his reply in the Upper House to the motion of thanks on the President’s address. The PM said, “MSP is, MSP was and MSP will be. Affordable ration for the poor will continue. Mandis will be modernised.” However, Tikait after the PM’s address said that the issue related was being made complicated. “We never said that MSP will be done away with. We said that a law on this is needed which will benefit farmers. Otherwise, they can be exploited at the hands of traders and corporate. The business in the country will not be done taking into consideration how hungry people are. The price of crops cannot be decided on the basis of tickets of flights whose rates fluctuate several times in a day,” Tikait said. The government has called the new farm laws “historic” for farmers and assured that MSP will stay. Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the BKU, said most of the schemes and allocation were aimed for people engaged in the agri-business.“The farmers are never consulted, even during pre-budget consultations. Our demand is that purchase should be on MSP. We welcome schemes for farmers. We demand that the price is fixed by the government and this should be guaranteed to farmers. We can take this agitation up for years,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the BKU. For over two months, protesting farmers at borders of the national Capital have been demanding repeal of the three new farm laws and a new law on MSP.The protests at UP Gate have been going on since November 28, 2020.The last time government representatives and farm union leaders held talks over the issue was on January 22. During the last meeting, the government had offered that they were willing to put on hold the implementation of the three laws for a period of about one-and-a-half years. However, farmers have stood by their demand for the repeal of farm laws.The farmers had been reiterating that the government should speak to them. “Na manch badlenge, na panch badlenge (neither the stage will change nor the people of the committee). The government should talk to farmers and to our committee. They should remove the problem by taking back the laws and bring out a new law on MSP,” Tikait said on Monday. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee and a farmer leader from Uttarakhand, said that there have been no talks with the government since January 22. “No talks have taken place with the government since then. We are ready for talks whenever they call us. But they have not given us any day or time for talks so far. It seems they think that the farmer is weak,” Bajwa added.“Earlier they had said that it was an agitation by farmers from Punjab.Then they termed it as an agitation of Sikhs, then Jats, and now they tell us the difference between small and big farmers. We want to say that it is an agitation for small farmers. They should increase the income of small farmers who have less than two hectares of land and their loans should also be waived,” Tikait added.The PM on January 30, during an all-party meeting ahead of the budget session on February 1, had said that the government stands by the offer to the farmers by agriculture minister Naresh Tomar, made during the last meeting between the government and farmer representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/we-never-said-msp-is-going-away-we-are-demanding-new-law-on-msp-says-rakesh-tikait-101612807973844.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Farmers to intensify meetings, hold panchayats in several states||Ghaziabad: Protesting farmers at UP Gate on Monday said they will now be spreading awareness about their issues and agitation to farmers across the country. On Monday, several seers came to the UP Gate protest site to offer support from farmers.Farmers have been protesting at UP Gate since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). Farmers’ leaders said they are now working to spread word about their demands and the agitation to different cities. “We will now be holding regular panchayats and meetings in different cities. The events have been finalised in cities of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana like Karnal, Kurukshetra, Hisar, Barabanki, Fatehpur and Moradabad, besides in states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan, etc. We will tell farmers at the grass root level that the government is not ready to roll back the farm laws or bring a new law on MSP,” Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said. He added that the rollback of cases against farmers is not a precondition for resuming talks with the government. “We are not fearful of cases. These things happen during the course of agitations. Our core issue is still rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on MSP,” he said. Rakesh Tikait, BKU’s national spokesperson, said that he has already asked farmers to continue protesting till October 2.“We have planned till October 2 and people should come and go on a regular basis. We don’t want all of us to come here to protest on a single day and then go back. Otherwise, people will say that the gathering has decreased. This agitation will not go on with sweets or expensive food items. From now on, only daal roti will run this agitation,” Tikait said.“Only those who have the ability to protest peacefully are needed here. We do not need revolutionaries here,” he added. The farmers’ leaders also said that they have activated their cadres in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and that they will be providing support to people in Uttarakhand where a glacial burst took place in Chamoli district on Sunday morning. “Several districts in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and even in the terai belt of UP have been asked to be ready with food supplies for people affected by the tragedy in Chamoli. As soon as we get a word from local administration, we will move to provide food and facilities to people,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and a member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee.Farmers at UP Gate on Monday were also provided support by several seers, including Shankarachayra Narendra Saraswati from Kashi Sumeru Peeth, and Acharya Pramod Krishnam from Kalki Dham.Krishnam had contested the last Lok Sabha elections from Lucknow on a Congress ticket. “The pain of farmers has pained us and we have come here to support them. We would like to tell the government to hold talks with farmers and decide in the favour of farmers by way of repealing the laws. The farmers are not getting the right price for their produce. Farmers are patriots and they cannot be termed as anti-nationals,” Saraswati said. Tikait said the farmers will base the agitation on concepts of “rishi and krishi” (seer and agriculture) and will not allow anyone to tamper with it.“I have discussed with the seers about the water which was brought to the protest site by people. Earlier, I had said that it will be taken to river Ganga. But the seers told me that this was not possible as the river will not take it back. So, considering their opinion, we have now decided that we will construct a Kisan Kranti memorial below the UP Gate flyover, and the water will be used in the cement for the construction of the memorial,” he added. Tikait also called on people to shun cold drinks and consume items such as milk, curd and coconuts etc., which he said will help farmers, also urging them to plant more trees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-to-intensify-meetings-hold-panchayats-in-several-states-101612807973288.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Did not call him when he broke down on television, says Rakesh Tikait’s wife Sunita Devi||Ghaziabad: Sunita Devi, wife of Bharatiya kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, is a frequent visitor to the UP Gate protest site. She said she is proud of her husband who, for over two months has been fighting for the cause of farmers.The protest at UP Gate has been going on since November 28, 2020, and is seeing participation by thousands of farmers who are demanding repeal of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). The protest has also seen families of other BKU leaders who say they have now increased the frequency of their visits.“I have seen my family members taking part in agitations since the past 36 years, when I got married. Four years (after my wedding), my father-in-law (BKU founder late Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait) started the agitation in Delhi. Ever since, I have witnessed all agitations and my other family members have supported all agitations,” Sunita Devi added.She said she saw her husband break down for the first time on January 28 but did not call him. “I saw him on television with tears in his eyes, but I decided I will not call him and let him continue the fight. If anyone feels cheated, what will they do? The next day, everyone saw the result. There was a gathering of about one lakh during the mahapanchayat held in Muzaffarnagar,” she added. Family members of Rakesh, including his son and daughters as well as the family of his elder brother, BKU president Naresh Tikait, have also made several visits to UP Gate. While the families were sitting amidst the gathering near the dais last week, Rakesh announced that he will not be coming home. “I have got a bigger family and now you look after your family. I have bigger tasks to do,” he said. Sunita also lashed out people who termed farmers at UP Gate as not real farmers. “If they say these are not real farmers then they should bring in real farmers to UP Gate and drive these people away. The “real farmers” who came here earlier returned within 12 hours and never came back,” she said, while referring to a rally on December 20, 2020 held by farmers supporting the three farm laws. Rajbir Singh, BKU’s state vice-president, said: “They, including the women, also share their opinions. Even my wife who mostly stays at home is keenly following our protest through television and newspapers. If she observes that we have said something we shouldn’t have, she will immediately call and will tell me. So, most of the women members of our families are of great help and they also try to correct us,” Singh added. Sunita added that the government should accept the demands of farmers. “It is a matter of concern that both sides are not speaking to each other. There have been no talks since January 22. The government should accept their demands. It is the government who will have to accept the demands of the farmers. The route for talks will be opened by the prime minister or the agriculture minister,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/did-not-call-him-when-he-broke-down-on-television-says-rakesh-tikait-s-wife-sunita-devi-101612807913262.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Two killed, one injured in clash over property in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: Two cousins were killed while their uncle was severely injured when two groups in a Badalpur village allegedly clashed over a property dispute on Monday morning.The deceased were identified as Amit (40) and Salek (34), residents of Girdharpur village in Greater Noida’s Badalpur area. Their uncle, Prem Singh, is currently undergoing treatment.According to locals, Amit’s family allegedly had a dispute with another group over a pathway adjacent to some fields in the village. The path had allegedly been blocked by the other group, to which the group Amit belonged to had objected a few days back.“On Monday morning they were holding a panchayat with the village pradhan to resolve the issue. However, the two groups started arguing and the matter soon escalated,” said Pradeep Singh, a local from the village.Eyewitnesses said the group Amit belonged to allegedly fired in the air and Salek allegedly slapped someone from the other group, after which things got out of hand.“The other group started firing rounds in which Amit, Salek and Prem Singh sustained injuries in the chest. The shooters and their supporters then fled from the spot while the injured were taken to a hospital nearby,” alleged Singh.Amit and Salek were declared brought dead while Prem is said to be stable.According to police officers, the incident was reported around 11am, after which heavy police force was deployed in the village.“It seems that the pradhan was related to the group Amit belonged to, and during the panchayat the accused party started objecting to the discussion. The land adjacent to the pathway in question belongs to relatives of the victim party. The suspects are on the run at the moment and teams have been formed to look for them,” said deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2, Harish Chander.Police personnel recovered three vehicles from the spot, allegedly belonging to the suspects, which were left behind. The family of the deceased has not filed a complaint in the matter, said the police. “We will register a case as soon as they approach us,” said the DCP.He also said that the two groups were booked on an earlier occasion as well for disrupting public disorder under relevant sections of the CrPC.The situation in the village is now under control, said the police.The DCP added that the weapons allegedly used in the incident appear to be licenced and action is being taken to suspend the licences. It is also being verified if any shots were fired by the victim’s side as well.The bodies were handed over to families following autopsy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-killed-one-injured-in-clash-over-property-in-greater-noida-101612807853823.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Noida’s air quality drops to ‘very poor’ again||Noida: After oscillating between ‘moderate’ and ‘poor’ category for three days, the air quality of Noida and adjoining areas on Monday dropped to ‘very poor’ levels again. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday was 310 against 238 a day earlier. Similarly, Greater Noida’s AQI value also went up to 319 against 224 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 329 against 251 on Sunday. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Weather analysts stated that the wind speed dropped on Monday, while parts of the national capital region (NCR) also saw mist in the morning leading to accumulation of the particle pollutants in the air. “The wind speed dropped on Monday and is expected to drop further,” said an official at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the pollution levels are likely to increase. “Surface winds are calm and forecasted to decrease gradually. The dip in ventilation is likely to influence air quality negatively. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate but predicted to remain within the very poor category for the next two days. The high end of very poor AQI is forecasted by February 11,” said a SAFAR statement on Monday. Meanwhile, mercury is likely to hover around season’s average which is around 8 degrees Celsius for minimum temperature and 24 degrees for maximum, IMD said. “The region may see moderate fog during early morning hours,” said the IMD official quoted above. On Monday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 10.1 degrees Celsius against 12.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 24.1 degrees Celsius which is same as a day earlier. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Tuesday is likely to hover around 8 degrees and 25 degrees Celsius, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-air-quality-drops-to-very-poor-again-101612807853245.html

The two brothers were also arrested by sector 20 police while police started to identify the people involved in the robbery.“We got inputs about the movement of the car which was used in the robbery. Following this, a team was formed and the car was intercepted near the Rajnigandha underpass,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO), sector 20 police station.The SHO said that police recovered the licensed pistol from the car and arrested the suspect, Rajkumar Tiwari, a native of Delhi.Singh said that Tiwari was not a part of the robbery in December, but was hiding the weapon and the car with him and was on his way to dispose of the two when he was arrested. He was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-mp-cop-s-service-revolver-robbed-in-sector-18-market-recovered-101612807793898.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Residents raise concern over stray cattle in Noida as 55-year-old lands in hospital||Noida: Severely injured and just out of coma, for Jitendra Kumar merely fetching his morning milk supplies turned into a near fatal experience as the 55-year-old was rammed by stray cattle.According to the locals who rescued him, Kumar was run over by a spooked cow who came running from behind near the local dairy, a stone’s throw away from his rented apartment at Sector 22.Doctors said the victim -- in coma when brought to the hospital – had seizure, multiple injuries in his ribs, clotting and head injuries, and had to be kept on ventilator for a day. While Kumar came out of coma on Monday and is now recovering, the concern of local residents is – “who will be the next victim?”“It seemed the patient had a seizure right at the time of the cattle attack, besides multiple injuries and clots. We had to keep him on ventilator for some time. By the end of the day he was extubated but kept in ICU. Now he is recovering. This is not the first time that we have treated a person injured due to stray animals,” said Dr Akash Mishra, senior consultant neurosurgeon, Metro Hospital, Noida. With over 2,000 stray cattle—oxen, bulls and cows – mostly discarded and a few ferals already living out in the open with nowhere to go, one can easily spot a herd at almost every sector, road nook and corner of the city.“There are more than 100 stray cattle in Sector 22 alone, where I live,” said Moolchand Sharma, the victim’s landlord. Noida authority officials had earlier stated that two more cow sheds had been planned to house and feed stray cattle.The residents of different sectors said they feel scared due to the rising numbers or stray cows and oxen especially around local vegetable markets and souks.“It is really very scary as numbers of stray cattle are multiplying quickly. Be it any road in Sector 74 to 77 and especially the vegetable market of Sector 77, it is very difficult to commute at times, and also threatening as the animals can attack you. It’s high time the Noida authority takes the issue seriously,” said Amit Gupta, city-based social activist and a resident of Sector 77. According to the authority, there must be at least 2,000 stray cattle on roads of Noida alone, and they are developing infrastructure to cater to the same.“The tendering process to build larger cowsheds had been done. The new infrastructure will have a capacity to hold 1,500 cows and 500 bulls or oxen,” said SC Mishra, project engineer (health), Noida authority. Officials, however, point out abandonment as one of the major reasons for the rising number of stray cattle in the city.“Only 10 out of 100 cows or cattle on the streets are feral. The remaining are either abandoned or left on roads after their utility ends,” Mishra added. When asked why action is not taken against such owners, the official said that they “tried and failed”.“We had taken up drives in areas like Barola, Harola, Bhangel, Naya Bans and Nithari. However, locals, mostly owners, come armed with sticks and take the cattle back. What can be done with such stubbornness,” Mishra said. Animal activists peg the number of bovines in the district to be around 5,000, based on the count of animals they fed during lockdown. The forest department, during their 2019 animal census, had noted at least 217 “feral cows” in the city – which are the second generation of bovines born to abandoned cattle on roads.“Based on the number of bovines we have fed during the lockdown there must be at least 5,000 animals on the streets of Noida alone, including urban rural areas,” said Kaveri Rana, district head, People for Animal (PFA), adding that there’s a lag at the administration’s part. According to experts, there is no data on fatalities or accidents caused due to stray cattle, and that ground work is needed to make the roads and cattle safe. “This is such a big problem but everyone turns their eyes away. It’s the municipalities’ work to look for a solution. But the issue is that we have very little information to work this issue out, including no data on the number of accidents caused, leaving both human and cattle injured,” Rohit Baluja, President, Institute of Road Traffic Education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-raise-concern-over-stray-cattle-in-noida-as-55-year-old-lands-in-hospital-101612807793291.html

Yeida on December 14 last year had finalised CBRE South Asia Private Limited as the consultant for the state government’s ambitious project to be developed in sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway.“The report will consist of feasibility study, financial model, developmental model, design and the best practices, among others. Once it is submitted on February 10, the authority will send the same to the Uttar Pradesh government for further decision,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.The project report will also cover future demand, employment, cost and revenue estimates, break-even point, and roles of various stakeholders, among others, officials said.Yeida has been exploring three models -- public-private partnership (PPP), the authority alone, or another single developer -- to develop the project. The DPR is expected to find an answer to this question. “The UP government will decide the model for the project once it receives the CBRE report. Then the model will be discussed and approved by the state cabinet. Once the cabinet approves it, the authority will implement the model,” said a UP government official not authorised to speak to the media.On September 18 last year, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced the development of the Film City project. Subsequently, Yeida offered land located only six km from the upcoming Jewar airport and 12 km from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The upcoming Film City is expected to provide the platform to encompass all aspects of filmmaking -- related with script, music, writing, editing and production -- under a single roof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dpr-of-film-city-project-to-be-ready-by-feb-10-101612807733716.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Noida Metro starts fast trains on Aqua Line||Noida: Aimed at reducing travel time by nine minutes during peak hours, the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Monday started the ‘fast train’ service on its Aqua Line that connects Noida and Greater Noida.The average run time of a train on the Aqua Line from Sector 51 Metro station in Noida to Depot station in Greater Noida is 45 minutes 43 seconds (one way). For the fast trains, this was reduced to 36 minutes 40 seconds, NMRC officials said, adding that the ridership on the route increased on Monday. “The ridership went up by around 870 to 13,446 today compared to last Monday from morning till 8pm,” said Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC. On February 1, the Aqua Line had recorded a ridership of 12,578 from morning till 8pm, she said.The fast train service has been made available from terminal stations -- Sector 51 station in Noida and Depot station in Greater Noida -- from 8am to 11am, and 5pm to 8pm on weekdays to cover peak hour rush. Out of the 21 stations on the Aqua Line, 10 stations, which have previously shown low ridership, have been skipped under the new system. The stations that were skipped are: Sector 50, Sector 101, Sector 81, Sector 83, Sector 143, Sector 144, Sector 145, Sector 146, Sector 147 and Sector 148.Commuters have appreciated the new initiative. “There are a few stations where no one ever gets in. There is no point in stopping at such stations. The new system will save our time,” said Manish Chauhan, a student travelling on the Aqua Line.Signages and regular announcements with respect to the initiative are being made at all the Metro stations of the Aqua Line, the officials said.Aishwarya, a daily commuter and a student of an institute in Greater Noida, said, “I travelled around 4pm and the regular trains were running at the time. However, there was no announcement about the fast trains.” NMRC also said that the frequency of trains from Monday to Friday will remain the same i.e., 7.5 minutes during peak hours and 10 minutes during non-peak hours. On weekends, Aqua Line trains will continue to run at a frequency of 15 minutes with no skipping of stations.On Monday, the run time between Sector 51 Metro station and Pari Chowk Metro station was reduced to 28 minutes 30 seconds during the peak hours as against 37 minutes, the officials said.NMRC had earlier said that QR code-based tickets would not be sold for the left out stations during the ‘fast trains’ running hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-metro-starts-fast-trains-on-aqua-line-101612807733219.html
08-02-2021||Noida||Authority to hire consultant for New Noida project soon||NOIDA: The blueprint for ‘New Noida’, a new city to be brought under the ambit of Noida, is to be worked out soon as the Noida authority is likely to hire a consultant for the project.The consultant will design the layout, define land-use, development model and other details for the New Noida project that aims to acquire at least 20,000 hectares of agricultural land increasing the size of the city to double of what it is today. “We are likely to issue a request for a proposal inviting bids from interested agencies. Once the agency is selected, we will plan out the development model. The authority will start its job only after the state government approves the development model,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Officials said the state government has not specified whether it will acquire agricultural land from farmers as per provisions of the Land Pooling Policy, direct purchase or the Land Act, 2013.“Nothing has been decided yet. After the consultant suggests some models, the state government will finalise the matter and issue directions,” said Maheshwari.On January 3 this year, the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to add 80 more villages to Noida – 60 from Bulandshahr and 20 from Gautam Budh Nagar – with an aim to ready industrial land so as to create opportunities by boosting growth in the region, as no more land is available within the existing city limits for new allotments. As of now, Noida is spread over 54 villages.At present, Noida is spread across 20,000 hectares, bookended by the Yamuna and Hindon rivers. It has around 16,000 hectares of urbanised area, of which 47% is for residential development, 13% industrial usage and the rest is for other usages such as commercial, institutional, and green purposes. It is left with about 250 hectares of land earmarked for industrial usage but is yet to be acquired from farmers, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/authority-to-hire-consultant-for-new-noida-project-soon-101612807673272.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||Sare Home residents take over collection of electricity bills||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Monday approved a nine-member committee of Sare Home residents for collecting electricity bills from residents and depositing the same with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN). Around 900 families living in the society in Sector 92 had been pleading with the department and district administration that collection of electricity charges and deposit of bills should be handed over to the residents’ welfare association (RWA)as the facility management appointed by developer was not regularly paying the bills on behalf of the residents. The DTCP on Monday issued a letter, giving approval to the interim committee comprising nine members, including the president of the RWA of different phases and a representative from the facility management company. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that residents of the society have been complaining that despite payment of advance bills owing to prepaid metres, the money was not being paid regularly and consequently the consumers were facing problems due to frequent outages and disconnections. “The committee will help in collection of bills and payment to the utility,” he said. Pravin Malik, president of one of the RWAs of Sare Home condominium, said that the problems being faced by residents due to non-payment of bills would be resolved now. Drive against encroachmentsMeanwhile, in a related development, the enforcement team on Monday visited the market of Malibu Town and removed the encroachments from the corridors. The enforcement team also asked the shop owners to clear encroachments and told them that they would visit again for inspection in a week’s time. Bhath said that the team also visited the Nirvana Country Yard market and removed encroachments.

08-02-2021||Gurugram||Air remains in poor zone for second day on the trot||The city’s air quality remained in the poor zone for the second consecutive day on Monday, recording a reading of 298 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was a deterioration from Sunday’s AQI reading of 209. Experts said that the air quality had deteriorated since pollutants couldn’t be dispersed on account of calmer winds.The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant was 174.07 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 388.79 µg/m3 on Tuesday. The PM 2.5 concentration at Gwal Pahari and Teri gram monitors stood at 199.4 µg/m3 and 211.08 µg/m3 respectively, all of which were above the safe limit of 60µg/m³. As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the average wind speed is expected to be lower than 10kmph on Tuesday, which is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. VK Soni, the head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) environment monitoring and research centre, said, “Currently, the winds were calm. When the wind speed is below 10 kmph we say that winds are slow and not favourable for good air quality. The winds are expected to slow down further from tomorrow afternoon on account of which the AQI is likely to deteriorate tomorrow and day after.”Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said that local pollutants couldn’t get dispersed due to calmer winds. “The winds were stronger three to four days ago, due to which the dispersion of local pollutants was better. Since calm winds are prevailing now, local dispersion couldn’t take place,” said Panwar. He said that the pollutants were peaking during the early morning and late night hours whereas afternoons were cleaner. “The AQI takes into account the average value and will always be higher than the absolute value. The pollutants peak at night and the reading takes into account the night time pollution as well,” said Panwar. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate and enter the upper end of the very poor category on Tuesday and Wednesday. Subsequently, over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the very poor category.While the IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature on Tuesday, the IMD’s AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 9.5 degrees Celsius. The city’s maximum temperature stood at 23.5 degrees Celsius.As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to hover around 8 and 24 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday. A partly cloudy sky is also expected during the day on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-remains-in-poor-zone-for-second-day-on-the-trot-101612806116113.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||Five, including Delhi cop, booked for abetting property dealer’s suicide||Five persons, including a Delhi police official, have been booked on Sunday for allegedly abetting the suicide of a Gurugram-based property dealer. The police said the man committed suicide on February 4 due to continuous harassment, torture and threat from the suspects, who were refusing to return his money.The victim was a 40-year-old resident of Nathupur in DLF Phase 3 and had started a real estate company in 2015 along with two others, also residents of the same locality. They had purchased a property in Dehradun in Uttarakhand, with a plan to construct villas on it.In the meantime, the trio also invested in another plot, a part of which was sold to a Delhi police personnel without the victim’s knowledge and consent, the police said. The two others shared the profits between themselves, the police said.The wife of the victim said that her husband had refused to sign the no-objection certificate for the land deal, which led to disputes between the partners. She alleged that they were forcing her husband to hand over his share of the plot to the Delhi policeman. “My husband demanded his share of money to transfer his share of land but they did not give any money, following which the land was not transferred,” she said.The woman said that last year, the policeman had registered a case against her husband and his business partners in Delhi. The victim and his partners were arrested by the Delhi Police and were released on bail after almost two months.She said that her husband restarted his work with another partner, but he turned out to be a close aide of the suspects and he suffered huge loss once again. “The suspects often visited our house, threatened to frame my husband in another case and kill us, including our children,” she said.The police said that on February 4, the victim left to buy some medicines, went to a rented property, where he was running a paying guest accommodation and hanged himself from the ceiling fan.After a preliminary investigation, a case was registered at the DLF Phase-3 police station under sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have registered a case against five people and are yet to make an arrest. “We are probing all angles of the case and have recorded the statement of the wife and have taken call detail records of the deceased,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-including-delhi-cop-booked-for-abetting-property-dealer-s-suicide-101612806115568.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||A week after reopening, government schools record nearly 60% attendance||A week after government schools across the city reopened for classes 6-8 after nearly 11 months, attendance is picking up even though schools continue to grapple with the task of bridging the learning gap due to prolonged closure. School heads said that nearly 50-60% students have started visiting schools for physical classroom sessions and the key challenge is to ensure that all students are on the same page in terms of learning.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that attendance in classes was gradually getting back to pre-pandemic levels with teachers striving to recap important topics. “Class strength is getting back to normal with each passing day. The bigger challenge that remains is to bridge the learning gap. There are students who missed out on the lessons due to lack of digital devices while those who were connected remotely couldn’t keep up with the lessons or fully comprehend what was being taught,” said Sharma.Schools across the country were closed in March last year amid the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. Voluntary visits to schools in Haryana for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. Schools were reopened for students in classes 6-8 last Monday. Teachers and school heads said that while students in senior classes were relatively self-reliant, students in classes 6 to 8 had not been able to keep up with the lessons imparted during the lockdown. To cover up the learning gap, teachers have been directed to ensure that the first few weeks are used for revision of key lessons that were covered during remote classes.Rajesh Kumar, who teaches science to students in classes 6-8, said that many students who were connected through WhatsApp where at best passive recipients. “During remote classes, students did not ask questions out of hesitancy. They couldn’t clarify the doubts then and did not get adequate support from the parents either. They have a poor understanding of concepts. We plan to revise lessons so that students get a chance to clarify their doubts before proceeding ahead,” said Kumar. He said that the last period of the daily schedule is being used to practice writing.Raj Kumar, principal, Government Senior Secondary School in Islampur, said that teachers were trying to ascertain students’ understanding of lessons and felt that not all students had been able to fully understand the topics. “While lessons were relayed over WhatsApp groups, the concepts were not fully grasped by students. Many students didn’t have any support at home. Now, when teachers ask questions, we are able to understand that substantial hand-holding will be needed to bridge this gap,” said Kumar. Kamal Chandra, a Class 6 student, said that physical classes were better for comprehension. “While I was connected to teachers via WhatsApp, sometimes the messages would get lost or take a lot of time to get loaded. There was some gap in responding to tests and notes. I like the classroom since there is no lag,” said Chandra. Kalpna Singh, deputy district education officer, admitted that the prolonged closure of schools had impacted the learning levels and getting back on track would take time. She said that teachers had been asked to take cognisance of the fact that children were away from regular learning for the past 11 months and teach accordingly. “A significant gap in learning has developed over the last year. Students, especially in younger classes, need help in picking up writing and oral skills. I have asked teachers to ensure that students get to practise writing in the last period. We need to see if students are able to articulate their understanding of topics through writing after this gap,” said Singh. Meanwhile private schools continued to remain closed for physical classroom sessions. Most schools said that they would continue to hold online classes till the situation gets back to normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/a-week-after-reopening-government-schools-record-nearly-60-attendance-101612806114982.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||Covid vaccinations: 80% coverage marks upturn in coverage of front-line workers||Over 80% of 7,500 front-line workers from various government departments turned up for the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Monday, according to the district health department.The turnout spiked massively after the drive reported a poor footfall of 54% last week. Senior officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), revenue and other departments took the vaccine jabs on Monday to assuage apprehensions among their staff.The vaccination drive day was held across the state to cover nearly 35,000 front-line workers. In Gurugram, the health department had set a target of 8,000 people, including 500 healthcare workers, at 61 session sites.Of the 7,500 front-line workers, at least 6,025 were from the revenue department, MCG, panchayati raj institutions, National Security Guard (NSG), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and the Gurugram police.About 1,277 police personnel of the 2,000 targeted took the vaccine shots on the day. Deepak Saharan, a deputy commissioner of police, took the vaccine shot to motivate the station house officers.Rajeev Arora, the additional chief secretary, health and home department, also visited the vaccination sites at sectors 51 and 45. “To make the drive successful, I have personally spoken to DGPs, SPs, MCG commissioner, among others, to encourage their staff. It has been decided that every week, a large-scale vaccination drive will be conducted to cover maximum front-line workers,” said Arora.The footfall of the revenue department officials also increased on Monday. At least 85 of the 100 who were listed turned up for the vaccination. Earlier, not more than 15 people from the revenue department had turned up for vaccination so far.Also, the inoculation of employees from panchayats in Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar blocks started. Almost 42% of the 300 targeted were covered at the 10 session sites.“Each of the department heads had been personally approached by us to motivate the front-line workers for vaccination. Of the 29,000 front-line workers vaccinated across the state, Gurugram’s contribution has been the highest,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Under the drive, almost 3,600 personnel of various security forces, under the union ministry of home affairs, were also targeted and 3,140 were vaccinated.According to Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer, the staff of NSG and CRPF were given Covaxin vaccine. “Roughly, 2,060 NSG staff and 380 from CRPF got inoculated with Covaxin, while at the remaining sites across the district, vaccine beneficiaries received Covishield shot,” said Singh.He said, “More session sites will be set up for the security forces in the next week. The Gurugram jail will also be covered, where almost 260 employees have to take the shot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccinations-80-coverage-marks-upturn-in-coverage-of-front-line-workers-101612806114325.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG workers turn up for Covid-19 vaccinations after officials intervene||The turnout of sanitation workers for Covid-19 vaccinations on Day 3 witnessed a major jump, following an intervention by the civic body’s commissioner. After voicing concerns about the Covid-19 vaccines, leaders of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) sanitation workers’ union had previously stayed away from the vaccinations, but turned up for the jabs on Day 3. Overall, 1,445 MCG workers, including those who missed the vaccinations on the first two days, took the vaccine shots at the 15 session sites set up for the MCG on Monday. Officials said this marks a big increase as only 228 workers were vaccinated on the first two days, against their target of 1,000 workers.The MCG has decided to revise its targets and set weekly ones centre wise — 492 is the highest vaccination target, at the Sector 39 community centre, and 204 is the lowest target, at the MCG’s Sector 34 office.Overall, 6,977 MCG officials have been categorised as front-line workers, of whom nearly 70% are sanitation workers. The majority of sanitation workers, following the lead of their union leaders, had refrained from getting themselves vaccinated amid fears of after-effects.On Monday, the MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh held talks with the union leaders and made them understand its importance.“A vaccine for Covid-19 is a matter of the highest importance across the globe. MCG officials are classified as front-line workers for a reason, as they not only travel to different corners of the city but are also engaged in its preventive measures. If they failed to get themselves vaccinated during this stage, their turn is likely to come after a gap of nearly six months, as per the age group decided by the central government,” said Singh.He said that he made union leaders understand that if sanitation workers aren’t vaccinated at this stage, it may not only be a health hazard for them but also for thousands of Gurugram residents too, including their families and friends.“I made sure that a few major union leaders are vaccinated and asked them to ensure that all sanitation workers come forward and complete the process, as they too fall in the category of front-line workers. Front-line workers have been given this opportunity by the government, which should be availed of by all. Doctors are available on the spot in all the vaccination camps and no person needs to panic for any reason,” said Singh, who also took a Covid-19 vaccine shot at a community centre in Sector 15 on Monday.Rajesh Kumar, president of the union of MCG’s sanitation workers, said, “I had met the MCG commissioner outside the vaccination centre in Sector 15. He informed us about its importance. Subsequently, another union leader and I got the vaccine as well. We have reached out to other sanitation workers to also come forward.”To further expedite the process and provide easier access to front-line workers, the MCG on Monday also increased their vaccination session sites from five to 15. Also, officials said they are aiming to finish the process within this week.“We have increased the total number of vaccination centres and placed them at strategic locations where the number of MCG officials is the highest. This way, workers can visit their nearest centre in quick time and without much hassle. It will also ensure that we can finish the vaccination process at the earliest possible timeline,” said Dr Ashish Singla, senior medical officer, MCG.Of the 15 vaccination centres, 14 have been set up at community centres in sectors 27, 39, 15, 45, 10A, 4, 7, 47, Islampur village, Badshahpur, Sukhrali, Tigra village, Basai Enclave and Sikanderpur, while one centre has also been set up at the MCG’s main office in Sector 34.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-workers-turn-up-for-covid-19-vaccinations-after-officials-intervene-101612806113785.html
08-02-2021||Gurugram||Truck on wrong side rams car, leaves one dead||A 32-year-old man was killed in an accident on the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) in Badshahpur, after the car he was travelling in was rammed by a speeding truck moving on the wrong side of the road in the early hours of Monday. According to the police, the collision took place around 3.15am, when Ashish Yadav, who ran a private company, was returning to his residence in Vatika India Next in Sector 82, near Kherki Daula, along with a friend. After the collision with the truck, the car hit the road divider and turned turtle due to the impact, said police. The police said that Yadav was rushed to a private hospital on Sohna Road by his friend, who also hurt. She called an ambulance and the hospital staff informed the police. The police said that his Honda City car was completely damaged due to the impact. Vipin Kumar, station house officer of Badshahpur police station, said, “The truck driver was driving on the wrong side and there was a massive head-on collision between the two vehicles. The man, who was driving, had sustained severe injuries and was rushed to a hospital from where he was referred to another hospital in Sector 43, where he succumbed to his injuries.” The police said the driver of the truck fled the spot in his vehicle immediately after the incident. He is yet to be identified or arrested. “We have received a complaint from Captain Veer Singh Yadav, the father of the deceased, and have registered a case. The truck driver will also be nabbed soon. The man died of excessive bleeding and head injuries,” said Kumar. Yadav’s body was handed over to his family after a post-mortem examination. His father said that he received a call around 3.30am from his son’s friend, who called her using his phone. “My family members and I reached the hospital in Sector 43.

According to the police, Vivek Sharma, a Delhi resident, complained to the city police that the agency promised to get him admission to a college in Germany and also assured to him get Level 1 and Level 2 language certifications. He had come across a private company in 2018. Sharma said that they promised him to get him a student visa within two months. “They asked me to deposit money in four instalments, to which I agreed and signed an agreement with them in January 2019. Since then, I have been waiting to travel,” he said. Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, DLF, said, “We have registered a cheating case against them and raids are being conducted for their arrest.”Goel said that the suspects have duped not only Sharma, but at least five more students. “We are waiting to receive complaints from them, following which more cases will be registered against the suspects for duping students and wasting their crucial years of studies,” he said. The police said that the agreement signed by Sharma had a provision that the complainant shall clear A1 and A2 levels of German language by April 30, 2019, failing which the legal agreement would stand cancelled and that the fees paid would not be refunded. “The suspects, in order to make wrongful gains, intentionally delayed my German classes and started them on April 1. It was not possible to clear A1 and A2 levels of German language in one month and I denied to appear in the exams. They asked me to pay an additional ₹1.5 lakh to save the year — ₹50,000 immediately and the rest of the amount after reaching Germany,” said Sharma. In August 2019, the Sharma contacted the company several times but they allegedly ignored his calls and messages. However, in December 2019, they allegedly asked him to pay them ₹1.5 lakh for extension of A1 and A2 levels, ₹30,000 for travelling expenses, ₹20,000 for health insurance and ₹90,000 for hostel accommodations in Berlin, the police said. Sharma said he received a fake visa on February 12 last year and on the same day, they demanded ₹4 lakh for obtaining the offer letter from the university. He said that meanwhile, as the government implemented a lockdown to curtail the spread of Covid-19, there was no progress till July. He alleged that they had stopped responding to his calls and threatened his life. The police said that Sharma then contacted the German embassy but could not clear the subsequent processes as his documentation was found to be invalid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/eight-booked-for-duping-student-of-rs-15-25-lakh-on-pretext-of-education-in-germany-101612806053222.html

Former head of the Gaushal Panchayat, Megh Singh, said in the valley such as Lahaul, which is most affected in the Himalayan region due to glacier breaches and avalanches, the government has planned as many as 56 hydroelectric projects.“The fragile ecosystem of Lahul valley would be destroyed if these projects are executed,” he said.Also read: ISRO experts revealed mix of rockfall, snow avalanche caused Chamoli tragedy - CMSushila Rana, head of Gaushal Panchayat, said they will not give no-objection certificate (NOC) to the Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam-promoted 104-megawatt Tandi Project. A 104-megawatt project is planned at Tandi, the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga which is sacred to the local population. “We will oppose other projects also,” she said.Vikram Katoch, vice-president of 'Save Lahaul Spiti', a social organisation, said people of Lahaul-Spiti were deeply concerned after what has happened in Uttrakhand and added that more and more people were coming out and opposing dam projects.“The dam projects require lots of blasting and drilling of hills and constructing tunnels under the mountains. The neighbouring Kinnaur district has seen enough destruction where a number of projects are being constructed,” he said.All villages plan to pass resolutions against hydel projects and send them to the Governor and the President of India, he added.Himachal Pradesh has a potential of tapping 27,400 MW of electricity by damming its rivers, of which only 10,519 MW has been generated so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/villagers-in-himachal-s-tribal-areas-pass-resolutions-against-dam-101612799667391.html
08-02-2021||Dehradun||ISRO experts revealed mix of rockfall, snow avalanche caused Chamoli tragedy: CM||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientists have revealed that the Chamoli tragedy was caused by a mix of snow and rock avalanche and that satellite images have shown no glacier breakage there.CM Rawat told this to reporters after chairing a meeting of senior government functionaries, senior officers of the Army, the ITBP and ISRO scientists.The chief minister said that ISRO scientists told him that a few days back there was snowfall in the affected area. “And from one trigger point due to rockfall at the top, it all slid downwards. Due to this, lakhs of tonnes of snow came gushing down which led to the tragedy. The ISRO scientists said the satellite imagery doesn’t show any glacier breakage and that this area is not avalanche-prone”.In a similar vein, Pradeep Srivastava, a scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun said that preliminary data suggests Chamoli tragedy was not caused by any glacial outburst but took place due to the sliding of the rock mass exposed on the top of the glacier and snow avalanche.Also read: 'Hanging glacier broke away from main structure in Uttarakhand' - DRDO“Due to freezing and thawing, rock mass broke away and slid down. Data suggests 0.2 km rock mass broke away and slid down, adding to the debris accumulated down the glacier. This created a melting layer near debris and the sliding snow. The rock avalanche was evident from the huge clouds of dust that came down with the flowing muck and debris”.Srivastava said on February 6 there was snow in the area and on February 7 the average temperature was 5 to 6 degrees there, which was enough to melt the snow.“Satellite imagery shows snow on February 6 and no snow on the slopes on February 7. So it seems that it was a mix of snow avalanche and rock avalanche which led to the disaster,” he said.Srivastava said in a glacier there are many sources of water.“Water can come from surface snow, from big cavities in glaciers and water trapped in crevices. Besides, water also melts due to pressure from the base of the glacier. But our teams will inspect the area and give details about what exactly happened there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/isro-experts-revealed-mix-of-rockfall-snow-avalanche-caused-chamoli-tragedy-cm-101612796354882.html

Working for almost the whole day on Sunday, they are no short of energy to save lives but face the challenge of a huge amount of muck brought by the swollen Rishi Ganga river in the incident.The rescue workers, which include personnel from state disaster response force (SDRF), national disaster response force (NDRF), armed forces and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), recovered 18 bodies of the 202 missing people till Monday evening. Major rescue work is going on in a tunnel which is about 900 metres long in the Dhauli Ganga dam at Tapovan in which about 35 workers are feared trapped.Praveen Alok, spokesperson for the SDRF, which was the first to reach the spot for rescue work on Sunday along with the local police said, "The biggest challenge in the rescue work is the huge amount of muck."Also read: 'Hanging glacier broke away from main structure in Uttarakhand' - DRDO"The rescue workers are working very cautiously as they are unable to assess the level of muck inside. Around 35 people are feared trapped inside the tunnel," said Alok.He added, "It is a considerably difficult situation to work in because we don't know how deep the muck is inside the long tunnel. The engineers in our SDRF teams, after assessing the situation, have asked the rescue workers to put a wooden plank and then walk on it inside the tunnel to avoid any untoward incident while working."Alok also informed that the rescue workers are "working tirelessly to save lives in the area after the tragedy.""On Sunday, after the incident was reported, our men started the rescue work at 11 am and continued the whole night. On Sunday morning, they were replaced by another team which is continuing the rescue work. They are working in rotation so as to get some rest as the team which worked till Monday morning has been asked to rest and resume on Tuesday. All are working for minimum 10-12 hours, braving all odds including the muck and the Himalayan winter," said Alok.State director general of police (DGP), Ashok Kumar, said that the main focus of the rescue work is on the tunnel while clearing the muck inside."The rescue workers are clearing the muck with the help of heavy machines to rescue those trapped inside.

08-02-2021||Chandigarh||With 1,600 glacial lakes, Himachal at flood risk||The glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) at Joshimath in Uttarakhand has once again put the spotlight on the 1,600 glacial lakes that have formed in Himalayan river basins in Himachal Pradesh and pose a threat to settlements and ecology in case of a rupture. The formation of these lakes, which vary in size from five to 10 hectares, has been primarily attributed to global warming, climate change and local factors. SS Randhawa, principal scientific officer at the State Centre on Climate Change, said, “The situation in Himachal Pradesh is no different from that in Uttarakhand. The lakes pose a grave threat to all that lies downstream.” “Glacial lakes that are over 10 hectares in size pose a greater threat and have to be monitored regularly,” Randhawa said. 2005 lake burst An artificial lake formed in a geomorphic depression in the course of Parceehu River had burst in 2005 when rapid glacial melting in summers had increased the water level in the river. The lake burst had caused extensive damage along the Sutlej River. The resulting flood had washed away at least 12 bridges in the Kinnaur-Rampur belt and several villages, including Leo village in Kinnaur. Sutlej’s water level had increased by an unprecedented 25 metres. The damage to government properties was estimated to be around ₹800 crore. Rapid increase in lakes over last 5 years Himachal Pradesh Council of Science and Technology monitors lake formation in river basins through remote sensing and satellite data. Studies have revealed that rapidly melting glaciers have led to the formation of numerous lakes in the basins of perennial Himalayan rivers, including Sutlej, Chenab , Beas and Ravi and their tributaries, over the last five years and that the number of lakes has been increasing at an alarming rate. Data collected between 2015 and 2018 shows that there was a 36% drop in lakes in the Beas basin. However, there has been a 32% increase in lakes in the Chenab basin, 94% increase in the Ravi basin and 97% increase in the Sutlej basin.Sutlej has most glacial lakesAn analysis of images captured between 2015 to 2018 revealed that the Sutlej basin has 769 lakes, of which 663 are below five hectares, 57 lakes have an aerial range between five to 10 hectare and 49 lakes extend over 10 hectares. An additional 127 lakes have sprung up in the basin since 2017, indicating an overall increase of around 16% lakes in the basin.In the Chenab basin (Chandra, Bhaga, Miyar), 254 lakes were delineated, of which 64 were in the Chandra sub-basin, 84 in the Bhaga sub-basin and 106 in the Miyar sub-basin. The Chenab basin had 192 lakes in 2015. However, the count had increased to 254 in 2018. Notably, only 55 lakes had been reported in the Chenab basin in 2001.Aerial measurements indicate that 240 lakes are less than five hectares, 10 between five to 10 hectares and four extend over 10 hectares, which indicates a 20% reduction in bigger lakes. 35% decrease in Parvati sub-basinThere was a 35% decrease in lakes in the Parvati sub-basin in 2018 in comparison to 2017. Scientists attribute this anomaly to the high cloud cover in the Jiwa basin. Of the 65 lakes in the sub-basin, 58 lakes were small, with an area below five hectares, four lakes had an aerial range between five and 10 hectares and three lakes had an area of more than 10 hectares in 2018, indicating an overall reduction of around 36% for small lakes and a drop of 25% in case of bigger lakes since 2017. No change was apparent in lakes with an area between five to 10 hectares.In the Ravi basin, 66 lakes were documented in 2018, while only 54 had been mapped in 2017. Studies indicate three lakes were over 10 hectares, two lakes were between five to 10 hectares and 61 lakes were spread over less than five hectares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-1-600-glacial-lakes-himachal-at-flood-risk-101612789013006.html
08-02-2021||Patna||New agri laws in farmers' interests, misgivings should be dispelled: Bihar CM||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday observed that the new agriculture laws was in the "interests of the farmers", and expressed hope that misgivings over the legislations that have arisen in some states would be addressed squarely by the Centre.He asserted that the controversy around the new laws will have no impact in Bihar where Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were done away with more than a decade ago and a viable alternative system put in place.He also welcomed the assurance given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the floor of the Rajya Sabha earlier in the day, that the system of MSPs (minimum support price) will not be tinkered with while bringing in the agriculture reforms."It is good that the government has made it clear that MSPs are there to stay...these laws have been brought for the betterment of farmers. Bihar is not affected by the controversy since we abolished APMCs long back."The alternative system of procurement has given the farmers an opportunity to sell their produce wherever they want, and it is working fine," Kumar told reporters in reply to queries about the ongoing agitations.He, however, noted that the system of APMCs was very much in place in states like Punjab and Haryana which have been on the boil ever since the three laws were passed by Parliament."The good thing is that the Centre has shown the willingness to talk to those who have reservations about the new laws. I am sure it will be able to convince people that it has brought the laws with good intentions," he added.The JD(U) leader, who is running his government with the BJP as an alliance partner, however dodged queries about the much-awaited expansion of the state cabinet."When we get a list of prospective names (for ministerial berths), it (expansion) will take place," said Kumar with a cryptic smile.Speculations are rife that new faces will be inducted into the cabinet ahead of the budget session of the state assembly, which commences on February 19.Expansion of the cabinet has been hanging fire over the issue of berth allotment to members of Kumar's party and the BJP, which has emerged as the ally with more number of seats in the assembly, upending the power equations within the Bihar NDA.The ruling coalition also includes smaller parties like former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Bollywood set designer-turned-politician Mukesh Sahni's VIP.Currently 13-strong, the state cabinet has seven members from the BJP, including two deputy CMs, four from the JD(U) other than the chief minister, and one representative each from the HAM and the VIP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/new-agri-laws-in-farmers-interests-misgivings-should-be-dispelled-bihar-cm-101612788287642.html
08-02-2021||Dehradun||Chamoli disaster revives tales of Gaura Devi and her role in Chipko movement||Uttarakhand's Raini village in Chamoli district, where flash flood tragedy struck on Sunday, has played a central role in one of India’s first major environmental movements -the Chipko movement. Legendary Gaura Devi, who paved the way for the movement, hailed from this very village.The movement in the early 1970s became a rallying point for future non-violent environmental movements in India and even attracted international attention.Noted historian Ajay Singh Rawat, who has authored many books on Uttarakhand’s ecology and environment, said it was Gaura Devi who played a key role in the Chipko movement in March 1974 when contractors engaged by an Allahabad-based sports goods company came to Raini village to cut Ash trees.“The male members of the village had gone away. It was Gaura Devi and the women of the nearby villages who hugged the trees and didn’t allow the contractors to cut them. Raini village is divided by Rishiganga. One side is called Pala Raini while the other is known as Wala Raini. Devi was born on the Pala side in 1925 but came to live on the Wala side early in her life,” he said.Also read: 'Hanging glacier broke away from main structure in Uttarakhand' - DRDOInspired by Gandhian non-violence, the Chipko movement started in 1973 against felling of trees and spread throughout the Himalayas. The word 'Chipko' means 'to hug' and this is how the movement came to be known as the Chipko movement. The movement got attention across the country and the Central government brought Forest Protection Act, a law to regulate forests in a bid to conserve them across India.“It was because of her bravery and determination that the contractors backed off and the then Uttar Pradesh government set up a committee of experts to investigate the matter. Later, the committee maintained that the Raini forest area was an ecologically sensitive region and no trees should be felled there,” he said.“The environment movement she started made India realise the importance of forests and sustainable development, especially in the Himalayan region where it was the first such movement. It created awareness on the importance of forests and inspired many policy changes and people to fight for the cause of forests and local ecology."Rawat said that if Uttarakhand has good forest cover at present, Gaura Devi has a major role in it. “She changed our attitude and outlook towards forests. Her fight to save her forests also showed what villagers can do to save their green wealth from the commercial interests if they are determined to do so,” he said.Chipko movement leader Sunder Lal Bahuguna said the women from the hills have a special relationship with their local forests.“They go to forests every day to get grass and fallen branches. They know how to use forests without damaging them. They think of the forests as their mother, a provider. So when contractors came to cut trees, they hugged the trees and offered to be killed rather than allow contractors to fell trees,” he said“Whenever you play with Nature, cut forests, whenever you overexploit the rivers with too many dams, nature replies with such disasters. This disaster should remind us of the role of people like Gaura Devi and her message. We have to make more efforts to save the forests, ecology and environment of the Himalayas. Playing with nature will keep triggering such tragedies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/chamoli-disaster-revives-tales-of-gaura-devi-and-her-role-in-chipko-movement-101612785090109.html

08-02-2021||Pune||After BMC extends closing time for hotels, Pune hoteliers demand similar extension||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) extended the timings of hotels, restaurants, and bars to 1am, a similar demand is being made by the hoteliers and bar owners in Pune. The president of Pune hoteliers association has written to the city as well as district authorities to make this demand heard and has requested authorities to extend the timings of restaurants and bars to 1am as it was before pre-Covid time. Currently, hotels, restaurants are allowed to be open until 11.30pm in Pune city.“We have sent a mail to Pune mayor, Pune municipal commissioner and the district collector to demand an extension of timings until 1am on the lines of Mumbai. Earlier, we had a time limit until 1.30am for restaurants and bars. We haven’t received any response yet. I am seeking an appointment to meet authorities regarding this issue,” Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune restaurant and hoteliers association said. Around 8,500 restaurants are associated with Pune hoteliers’ associationAccording to the order issued by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on October 24, 2020, timings were extended for bars and restaurants from 10pm to 11.30pm. The Maharashtra government issued an order on January 29, 2021 extending the closing time of restaurants and bars to 1am. Following which, the BMC also issued an order on February 6, 2021 extending the closing timings of restaurants and bars in accordance with the state order. After this development, a similar demand is echoing from Pune as well.“We have to close the restaurant at 11.30pm now but we have to indulge in arguments with customers as we have to close the restaurants. We cannot accept customers after a certain time fearing police action. Our business is still allowed to be run at 50 per cent capacity but the business is increasing gradually after restaurants were allowed to be reopened after lockdown,” said Shetty.Arun Shinde, a restaurant owner on Paud road also expressed the same opinion. “There has been an increase in the number of customers. If customers come after 10.45pm we cannot accept them as we have to keep the restaurant’s closing timing in mind. This issue should be addressed.”On asking whether PMC is also considering the extension of closing timings for restaurants, Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “We will let you know when this decision is taken.” Pune Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar remained unavailable to respond.Meanwhile, Manjushree Khardekar, corporator from Karvenagar area said that in accordance with the Covid precautions, closing timings of the restaurants could be extended.“We have to remember that Covid-19 is still there. With proper enforcement of Covid protocols and law and order there shouldn’t be a problem with extending the closing timings of restaurants,” said Khardekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-bmc-extends-closing-time-for-hotels-pune-hoteliers-demand-similar-extension-101612783015002.html

Rawat while talking to the media here said that so far 11 bodies have been recovered and 201 are still missing. Darshan Singh Rawat, the chief minister’s media coordinator, confirmed the development. Also Read | PM Modi announces ex gratia of ₹2 lakh to kin of those killed in UttarakhandAccording to Praveen Alok, media in-charge, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), so far 15 people have been rescued from the Rishiganga dam site and 12 from NTPC’s Tapovan dam site. He said 70 SDRF personnel, two teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), 425 personnel of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), one team of Seema Suraksha Bal and 125 army personnel are carrying out the rescue and relief operations in the affected areas of Chamoli. “Apart from this, 400 ITBP personnel, 220 army personnel and three army choppers are on standby. Choppers are stationed at Joshimath,” he said. He added that search operation is on for recovering bodies downstream at Reni village, Tapovan, Joshimath, Ghochar, Karnprayag , Rudraprayag, Dharidevi and Srinagar. Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has already sent two teams of experts to study exactly what happened in Rishiganga catchment area which led to the flash flood. The teams are on their way to Chamoli and will likely reach there by Monday evening. Kalachand Sain, director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun, said, “One team will be led by Manish Mehta and another team by Amit Kumar. We want to understand whether the glacial lake burst led to allof the flooding or damaged the Rishiganga dam, which then added to the quantum of water in the flash floods. But prima facie it seems the glacial lake triggered the whole thing. And what is intriguing is that such a glacial outburst happens in the summer,” he said Manish Mehta said his team is on its way to Chamoli and. after reaching, will inspect the valley where the flash flood occurred. “It is unusual that a glacial lake burst in this season. But unless we study the area, we can’t say whether it was caused by glacial lake burst or some landslide induced water formation that burst and then caused this tragedy downstream.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cm-to-seek-isro-help-to-understand-what-caused-chamoli-tragedy-101612783013016.html

Now, PMC will have to make a detailed project report (DPR) again to start work on the project.Last year, Pawar had instructed the municipal administration to scrap the HCMTR and convert it into a Neo-Metro like Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has proposed in their area. After that, there was no development on the HCMTR front. However, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar has allocated ₹112 crore for HCMTR for road development, land acquisition and formation of special cell for the project.The corporation has estimated the cost of the project at ₹5,096 crore and three years to complete the project.PMC has also proposed three funding options- HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model). HAM’s a hybrid — a mix of the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) and BOT (build, operate, transfer) models and also DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer). But, the decision of selection of funding patter is pending for more than one year due to pandemic.HCMTR project, meanwhile, is on hold as National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given directives to take environment clearance from the central government’s environment department. Besides that, there were 12 changes in different routes in the six-kilometre stretch. Out of that, five changes are a major one. However, the state government has not given approval for the modification of HCMTR.Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer, road department, PMC, said, “After we get permission, we will be able to start work. We had already made a DPR of the project, but after the modifications, we will have to make it again.”Aba Bagul, Congress leader, said, “We are against Neo-Metro proposal. Even, Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, Union government urban development, said that Neo metro is applicable only in small cities. In Pune, the metro project is on, so there is no need for Neo-Metro.”“The tender was also floated for the project, but it was scrapped due to 40 per cent above the actual project cost. Now, the corporation will have to float the tender once again,” he said.“PMC has got 60 per cent of the land to run the project. We want only working permission on government land,” he said.”We will meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and urban development minister Eknath Shinde to speed up the process and grant us required permission for the same,” he said.Allocation for HCMTR in PMC draft budget 2021-22Special cell and appointment of consultant - ₹2 croreHCMTR road development- ₹100 croreLand acquisition - ₹10 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-allocates-rs-112-crore-for-hcmtr-despite-ajit-pawar-s-suggestion-of-neometro-101612782474142.html
08-02-2021||Pune||Elgar organisers back Usmani; BJP demands action against them||In a complete U-turn from their previous stand, the Elgar Parishad organisers have now backed Sharjeel Usmani who was booked by Pune police for making controversial remarks during the January 30 event in the city. Elgar organisers on Sunday issued a statement showing vehement support to Usmani (23), an activist and a student of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in light of two cases registered against him - one in Pune and one in Lucknow. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while slamming the organisers demanded action against them. Keshav Upadhye, chief spokesperson of the BJP state unit, said that the conclave was creating divisions in the society and demanded police action against the organisers for supporting Usmani’s statement. The 11-page long statement by the Bhima Koregaon Shauryadin Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella body which organised the second edition of Elgar Parishad on January 30, have urged the public to understand the context in which Usmani was speaking when he said that the current-day Hindus are rotten. The stand taken by Elgar organisers differs from earlier remarks by former HC judge BG Kolse Patil, who condemned the particular utterances of Usmani during his speech. Kolse Patil is one of the organisers of Elgar Parishad. “Sharjeel Usmani had pointed out the intolerance of the Hindu community by recounting the incident of Junaid. His supposedly ‘controversial’ statement was part of these remarks. Who was the Junaid that Sharjeel talked about? Fifteen-year-old Junaid was stabbed in public on the Delhi-Mathura railway in July 2017. Junaid, who was returning from Eid shopping with his brother and friends, was stabbed to death by some Hindu youths in a dispute over sharing a train seat,” read a part of the statement that has accused the government and other stakeholders of “cherry-picking” Usmani’s words. Upadhye took to Twitter to oppose the statement made by the organisers. “The organisers of Elgar Parishad, who are supporting the same Sharjeel Usmani who said Hindu samaj is rotten, should also face police action. By extending support to a person who aims to create disharmony in the society, they have proved that it is their aim too. Strict action should be taken against these organisers,” read the direct translation of his tweet in Marathi. The 11-page long speech invokes multiple scholars including Babasaheb Ambedkar, Prabodhankar Thackeray, Mukta Salve, and Krantiba Jyotiba Phule.Earlier last week, Swargate police booked Usmani under section 153(a) of IPC for promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/elgar-organisers-back-usmani-bjp-demands-action-against-them-101612782473591.html

There are over 65,000 registered FLWs from Pune city on the Co-Win app. The district administration first started that Covid-19 vaccination for frontline workers on Wednesday, February 3, at Aundh hospital when 67 FLWs got vaccinated. The city will see the vaccination drive for FLWs begin from Monday at two of the civic body-run hospitals namely Rajiv Gandhi hospital and Kamala Nehru hospital. Frontline workers include police officials, armed forces, disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, home guards, and civil defence organisations and prison staff. Since Wednesday as of Saturday, 1,046 frontline workers have been vaccinated with Covishield or Covaxin. FLWs are included in the phase one nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive in the country. PMC health chief, Dr Ashish Bharti said, “We have to start the vaccination for FLWs which will begin from Monday. We will start from at least two centres at two of our hospitals. We will start first with PMC sanitation workers and other civic body workers and then eventually with police personnel and PMPML staff who will be followed later. Depending on the response in the beginning, we will go ahead with the FLWs vaccination. We will have to follow the same process that we did for healthcare workers that is sending SMS and calls to the registered beneficiaries for FLWs too. However, for HCWs, we could call the respective hospital staff which is on duty and achieve the vaccination target. However, in case of FLWs, we are not sure of the attendance because they would not be at the same place and so we will start with these two sites first.”He further added that for HCWs the session sites had to be created as per the pin code and assuming that most of these FLWs live in the city areas of Shivajinagar and Pune stations, they will have to create the sites accordingly. Earlier the vaccination sites were restricted by the government of Maharashtra but now with more sites available, the PMC would begin the vaccination drive for its FLWs too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-civic-body-to-start-covid-19-vaccination-for-frontline-workers-civic-staff-to-be-first-beneficiaries-101612781693025.html

PMC additional commissioner (solid waste management department) Kunal Khemnar has ordered that bills will not be sanctioned until an inquiry is completed. The opposition has alleged that instead of offering wages to the cleaners on a daily basis, the civic body sanctioned bills on a rate per square feet basis causing loss of public money and PMC exchequer.According to the complainants, despite objections being raised by the vigilance department of the civic body, the cleaning contract bills were processed. The cleaning contract deals with as many as 52 Covid care centres which were operational in the city and despite a number of discrepancies in the contract tenders, efforts were not taken to rectify the mistakes, the complainants alleged.Khemnar said, “Based on the reports in public domain, an inquiry has been ordered in this case, though I am yet to receive a written complaint. We are investigating the issue. The department will investigate the papers and appropriate action will be taken. If previous sanction is not taken and bills have been sanctioned, then appropriate action will definitely be taken.”PMC leader of opposition Deepali Dhumal said, “We have demanded an inquiry into the issue of inflated bills against the department concerned, but no action has been taken till date. The department must follow integrity and ensure that public money is not wasted.”Arvind Shinde, corporator said, “I have given four letters to the commissioner regarding this issue. There were no labourers present during the lockdown period then how were the bills processed? We have demanded third party audit into this case, but the administration has gone ahead and approved the bills. I have complained to the urban development department seeking remedy from the top authority as the PMC administration is not paying any heed to my complaint.”Former mayor Siddharth Dhende said, “It is mandatory for state government’s special health committee to look into each of the bills. There are many discrepancies and only an artificial scrutiny has been done. Inflated bills must be rechecked and only genuine bills must be sanctioned. On what basis were calculations taken, also needs to be clarified. Charges to the cleaners should have been given per day as wages and not per square feet. This needs a complete inquiry and investigation as public money is being squandered by the administration for private profiteering.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/opposition-attacks-pune-civic-body-administration-over-inflated-covid-care-centre-cleaning-bills-101612781455482.html

Javadekar, who hails from Pune, clarified that city’s name did not find mention in the February 1 Union budget as there was no proposal sent by the state government. “Both Nashik and Nagpur metro projects have been allocated money because they are new proposals. No such proposal has come up for any of the new phases of metro rail in Pune,” Javadekar said during the press conference organised to highlight features of the budget presented by the finance minister. The minister also clarified that the Centre has earmarked ₹1.17 lakh crore only for road infrastructure in the country with funds being allocated for flyover at Katraj and six-laning of Katraj-Dehu bypass. The minister also stressed that the budget has also made enough allocations for the farm sector. “We have already demonstrated our commitment to the farm sector by purchasing additional foodgrains. The government is already depositing money in farmers’ account.” When asked if the government is doing so much for farmers, why is it that those in power have failed to convince farmers agitating around Delhi borders, Javadekar said that the government has already shown willingness to engage even after 12 rounds. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already made it clear that he is just a phone call away from dialogue. We have never shut the doors for talks,” said Javadekar. On rising fuel prices, Javadekar said that they are linked to international pricing and he hopes the prices will come down soon. The minister also responded to criticism by various states on not getting share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on time. Javadekar said that the all allocations and GST rate finalisation is done in consensus with the state governments and its share is being distributed on time. “The Union government will not do any discrimination in the allocation of its share of GST for the state, based on who is ruling it. Even though opposition parties are ruling in some of the state. The specific details about GST dues of Maharashtra will have to be checked,” said Javadekar. Javadekar said that the Union government has presented a promising budget for all including farmers. During the pandemic time, it was expected that tax raise may be imposed for dealing with the financial crises, but no such tax imposition was made. According to Javadekar, emphasis has been given on improving basic infrastructure such as road development. “Our government is committed to the development of agriculture. The initiative like providing more that Minimum Support Price (MSP) price for agricultural produce will help farmers. Record procurement has been done under MSP,” he said. He said that farmers in West Bengal will also get the benefit of Kisan Swabhiman Yojana. Though the state government there did not cooperate but the allocation will definitely be done by April this year. Apart from that ‘one nation one ration card’ initiative has been taken. It help people who are migrating from one state to other for works||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/existing-metro-routes-to-continue-to-get-central-funding-javadekar-101612781332933.html

Pune metro is supposed to start commercial operations on a six kilometre stretch from PCMC to Phugewadi and Sant Tukaramnagar is one of the stations on the route.As per the Pune metro schedule, it would have been completed five to six months earlier. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, work was delayed. Pune metro administration completed the work during the unlock period. The Sant Tukaramnagar station work started in December 2019. However, due to Covid-19, there was no work for seven months.Pune metro successfully conducted a six-kilometre trial run between PCMC and Phugewadi last month, which is the priority stretch of Pune metro.Last year, Pune metro had completed a successful trial run on the same route in one kilometre stretch between PCMC and Sant Tukaramnagar station.Hemant Sonawane, general manager of Pune metro, said, “Sant Tukaramnagar metro station has been completed. There is some minor work going on. It is one of the major stations on the PCMC to Swaragte route. After that, we are focusing on completing the Phugewadi station. It will be complete within one month. We have given priority to PCMC to Bopodi stretch which is 6.6 kilometre. We have had trail runs between these two stations.”Swargate to Pimpri route consists of nine stations. Of that, Range hills to Pimpri have elevated stations which includes Dapodi, Phugewadi, Kasarwadi, Bhosari (Nashik Phata), Sant Tukaramnagar and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation PCMC) main building.

08-02-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Blaming Centre is futile when proposals of metro haven’t moved forward||When Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar countered opposition parties like Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for the city not getting much during the Union budget, he was right. The NCP and Congress have been highlighting Centre’s apparent apathy towards Pune and the rest of Maharashtra. While the Centre allocated funds for the new phase of Nagpur metro and is starting the Neo metro at Nashik, Pune didn’t find any mention in the budget, a trigger, which leaders like Ajit Pawar are using against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The fact is neither the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) controlled Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) nor the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has sent any fresh proposal to the Centre for expanding the metro network in Pune this year. This is when multiple routes of Pune metro are being proposed. For the existing work on two lines of metro rail project from Swargate to Chinchwad and Vanaz to Ramwadi, the Centre has allocated funds while the third corridor between Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar is being developed by PMRDA and is being funded by the state government. For the record, the much-awaited Katraj-Swargate metro route is on only on paper even as the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation has prepared its Detailed Project Report (DPR). Even after a year, the PMC general body has not yet cleared the Swargate-Katraj Metro proposal. The standing committee approved extension of Swargate to Katraj 5.4 km extension of metro corridor on March 17, 2020 . Almost 12 months later, the proposal has not come yet before the general body, which has so far conducted its meetings online due to the Covid-19 pandemic even as the PMC now plans to allow in-person meetings from this week. As per the DPR, the 5.4 km Swargate-Katraj stretch is likely to be underground and will cost ₹4,283 crore. If completed, it will be an extension to the existing Chinchwad-Swargate line, currently being developed by Maha-Metro, and will attract maximum footfall given the population density on Satara road. While the proposal is awaiting approval, city’s public transport body Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has proposed Neo metro on the stretch. The Neo metro, which is being promoted by Centre’s Ministry of Housing and Urban in non-Metro cities, is a rail guarded urban transport system with electric coaches installed on rubber tyre. The train, similar to Tram, is powered by overhead traction system. The issue was discussed ruing the meeting of an umbrella body, Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (PUMTA), which is now responsible for increasing the efficiency of the existing public transport system and developing a comprehensive transport system and maintaining coordination among various government bodies. But this isn’t the only stretch awaiting any development. Popular as it is, those in power – whether at PMC or in the state government – have on multiple occasions proposed various routes of metro rail for the city, whose population is likely to cross 50 lakh given the merger of 23 villages in civic limits. In reality, the state government or its agency Maha-Metro hasn’t prepared DPR of any of the routes, be it for extending the network till Khadakwasla, Warje, on the western part to Kharadi and Wagholi on the east. If the first phase of the metro rail network involving three lines plan to cover 55 kilometre stretch, the phase two, if sanctioned and executed in time, can expand the network covering 125 kilometres with around 10 lines. On paper, this may sound impressive. In reality, a lot needs to be done, that too quickly. The city has already missed its bus to improve its mass transport. Without solid urban mass transport, city’s existing infrastructure of roads and flyovers may just be inadequate even if PMC keeps on adding them, one after another. The flyovers with widened roads may end up pushing bottlenecks from one point to another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-blaming-centre-is-futile-when-proposals-of-metro-haven-t-moved-forward-101612781092779.html
08-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to probe if Indian celebs were forced to tweet in Centre’s support||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said Monday there will be an investigation into tweets by Indian celebrities last week made in response to tweets by international celebrities on farmers’ protests. The state will probe whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pressurised celebrities to tweet, he said. The assurance was given to a Congress delegation, which, led by Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, met the home minister virtually on Monday. The Maharashtra Congress has demanded a probe by the police into the tweets posted by Indian celebrities in response to the global criticism of the Central government’s handling of the farmers’ protest. The party sought an investigation to check if the celebrities were pressurised by the BJP to take to social media in support of the Central government. Also Read | Congress demands probe to check if celebrities were forced to tweet in Centre’s support“We met Deshmukh virtually and demanded a probe. He assured us there will be an investigation by the state intelligence department,” said Congress spokesperson Raju Waghmare.Sawant said, “There is a similar pattern in these tweets by celebrities, including Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty, and sportspersons Sachin Tendulkar and Saina Nehwal. This shows that there was some communication between the celebrities and the ruling party leaders. There needs to be an investigation to check if these national heroes were pressurised by the BJP for such advocacy on social media. If so, these celebrities need to be given more protection,” he said. Celebrities, including Tendulkar, playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and a host of Bollywood actors took to Twitter on February 3 after international personalities such as musician Rihanna and climate change activist Greta Thunberg expressed support for the farmers’ protest in Delhi. Indian celebrities tweeted in response using the hashtags #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether, which have been framed by the ministry of external affairs (MEA). The tweets from these celebrities came after a statement from the MEA which called the criticism of India’s farm laws by foreign personalities “unfortunate”.“Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers,” the ministry said in a statement.“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we urge that facts be ascertained and proper understanding of issues at hand be undertaken,” the MEA had further said in the statement.Maharashtra BJP’s media head Vishwas Pathak said, “Raising questions over tweets by Indian celebrities is an insult to them. These celebrities have their own ability to express on social mediums. There was nothing wrong in them speaking about the Indian sovereignty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-probe-if-indian-celebs-were-forced-to-tweet-in-centre-s-support-101612778332725.html

08-02-2021||Bangalore||Sasikala departs Bengaluru to an exuberant welcome in Tamil Nadu||VK Sasikala, the expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader, left for Tamil Nadu after serving four years in Parappana Agrahara, Bengaluru Central Jail, to an exuberant welcome just outside Athibele crossing, the border between the two states.Thousands lined the street, dancing while awaiting the arrival of Chinnamma (or mother’s sister) as Sasikala is known (former chief minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa was known as Amma or mother) among her supporters. Defying all warnings from the AIADMK, Sasikala left Prestige Golfshire, a luxury resort outside Bengaluru, with the AIADMK flag hoisted on the car and wearing a green saree that was considered a favourite by her late mentor and friend Jayalalithaa. The AIADMK expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran in September 2017 and a group of ministers last Thursday filed a complaint with the Tamil Nadu DGP against her using the flag. Also Read | Ahead of VK Sasikala’s return, Tamil Nadu govt confiscates properties of her kinSasikala was living at the resort since the beginning of the month to complete her quarantine while her nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief TTV Dinakaran prepared a “grand homecoming” for her. A poster at the border illustrated a picture of Jayalalithaa placing a crown on Sasikala’s head, meant to signify that the latter remains the rightful heir to “Amma’s” legacy. There was heavy police presence on both sides of the border. The Krishnagiri Police have issued a notice against her using the AIADMK flag and restricting the number of vehicles accompanying Sasikala in view of Covid-19 rules against large gatherings. Sasikala completed her four-year prison term in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case on January 27 but remained in the city’s Victoria Hospital where she was treated for Covid-19. While leaving the hospital on January 31, she used the AIADMK flag on her car on her way to quarantine at the resort.Her return further intensifies the high-deciblel political climate of Tamil Nadu in which Sasikala and Dinakaran are seen as threats to the AIADMK’s bid to return to power by defeating arch rivals, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the upcoming polls. The Sasikala faction continues to have significant hold on several assembly constituencies of the state that could upset the AIADMK’s calculations. Though Sasikala cannot contest or hold a constitutional position for six years, if she chooses to, she is likely to manoeuvre and spoil the electoral plans of the ruling government which is in alliance with the BJP. On Saturday, they urged the police to ensure law and order isn’t affected when Sasikala returns, as law minister CV Shunmugam said that they were planning “human bombs” to create chaos and blame it on the AIADMK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sasikala-departs-bengaluru-to-an-exuberant-welcome-in-tamil-nadu-101612770592574.html

The state’s cumulative vaccine wastage, in terms of doses, till Saturday was 0.2% for Covaxin and 3.5% for Covishield, with the state having achieved 78% first-dose vaccination footfall against a target of inoculating 476,000 healthcare workers, said a state health officer. “The vaccine wastage, as on Friday, was 2.3% for Covishield and 1.1% for Covaxin, against an admissible wastage limit of 10% allowed by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW),” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society and the state nodal officer for vaccination. Also Read | Need Covid-19 vaccination details? CoWIN info now available on Aarogya Setu appGujarat was among 10 states with maximum vaccine wastage under THE MoHFW scanner, said officials. Bihar haS so far received 1.1 million doses of the two vaccines, of which Covishield accounted for 1 million doses and Covaxin 100,000 doses. The state has kept rigorous tabs on vaccine wastage. The state health brass had even pulled up a couple of medical colleges, including the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital in Bhagalpur and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital in Patna, for slackness in the initial few days of the pan-India launch of the vaccination drive on January 16. “We issued explicit instructions to keep vaccine wastage at a bare minimum. We have asked our healthcare officials not to open any vaccine vial till a minimum of 10 beneficiaries are present for vaccination. This has helped us keep vaccine wastage low and within permissible limits,” said Kumar. One vial of Covishield is equivalent to 10 doses and a vial of Covaxin makes for 20 doses, said officials. The state Saturday initiated inoculation of nearly 240,000 frontline workers. Bihar achieved 52.55% first-dose vaccination of frontline workers on Saturday when 4,471 out of the targeted 8,507 turned up at 525 vaccination centres across the state. The vaccination of frontline workers was in addition to 15,450 healthcare workers out of targeted 50,150 to be vaccinated in the state on Saturday. As many as 28 district magistrates, 16 superintendents of police, the municipal commissioner of Muzaffarpur and six additional district magistrates were among the 4,471 frontline workers vaccinated on day one of their vaccination against coronavirus, said Kumar. “There were no reports of adverse event following immunization (AEFI) reported from any of the frontline workers vaccinated Sunday,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-covid-vaccine-wastage-rate-much-below-permissible-limit-state-govt-101612758292691.html

Ram Chander had won the Bawana assembly constituency in the 2017 bypoll. In 2020 assembly polls, the AAP fielded the sitting councillor BSP’s Jai Bhagwan, whose victory necessitated the bypoll.From ward number 62N (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi, BJP has fielded former councillor late Renu Jaju’s daughter-in-law, Surabhi Jaju. The bypoll on this seat was necessitated after Jaju’s death two years ago.Though it is considered a BJP stronghold, from where Renu Jaju contested and won, it is going to be a tough fight as Surabhi Jaju is pitted against AAP’s Sunita Mishra, who is party’s mohalla coordinator and also secretary of AAP’s women’s wing in the Shalimar Bagh assembly constituency.

08-02-2021||Delhi||Bypoll to set tone for 2022 battle for three civic bodies||Being touted as the precursor to the municipal elections scheduled next year, the bypolls to five corporation wards on February 28 will be an indicator of public mood, leaders of the three main political parties said.The Aam Aadmi Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress have announced their candidates for the five wards where elections were necessitated after four councillors were elected to the Delhi assembly last year and one seat fell vacant after the death of the incumbent representative two years ago.Of the five wards Rohini-C and Shalimar Bagh are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and the rest Trilokpuri East, Kalyanpuri and Chauhan Bangar are part of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. Last date of filing nominations is February 8 while polling will be held on February 8. Results will be declared on March 3.In 2017 municipal elections, the BJP won 181 of the total 272 wards and it rules all the three municipal corporations. The AAP got 49 seats while the Congress managed 31.The AAP failed to make any significant inroads in the MCDs in 2017 but won the Delhi assembly polls in 2020 with an overwhelming majority (62 of total 71 seats). The party is now looking to replace BJP in the MCDs.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, who is in charge of party’s municipal affairs, said the bypolls are about the mismanagement and flawed policies of the BJP which has landed the corporations in a crisis. “There is anger among people against the BJP due to their financial mismanagement, flawed policies and corruption. Today, they are not able to pay salaries to civic employees. Corruption by their leaders and sanitation mess in the city will be our two main issues in the bypolls.”Pathak said in door-to-door campaigning, AAP workers are explaining the issues to people in detail and answering their queries. “We will also tell them about the work our councillors did before they got elected as MLAs and the current situation in the wards,” he said.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “We will highlight the lack of development in wards which were won by AAP apart from raising the issue of the financial crisis faced by the corporations due to government’s apathy.”For the Congress, the election will be the first to be held after the new team in Delhi was appointed. A senior party leader said it will be a test for the party about the change in people’s perception. While AAP and BJP are blaming each other for the fund crunch, the Congress is blaming the two parties for the mess. Talking about the party’s ‘Pol Khol’ campaign, Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said, “This is to expose the corruption in both AAP and BJP which are ruling the Delhi government and corporations respectively. Both parties could not fulfil even one of their election promises.”Political analyst Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said, “The bypolls will indicate the public mood in the city. But in ward-level elections, it is the candidate that matters more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bypoll-to-set-tone-for-2022-battle-for-three-civic-bodies-101612744976477.html

While no person was injured, firefighters said at least six animals were killed in the fire. A truck parked nearby was also gutted in the blaze. The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said the cause of the blaze is yet to be established.The fire broke out around 2.30am, when the DFS received a distress call reporting the incident. Senior officials said seven fire tenders were initially rushed to the spot to contain the fire, but as the blaze was in a cluster, 19 more were used to prevent it from spreading and to douse it completely.DFS director Atul Garg said firefighters who reached the spot found that a truck parked nearby had been burnt. “The blaze was controlled after two hours, but the cooling operation continued till morning. While no person was injured, six animals were found dead in the fire,” Garg said.He said the cause of fire is not yet established, but is believed to have sparked from a stove or a brazier lit inside one of the slum clusters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/40-slum-clusters-gutted-after-blaze-in-sanjay-colony-none-hurt-101612733671781.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||North civic body to give permanent licences to food vans, e-food carts||The cash-strapped North Delhi Municipal Corporation — in an attempt to generate more revenue — has decided to give permanent licences to food vans and e-food carts in its jurisdiction. Food vans will be approved for places where space is available and footfall is abundant.A proposal for allowing food trucks had been passed by the north civic body last month.Officials of north civic body said that other than increasing revenue of the municipality, the initiative will also create jobs for a lot of unemployed youths.A senior official of the north corporation said that modalities of the scheme are yet to be worked out. The official, however, said that other than issuing licences to existing food carts, people belonging to economically weaker sections would be given preference and discount in setting up their food business in empty lands of the municipality.Mayor of north corporation, Jai Prakash, said that there are a number of eateries already functioning at different locations in north Delhi but the civic body does not get any revenue from such establishments. “This scheme will pave a way to legalise such food carts after paying a licence fee, which will be decided later. Other than this, we will also promote setting up food vans in empty lands of the civic body at various locations in north Delhi. We will allocate these food vans to those people whose annual family income is less than ₹25,000. We will provide them special discounts to set up movable eateries in empty lands and at places where footfall is high,” Prakash said.He said that officials have been given instructions to start a survey to identify empty lands and places where such food vans can be set up in the jurisdiction of north corporation. “Though the fee for the licence is yet to be decided but it is likely to be kept dynamic, which means that those who wish to set up their food vans in busy markets or at prime locations, will have to pay slightly higher prices for a licence. People belonging to EWS category with less than ₹25,000 annual income are likely to get a nearly 25% discount,” the mayor said.A senior official of the north corporation also said that applicants will have to produce a no-objection-certificate from the traffic police as well as from the road owning authority if they wish to set up food carts on any road side.“Initially, we are planning to allow one to two food vans per ward. But this number can be increased later if required. This move will create employment for weaker section and they will not have to pay illegally to any other agency or local authorities. This initiative will also help the civic body in augmenting its revenue collection and make it financially stable,” the official said.A similar move was passed by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in the beginning of this year. In its proposal the south civic body had proposed that it would provide licences to five smart food eateries, including food trucks, vans, e-carts in each municipal ward in its jurisdiction.KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MCD, said that the initiative will help in boosting revenue of the corporations.“It is a very good move and such efforts are required to be taken by the authorities to augment revenue collection, especially when it is undergoing a huge financial crisis. This initiative will bring additional funds to the corporation as illegally running food vans will be brought under the tax net of the MCD,” Mehra said.He added that the civic body should ensure that all areas are tapped under the scheme for maximum revenue realisation.However, the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) said they were against the proposal. Arbind Singh, national coordinator NASVI, criticised the move and termed it “anti-street vendors”.Singh said that the civic body was yet to implement Street Vendors Act 2014, which speaks about regulation and welfare of the street vendors.“It is an effort to snatch livelihood from the street food vendors. Through allocation of e-food carts and other such special type of eateries, the municipality only wants backdoor entry of capitalists. They should first regulate the existing street food vendors who set up roadside stalls . They should implement Street Vendors Act 2014,” he said. Singh added that the clause of giving priority and discount to EWS people “merely seems to be a lip service”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-civic-body-to-give-permanent-licences-to-food-vans-e-food-carts-101612733691582.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||Covid vaccine jabs for people aged above 50 likely from mid-March||The Delhi government is likely to open the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive up for people aged over 50 and individuals with comorbidities in mid-March, pending the Centre’s approval, senior government officials said on Sunday.People aged over 50 years and individuals with comorbidities irrespective of age have broadly been categorised as the third priority group for vaccination, after health care and front line workers, for whom the vaccination drive is currently open.On Friday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in the Lok Sabha had announced that the third phase of the vaccination drive for people aged over 50 will begin after the second week of March.“In the first phase, the target was to vaccinate around one million health care workers both in the public and private sector... In the second phase, an estimated two million frontline workers were to be vaccinated, and that also began at many places in the country on February 2. After completion of the first and second phase, the third phase will begin wherein everyone above 50 will be vaccinated. It may not be possible to provide an exact date, but it is likely that the process will begin anytime in the second, third or fourth week of March,” said Harsh Vardhan.In Delhi, around 240,000 health workers and 450,000 front line workers have so far registered for the vaccination programme. Of these, 109,478 have so far received their first doses of the coronavirus vaccines, according to government records.“The protocols and deadlines have seen several changes since the vaccination drive was launched on January 16. We are now capable of vaccinating multiple priority groups at the same time, as against the earlier plan in which specific windows were charted out for each group one after another. The provision to allow out-of-turn shots to registered beneficiaries is helping increasing turnout across the country,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.The official added, “Considering all these factors, at this stage, we expect to start with the vaccination of the third category by mid-March. The Centre’s approval will be required for this. The matter was taken up in few meetings over the last two weeks. Registrations for eligible beneficiaries in third category are likely to be open on the CoWin app from March 1.”The government has so far estimated that 4.2 million in Delhi are aged over 50, a number arrived at largely through the use of electoral rolls. Government officials are still ascertaining the number of people with comorbidities through survey findings, departmental data and hospital records.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “The more people across different categories get vaccinated in the early stages, the better it is. Covid management will become much easier for potential spikes in futures and mutant strains. Also, there will be less burden on the health care infrastructure system. At this stage, several states are preparing to start with vaccination of the elderly and those with comorbidities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-vaccine-jabs-for-people-aged-above-50-likely-from-midmarch-101612733698607.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP accused lock horns over tours by party leaders||A war of words broke out between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday with leaders of both the parties accusing each other of going on personal tours, within India and abroad, on government money.Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs, accused Delhi BJP leaders of going on trips at the expense of the municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) and demanded a probe into it. The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and hit back, accusing AAP leaders of going on foreign trips on government’s expense.While the AAP is in power in the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three MCDs.“Several BJP councillors including Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, mayors and officials have taken several trips inside and outside India on MCD’s expense. On one hand, employees of the BJP-ruled MCDs are starving because they have not been paid salaries and on the other hand BJP leaders are using MCD funds for their trips,” said Pathak in a press conference at the party’s head office in central Delhi.He said, “The AAP demands that the BJP-ruled MCD must publish a white paper declaring all such trips taken by the BJP councillors or mayors within 48 hours and set up a probe into the matter.”Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the allegations were baseless. He said it was an attempt by the AAP to malign the image of BJP-ruled MCDs.In a statement issued later, the BJP said, “Trips by ministers of Delhi government or mayors of MCDs to other cities is a normal protocol affair. The fact of the matter is that the Delhi government is bearing expenses of many political tours of AAP ministers including Manish Sisodia to several states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand under the garb of study tours of schools in those states. MCDs are in deep financial crunch due to Arvind Kejriwal government’s withholding funds since 2020.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said two trips taken in 2018 and 2019 by former MCD mayors were marked as “disputed”. “Here, it is pertinent to mention that in 2018-19, the then-mayor got the permission and financial clearance to attend a conference in London which he himself cancelled in view of hefty expenses… Mr Pathak is misleading people with his claims that there are several such unpaid trips in the last financial year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-accused-lock-horns-over-tours-by-party-leaders-101612733537580.html
08-02-2021||Delhi||Govt focuses on two wheeler EVs in first week of Switch Delhi campaign||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Sunday that in the first week of the ‘Switch Delhi’ campaign – which was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to promote electric vehicles (EV) in the city – the government will focus on outreach concerning the two-wheeler EV segment.“The first week of the campaign will focus on outreach regarding the two-wheeler segment including electric bikes and e-scooters to accelerate its adoption. Delhi’s EV Policy especially focuses on incentivizing the purchase of two wheelers, which comprise two-third of all vehicles in Delhi and cause maximum pollution. Incentives up to ₹30,000 can be availed upon the purchase of two-wheelers listed under the policy along with scrapping incentives,” said Gahlot in a statement.He further said, “Under Delhi’s EV policy, 23 two-wheeler models are available and eligible for purchase and scrapping incentives across seven manufacturers. By switching to electric two-wheelers which have very low operating costs, an individual can make annual saving of approximately ₹22,000 as compared to using petrol scooter and ₹20,000 as compared to a petrol bike. An average electric two-wheeler provides a life time savings of 1.98 tonnes of carbon emissions as compared to an average petrol two wheelers, which is equivalent to planting 11 trees.”‘Switch Delhi’ will be an eight-week campaign to sensitise Delhi residents about the benefits of switching to electric vehicle, Gahlot added.While launching the campaign on Thursday, Kejriwal had said that his government will, in the next six months, change its policy to lease only electric cars as part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric cars in the city. On Friday, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar announced that the government floated a tender to set up 500 EV charging points across 100 locations in the city in the next one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-focuses-on-two-wheeler-evs-in-first-week-of-switch-delhi-campaign-101612731163965.html
08-02-2021||Mumbai||Second vax shot for health workers in Maharashtra from February 13||As it inches closer to the 500,000 mark for Covid-19 vaccinations, the state government said it is all set to administer the mandatory second doses to healthcare workers (HCWs) from February 13. The registration of beneficiaries for the third phase (meant for citizens with comorbidities and those above 50 years of age) is likely to take more time, state officials said. The Central government had on Friday announced that the third phase is likely to commence from March.The state government has also clarified about the stricture in the Economic Survey of India tabled in Parliament that the number of Covid-19 patients in the state was high owing to the large number of international fliers arriving in cities like Mumbai and Pune. It also said that Maharashtra on behalf of the country took the brunt of the disease in the beginning.According to the economic survey presented in Parliament last week, Maharashtra “underperformed the most” in handling the spread of Covid-19.The survey said, “Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar have restricted the case spread the best; Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have saved the most lives; Maharashtra has underperformed the most in restricting the spread of cases and in saving lives.”A statement from the state health department on Sunday said, “With reference to remarks in the economic survey, Covid-19 is an infection imported from outside the country into India and naturally the state and the cities where arrival of international passengers was maximum were the most severely affected states. Maharashtra and Mumbai and Pune in particular cater to one of the largest number of international arrivals in the country... Maharashtra on behalf of the country took the brunt of the disease in the beginning.”Regarding Covid-19 cases per million of the population, Maharashtra had 16,008 infections as of February 2, 6th in the country after Delhi, Goa, Puducherry, Kerala, and Chandigarh, even though the state had the highest number of Covid-19 cases in absolute numbers, the statement said. Maharashtra is also not the state with the highest number of deaths per million of the population, at 403 deaths, after Delhi, Goa, and Puducherry, as of February 2. Maharashtra’s numbers is around 290 per million population, while Kerala has more than 2,000 active cases per million population, it added.The statement said, “These details will show that Maharashtra has performed really well in containing the Covid-19 epidemic and at the same time opening up the economic activities on behalf of the country when Mumbai and Pune the cities, which are economic hub were allowed to function early during the epidemic.”The Maharashtra government will start administering the second dose of the vaccine for healthcare workers, part of phase 1 of the vaccination drive, on February 13. This day completes 28 days from the day vaccination started on January 16. Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the state’s public health department, said on Sunday, “It will be some time before registration for phase three of the Covid-19 vaccine starts. The second dose for beneficiaries of phase one, which is healthcare workers, will start 28 days after they received their first dose.”So far, a total of 472,805 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in 14 sessions since January 16. Of them, 444,448 are healthcare workers and 25,600 are frontline workers. Maharashtra has around 800,000 healthcare workers and 580,000 frontline workers registered on the CoWIN application, the automated system launched by the Central government to systematically administer vaccine shots across the country. So far, the state has received a total of 1,972,400 vaccine doses, of which 170,400 are Covaxin doses, and 1,802,000 are Covishield doses.Approximately 3 million people in Mumbai would qualify for phase three of the covid-19 vaccination drive. Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the municipal public health department said, “So far we have information about so many people who will qualify as beneficiaries in the third phase, as per data collected by the municipal corporation in the My Family, My Responsibility drive. However, we will have to see if all these people have the necessary documentation to register on the app, such as Aadhar Card.”If the government allows integration of electoral data for registration of beneficiaries for phase three, the process may get simpler, according to officials, who are awaiting directives from the central government. Once the registration drive starts for phase three, it will take not more than 15 days for BMC officials to register individuals, civic officials said. However, if citizens have to register themselves, it may take longer. Kakani said, “BMC will deploy the necessary manpower, as needed.”Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 2,673 new Covid-19 cases, and 30 deaths due to the infection, taking the total number of cases in the state to 2,044,071 and the toll to 51,310, with a case fatality rate of 2.51%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-vax-shot-for-health-workers-in-maharashtra-from-february-13-101612725474645.html

The force of the glacier burst was severe enough to totally devastate NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and the Rishi Ganga Hydel Project along with a BRO bridge in the Joshimath highway.The Indo-Tibetan border police is currently working to rescue any survivors in a second tunnel near the NTPC hydel power project. Earlier on Sunday, the ITBP had undertaken a rescue operation and saved the lives of 16 labourers who were trapped in a tunnel.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the cause of the glacier burst is still unknown but the government primary focus is saving lives presently. The Uttarakhand government has announced that it will pay ₹4 lakh compensation for the families of those killed due to the flash flood caused by glacier burst in the Chamoli district.The Prime Minister’s Office also said that PM Modi has approved ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh for the kin of the deceased and ₹50,000 for people who have been injured seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-photos-more-than-120-feared-dead-in-chamoli-glacier-burst-101612724478764.html

According to the PIL, though the institute has been approved by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush), the state has not done anything in that regard.According to the PIL filed by Vilas Sadashiv Patne through advocate Rakesh Bhatkar, the Konkan region has the most fertile land, which is conducive for the growth of medicinal plants, and a study conducted in 2012 had shown that there were 32 herbs growing in a radius of 30 kilometres of Sawantwadi area, and hence setting up the institute there was feasible. The PIL added that though Sindhudurg collector had surveyed, identified and sent a positive report for setting up of the institute in the district, there was no response by the state. A letter from the Ayush ministry in October 2020 to the chief minister with regards to the same has not been responded to and hence the PIL has been filed. According to the petitioner, the state had written a letter to the Ayush ministry to shift the institute to Jalgaon, but the proposal was rejected stating that the land there was not suitable for the project due to climatic/edaphic factors. Patne alleged that the state now plans to move the institute to Latur district. Seeking directions to the state government to grant requisite permissions, the PIL stated, “The located area is most appropriate for such an institute with a natural environment required for plantation and growth of medicinal plants. If it is not used, then there will be extinction of plants and species. Therefore, there is a dire necessity to set up medicinal plant institutions at the approved area in Sindhudurg.” The PIL is likely to be heard by the bench led by chief justice Dipankar Datta on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-seeks-state-nod-for-med-institute-in-maharashtra-s-sindhudurg-district-101612724270712.html
08-02-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown led to higher depression rate: PGIMER study||The lockdown period and being in quarantine were associated with significantly higher rates of psychiatric morbidity, especially anxiety, a study by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has stated, stressing the requirement to address the psychological needs of people.In the study that appeared in the Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practise on January 29, researchers said that there was a need to develop self-help groups and counselling manuals that could be used even by under-trained people to address the psychological needs of the public at large.The aim of the study was to evaluate psychological distress among persons in quarantine and compare the same with a group of persons who were in the lockdown in the early days of the pandemic.For the scope of the study, 44 persons in quarantine and 45 in lockdown were evaluated on the depression anxiety stress scale.Being in quarantine worse, psychologically About three-fourths (77.3%) of the participants in the quarantine group and one-third (37.8%) in the comparator group had depression, while one-fourth (22.7%) in the quarantine group and one-third (35.6%) in the lockdown group had anxiety.In terms of severity, in the quarantine group, half of the participants reported moderate levels of depression, and 6.8% reported severe depression. In terms of anxiety, more than 90% reported at least a moderate level of anxiety, with nearly 60% having severe to extremely severe anxiety.“When these prevalence rates for both groups are compared with the data reported for the National Mental Health Survey 2019, it can be said that the prevalence rates among those under quarantine are significantly higher than the general population,” the study claimed.However, the sample size of this study is small and does not take into account other variables that can influence the findings, such as knowledge and attitude toward Covid-19, social support, history of physical or psychological disorders in the past, and cultural aspects.The higher prevalence of psychological morbidity could be attributed to confinement at one place. Additional factors that possibly contribute to psychological distress include isolation, stigma, fear of the unknown, and fear of death, the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-led-to-higher-depression-rate-pgimer-study-101612724269604.html

In the last elections, the reservation for women was 33%. Out of 50 wards, 25 seats are reserved for women. Former councillors are aggressively campaigning for their wives and even holding public meetings on their behalf. Though their wives are accompanying them, they are the ones leading from the front.

The agency also seized Kaskar’s Mercedes car. NCB claimed that Kaskar was using his high-end car to peddle drugs to high-profile customers in western suburbs. During the drive against narcotics, an NCB team raided Kaskar’s home at Jogeshwari and allegedly seized 100 gram of mephedrone (MD) from his possession. During interrogation, he revealed that Rajkotwala had supplied him the contraband. The team then went to Dongri to arrest Rajkotwala and allegedly recovered a small quantity of charas from his possession, said NCB officers.Both have been working together from a year, said NCB officers. Kaskar is an accused in an attempt to murder case and has allegedly assaulted a police personnel. He is currently on bail in the other cases and came in contact with Rajkotwala through a common friend, who is a wanted in the drugs case. “Kaskar and Rajkotwala are in NCB’s remand and we are investigating further, said an officer.Last month, NCB had arrested south Mumbai resident Parvez Khan alias Chinku Pathan, and his associate Arif Bhujwala, for allegedly running a drug laboratory in Dongri. Bhujwala allegedly manufactured MD from more than three years at the laboratory, said NCB officers. The agency also recovered drugs worth Rs8-10 crore, two automatic revolvers and Rs21 crore from Bhujwala’s home.

08-02-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Financial planning for an emergency||Job loss, death, sustained loss of health: If there is one thing that the pandemic shown, it is that we cannot assume that we are immune to emergencies. But what are the lessons that we can learn from that? A lot of people deal with emergencies by relying on credit cards. Others take out loans and fail to save or make investments in the bargain. Here’s how you can avoid a crisis.Have a contingency fundThough companies are bound under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 to pay their employees severance equal to three months salary in case of a sudden job loss, many employers do not do so citing company losses. So, lesson one. Create a contingency fund that will help you survive for at least four months. Raj Khosla, founder and managing director of financial services marketplace MyMoneyMantra said, “For funds earmarked for emergency use, ease of access to the money is paramount. You need to ensure maximum liquidity with minimal hassles, so park the money in savings accounts, liquid debt funds, or small saving schemes with fixed returns and easy exit options.” In case you have received severance pay, add it to your contingency fund.Buy health insuranceSudden ill health means that your money will necessarily get diverted to pay medical expenses. Lesson two: Buy health insurance and pay the premiums regularly. Pankaj Verma, head-Underwriting, SBI General Insurance said, “A comprehensive health plan protects savings by covering pre-hospitalisation, hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses in case of unforeseen emergencies.” Verma also advised salaried people to add the sum insured amount for medical emergencies with a top-up health insurance plan. An indemnity base policy, for instance, reimburses the policyholder the amount spent on medical treatment, paying back the amount spent on hospital stay and subsequent treatment up to the sum insured under the policy. “This can help in case of job loss and can keep your coverage uninterrupted between the job transitions,” Verma said.Insure your lifeBe it life or health cover, we need insurance so that our families are secure, especially at times when we are not in a position to take care of them ourselves. It is essential that you do not conflate insurance with tax savings or investments. “As such, any earning person with dependents should have a total individual term plan up to 10-20 times of the annual income considering the assets and liabilities in hand,” Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online market place for financial products said. To decide how your cover, evaluate your financial assets and liabilities. For example, if you have a salary of Rs6 lakh per annum, then the ideal cover must be 20 times that, which is Rs1.2 crore. However, let’s say you have a loan of Rs50 lakh, then you should buy a cover of Rs1.7 crore. This will ensure that your family has enough money in hand for their entire lives even after having paid off your loans/liabilities.Get pensionNot many know of the government-sponsored pension scheme which allows you to contribute regularly to a pension account during your working life. Upon retirement, you can withdraw up to 60% of the corpus in a lump sum while the remaining amount could be used to buy an annuity or regular pension post-retirement. There are seven different annuity service providers under the NPS scheme. Depending on the terms and conditions of the annuity service provider, the nominee’s account will either be credited with the pension amount or reimbursed the remaining 40% of the maturity amount. CS Sudheer, founder of IndianMoney.com, an online financial advisor site explained why NPS is a good idea. “In case of the sudden death before attaining the age of 60 years, the entire amount is paid to the nominee or legal heir of the subscriber.”That’s exactly the sort of relief you’d require if you ever face an emergency.Tying up loose endsAnd finally, the most important lesson: Most financial planning goes awry owing to our callousness in not choosing our nominees wisely. Write their details clearly to prevent confusion during the handover of the maturity amount to the nominee. If the nominee is a minor, take care to secure a guardian to whom the funds can be entrusted in the event of sudden death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-financial-planning-for-an-emergency-101612723729792.html
08-02-2021||Other||A year on, aviation ministry to install body scanners at airports||New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport is likely to be the first of the country’s airports that will be outfitted with technologically advanced body scanners starting March, a whole year after they were first meant to be installed, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) officials said. “Recommendations on the project to implement body scanners at the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) have been made by the special committee constituted for the purpose and approvals are awaited from BCAS,” a DIAL spokesperson said, adding that they will take up the project as soon as they receive the approval. As per the Centre’s directions, all Indian airports were to be installed with body scanners that offer enhanced security and a touchless experience by March 2020, but the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent closure of airports led to a delay in procuring the scanners, officials said. “Though our idea of procuring body scanners was approved by the government, it could not be taken ahead last year due to excessive financial constraints caused due to Covid-19 pandemic,” senior Airports Authority of India (AAI) officer, who did not wished to be named, said. “Specifications of the body scanners have been finalized. We are now planning to have a combination of both the systems: body scanners and door frame metal detectors (DFMDs) and then slowly switch to only body scanners once the air services resume normalcy,” said a top Ministry of Civil Aviation official who did not wish to be named. Currently, DFMDs and hand-held metal detectors only detect metal objects. However, body scanners provide better security as they can scan plastic-based explosives as well as metallic items. Passengers would be required to remove their shoes, belts, jackets and all metallic objects according to an SOP released by the BCAS in 2019.The aviation ministry had made it mandatory for all 28 hypersensitive and 56 sensitive airports to install body scanners by March 2020 while the remaining airports were permitted to install them by March 2021.Of around 105 operational airports in the country, hypersensitive airports include those in Delhi, Mumbai, Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.Following the delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a committee of officials from the BCAS, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and airport operators was formed in October 2020 to identify the space for installation of full body scanners and to decide on the number of body scanners. How the body scanner worksBody scanner is an open structure that a passenger will require standing between two wall-like structures for around three seconds during which it captures an image of the person using millimeter wave technology to see if any prohibited item is on them.A mannequin-like image is generated and if there is a yellow spot on the screen, it means that area on the body may need further screening.According to BCAS officials, body scanners can handle 300 passengers an hour and should store the scanned images of the passengers for at least seven days.Passengers would be required to take off their footwear and belts.Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport had conducted a trial in August 2019 with a scanner that used a non-ionising electromagnetic radiation technology that is considered safer for pregnant women. The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad also conducted a three-month trial of body scanning machines for passengers on voluntary basis at the domestic departure terminals in 2019.Last July, Airports Authority of India (AAI) had issued a tender to procure 198 body scanners for 63 airports, following which three companies had placed bids. The tendering procedure was put on a pause during the pandemic.Of these, 19 were to be used in the Chennai airport, 17 in Kolkata airport, seven in the Srinagar airport, and 12 for the Pune airport, among others. Delhi and Mumbai were not included in this list as both are managed through joint ventures between AAI and pvt firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-year-on-aviation-ministry-to-install-body-scanners-at-airports-101612722949800.html
08-02-2021||Chandigarh||Multiplexes still not finding patrons in Chandigarh||Even as the central government has allowed 100% occupancy in theatres and multiplexes, the response from moviegoers remained tepid in Chandigarh this weekend. On checking online ticket booking websites, it was found that on an average only four to five seats had been booked per show. English, Hindi and Punjabi films were all getting a similar response, with relatively newer releases having more bookings than the reruns.When cinemas had reopened with 50% occupancy in October, no new movies were being shown, but this has changed now with the release of Vijay the Master and Madam Chief Minister, both released in January. Hollywood titles Wonder Woman 1984 and Tenet, which have performed well in the global markets, are also being screened, but are not faring that well.Talking about how PVR plans to bring back customers, CEO PVR Limited Gautam Dutta said: “We have maintained ongoing communication with our database of members and guests via social media and emails among other channels. We are also running an evangelism phase by organising goodwill screening and film festivals for people.”To make customers feel safe, PVR follows all standard operating procedures issued by the government and even has ultraviolet cabinets to sterilise food packaging, he said.Not all have moved to 100% capacityWhile PVR has moved to 100% capacity, Cinepolis is still following 50% rule. “We are awaiting instructions from some state governments regarding reopening (with 100% capacity) before it is rolled out for all our cinemas. Meanwhile, we have started showing the latest releases and are running special offers for customers to entice them,” said a Cinepolis spokesperson.Meanwhile, single-screen theatres remain closed in the city. Neelam Cinema manager SK Shama said it is not viable for them to reopen. “A big budget movie with big names would draw a crowd, but currently such movies aren’t being released,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/multiplexes-still-not-finding-patrons-in-chandigarh-101612636359743.html
