The administration had bought these machines with the money received from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The isolation centers were closed in November after the number of cases in the district saw a considerable dip and the government started allowing home isolation.Meanwhile, the Meritorious School and its hostel were thrown open to students last week. The laundry machines, however, remain a white elephant.When asked, civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said the machines will be shifted to the civil hospitals at Khanna or Jagraon or any other government-run medical facility as per the requirement.“We had bought these machines with an aim to provide the best hygiene standards to patients at isolation centres. But currently, we are facing an issue as the company which had installed the machine is stating that they will charge ₹2 lakh for disassembling, transporting and reassembling the laundry machine,” said Dr Kakkar.He added that the beds, chairs, clothes and other material from isolation centres have already been shifted. When contacted ADC (development) Sandeep Kumar said, “The representative of the company concerned, which was to shift the machines, was shown various sites, and we are hoping that the issue will be resolved soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/laundry-machines-worth-rs-6-25-lakh-at-disbanded-isolation-centres-in-ludhiana-gathering-dust-101614018568784.html

This phase will have 15 rounds and 616,000 beneficiaries for their first dose in the district alone. It is expected to begin next march.“Catering to such a large number of beneficiaries is a major challenge. First issue will be of listing people. For any vaccination day, we may have to accommodate those who may be travelling or out of station. So, we have made teams who will keep a tab on beneficiaries. Next, we have limited resources and staff. We have roped in 83 private sector establishments and will be able to get support of their staff as well,” said Dr NK Gupta, the district chief medical officer. The health department has designated 188 session sites and 337 teams for 15 days. The beneficiaries will have to get their second dose of the vaccine after 28 days.“All the session sites are hospitals or healthcare facilities, and they will come in handy in case we get adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) events. Next, we are waiting for further directions from the state government,” Dr Gupta said. The health department has completed the vaccination rounds for the healthcare workers who are categorised as first category. The second category is of frontline workers whose final mop up round is scheduled for February 25. On Monday, the penultimate mop up round for frontline workers saw 2,582 of the 6,415 expected beneficiaries take their first shot.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also took the shots and said that he suffered no AEFI issues. Overall, about 9493 of 18100 identified frontline workers so far have taken the shots with coverage of about 52.44%. The overall figure for completed rounds for healthcare workers stood at 74.26% coverage with 17641 getting the vaccine shots of the total identified 23754 beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-identifies-188-sites-to-vaccinate-over-6-lakh-third-category-beneficiaries-in-15-days-101614018508132.html

As many as 70 stolen cards were recovered from their possession, police said.The suspects were identified as Ranjeet Sahni (29), Jitendra Sahni (31), Arun Singh (42), all natives of Bihar and Prakash Chauhan (26), a native of Madhya Pradesh. According to police, the suspects would target ATM kiosks that did not have a security guard.“They specifically targeted senior citizens. The suspects would stand in queue and offer to help. While helping, they would swap the ATM card with a fake one and then get the card details from the person who they would tell that the machine isn’t working. Afterwards, the suspects would withdraw money from the person’s account and would flee in an auto-rickshaw they had purchased,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Zone 1.The gang had been active for the past two and a half years, the ACP said, adding that they came on police radar after a complaint was filed with Sector 24 police by a 78-year-old man who had alleged fraudulent withdrawals from his account.“An amount of ₹20,000 was first withdrawn and then another transaction for ₹35,000 was done using the ATM card. The suspects used the money to purchase two mobile phones. We tracked the purchases and obtained photos of the suspects. They were then traced to an ATM in Sector 22 from where they were nabbed following tip-offs,” said Verma.Police officials said that the suspects would spend the money to buy gifts for their female friends. Apart from the 70 ATM cards, police have also recovered two mobile phones, ₹2,000 cash, six Aadhaar cards, five PAN cards, two driving licences and the auto-rickshaw.The gang members are not very educated, said police, adding that they had learnt the tricks from watching videos on social media.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-held-for-duping-people-by-swapping-atm-cards-101614018328147.html

Yesterday, checking was going on in the area around the peripheral expressway. Two men on a motorcycle were asked to stop. Instead, they tried to flee and fired on the police team. One of the suspects was injured in the retaliatory firing, while the other managed to escape,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey.The arrested suspect was identified by his single name as Intezaar, who is from Firozabad, and was taken to the district hospital for treatment. According to police, he and his paternal cousin were involved in the kidnapping. “The cousin’s father had been duped of ₹2 lakh and the family was in financial distress. The kidnapping was not pre-planned. They had abducted the boy with the intention of ransoming him and brought him to their house in the village. Their family, however, told them to let the boy go. This and the pressure of the police probe forced them to release him,” said Pandey.He said that a search was on for the second suspect in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-wanted-in-kidnapping-of-teen-held-in-greater-noida-101614018268645.html

22-02-2021||Noida||Chairman, manager of old age home booked for gang rape||Police on Sunday booked the chairperson and the manager of a Greater Noida home for senior citizens for the alleged gang-rape of a staff member last year.According to the complainant, the incident occurred on May 5, 2020. The chairman and a colleague had allegedly cornered her in a room of the home.“They raped me and the manager helped them keep the incident under wraps along with the help of another staff member,” said the woman in her complaint.She alleged that her earlier attempt at filing a complaint fell flat after a police officer refused to do so. She then approached the Surajpur district court.Based on orders of the court, a case of rape was registered at a Greater Noida police station against the four, one of whom is a woman.A senior police officer said that the police conducted an investigation soon after the woman approached them the first time. “There were certain discrepancies in the statements of the victim and her husband who also worked at the same establishment. The allegations were found to be inaccurate,” he said. “It seems that the real issue was regarding the payment of the wages.”However, a probe was re-initiated following the court order.“We have registered the case and will question all the people involved. The case will be reinvestigated thoroughly and necessary action will be taken against those responsible,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/chairman-manager-of-old-age-home-booked-for-gang-rape-101614018148671.html
22-02-2021||Noida||Gathering of crowds changes government, says Rakesh Tikait||Ghaziabad:Taking a dig at Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s remark that mere gathering of crowds “does not lead to revocation of laws”, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tiakit on Monday said that the “gathering of crowds changes government”. “You purchase crops at half the rates and say that farm laws are beneficial. The minister says that gathering of crowds doesn’t lead to change of laws. They (the government) should understand that gathering of crowds changes governments... Presently the youth here are asking to take back the three farm laws but so far they have not given a call to change the power. They (the government) should understand this and talk to our committee,” Tikait told a panchayat in Kharkhoda, Haryana. Tikait, who is spearheading the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad, is doing a series of rallies in Haryana to garner support of farmers and also of various Khap Panchayats who hold social dominance. Tikait reiterated that the government should hold talks with the committee comprising members of farmers’ unions. The last time when the government representatives and the farm unions’ committee members met each other for discussions was January 22 and thereafter no talks could be held. “The government should know that they are nothing in front of farmers who can destroy their crops. They should not forget that these are our own tractors (which went to Delhi on the Republic Day) and not the ones roped in on rent...,” Tikait said. On Sunday, Union minister Tomar had told reporters in Gwalior that the government is ready to hold talks and also make amendments if need be and urged the agitating farm unions to tell the government which provisions in these new laws they find anti-farmers. “Considering the issue with sensitivity, the government has held 12 rounds of talks with the farmer unions. But decisions on the basis of talks could be taken when objections (over the new farm laws) are pointed out,” Tomar had said. “You flatly say revoke the laws...It doesn’t happen that crowd gathers, and the laws get revoked,” the minister had said. The BKU national spokesperson further said that the ongoing agitation is also of poor farmers who have two cattle and even the poor who get food from ration shops, besides the vendors who put up shops in weekly markets. “The protest is not against just three laws, as more such laws will come. They will go out of hands if we do not put brakes now. They have got a lot of power given to them by farmers and the common man. So, we have to ‘break their nose’ and after that a child will also be able to make them work. After this they will take back the new laws and also the laws which they wish to bring in,” Tikait added. He said that the farmer unions have spread the message to the farmers in West Bengal and Assam that their rice crop should be sold on minimum support price (MSP). The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of about 40 farmer unions, from the Singhu border also criticized the remarks made by the Union agriculture minister. “We would like to remind Shri Tomar and others in the government that the current protests are a consequence of deep unhappiness and anger that was allowed to build up in farmers’ minds by the government. Today, farmers are getting support from all sides, nationally and internationally. The protesters are not a crowd, but our annadata, thanks to whom we are all alive today, including people in the government,” SKM said in a press statement issued on Monday.Meanwhile, Chandra Mohan, secretary of UP unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, criticized the remarks made by Tiakit. “The language used is not called for in a democratic set-up. However, this shows the frustration of these people and also that their ongoing agitation has failed. The farmers of the country stand with the Prime Minister,” Mohan said.Thousands of farmers since November last year are on a protest at various borders of Delhi, including the one at the UP Gate protest site. They have been demanding repeal of the three farm laws and a new law on MSP. The government during the last meeting had proposed that it was ready to hold the implementation of the three laws for a period of one and half years. The proposal was rejected by the farmers’ unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gathering-of-crowds-changes-government-says-rakesh-tikait-101614018148083.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||Court grants bail to man accused of raping US national after she refuses to pursue matter||The Delhi high court has granted bail to a man, a co-accused in the alleged gang-rape of a US national, after the woman said she does not want to pursue her complaint further, almost three years after the incident in August 2017.The main accused is already out on interim bail.Justice Anu Malhotra, on February 11, granted regular bail to Amit Balguhar, after the court noted that the woman no longer wished to provide her testimony or to have any further involvement in the matter.The woman, through the US Department of Justice, had informed the court in August 2020 that she does not want to have any further involvement in the matter and asked not to be contacted again by the Indian authorities.The woman has earlier complained that two men—Shamim and Balguhar -- had gang-raped her in Safdarjung Enclave on August 25, 2017. Balguhar, she alleged, was privy to the crime and helped Shamim to sexually assault her and then later destroy the evidence.The court, while granting bail to Balguhar, noted that the woman had not joined the proceedings through video conferencing and her statement was recorded on September 3, 2019.“The attempts for video conferencing for recording of the statement of the prosecutrix did not succeed for long and on September 3, 2019, her counsel placed on record an email received from her stating that she was not willing to come to India as she had been medically advised against travel and that it was not within her province to arrange the video conferencing process for recording of her testimony,” the court noted.Appearing for the accused, his counsels Akshai Malik and Khawar Saleem, contended that there was a delay of 24 days in the registration of the FIR. They also said the complainant was in a consensual relationship with the accused.The court said considering the totality of circumstances, the accused is entitled to bail. The main accused Shamim is also out on interim bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-us-national-after-she-refuses-to-pursue-matter-101614017668668.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||Man arrested from UP for murder of 17-year-old girl in Begampur; she had rejected his proposal||Three days after a 17-year-old girl was bludgeoned to death with a hammer at her home in outer Delhi’s Begampur, allegedly by a man whose proposal she had recently turned down, the police on Monday said they have arrested the suspect from Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. The police said multiple teams were conducting searches in Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh to nab the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Laik Khan.The murder case had figured prominently on social media platforms all through Saturday since the girl and the alleged accused belonged to different religions. The police, however, have maintained that religion had nothing to do with the girl’s murder.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra said Khan was arrested on Monday morning from his home town in Hardoi while he was about to flee for another destination. “We are interrogating him to ascertain the exact motive and sequence of events leading to the girl’s murder,” said Mishra, adding that Khan worked in a car mats manufacturing factory in Bawana and knew the girl’s family for the past five years.On Friday evening, the police said, when the girl’s parents were away at work, Khan visited her house. He allegedly sent her brothers to the market to buy vegetables. When the brothers returned, they found the house locked from outside. They initially thought their sister had left with Khan after locking the house.“But when they tried calling her and heard her phone ringing from inside the house, they suspected something amiss and broke open the door,” a police officer, who did not want to be named, said.Inside, the brothers found the girl unconscious and injured. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. A murder case was registered at the Begampur police station and investigation was taken up. Khan became the prime suspect as he was the last person seen with the girl and was missing after the crime. During the probe, the officer said, it was learnt that Khan was very close to the girl’s family and was a frequent visitor to their home. He had even lived with the family for two months when they had moved from Bawana to Begumpur. He would often help the family with their day-to-day affairs,” the officer said.Police said Khan was on good terms with the girl’s family until recently, when he started developing feelings for the teenager. Recently, he proposed to the girl, but she had turned him down, the DCP said, based on what the police had gleaned from one of her cousins.Investigators suspected that an argument ensued between the girl and Khan over her rejecting his proposal and that led to him beating her to death with a hammer. “We are interrogating Khan to get a clearer picture of what had led to the murder,” the officer added.Last week in Mangolpuri, the death of a 25-year-old man who was stabbed to death by a group of men took a communal turn after his affiliation with some Hindu outfit came to fore. Many political leaders visited the house of the deceased as Delhi Police increased security in the area and transferred the case to the crime branch. Seven persons have been arrested in that case so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-arrested-from-up-for-murder-of-17-year-old-girl-in-begampur-she-had-rejected-his-proposal-101614017549650.html

The cheques were handed over to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office-bearers Mohan Singh, Ramnavmi ji and Raman Pratap by JD(U) national president RCP Singh.BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and state general secretary Devesh Kumar were present on the occasion.Speaking on the occasion, RSS leaders said that Lord Ram "belongs to all” and just to any particular political party.Also read: 'India committed to no-first-use policy under nuclear doctrine' - ShringlaIn 2018, the JD(U) made it clear that it was not in favour of the promulgation of an ordinance to facilitate the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, demand for which has been made by the Sangh Parivar and a section of the BJP.Singh, at that time, had said that the party will stick to its earlier stand on the issue in its earlier avatar as the Samata Party which was - the issue should either be solved by mutual consent between the affected communities or be decided by a court of law.Even before walking out of the NDA in 2013, the JD(U) had always insisted that abrogating Article 370, Ram temple in Ayodhya, and the Uniform Civil Code should be kept out of the coalition agenda.Although chief minister Nitish Kumar had maintained silence on the issue, incumbent water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha made a mention of the Ram temple bhoomi pujan in one of his tweets last year.“Sita and Ram reside in the hearts of every resident in Mithila,” Jha had posted.

22-02-2021||Gurugram||State refuses prosecution sanction against four cops in school murder case||The Haryana government declined prosecution sanctions against four police officials, including an assistant commissioner of police, chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the 2017 Gurugram school murder case. According to the government, the sanction for prosecution was declined after examination of the CBI report, statement of relevant witnesses and relied-upon relevant documents. On January 6, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet against four Gurugram police officials for falsely implicating a school bus conductor and for fabricating documents against him in the case. An investigation by the CBI had concluded that these four had allegedly fabricated false evidence with intent to procure the conviction of Ashok Kumar, a bus driver. Kumar was arrested on September 8, 2017, but was later acquitted by a special court on February 28, 2018. Rapping the state government and the state police, the special CBI court on February 2 had stated that “they are sleeping like a Kumbhakarna” instead of discharging their statutory duties, over the delay in granting prosecution sanction for four Gurugram police personnel in the school murder case. The court directed that the requisite action be taken within 10 days. On February 19, Rajeev Arora, the additional chief secretary to the government of Haryana, home department, passed an order in this regard concerning Birem Singh, then ACP, Narender Khatana, then station house officer of Bhondsi police station, Shamsher Singh, a sub-inspector who was the investigating officer for two days, and Subhash Chand, an ASI, the four officials named. The state government, however, declined the prosecution sanction on the grounds that the officials made an error in the investigation, but that there was no fault in their intent. “On examination of all the materials including FIR, investigation report of CBI, disclosure statements, statements of witnesses, recovery memos and other relevant materials, it is observed that merely oral statements have been relied upon and no medical documents have been placed on record regarding voluntarily causing hurt to Ashok Kumar to extort confession. Ashok Kumar was subjected to regular medical examination during the police custody and such medical documents are required to be relied upon and to be cited in the investigation report,” said a report filed in the court on Monday. Sushil Tekriwal, the counsel for the complainant, said they will challenge the order in the Punjab and Haryana high court. The state government further argued that other charges relate to inaccurate documentation, which cannot be punishable by criminal prosecution, unless there is criminal intent and proving such intent to falsely implicate any person. “There may be instances of not adopting the correct approach depending upon the circumstances of the case, but the intent of the investigation officer to conduct the investigation in the right perspective has to be seen. The intent and ultimate objective of both the agencies was to focus on investigation of the main offence of murder of seven-year-old and crack the crime,” read the government report. The state government also took a dig at the CBI for filing a chargesheet against police officials. “The charges sought to be made against the police officials are distinct and severable from the main case entrusted to the CBI. An act or omission or lack of efficiency of failure to attain the highest standard of investigation may or not, by itself, amount to or constitute an offence.” Deepam Raghav and Mayank Raghav, the counsels for the police officials, said the state government has refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of all four officials. The court adjourned the next hearing to March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/state-refuses-prosecution-sanction-against-four-cops-in-school-murder-case-101614017128009.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||Congress holds protest march to oppose rising fuel prices, farm bills||The Congress party on Monday carried out a protest march called ‘Tiranga Yatra’ against the rising prices of petrol, diesel, gas cylinder and also against the three farm laws passed by the union government last year. Party workers and leaders gathered at the Old Jail Road crossing and marched up to Rajiv Chowk, shouting slogans against government policies. The protesters alleged that the present government has failed to control inflation and the rising fuel prices. “One has to recall the amount of protests carried out by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP ) when Congress was in power. Even a small rise in the fuel price would be used have been used by the opposition to hit out at the government. Now that the prices of these fuels are increasing exponentially, the ruling government seems to have no solution. If this continues, then the day is not far when people will have to return to the days of bullock carts,” said captain (retd) Ajay Singh Yadav, former minister and a senior Congress leader. Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson, when asked about the matter, said that slogans raised in Congress protest were against the spirit of democracy and against healthy discourse. “As far as fuel prices are concerned, a comparison should be done of fuel prices in BJP-run states and Congress-run states so that truth ces out. Fuel prices in Congress-ruled states are higher across the country,” said Malik. The Congress leaders also alleged that the present government by bringing in three farm laws was trying to push agriculture and farming into the hands of a few corporate organisations. The party also said that these laws will lead to hoarding, black marketing of agricultural produce and will ultimately harm both farmers and consumers in the long run. Harpal Singh Boora, in-charge, Indian National Congress, Gurugram, said that the BJP-led government is not taking any steps for the welfare of youth and women. It has also failed to curb inflation and to tackle unemployment. Boora also alleged that the present BJP government was implementing the agenda of corporate companies and that the Congress would oppose it.Raman Malik, spokesperson, BJP, when asked about the matter said that slogans raised in Congress protest were against the spirit of democracy and against healthy discourse. “As far as fuel prices are concerned, a comparison should be made of fuel prices in BJP-run and Congress-run states so that truth comes out.

22-02-2021||Gurugram||Schools for students in classes 3 to 5 to reopen on February 24||Schools across the state will reopen for students in classes 3 to 5 from February 24 — nearly 11 months after they were closed across the country amid Covid-19 outbreak in March last year. Online classes for students who wish to continue to with remote learning will also continue and they will neither be bound to attend physical classroom sessions nor will their names be struck off the school roll, as per the SOP(standard operating procedure) issued by the education department on Monday.In the directive shared with all district education officers on Monday, the directorate of education said that the state government had decided to reopen schools for students in classes 3 to 5, while taking cognisance of the importance of learning and classroom lessons for students. Both government and private schools will be allowed to conduct classes of three-and-a-half hour duration from 10am till 1.30pm for students in these classes, as per the directive. Students are also required to produce a parental consent letter for school visits as per the norms. In a departure from the guidelines that were in place for school reopening for senior classes, the SOP doesn’t mention the requirement of a medical clearance. Schools will, however, continue with thermal scanning and record the daily temperature of students. Schools across the country were closed in March last year amid the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Voluntary visits to schools in Haryana for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. Schools were reopened for students in classes 6-8 on February 1.“At the entrance itself, we will check the temperature and see if students exhibit any visible Covid-19 symptoms or not. Their temperature will be recorded in an app. If anyone has fever or cold, they will not be allowed to enter the school,” said Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi. Raghav said that the requirement of a compulsory medical clearance had been waived off on view of the age of children. “We can’t expect children in younger grades to get the health clearance done. It will be a hassle for them. Teachers will be conducting necessary checks in school,” he said. Most private schools are expected to continue with online classes. Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the school would call students based on feedback from parents and was presently continuing with online classes for students in grades below 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-for-students-in-classes-3-to-5-to-reopen-on-february-24-101614016828832.html

A decision in this regard was taken during a special review meeting held at the MCG’s Sector 34 office on Monday. At the meeting, the status of all MCG projects costing more than ₹5 crore was reviewed.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, who attended the meeting through video conferencing, directed civic body officials to ensure that there is no encroachment on any of the designated project sites before allotting any work. “There are encroachments at the Wazirabad sports stadium project, and I have given officials a two-week deadline to remove them. Further, directions have been also given to demarcate its boundary wall and fast-track the project,” said Singh.Back in June 2016, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had made the announcement for the construction of a sports stadium in Wazirabad. A year later, the MCG had procured 12 acres of land from the Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on a 99-year lease for the project.Until May 2019, the MCG had plans to construct a ₹130-crore archery range and multi-purpose indoor sports complex. However, following a meeting between Yashpal Yadav, the former MCG commissioner, and V Umashankar, the former chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), it was decided that a ₹20-crore recreational sports complex was more feasible along the lines of Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park in Mumbai.The complex was supposed to have a ground for football, a jogging-running track for athletes, a skating rink, indoor badminton and a basketball courts. However, this project too did not come to fruition.In August last year, the MCG decided to construct a ₹200-crore sports complex instead with facilities such as a swimming pool, shooting range, basketball court, kabaddi court, among other such sports. In addition, MCG had also decided to build a hostel for accommodating over 100 male and female athletes.Overall, 19 projects were reviewed in the meeting, which included the construction of multilevel car park at Kaman Sarai, Sadar Bazar, and the main post office; a cultural and art complex in Sector 53; an auditorium in Bal Bhavan; MCG’s office in Vyapar Sadan; 45 MLD capacity main pumping stations at Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited(GMCBL) depot in Sector 10; roads and stormwater drains in Palam Vihar; and strengthening of existing infrastructure at Sushant Lok 1. MCG officials informed councillors and Mayor Madhu Azad, who was chairing the review meeting, that the pumping station project at the sector GMCBL bus depot are already complete while all the remaining projects are in progress.In the meeting, Azad said that all the development works should be expedited, and the works should be completed within the stipulated time period. “All these big projects should be viewed as achievements of the MCG and the residents of Gurugram should be given an opportunity to avail the same at the earliest. A report on completed projects has also been sought from MCG officials and they have been further directed to not compromise with the quality of work while they are expediting all the concerned projects,” said Azad.The mayor also directed the officials to install sign boards in the new areas taken over by the MCG.“For each of the major projects, negligence in development works will not be tolerated. Officers have been directed to ensure that whenever they come to the next review meeting, they submit the report with complete information for each project,” said Azad.During the meeting, Singh also directed officials to ensure utilities are removed well in advance before any construction commences and to make adequate security arrangements for all large projects. Along with this, instructions were also given to place boards related to the work on every site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-sets-deadline-to-remove-encroachments-from-wazirabad-sports-complex-site-101614016827990.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||Poor lighting main cause of accidents: Police||Following a spate of accidents on Friday and Saturday — in which four persons died on roads connecting to the Delhi-Jaipur highway within 24 hours — the police found that the lack of streetlights was leading to accidents. Two police teams visited 12 black spots and found that six did not have functional streetlights. Lack of proper lighting is a major problem on Dwarka Expressway, Farrukhnagar crossing, Pataudi crossing, Hero Honda Chowk, Sidhrawali crossing and Manesar. Motorcyclists and pedestrians are the worst affected, as most on these stretches and the lanes don’t have a footpath. Last week, over 25 accidents were reported from the six spots, which have already been identified as black spots by the district administration. The police said that deploying personnel and PCR vans at accident-prone spots have failed to help, as drivers fail to notice the vehicles, steep turns and potholes due to poor visibility during the early hours. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have formed two teams to check the spot and submit the report, following which the stakeholders will be informed to take prompt action. “We have been analysing accident spots and Bilaspur and Manesar are two of the most dangerous spots, where (a lack of) streetlights is a major concern,” he said. On Friday and Saturday, four people were killed due to speeding, lack of streetlights and poor condition of the roads.In one of the incidents on Friday night, a mother-son duo had hitched a ride on a tractor and was on the way, when the tractor sped over a speed breaker, allegedly due to poor visibility, and the woman was thrown off the vehicle and died of severe injuries. “The Farrukhnagar crossing is dangerous and more than 10 accidents have been reported in the last four days. The authorities should at least install a few streetlights for the safety of commuters,” said Harsh Kumar, a resident of Farrukhnagar, whose mother died in the incident. Lalit Yadav a resident of Panchgaon in Manesar, said that the crossing was unsafe after dark. He said that trucks speed on this stretch and due to non-operational streetlights, the motorists and pedestrians suffer the most. “My sister-in-law and I were returning home on Friday night from the market when a speeding tractor rammed us from behind. We fell and she was run over by the tractor and died on the spot. The driver took advantage of the dark and fled the spot,” he said. The police said that service roads on both sides have poor lighting during the night and the narrow potholed road compounds the issue. Rao said they would write to the highways authority, public works and other agencies, and hold a meeting this week for prompt solutions. “We have identified the spots where streetlights are required and can save lives,” he said. Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert, said that besides lack of infrastructure, including streetlights, road safety audits of accident-prone sites also revealed that the timings of streetlights are erratic. “Often, in several areas of the city, including a major road network, streetlights aren’t turned on until 8-9pm and in many areas, they are not functional. Similarly, they are turned off around 5am, even though it’s dark. A lot of accidents have taken place due to lack of streetlights in areas like Bilaspur and Manesar,” she said. The district administration and the Road Safety Authority (RTA) is also analysing the data to pinpoint reasons for the accidents and suggest solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/poor-lighting-main-cause-of-accidents-police-101614016769462.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||Over 88% turnout recorded among health workers for Covid vaccine||The turnout for Covid-19 vaccine doses improved on Monday with at least 88.2% of the 4,001 targeted healthcare workers taking the shot at a mega vaccination drive. The sluggish pace of vaccination for front-line workers, however, continued with only 49.2% of the 1,500 getting their first jab. Officials said that they have been aiming to cover majority of health workers under second-dose drive before the third phase of vaccination begins next month. “Considering the high turnout, the vaccination target will be increased to cover more than 5,000 healthcare workers at 66 session sites on Tuesday. The plan is to inoculate the maximum healthcare workers with second dose so that third phase of vaccination targeting people of 50 years and plus can be easily conducted,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Monday reported the maximum turnout of 3,531 healthcare staff coming forward to take the jab at the 59 vaccination booths set up in different hospitals. This is the highest turn out in the last one week since the second dose drive started on February 15. Considering the fact, the vaccination drive will be conducted only three times a week – Monday, Tuesday and Thursday – the per day target is likely to be increased for both front-line and healthcare workers. The footfall of front-line workers remained low with only 738 of the 1,500 target turning up to take the jab. Till now, almost 14,000 out of 18,000 registered staff has taken the first dose. The lowest turnout was reported from panchayati raj institutions, where only 54 people of the 300 took the shot. Even in case revenue department, of the 100 people targeted for the day, only 24 got inoculated. About 375 employees out of 500 from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), 116 of the 500 from the police department, and 169 National Security Guard (NSG) personnel also took their first shot. “Inoculation of front-line workers will continue until further orders. Employees of revenue and panchayati raj institutions are extremely reluctant to take the jab. They need to be motivated,” said Yadav, adding that more than 1000 frontline workers have been targeted on Tuesday at least 14 vaccination sites. An additional 152 healthcare staff from ESIC Hospital, Manesar also took the shot on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-88-turnout-recorded-among-health-workers-for-covid-vaccine-101614016769979.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||36 random samples sent for testing to identify new SARS CoV-2 variant||At least 36 random Covid-19 positive samples have been sent from Gurugram to the National Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, in the last one month to detect the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged in the United Kingdom late last year. The test results have not yet been shared with the district health department, according to the health officials who raised the issue in a meeting with Dr Usha Gupta, director, health services, Haryana, on Monday. “Test results of 36 samples sent till now have not been received from the government lab in Delhi. According to the government guidelines, 5% of the random samples positive for SARS CoV-2 has to be tested for genomic sequencing to identify the new variant of the Covid-19. Even if the results are negative, the health department has not yet been updated, “said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. The genomic sequencing started in December last year after a new strain — currently called B.1.1.7 — emerged in the United Kingdom. International travellers from UK started to be tested, which included nearly 700 people from Gurugram who travelled after November 25 last year. Only a single case of a 22-year-old man with the new strain was reported from the city in the last week of December. Since then, the health department has been sending random positive samples by public or private laboratories to the identified regional genome sequencing laboratories. On Monday, the district reported 23 new cases, taking the active case count to 233. Identification of the new strain is critical to assess whether the mutation can influence the transmission and severity of Covid-19. Since the vaccination has been ongoing, variants could reverse the progress towards herd immunity. “Random samples are being sent weekly. In case any international traveller is tested Covid-19 positive, their samples are also being sent along with it,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19. “The test results are directly being submitted by the lab to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for further analysis and compilation but have not been reaching us.” Hepatitis and Vector-borne disease Gupta, who is also the state officer for National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), reviewed other ongoing health programmes, with a focus on Hepatitis B and C. “Screening camps will be held in jails, TB centres, de-addiction centres, among other places, to identify cases of Hepatitis B and C. Also, the health department will now give confirmation on swine flu cases for samples that will come from Faridabad, Jhajjar and Rewari,” said Dr Sudha Gupta, deputy civil surgeon and district surveillance officer for Hepatitis and NVBDCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/36-random-samples-sent-for-testing-to-identify-new-sars-cov-2-variant-101614016768402.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||City bus service extends reach in Faridabad with new route launch||The Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) launched a new route to Faridabad on Monday and plans to add 10 more buses for the Gurugram-Faridabad route, officials said on Monday. Anju Chaudhary, chief executive officer of GMCBL, said, “We are already running four buses till NIT Faridabad and on Monday, we started two more buses from NIT till Bata Chowk. These buses will be going from Gurugram and cater to the public within Faridabad. We are further thinking of adding 10 more buses to the fleet with an increase in the number of commuters.” The GMCBL on Monday, introduced Route 902, which will follow the route from NIT Bus Stand — Bata Metro Station — NIT Bus Stand (Mudrika) Via Hardware Chowk, Bata Metro Station, Hardware Chowk, Dabua Colony, Hanuman mandir and KL Mehta College. The bus service will start at 7.15am from NIT Bus Stand and the last bus would leave at 7.35pm. With the new bus route, the city bus service is now available on 24 routes with 153 buses. “These buses will ease public mobility between the two major cities and being CNG buses, they will help reduce pollution also. Our main aim is to strengthen the intercity public transport system in Faridabad,” said Chaudhary. On Republic Day, the GMCBL had launched five new routes and added 25 new vehicles to its existing fleet. Three of the routes launched were aimed at increasing the connectivity between the busy transit hubs in the heart of the city, while two were aimed at mass transit options to distant locations. Despite the new routes, the GMCBL is still behind on its declared objective of launching 200 CNG-operated, low-floor buses by March 2019, and the addition of another 300 in the following year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-bus-service-extends-reach-in-faridabad-with-new-route-launch-101614016768985.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||Admin directs all agencies to take corrective measures to prevent accidents||In a district-level road safety meeting held on February 19, the district administration directed the agencies concerned to install streetlights in areas where they are currently lacking. Although officials did not provide specific details about the areas and the agencies concerned, they said that the matter has been taken into cognisance by the recently constituted Safer Streets for Gurugram (SSFG) — a partnership between road safety experts and the district administration — and will be tackled on a priority basis.The meeting was attended by officials from the road transport authority, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Public Works Department (PWD) and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who chaired the February 19 meeting, said, “We have reviewed available safety measures at all accident-prone spots in Gurugram. Authorities have been told to execute whatever engineering changes are needed at accident-prone locations in their jurisdiction, be it installation of streetlights or speed calming measures. Essentially, we are taking all steps necessary to prevent the rate of accidents that we are seeing.” Jitender Mittal, chief engineer (infra), GMDA, who is also overseeing the operations of the GMDA’s mobility division, confirmed the development. “We will work with SSFG to identify areas which need better lighting and we will take action. There will be a detailed safety audit of all stretches across the district and we will submit the data to the district administration for review. A second audit will be conducted after the gaps have been identified to see if they are effective.” Residents, meanwhile, said that the issue is not just about safety of motorists but also that of pedestrians and women. Pancheswar Singh, a resident of Kaliyawas in Farrukhnagar, said, “On the same stretch where the recent accidents have happened, women have earlier reported incidents of molestation and snatching as well. It is unsafe for anyone to commute after it gets dark.” A transportation planning expert associated with a Delhi institute, on the condition of anonymity, said, “To blame lack of lights for accidents is a bit simplistic. You can also solve the issue by increasing the number of reflectors on the motorable surfaces, for example, or simply redesigning the roads. If most of these accidents in the last week have happened at junctions, it indicates a deeper issue than just lack of streetlights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/admin-directs-all-agencies-to-take-corrective-measures-to-prevent-accidents-101614016767887.html
22-02-2021||Gurugram||28-year-old man shot dead in Sector 9||A 28-year-old man was shot dead by at least two unidentified assailants in Feroz Gandhi colony of Sector 9 in Gurugram on Monday afternoon. According to the police, the assailants fired 18 bullets, of which 15 hit the man, killing him on the spot.The victim was identified as Manish, a resident of Basai village, who worked for a transport agency and collected money from drivers.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the victim had left his house around 10.30am and visited his employer’s house in Feroz Gandhi Colony around noon. “He entered his house, took the keys to his SUV key and the moment he sat on the driving seat, masked persons shot him dead with a pistol,” he said.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that several people were present at the spot but no one has come forward to give their account. “We have asked more than 20 persons, but all of them have denied seeing any firing,” he said.Sangwan said that five crime teams from sectors 17, 10, 31 and 40, and Palam Vihar were formed on Monday to investigate the incident. “The family members are in shock as Manish had no personal enmity. They were not aware that he had parked his motorbike at the employer’s house and was going in his SUV,” he said.The police said that Manish had no criminal record, but his employer had several cases against him, due to which they suspect the assailants mistook him for the owner. “We are trying to ascertain the cause of the murder. The reason behind the murder will only be known after the investigation is complete,” Sangwan said.A team of dog squad and forensic experts visited the spot and collected samples. The body was sent for a post-mortem examination.Sangwan said they are scanning the CCTV footage from six cameras in the area to identify the suspects and if more people were involved. A case under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intentions) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at New Colony police station on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/28yearold-man-shot-dead-in-sector-9-101614016707880.html

Now we have approached for direct relief from the deadly garbage burning issue.”Taking cognisance of the garbage burning issue, the central pollution control board (CPCB) had asked the Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB) to seriously look into the issue of chronic garbage and plastic burning in Wagholi in 2018.Members of the Wagholi housing societies association (WHSA) had complained to the central pollution control board alleging that the Pune metropolitan region development authority (PMRDA), local gram panchayat and even the Maharashtra pollution control board had turned a deaf ear to their pleas demanding an end to the garbage burning menace in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/wagholi-residents-write-to-aditya-thackeray-against-garbage-menace-101614015207831.html
22-02-2021||Pune||MSRTC Pune division tightens Covid measures||Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao declared and issued orders on Sunday about several restrictions to be imposed in Pune district to stop the increasing spread of Covid-19, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), Pune division has taken stricter steps to stop the spread of the virus. Already, precautionary measures are being taken at ST stands, additionally now squads have been deployed to monitor the crowd in the MSRTC Pune division. “We are running all the schedules of ST buses across Maharashtra, there is no change in it. But at the same time, the safety of passengers at ST stands and inside the bus is also equally important. Already, safety precautions as per state government guidelines are being taken at ST stands with proper social distancing. Passengers without face masks are not allowed inside the bus. Each and every bus is sanitised before going on the route, additionally, we have made squads with the help of ST bus conductors and stand staff to monitor the crowd,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune divisional controller. “During the weekends, there is lot of rush across ST stands in the division, we try our best to maintain social distancing but as the number of passengers is high, sometimes it becomes difficult to monitor the crowd. These squads will be clearing the rush of passengers by guiding them to their required ST bus or help them in getting the bus information. There will be no such impact on ST bus operations due to the newly imposed restrictions, only for the buses coming from Vidarbha side they would be reduced as lockdown is imposed in some of the cities like Amravati,” he added. While passengers are worried about the safety and infection risk at the ST stands due to the increasing number of Covid cases in Pune, Santosh Jaybhay a regular ST bus passenger said, “I regularly travel from Pune to Solapur to my village and in the few months since the ST bus service has started there is no proper social distancing maintained at the ST stands. The premises need to be cleaned more often and strict action needs to be taken on passengers who are spitting, throwing garbage and making the stand premises dirty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-pune-division-tightens-covid-measures-101614015149581.html
22-02-2021||Pune||SPPU faces financial crunch, appeals alumni to donate||In a bid to help the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) financially, a system will be made in place to reach out to alumni students across the globe. Along with this, several other important decisions and discussions were held on Monday at the SPPU’s management council meeting. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar along with the council members and other senior office bearers of the SPPU attended the meeting. The decreasing number of SPPU’s savings, decline in interest rates and to increase the income of SPPU by various means was the topic majorly discussed at the meeting. Also, the draft for the forthcoming SPPU budget for 2021-22 was discussed at length and sanctioned during the meeting. After several changes to be made in this budget draft, it will be presented in the last week of March. “There was ₹550 crore in the SPPU saving funds earlier, which has now reduced to ₹350 crore. Government grants are reducing, and decreased interest rates of the banks have affected the SPPU yearly budget. Also, the expenditure on faculty’s salaries have increased, so to create new sources of income was the discussion made in today’s meeting. In this, a proposal was made to get help from alumni students who are at various positions across the globe. For this, we are going to create bank accounts and other systems will be made in place,” said Rajesh Pande, SPPU management council member. “We are now going to focus on fewer expenses to be made in the budget draft and only necessary allotment of funds will be done. As the saving funds have drastically gone down we need to look for alternative incomes now, as we won’t be able to sustain for long with it,” added Pandey. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “In today’s meeting, an important decision to give sanction to forthcoming SPPU budget was taken, also there was a discussion on clearing the audit. We are also going to appeal to our alumni students to help SPPU financially, for which an official circular will soon be issued from us.” BOX During the SPPU management council meeting, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Pune division student volunteers protested inside the meeting hall for various demands. One of the major demands raised by ABVP was to return back the examination fees taken from students by colleges. Last year, in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic exams of all students except last year students were cancelled and everyone passed. However, the exam fees were taken from students, so demand was made to return back the fees to the students immediately. The SPPU examination department issued a circular to all affiliated colleges to submit their report about examination fees and after taking a review, a further decision will be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-faces-financial-crunch-appeals-alumni-to-donate-101614015148979.html
22-02-2021||Pune||Tender for Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project to be floated this week||City mayor Murlidhar Mohol stated that the tender for the Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project will be floated in the next two to three days, after receiving all the permissions from the Central government. On January 27th, 2021, union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari held a review meeting for Pune city’s river rejuvenation project which is being funded by the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA). Gadkari instructed the PMC to float the tender by February end. He even instructed the Central government officials to give all necessary permission. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “We have received almost all clearance from the Central government. Now, the PMC would float the tender in the next two to three days.” Maharashtra irrigation minister Jayant Patil, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, mayor Mohol, standing committee chairman Rasne and municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar were present for the meeting with Gadkari. Mohol said, “As the cost of the previous tender was inflated, it got cancelled. The Jalshakti mantralaya gave permission to scrap the project. As the project cost was high it got scrapped earlier and took a long time. Now, I am not aware of the estimated cost but whatever excess amount that was approved by the JICA would need to be paid by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).”BOXTimeline for the Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project The JICA provided the funding for the project and got it approved on January 13, 2016. In the last five years, despite getting approval, the project was not kick-started for various reasons. Earlier, the central government took a long time to appoint a consultant for the project. Later, the PMC floated the tenders for the same and it received higher costs. Some of the central government officials tried to pressurise the PMC to accept inflated tenders but all parties remained firmed to scrap it. Again, the Central government took almost two years to scrap the inflated tender. Now, as all the permissions have been received, the PMC is in the process to float the tenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tender-for-mula-mutha-river-rejuvenation-project-to-be-floated-this-week-101614015148349.html
22-02-2021||Pune||No decision on holding board exams online yet, parents advise against||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) is yet to take a call on whether board exams will be held online or not. Officials from the board noted that there is still time for the examination, and the final call will be taken as the exam dates approach closer. Dinkar Patil, chairman of the MSBSHSE said that there is still time to take a final call on the nature of the exams this year. “We still have two months, as the dates approach closer we will assess the situation and then take a call whether the examination should be held online or not. As of now, there is no such decision to conduct examinations online,” Patil said. While the decision is still pending, students and parents are not happy with the online examination. Sampada Waghmare, a student of class 12 said that giving an online examination will not be a good idea. “For multiple-choice questions, it is easier but for subjective testing, the online examination can be difficult. We might have to type the answers. Or else we will have to visit a centre for writing the examination. There is no clarity on this as of now. As a student, I am more comfortable writing offline. That is how we have practiced so far. Offline exams will be more suitable for us,” said Waghmare. Sharing similar views, Pragati Kulkarni, a parent of a class 10 student said that her son is more comfortable in an offline examination, but the fear of Covid continues. “Class 10 and Class 12 are important academic years for a child. It is different to learn online but if the examinations are also online, the challenges will be different. In less than two months, the child might not be very well prepared to attempt exams online,” said Kulkarni. Nishi Parkhe, a city-based teacher said that offline examination will be a better call as class 10 and Class 12 examinations are crucial for students. “Online examination will require an entirely different centre. Subjective answers will be required to either be sent as a PDF or typed. Typing for students is not a regular activity and so may consume more time for them to answer one question. Moreover, an online centre may not be available in rural areas. The pdf for subjective answers can be difficult to check. This we have experienced during our midterm examinations,” said Parkhe. She further added that for offline exams, with due safety measures, social distancing can be adopted. “Offline examination can be conducted in a safer way by adding more examination centres. More centres will ensure that fewer children are accommodated in one class thus ensuring strict invigilation and more safety,” said Parkhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-decision-on-holding-board-exams-online-yet-parents-advise-against-101614015147744.html
22-02-2021||Pune||Pune applicant allotted Gadchiroli exam centre for health department recruitment exam||Students who have applied for various posts of the state health department are facing major issues regarding the recruitment examination to be held on February 28, Sunday. Students who applied and gave preferences for an examination centre in a nearby city have been allotted a centre far away in another district. Ashish Khadke, an applicant who received a faraway centre said, “I have applied for the post of pharmacy officer, I am from Pune so had given a preference of Pune and Mumbai for the exams, but I have been allotted the Gadchiroli college examination centre which is very far away for me to travel. Only yesterday, there have been restrictions imposed in Pune district and travelling so far in such Covid times is too risky for me. Even my parents are worried to send me to Gadchiroli for the test, so our demand is that the state government should immediately do something about it and give us nearby centres to appear for the exam.” For Agatrao Vagare, a resident of Satara district who gave a preference of Mumbai or Pune has been allotted the Nagpur centre to appear for the exam. A similar situation is being faced by hundreds of other students who have applied for the posts and are going to appear for the exam. “When I filled up the application form for several posts which were opened for recruitment in the state health department, I clearly mentioned in the online form for a Mumbai centre in the preference column. Despite giving this preference, when I got my hall ticket of the examination, the exam centre allotted to me was in Nagpur city. This is just unacceptable and complete mismanagement done by the state health department, in such tough times of Covid they are not considering the safety of applicants.” said Vagare. Maharashtra state health department recruitment process for various posts is currently going on like medical officer, pharmacist, community health officer, junior clerk, laboratory assistant, multipurpose health workers, telephone operators and many more. For these posts, lakhs of people have applied, and the written examination is going to be held on February 28 at several centres across the state. Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar, minister of state for the public health department said, “I will take more information on this issue and accordingly further steps will be taken by our department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-applicant-allotted-gadchiroli-exam-centre-for-health-department-recruitment-exam-101614015088752.html
22-02-2021||Pune||Ahead of civic polls, corporators prioritise lane concretisation work||Despite the PMC municipal commissioner’s instructions to stop using funds on non-proprietary works, a lot of money is being spent on cement concretization in narrow lanes on the background of the upcoming civic polls. On the background of the Covid-19 pandemic, PMC chief Vikram Kumar has instructed all departments to prioritise essential works like water, drainage, health and road repair. Despite that, ward offices have floated tenders of concretisation in by lanes to spend the budget as well as to show development work in light of the upcoming civic polls. As per road department statistics, there are around ₹100 crore worth tenders floated to concrete the lanes in different ward offices. The ward office has the power to float tender up to ₹25 lakh at the ward level. There is no need to take permission from the main road department. Dr Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner said, “We will check tenders and allow permission to cement concertise work for the essential ones. Earlier, the PMC commissioner was given instruction to spend only 40 per cent of budget allocation on priority work. Now, they have increased the cap up to 60 per cent. But that doesn’t mean it is wise to spend the maximum ward level budget on lane concretization.” Every year, the PMC allots around ₹500 crore for roadwork. It includes road repairing and the construction of new roads. The share of the budget for road repair and maintenance is around ₹60 crore. The other funds are used for making bituminous and cement concretization (CC) of roads. PMC makes its budgetary provision based on visual inspection before drafting the annual budget. However, corporators propose cement concrete road work in the wards to utilize the ward development funds. The amount goes to around ₹100 crore. On the eve of civic polls, the amount increases and reaches ₹150 crore at ward level. On the other hand, the civic body’s main road department spends ₹200 crore every year on cement concrete road construction. It is regular work and has nothing to do with the election period. Vivek Velankar, civic activist said, “Local corporators are wasting money on concretization of lanes. Actually, the lanes are in good condition. On the other side, due to the lack of stormwater drain, there are chances of a flood-like situation in lanes. However, the corporators are in a hurry to spend the allocated budget money.” “It is one of the ways of corruption to spend money on non-priority works as most contractors have a direct connection with the corporators. Another thing, the PMC commissioner has not mentioned a list of priority works in detail. Therefore, ward offices are taking benefit of doubts and float tenders,” he added. In the city, there is a 2,064 km long road network. Of that, around 1,800 are totally developed. The width of roads varies from 7.5 meters to 60 meters. A maximum of 18-meter-wide roads has been developed in the city. The bituminous roads have a maximum share as compared to cement concrete roads. There is 400 km of cement concretised roads. The share of main roads is 200 km, and the remaining are secondary roads. There are 50 major roads in the city with a maximum of 60 meters in width.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ahead-of-civic-polls-corporators-prioritise-lane-concretisation-work-101614015088248.html
22-02-2021||Pune||Footpath and drainage repair season begins ahead of polls||As the financial year is coming to end, the regional ward offices started floating maximum tenders for drainage and footpath repairing related works. In order to utilise the ward development fund, it is common practice in the civic body that elected members are forced to spend a maximum amount on drainage and footpath related works. For the last two weeks, almost everyday tenders are floated by the PMC for footpath repairing works and laying drainage lines. Each tender’s estimated cost is below Rs10 lakh. One of the officials on anonymity said, “It is an elected member’s ward development fund. We need to float the tenders as works are suggested by elected members. It’s their budget.” One of the ruling party’s office-bearers accepted on anonymity that ward office levels works are unnecessary and money is spent on the same work.“year, the same footpaths are getting renovated but as elected members are aggressive about it, we cannot do much about it,” he said. A senior official from PMC said, “In almost all the municipal corporations it is general practice to carry out drainage works. The maximum number of works is unnecessary. There is no mechanism to check whether the work carried out is really necessary.” Another elected member on anonymity said, “A few years ago, it was exposed in the Bhavani peth area that only manholes were erected and there were no pipes connected to it. It means the contractor only erected the manholes and pipes were not laid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/footpath-and-drainage-repair-season-begins-ahead-of-polls-101614015087657.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade charges over Chandni Chowk Hanuman temple||The war of words between the BJP and AAP over a makeshift Hanuman temple at Chandni Chowk continued Monday with each attacking the other over the PWD filing a police complaint in which it termed the structure an "obstacle" in executing a beautification project.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak charged that the BJP exerted pressure through the LG office to get the Public Works Department (PWD) to lodge a police complaint against the structure, an allegation the BJP termed "hilarious".A prefabricated, steel-made structure was installed by unknown persons on central verge of Main Chandni Chowk on February 18.The structure has come up close to the spot where an old temple of the deity was demolished after court order to pave way for Chandni Chowk beautification project being carried out by PWD.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor found Pathak's statement "hilarious" and reflective of his frustration."After getting exposed that Arvind Kejriwal government's PWD has written a letter to the Delhi Police against the re-established Mandir, it clearly stands established that Aam Aadmi Party right from the beginning did not want to see this Hanuman Mandir in Chandni Chowk," he said.Pathak, however, hit out at the BJP alleging the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) ruled by the party first paved the way for demolition of old Hanuman temple and was now indulging in "dirty" politics over the new temple."The BJP through LG office, forced the PWD engineer to file the police complaint and now it's enacting drama over the whole issue and blaming the Delhi government," Pathak charged.The PWD in a complaint to Kotwali police station, asked for action on the prefabricated structure kept in Chandni Chowk."This structure is basically an obstacle in the theme of (the) project and placed without intimation and permission from project executing authorities. In this regard, it is requested to take necessary action at the earliest so that the project can be executed within the timeline," stated the complaint.Police had said that "legal action" in the matter was taken although no case was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-trade-charges-over-chandni-chowk-hanuman-temple-101614013933729.html

22-02-2021||Noida||Ahead of ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’, AAP leader slams farm laws||Ghaziabad: Terming the Centre’s new farm laws a ‘death warrant’ for farmers, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh on Monday said that the party will try to put pressure on the government for rollback of the three legislations during the proposed ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Meerut on February 28 which is to be addressed by Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal.Singh, who was in Ghaziabad to review the preparations ahead of the Mahapanchayat, also slammed the state budget rolled out by the Uttar Pradesh government.“They (the Centre) have made three new farm laws which are like a ‘death warrant’ for farmers. Like they put up barbed wires at the borders, farmers and people will also put the same during the upcoming panchayat elections in UP. The way farmers’ agitation is growing, the Bharatiya Janata Party must contest panchayat election on its symbol and people will teach them a lesson,” Singh said.The UP government on Monday in its first paperless budget for 2021-22 proposed no new taxes despite high deficit and promised to please-all by “empowering different sections” by “self-reliance, integrated and inclusive development” ahead of 2022 assembly elections in the state.“There is no farsightedness seen on part of the UP government in the budget related to education, healthcare and employment. The UP chief minister is not concerned with law and order, employment, education, healthcare, mid-day meal, and is roaming in Kerala, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. He should look at his state first,” Singh told reporters.He termed the budget “rhetoric”. “The budget is rhetoric. They have done nothing for four years. The Prime Minister says that income of farmers will be doubled. The prices of diesel have increased. How will the income be doubled?” he added.The BJP’s UP unit, however, rubbished claims made by Singh and said that the farmers stand with the Prime Minister and the budget of the UP government is aimed to promote all round development.“The budget will be a milestone considering the effects of pandemic situation. It proposed employment, roads, water and other facilities to people and even projected the state towards the $1 trillion economy. AAP has no base in UP. They are just trying to create instability in UP before the elections, but people show them mirror each time. So, their allegations should not be taken seriously,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and secretary of BJP’s UP unit.The Kejriwal-led party is trying to make inroads into UP. However, performance of its candidates has not been very encouraging during past elections. In 2014 general elections, former AAP member Shazia Ilmi (now with the BJP) had lost deposit in Ghaziabad. In 2019 polls, AAP did not field any candidate from Ghaziabad but offered unconditional support to Samajwadi Party candidate. In 2017 local body polls, AAP candidate Dr Pragati Tyagi also lost deposit. In December last year, Kejriwal had said that the party shall contest the 2022 assembly elections in UP.(With budget inputs from HTC, Lucknow)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ahead-of-kisan-mahapanchayat-aap-leader-slams-farm-laws-101614012747492.html

The motorbike is registered in Satara.The deceased was working as a medical representative at a private company in Wagholi.“We are yet to ascertain where he (the deceased) was heading, but he was going in the direction of Vimanagar. He was living in Bavdhan and working in Wagholi. We are in the process of registering a case against the bus driver under the relevant sections. The passengers escaped unscathed,” said assistant police inspector Rahul Patil of Vimantal police station who is investigating the case.“The bus was a CNG vehicle from Kothrud depot and was running on the Warje-Wagholi route. The two-wheeler overtook one car and another bus that was heading towards Pune on the correct side of the road and then entered the wrong side of the diversion; therefore he was already riding in high speed. He rammed into the right front side of the bus and as the petrol tank of his bike was damaged, it spilled petrol on the bumper,” said SR Pasulkar, depot manager, accident department of PMPML head office.“The silencer in a CNG bus is located in the front and is always heated. Moreover, CNG catches fire when in close vicinity of petrol. Therefore, from my experience of 14 years, I suspect that the spillage of petrol from the bike fuel tank led to the combustion,” he said.“We have an official from the accident department who conducted a punchnama on the bus who might be able to identify the cause,” he said.A case under Sections 279, 427, and 304(a) of the Indian Penal Code along with 184, 119/177 of Motor Vehicle Act was in the process of getting registered at Vimantal police station against Majire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/narrow-escape-for-passengers-as-pmpml-bus-catches-fire-after-accident-with-twowheeler-101614012147364.html
22-02-2021||Bangalore||Covid-19 protocols: Karnataka closes borders with Kerala again||With the Karnataka government reinstating stricter control of transit passengers from Kerala in view of increasing Covid-19 positive cases, people bound to Mangaluru and other parts of Dakshina Kannada from here for various purposes, including medical needs and studies, are in a fix again. Long queues of vehicles could be seen in the border areas since morning as Karnataka authorities sealed many roads, including national highways and restricted entry only for those with Covid-19 negative certificates. The Dakshina Kannada authorities sealed all borders from Monda, except four to cross over, sources said. According to Karnataka officials at the borders,those who wish to enter the state have to produce Covid-19 negative certificate through an RT-PCR test taken 72 hours prior to their cross over time. Health and police personnel are on duty at the four borders, viz.Talapady in Mangalore taluk, Saradka in Bantwal, Nettanige-Mudnuru in Puttur taluk and Jalsoor in Sullia, to verify and allow people's entry into Karnataka. Meanwhile, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the issue would be brought to the notice of the Centre. "Karnataka's move closing the border roads and blocking vehicles is against the central government's guidelines that no state should impose any restriction on the inter-state travel," he said. Speaking at the Covid-19 review meeting at Thiruvananthapuram, he also said state DGP Loknath Behera had already brought the matter to the notice of his counterpart in Karnataka, who assured that vehicles carrying essential commodities would be exempted from the restrictions. The state government would continue to be in touch with the Karnataka authorities to resolve the issue completely, he added. The residents in and around Kasaragod, the northernmost district of Kerala, have been thronging Mangaluru in Karnataka for decades for treatment at the specialty hospitals there. While Mangaluru is just about 10 to 50 kms fro anywhere from Kasaragod, the nearest available facility is in Kannur, which is as far as 100 km. People in and around Kasaragod had struggled a lot during the initial days of the lockdown when authorities in Karnataka restricted movement of people into their territory. Strict guidelines on producing medical certificates to get an entry for critically ill-patients had also turned out to be a nightmare for follow-up treatments during those days. There were instances of patients dying as the authorities disallowed their entry, even for critical medical care. However, the intervention of the Supreme Court had facilitated permission to critically ill patients to cross over to Mangaluru for treatment. Now the plight of the poor, but critical patients from the district is pathetic as they need to undergo a ₹1,700 RT-PCR test to enable entry into Mangaluru for follow-up treatment, local people complained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/covid19-protocols-karnataka-closes-borders-with-kerala-again-101614009961539.html

22-02-2021||Kolkata||'Mamata Banerjee’s white saree, slippers a façade': MP minister Narottam Mishra||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday questioned Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s integrity and image for the first time in the run-up to the crucial assembly polls as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned her nephew and Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee’s sister-in-law. The agency is all geared up to pay a visit to this wife in connection with the multi-crore coal scam.“The masses will scare her (Banerjee) now for her involvement in the coal scam. Everything is getting exposed. She used to put up a façade with her Hawaii slippers, white saree, plain living and high thinking. Everything is peeling off like the skins of an onion,” said Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra who is touring the eastern state to boost the ongoing campaign. Bengal polls will be held in March-April.The political temperature in Bengal is on the rise since Sunday afternoon when the CBI sent a team to Abhishek Banerjee’s south Kolkata residence and left a notice seeking time to question his wife Rujira Banerjee nee Naroola as a witness under Section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC). On Monday afternoon, five CBI officers questioned her sister, Menka Gambhir, for three hours in her apartment at a posh south Kolkata residential complex.Agency officials said on condition of anonymity that they are probing overseas bank transactions. The family of Rujira Banerjee is based in Thailand.Also read: Rahul Gandhi explains how 3 farm laws will hurt agriculture sectorMishra made the comments before the media while reacting to Mamata Banerjee’s speech at a cultural event held in Kolkata on the occasion of International Mother Language Day on Sunday.“Threats of jail sentence cannot scare us. We have stood before guns in the past. We won’t be scared of fighting rats. I will not surrender as long as I am alive. You cannot break our spine. A tiger cub is not scared of cats and rats,” Banerjee had said.“In a democracy, it is the people who decide who is a tiger and who is a rat. If their conscience is clear why are their associates on the run? Why don’t they come clean?” Mishra said on Monday.The BJP leader from MP was indirectly referring to the CBI naming Vinay Mishra, a businessman and general secretary of the youth front of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), of which Abhishek Banerjee is the president, as one of the prime suspects in the coal smuggling scam along with Anup Majhi alias Lala, a businessman whose offices have been raided and sealed. Both have been declared absconders by the CBI.BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari alleged in a tweet on Sunday that Gambhir "and related parties" were "favoured" by the government while placing orders for bicycles that are given free to school students. To counter the TMC's 'Duare Sarkar' (government at the doorstep) outreach programme, the BJP started a hashtag campaign, naming it 'Duare CBI' (CBI at the doorstep).It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. The sale proceeds were allegedly routed through numerous shell companies that the CBI, the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate are probing.The TMC launched a counter-attack on the MP home minister and called him “communal” and “tainted.”No state or central leader of the BJP earlier attacked the Bengal chief minister’s integrity although they did not spare her nephew.While attending a media conclave in Kolkata last week Union home minister Amit Shah said, “I do not think Mamata Banerjee is an overhyped leader. She is a big leader and has been the chief minister twice. But she has failed and people have realized that. I do not nullify her political ideology.”TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy made a counter-attack on Mishra.“I condemn Mishra with all the vehemence in my command. He is a communal leader from MP. He engineered defections from the Congress. Nobody knows his name in Bengal. He is a tainted BJP leader,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-s-white-saree-slippers-a-fa-ade-mp-minister-narottam-mishra-101614005043348.html

Pune city has reported the least number of FLWs who have been vaccinated, from among the three local authorities, which include PCMC and Pune rural. As per data from the district health office, until February 21, only five per cent or 2,895 of the 57,264 registered FLWs have been vaccinated. In PCMC this number stands at 34% of the 12,000 beneficiaries, which is 4,048. Pune rural has recorded 71% of the 14,890 registered FLWs being vaccinated. While there are 100 departments that have registered over 57,000 FLWs in Pune city, the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) alone has 40,000 FLWs, of which only 4,000 have been vaccinated so far.In terms of health care workers (HCW) too, the city lags behind with only 54% of the registered 56,000 beneficiaries having been vaccinated. In PCMC, 67% of the 17, 636 beneficiaries have been vaccinated and 75% of the 32,815 beneficiaries have got the jab in rural Pune. The district’s average stands at 63% for HCWs and 21% for FLWs who have been vaccinated, of those that have registered. Despite having more session sites than PCMC (eight), Pune city (29) has not been able to vaccinate as much.A senior official from the PMC health department said, “We are now writing letters to all HODs within the PMC and also various other agencies who have registered FLWs, to encourage them to take up the vaccination. We have allowed walk-in vaccinations at our session sites, but most of the registered FLWs are unaware.”PMC has 42,000 registered FLWs of which most are from ward offices; 1,500 from the education department; and 1,700 from the security department.“Till now we have vaccinated just about 4,000 of our own employees,” the official said. The low turnout in vaccination could be because of lack of confidence among FLWs said divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, on Sunday during a press meet. Rao said, “The vaccination percentage has been low in the city, especially among frontline workers and so we are creating awareness through daily video conferencing and also through media. Also, we have got complaints from private health care workers that many names are missing and there are technical problems with the CoWin app. We will start with the re-enrolment process soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-five-per-cent-or-2-895-of-the-57-264-registered-flws-vaccinated-in-pmc-101614004706422.html

Raje could not attend the first meeting of the committee in January, which led to speculations about her differences with the state leadership.Factionalism within Rajasthan BJP has become more evident recently with MLAs considered close to Raje writing to state party chief Satish Poonia, complaining of being ignored in the state assembly. Earlier, her supporters held a meeting in the name of a ‘chintan baithak’ in Kota city and pitched for her to be the chief ministerial candidate in the next assembly polls.Party sources said that in the national executive meeting, BJP national president JP Nadda asked leaders to set things right in the state, especially ahead of the by-polls.“The leadership is well aware of the political differences, sentiments of MLAs and party workers, and unwarranted developments that are affecting the party’s image,” a senior BJP leader familiar with the developments said on the condition of anonymity.Also read: India extends $100 mn line of credit for defence equipment to Mauritius“The core committee meeting will not only discuss the observers’ panels for the upcoming by-polls on four assembly constituencies but also the MLAs’ complaint of being neglected in the House and unwarranted statements by leaders that encourage factionalism.”Senior BJP MLA Rajendra Rathore said, “There is no factionalism in the BJP; we have only one leader, Narendra Modi.”On the MLAs’ complaint to Poonia, he said, “It’s the state party chief who can make any comments after looking into the issue. But what happened is not as per the culture of the BJP. I have no reservation in saying that the leader of opposition and I have always encouraged those who wish to speak in the assembly. We have even made arrangements for providing content to members on related subjects. I don’t know why this issue was raised.”Rathore said the letter written by the MLAs will be discussed at the core committee meeting. “I am surprised by the news. None of the MLAs raised the issue in the legislature party meeting, and around 80 per cent of the MLAs named in the news have spoken in one or other way,” he said.“We will speak to the MLAs and resolve the issue. Over 46 MLAs spoke in the assembly on the Governor’s speech.”The core committee meeting will be chaired by state party chief Poonia and will include members like Raje, Union ministers Gajendra Singh, Kailash Choudhary and Arjun Ram Meghwal, MP Om Mathur, leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, deputy LoP Rajendra Rathore, CP Joshi, Kanakmal Katara, national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, secretary Alka Gujjar, state in-charge Arun Singh and co-in-charge Bharti Ben.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/raje-to-attend-bjp-s-core-committee-meeting-on-tuesday-101614003104327.html

22-02-2021||Bangalore||Covid-19: No restrictions on inter-state travel, says Karnataka govt||The Karnataka government on Monday clarified that it had not imposed any restrictions on inter-state travel, but has mandated RT-PCR certificates not older than 72 hours for those arriving in the state from neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra.Health Minister K Sudhakar, while stating this, also cautioned people against negligence towards observing protocol and of stricter steps if the number of cases increase and said marshals would be deployed to monitor weddings as they were taking place without following any norms or guidelines."We have not imposed any restrictions on passengers traveling from Kerala, Maharashtra or any other state to Karnataka.Let me clarify this, because other states may have got a wrong opinion....For inter-state travelers there is no restriction," Sudhakar said.Speaking to reporters here, he said Karnataka has made it mandatory for people arriving in the state to have a negative RT-PCR certificate that is not older than 72 hours.This measure was taken last week for those arriving by flights, buses, trains, personal transport from neighboring Maharashtra and Kerala, following the recent spike in Covid cases in those states.To a question on people staging protests at the Kerala borders demanding withdrawal of "restrictions", Sudhakar said no restrictions had been imposed, but checking negative test reports could have caused some inconvenience to travelers."According to Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner, there is movement of about 2-3 lakh people between both states every day.If test reports of such a large number of people has to be done, it definitely causes inconvenience, so we may not be able to do it 100 per cent, but we are trying random at least," he said.Sudhakar also said he would speak to the Health Ministers of Kerala and Maharashtra in a couple of days and request them to issue strict circulars to travelers in their states."Many people travelling from those states don't have information. We have issued a circular in our state. But if circulars are issued in those states also, it will benefit both," the minister said.He noted that events, fairs, marriages and agitations with large crowds were being held despite repeated appeals by the government, all of which were against the guidelines issued by the Covid technical advisory committee."Civic sense and responsibility is also important. If we don't understand it, in the days to come, if the cases increase, you (people) will be responsible for forcing the government to take strict measures.At a few places in Maharashtra there is lockdown...you decide if such a situation has to come in Karnataka," he said.The Minister said marshals would be deputed at weddings to ensure that not more than 500 people gather at the events, wear masks and maintain social distancing.Further, if five people in a place test positive, the area would be designated as a containment zone, he said, adding there is already a circular in this regard.Stating that more than 4.24 lakh health department employees and 1.20 lakh front line warriors have been administered the first dose of Covid vaccine,Sudhakar said the government was cleaning up registration data by eliminating duplicate entries."We have a target of 80 per cent and 90 per cent coverage for Health department staff and front line warriors respectively by the end of this month.All officials have been requested to get the dose."

The demand for bird nets has increased in the city since last 15 days, according to traders. “Though bird nets of various materials are available with us, many customers demand copper nets as it is stronger than nylon,” said Ganesh Jadhav, Alankar Hardware, Sadashiv peth. Although no avian flu virus has been detected in pigeons, residents do not want to take risk and are placing nets to get rid of the bird menace while ensuring no harm to them. “Whenever there are reports of bird flu cases in the country, people become extra cautious and put up nets as a preventive measure. Some customers are also going for double layer of net cover. However, there has been no rise in price of nets. We are keeping more varieties as residents visit our shop after checking options on the internet,” said Vishal Deshmukh, Deshmukh hardware, Raviwar peth. “While bird flu threat is looming since last one month, pigeons can be seen at every nook and corner of the city. The bird’s feathers can cause Histoplasmosis that affects lungs and other organs. Its dropping carries Salmonella bacteria that causes food poisoning, diarrhoea and fever. Its faeces could cause asthma and allergy issues. Though bird protection nets give a shabby look to the housing society, public health should be priority,” said Suhas Patwardhan, a resident of Success Towers, Panchwati, Pashan. Patwardhan is also chairman of Pune District Co-operative Housing Federation. “Many in our society used to feed pigeons. We told them how the bird could after our health. Now, we have covered our residential space with a copper net,” said Jiten Shah, resident of Balewadi High Street.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bird-flu-scare-leaves-housing-societies-in-pune-to-seek-net-protection-101614000085604.html

22-02-2021||Bangalore||Bharath Bopanna: I want to explore films which create an impact and inspire people||Being a TV star for four years is not an easy task but what drives Bharath Bopanna to the sets everyday is the love and response he gets from his audiences. “When I heard the story, I knew it would break barriers as the subject was unlike what we had seen earlier. I was excited to be a part of the show as it wasn’t a routine story. Working in a TV serial, it gets monotonous after a certain time but the audinces loved the show and my character a lot and that motivated me,” says the actor who stars in Brahmagantu, a remake of the Hindi TV show Badho Bahu, and is looking forward to crossing 1000 episodes soon. Having been a part of two other Kannada serials and a Telugu one as well since he started acting in 2016, Bopanna forayed into films with Kannada film, Demo Piece, last year. “I am blessed with good opportunities and now I am greedy for good films (laughs). Demo Piece was challenging as a subject and also as I had to balance my film and TV schedule. The college-goers loved the film as they connected with the subject, which is about staying away from vices. Going forward, I want to explore films which create an impact and inspire people. I want to play roles that become memorable,” he shares. While Kannada TV content revolves around family oriented subjects, he divulges that audiences also appreciate new concepts. Though he doesn’t watch Hindi TV shows often, Bopanna admits to being a fan of Kasautii Zindagii Kay. “I enjoyed the original version as the drama was quite engaging. Kannada TV too has been improving content every year. But with the lockdown, the industry found it difficult to cope for the first 5 months. There were re-runs of my shows and so many texted saying it feels like the show started yesterday (laughs). Now, things have recovered and shooting for many projects are on in full swing,” he says, adding that OTT platforms have been a boon. “The medium has been a huge advantage for many filmmakers who couldn’t release their films in theatres due to Covid. Delays impacted the industry and the producers but having a new avenue to release movies, has been wonderful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bharath-bopanna-i-want-to-explore-films-which-create-an-impact-and-inspire-people-101613997986964.html

The high definition cameras are attached to a microchip computer that uses artificial intelligence to assess crowds and alert with a pre-recorded message whenever it spots people not following the distancing or masking norms. As a result of the system, people are following the safety protocol with more caution, said the institute in a release on Monday.

22-02-2021||Bangalore||Yatnal, Kashappanavar exploiting Panchamasali agitation: K’taka ministers||Senior ministers of the Karnataka government on Monday hit out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal) and former legislator Vijayanand Kashappanavar for exploiting the ongoing Panchamasalis’ (a sub-sect of the Lingayat community) agitation for political gain.“The campaign is being used for selfish reasons by some people and this is something that we do not agree with,” CC Patil, a senior minister of the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government, said on Monday.“Some people have the seer (Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami) under their grip and are misusing the forum,” he added.They also said that Kashappanavar has declared himself the national president of the sub-sect without consulting anyone. “He should have named himself the international president of the Panchamasali,” Patil said, mocking the title.Also Read | Yatnal sets Yediyurappa new timeframe for 2A reservation for PanchamasaliPatil stormed off the stage on Sunday after Yatnal said that the ministers from the community should resign if the chief minister does not cede to their demands.The statements come even as the influential seers of the Panchamasali, one of the largest sub-sects under the Lingayats, have intensified their agitation and asked that the reservation change be announced before March 4 or before the start of the budget session.Yatnal, a staunch critic of the chief minister, has repeatedly targeted Yediyurappa and his family after being left out of the state cabinet.He has levelled charges of corruption, favouritism and even inability on the part of Yediyurappa and his family members that has added to the challenges of the dissent-hit government and its remaining two-year tenure.Yediyurappa has remained silent on the issue ever since he issued an order, directing the state’s backward classes commission to conduct a review of the Panchamasalis’ demands.Several dominant and politically influential communities in the state, including Vokkaligas, Valmiki and Kurubas among others, have also sought a change in reservation category or increase in allocations.Minister Murugesh Nirani said that there is a procedure to initiate such a request and the government required some time to act on the same.He also said that there are efforts to include all sub-sects within the Lingayat community into the 2A category and not just the Panchamasalis.Nirani said that Lingayats make up around 800,000 of the total 65 million population of the state and there are several smaller sects who have not been represented at all.There are at least 36 pending applications before the state’s backward classes commission, and change of reservation category, according to people directly involved in the process, takes time.“The good intent with which the campaign started did not end on the same note,” Patil said.Meanwhile the seers and their followers have been camping in Bengaluru and have demanded that the announcement be made at the earliest or that they will initiate a fast.“The main reason for the delay is that the chief minister did not take us seriously from the beginning,” Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami told reporters in Bengaluru.He said that the government should provide an exact timeframe of the process and the community leaders would take a call based on these assurances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yatnal-kashappanavar-exploiting-panchamasali-agitation-k-taka-ministers-101613988081080.html

They are not following protocols at public places," Kakani said.According to the BMC, it has already increased daily Covid-19 tests from around 15,000 earlier this month to over 22,000 now."Among the positive cases, the number of asymptomatic persons is more," Kakani said.The civic body is also trying to find out if the virus has mutated.Kakani said they have already sent 90 samples to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology to check for any mutation of the virus.It takes 10 to 15 days to get the report from the institute, he said.Since last week, the BMC has intensified action against those found without masks in public places, and started a crackdown on establishments like marriage halls, hotels and restaurants which are found violating the Covid-19 norms.The civic body has also filed police complaints against some establishments in the last few days, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/36-per-cent-rise-in-active-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-since-february-8-bmc-101613987499116.html
22-02-2021||Chandigarh||MC elections to be held on party symbol in Himachal||Amid growing demand, the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government in Himachal Pradesh will hold the municipal corporation elections in Mandi, Palampur, Solan and Dharamshala next month on party symbols. The state urban development ministry will move a proposal to amend the rules for the corporation elections. “We will move the proposal and now it depends on the parties,” state urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, who also holds the law portfolio, said. The government’s proposal to hold elections on party symbols comes a fortnight after the elections to panchayats, zila parishads, and block samitis. Though these elections were not held on the party symbol, the ruling BJP claimed victory as candidates it supported won, while Congress-backed nominees could get a majority in only two zila parishads of Shimla and Kullu. The opposition Congress accused the ruling party of misusing official machinery during the elections and charged it with horse trading after the zila parishad poll. The BJP top leadership, including JP Nadda, met office-bearers in Dharamshala during a three-day conclave to ponder over the strategy for the municipal corporation and 2022 assembly elections. A majority of attendees were for fighting the MC elections on the party symbol. Move will curb horse trading: Former Shimla mayor Former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal had experimented with holding MC elections in Shimla on the party symbol in 2012. The posts of mayor and deputy mayor were held on the party symbol. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) captured both posts with Sanjay Chauhan getting elected as the mayor and Tikender Panwar as his deputy. “We have always favoured elections to the MC on the party symbol. In Kerala too, the civic body elections are held on the party symbol,” says Chauhan. “ At least this will help curb horse trading after the elections,” he said. Kimi Sood, the councillor from ward number 17, who represents Bemore in Shimla, says she too favoured elections on the party symbol. “The councillors are associated with ideologies. These elections should certainly be held on party lines; it will rather strengthen them,” she said. MC elections to be announced during assembly session Congress leaders have been demanding direct elections for the posts of mayor and deputy mayor. “The government should bring amendments that enable direct elections to the posts of mayor and deputy mayor. Direct elections will stop horse trading. It will also permit the elected heads to work for the welfare without any undue pressure about their tenure,” says Gokul Butail, the AICC national joint secretary. The elections to the four municipal corporation is likely to be announced during the budget session of the Himachal Pradesh assembly that begins on February 26. The state election commission is already preparing the electoral rolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-elections-to-be-held-on-party-symbol-in-himachal-101613987180632.html

The state Budget for the year 2020-21 will be presented in the second half of the day’s session by deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad.The house proceedings started with CPI-ML members raising the issue of fuel price hike. They shouted slogans and trooped into the well of the house, where they sat in protest despite the speaker’s requests to allow the question hour, which had 82 listed questions.When the speaker tried to resume the question hour for the second time, leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav stood up raising the issue of Bihar board examination question leak. Earlier today, Tejashwi came to the assembly on a tractor in protest against fuel price hike but was stopped at the gate.“I had raised the issue of leak of social science question paper on Friday and today again there are reports of Hindi paper question leak. What is happening? The Bihar board claims to be following the CBSE pattern, but we never hear anything of this sort about the CBSE. It is a serious issue, as it affects students,” he said.The Speaker tried to impress upon members that the house was a platform for meaningful discussions and there was a time for raising all issues. “Out of 82 questions, online replies from concerned departments have been received for 77 and the members can raise important supplementary questions only if the house functions properly,” he said.The question hour continued with the CPI-ML members protesting in the well, though not much was audible. At one point, a BJP legislator got involved in an argument with the Tejashwi, when the latter started speaking on her behalf.Also Read: Patna minor with disability raped, govt promises compensation, rehabilitationBJP MLA Gayatri Devi raised the issue of lack of a police outpost in a panchayat of Sitamarhi district, where crime incidents were being reported.

22-02-2021||Bangalore||Congress attacks Yediyurappa, lays out red carpet for disgruntled BJP leaders||Congress has launched an offensive against Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who is battling internal and external dissent. While former chief minister Siddaramaiah raised issues of financial crunch, alleged unfulfilled electoral promises by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and donation collection for Ayodhya Ram Temple, Congress state chief DK Shivakumar said any disgruntled BJP leader was welcome to join the Congress.Siddaramaiah said if Yediyurappa wasn’t able to handle the state finances, he should quit in favour of someone who has the authority to do so. The Yediyurappa government was battling a shortage due to a reduction in revenue inflows from the centre. He has made several trips to Delhi seeking funds.To add to his woes, Yediyurappa is also facing heat from the Panchamasali sect of the powerful Lingayat community, which is demanding an increase in reservation. One seer at the Panchamasali reservation rally on Sunday said there were several other Lingayat political leaders in the state, questioning the 77-year-old leader’s status as their representative. Yediyurappa’s task has been complicated even more since Vokkaliga, Valmiki and Kurubas too are seeking a change in their reservation status.The state government is scheduled to address the media on the issue on Monday. Karnataka Congress president, D K Shivakumar said the party will make its stand on issues like reservation clear in the coming days and invited all disgruntled elements within the BJP to join the Congress. Sharath Bachegowda, the legislator from Hosakote and son of BJP's Chikkaballapur member of parliament, is scheduled to join the Congress party later this month.Also Read: New quota requests add to Karnataka's existing pileOpening up another front, Siddaramaiah had questioned the collection of donations for the construction of Ayodhya Ram Mandir.“We are also building a Ram Mandir in our village. Even we have faith in God. Our beliefs are our personal issues and should not be used as a political tool. It is unfortunate that @BJP4India leaders are using the Ram Mandir construction for their political benefits,” Siddaramaiah said on Saturday.K.S.Eshwarappa, senior BJP leader and cabinet minister on Sunday hit out at Siddaramaiah's remarks. "Who is he to ask for an account?," Eshwarappa asked.Another former chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H D Kumaraswamy, who has allied with the BJP in the upper house of the state legislature, has also questioned the collection of donations in the name of the temple. He alleged he had been threatened over donating for the cause.Siddaramiah also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging he had made false election promises."The synonym for lie is Narendra Modi. His speeches before elections and today's conditions are completely opposite of each other. People who chanted Modi, Modi have been duped. His true colours will be exposed by the Congress," he posted in Kannada on Twitter with a hashtag #BJPFailsIndia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-attacks-yediyurappa-lays-out-red-carpet-for-disgruntled-bjp-leaders-101613981026888.html
22-02-2021||Other||Monday Musings:3 years since DSK’s arrest... desperation grows among investors||PUNE Till five years ago, when Pune developer DS Kulkarni, a.k.a. DSK, used to share his life experiences on All India Radio’s (AIR) morning show, many used to see his anecdotes as aspiring tales worth emulating. As the developer completed three years in jail on February 17, with most of his family members also behind the bars, those invested in his schemes are losing patient.For these investors, if the arrest of the self-made billionaire, who is looking frail these days during the court proceedings, may have initially cheered hundreds of investors awaiting their hard-earned returns, the long and complicated legal process has only extended their wait. So, if the Yerawada prison has made life difficult for DS Kulkarni, the situation of many investors outside is equally bad, given the fact that most of them are senior citizens. So much so, a few investors have initiated the process of selling their fix deposits and non-convertible debentures (NCDs) at a price one-tenth of the actual value. The buyers are those willing to take the risk and gamble. These buyers with deep pockets can afford to wait till the case is resolved and investors get their money back after land holdings of DSK find buyers in the market. It was around 2015, when DS Kulkarni was at the peak of his business. The heydays in real estate prompted the ambitious businessman to launch one of the biggest projects of the DSK group -Dream City – on a land parcel at Phursungi. The same project, however, led to his downfall as he failed to repay the depositors’ money as demonetisation wiped out cash from the market. To finance the project, DSK started raising money through bank loans and deposits from citizens, who were promised higher interest rates as compared to the market. However, his arrest paused the development at Dream City and other real estate projects in Pune and parts of Maharashtra There are around 33,000 depositors identified with 6,792 complaints filed against DS Kulkarni in various parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, Mumbai and Kolhapur, according to the chargesheet filed against the real estate developer. The developer, as per the chargesheet, had raised ₹1,083 crore through unsecured loans from the banks and financial institutions, deposits and debentures. The probe also revealed a complex web of money flow and siphoning off large sums, as revealed in the supplementary chargesheet. In some of the schemes, brokers or middlemen lured investors to put in their money. The investors, however, have failed to provide the names of these middlemen, who have benefited from these investments given that they got the bulk of commissions.In the court, the case is currently at a stage where the prosecution is likely to frame charges against DSK and the family. It may take time before the actual trial begins, and the court disposes of the case. Till then, the investors can show a little more patience. DSK is not just one scheme where investors are awaiting justice. The Covid-induced lockdown was a double whammy for investors in the Shivajirao Bhosale bank case or Pancard club investment scheme, both currently being probed by police. The Pan Card Club, which began operations in 1997 collected ₹1,400 crore from depositors nationally. The investors are now awaiting their money back. The same goes with the Shivajirao Bhosale bank case, where police have arrested the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) member of the legislative council, Shivaji Bhosale, along with other bank officers, on charges of a ₹71 crore fraud and other financial misappropriations running into crores. The bank, with 12 branches and ₹430 crore deposits, across Pune district and 1.10 lakh account holders, was promoted by Bhosale. The woes of investors are unending. But, patience may be the key to some relief… if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-3-years-since-dsk-s-arrest-desperation-grows-among-investors-101613981120063.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Instead of taking Ram Temple donations, slash fuel prices: Shiv Sena to govt||Shiv Sena on Monday launched an attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government over the increasing fuel prices in the country. Slamming the BJP, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that instead of taking contributions for Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the government should bring down the skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel in the country.“The people have the right to live and it is the responsibility of the government to keep the prices of essential commodities under control. If the Central government has forgotten this then the public will remind them. Instead of seeking contributions for Ram Temple, bring down the skyrocketing fuel prices.

The banners have mentioned rates of petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders in 2014 and 2021.The editorial on Monday said, “The BJP should celebrate that petrol has crossed ₹100, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to give the credit to Congress. ‘Had the previous governments not been so energy import dependent our middle-class would not be burdened now,’ said Modi... The previous governments built Indian Oil, ONGC, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, Bombay High to look for oil reserves. Modi is now selling all these PSUs and blaming the previous governments.”There was no immediate response from the BJP.The Sena mouthpiece also commented on the issue of Bollywood stars maintaining silence over rising fuel prices.The editorial questioned why film stars Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar should be blamed for not speaking up on the rising prices since no one could dissent in the country any longer.“Before 2014, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan spoke about the rising fuel prices through social media. But now the celebrities are quiet even after petrol crossing ₹100. They are criticised by the Opposition now. They are quiet now because they have been made to sit quietly. This means that before 2014, there was the right to show dissent against the government. Today we have lost the right to show dissent. Why blame Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar?” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/instead-of-taking-donations-for-ram-temple-slash-fuel-prices-shiv-sena-to-govt-101613977462072.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Activist Varavara Rao, arrested in Bhima Koregaon case, gets interim bail for 6 months||Telugu poet and activist Varavara Rao, who is an accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, was granted interim bail for six months on medical grounds by Bombay High Court on Monday. The order came on a petition filed by the wife of 82-year-old Rao’s wife, P Hemlatha. The activist’s wife had cited Rao’s frail health and co-morbidities in her plea to the high court seeking temporary bail on medical grounds. She had pointed out that a previous Nanavati Hospital report said that Rao was fit to be discharged and could take care of himself. In January, Rao’s counsel submitted that shifting Rao to Sir JJ Hospital could result in a relapse, and hence the option was to either send him to Taloja jail or his house in Hyderabad. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who was appearing for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), however, had argued that there were many undertrials in Maharashtra who were suffering from various ailments and being given requisite medical care by the state while in prison. The court was also informed that the poet could meet his family in the prison ward and therefore his application for bail so that he can return to his Hyderabad home should be rejected.The court has asked Rao to stay in Mumbai, within the jurisdiction of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, during the bail period.On account of Rao’s ill health, the high court had, in November 2020, directed the state and NIA to shift Rao to Nanavati Hospital, a private super-speciality hospital in Mumbai, after he tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The poet is among over a dozen scholars and rights activists arrested for their alleged links with Maoists and for allegedly instigating violence at Bhima Koregaon near Pune in 2018.

Revised estimates may, however, bring the same close to or less than the size of 2020-21,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor at the department of economics, Lucknow University.However, mobilising resources will not be easy since revenue in the first few months of financial year 2020-21 declined considerably due to Covid-19, forcing an increase in VAT (Value Added Tax) on petrol and diesel and excise duty. This will be the last full-fledged budget before the 2022 assembly elections. Yogi Adityanath government had presented the largest-ever annual budget totalling ₹512,860.72 crore in 2020-21--an increase of 6.9% against the previous year. The size of the budget is likely to be close to ₹5.25 lakh crore or ₹5.50 lakh crore, if not more, said experts. Minister for finance Suresh Khanna, too, hinted at the budget’s size increasing this year despite challenges on the resource mobilisation front.Large allocations for infrastructure projects like the Ganga Expressway and the metro project is likely apart from other existing projects/schemes.“Announcements in the budget are political compulsions for any government. The state government should, however, follow the Union government and come out with a pre-budget economic survey and outcome budget to make the people aware of the impact of the budget on the state’s economy,” said Tyagi.The government is also likely to restore the Vidhayak Nidhi or the MLA LAD (local area development) funds that was suspended for one year as a slew of measures undertaken to mobilise resources to fight Covid-19.Although minister for finance Suresh Khanna recently parried a question in this regard, he may make an announcement in his budget speech.In another milestone, Uttar Pradesh will become the first state in the country following the example of the Union government to present a paperless budget.Also Read: UP sounds alert after Covid surge in other states, to monitor visitorsA sum of up to ₹50,000 was earmarked for every legislator to buy an iPad.

22-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Vidarbha reports highest number of Covid-19 cases||Amid a rise in Covid-19 cases, Vidarbha region is reporting the highest number of new infections in Maharashtra. It recorded 2,527 cases on Sunday, 36.25% of the total new cases in the state reported on that day.On Sunday, the state recorded 6,971 cases, its highest one-day spike in the last 121 days since October 23, when the state clocked 7,347 cases. The state’s Covid-19 case tally has reached 2,100,884.Vidarbha has surpassed Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which reported the highest number of cases for most of the time during the pandemic. On Sunday, MMR clocked 1,678 cases and Mumbai recorded 921 cases.Amravati in Vidarbha region is also reporting the highest number of cases across the state. On Sunday, Amravati (both district and city) reported 926 cases, while on Saturday, 1,055 cases were reported in the district. Also Read | Will review the need for fresh lockdown after 8 days: UddhavThe spike has led to a week-long lockdown in Amravati city to arrest the spread of the infection. “Amravati city will be placed under lockdown for a week starting Monday, 8pm,” guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said on Sunday. Only essential services will be allowed to function during the lockdown. This will be the first lockdown after the state initiated “Mission Begin Again” or unlocking activities. A few other districts in Vidarbha and other parts of the state such as Akola, Yavatmal, Pune, Nashik, Parbhani have imposed other curbs, including night curfew, weekend lockdown, closure of schools and colleges and started penalising people and establishments for not following Covid-19 protocol.“The rise in cases is worrying as daily cases have doubled only in a few days. On February 11, 3,297 cases were reported in the state; the number rose to 6,971, more than double, on Sunday. Moreover, the daily cases are constantly rising and we require strict decisions to bring the situation back under control,” said a senior health official.On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray issued an ultimatum to people, warning them of a lockdown if Covid-19 protocol was not followed properly. “It all depends on you, whether you want a lockdown or you are ready to follow the norms to avoid it. The lockdown this time will be more difficult to follow. It will be known only after a week or two if we are facing the second wave of pandemic,” he said. He also announced a ban on social, religious, political gatherings and protests for the next few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vidarbha-reports-highest-number-of-covid-19-cases-101613969960080.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC to hear Sherlyn Chopra’s pre-arrest bail plea today||The Bombay high court is likely to hear the anticipatory bail application of actor Sherlyn Chopra on Monday. The actor had moved the application after the sessions court had rejected a similar application on February 8. The actor was booked by the Cyber Crime cell of the Mumbai Police on November 6 under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 67 and 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2008 and Section 3 and 4 of the Indecent Representation of Women (Protection) Act, 1986. The complaint was lodged after obscene videos of the actor were found on free-to-view sites on the Internet. Also Read | Presumptions under Pocso Act can only be rebutted at trial: Bombay HCThe actor’s application, filed through advocate Charanjeet Chanderpal, claimed that she is a victim and the said videos were pirated and uploaded on free-to-view sites by someone else without her permission. When the application came up for hearing before the bench of justice PD Naik on February 18, Chanderpal informed the court that the alleged obscene content found on free-to-view sites was created by a UK-based company of which Chopra is a director. He added that the content created by the company was paid content but someone had pirated it and uploaded the same on the Internet without the consent of his client. In light of these submissions and the fact that actor could not be present for interrogation due to personal reasons when she was called by the police in November last year, Chopra sought protection from arrest as she was willing to cooperate with the investigation. On February 18, after the cyber cell gave an oral assurance that it would not take any coercive action against the actor till her application was heard the court posted the hearing for February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-sherlyn-chopra-s-pre-arrest-bail-plea-today-101613968939879.html

22-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi air quality in poor category, significant improvement unlikely||Delhi’s air quality remained in the poor category with an air quality index of 288 on Monday, according to Sameer app of Central Pollution Control Board. An AQI of 301 to 400 puts the air quality in very poor category. AQI is likely to hover in “poor” to “very poor” category over Delhi and other parts of northwest India due to calm winds in the evening, which slow down dispersal of pollutants. “Wind speed during the day was around 10kmph but in the evening, it will be mostly calm. This is why we are not seeing any improvement in air quality. We are unlikely to record any significant improvement in the coming days either,” said VK Soni, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s air quality division. Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Meerut also recorded “very poor” air quality on Monday. “As February is coming to an end we are expecting a rise in both maximum and minimum temperatures. Maximum temperature is likely to be 30 to 31 degrees Celsius while minimum is likely to be 12 to 13 degrees Celsius in the next three or four days. A western disturbance is impacting the Western Himalayan region. Once that moves away, there will be a marginal and brief drop in temperatures in the Capital as cold northwesterly winds will be blowing, but otherwise its likely to get warmer now,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. Also Read | Foggy February: Experts explore reasons behind ‘unusual’ weather phenomenonOn Monday , Delhi’s maximum temperature was 28.9 degrees Celsius, 4 degrees above normal and minimum temperature was 11 degrees Celsius, 0 degrees above normal. Under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, widespread rainfall or snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad; scattered rainfall/snowfall is likely over Himachal Pradesh for next 3 days and fairly widespread rainfall for the subsequent 2 days while scattered rainfall or snowfall is also likely over Uttarakhand during next 5 days. Thunderstorm or lighting is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad during next 5 days and over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during February 23 to 26. Isolated hailstorm is likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad on February 24 and 25; Himachal Pradesh on February 25 and 26 and over Uttarakhand during February 23 to 26. Air quality early warning system for Delhi under the ministry of earth sciences had forecast that air quality is likely to be in very poor category on Monday and Tuesday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from west of Delhi with wind speed 05-15 kmph, mainly clear sky and mist or shallow fog in the morning on February 23.Meanwhile, IMD said dense to very dense fog was observed in isolated pockets over Delhi, and the visibility remained 500 metres in most parts of the city.On Sunday too, the AQI was recorded in poor category at 295. The average air quality was recorded in the poor category across Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon as well, according to data issued by a government agency on Sunday. According to CPCB’s Sameer app, AQI was 260 in Ghaziabad, 300 in Greater Noida, 251 in Noida, 264 in Faridabad and 297 in Gurugram.

22-02-2021||Bangalore||New quota requests add to Karnataka's existing pile||At least 36 caste groups in Karnataka await their turn for a change in reservation status and category as well as corrections in spellings, among other requests, before the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission, people aware of the developments said.Some of these requests are at least 5-10 years old, highlighting the slow process and time taken for any changes related to caste groups in a state -- and the country -- where these communities are an integral part of electoral politics.The pending applications indicate that fresh demands by at least four large communities in Karnataka -- Panchamasali, Kuruba, Vokkaliga and Valmiki -- over the last couple of weeks for better reservation categories and higher allocations, among other reasons, will have to wait their turn.“The new requests (for change in reservation category) will take a long time as it involves carrying out studies on communities who are not concentrated in just one region but are spread out across the state,” said one person directly aware of the developments.“This report is then given to the state government for further action,” the person cited above said, requesting not to be named.The backward classes commission often resorts to seeking help from students at universities to collect data to make up for the shortage of personnel. The department has also continued with the services of retired officials who know the intricacies and complexities of reviewing caste categories and allocations, said the person.While pressure to announce higher reservations, opportunities pile up on chief minister BS Yediyurappa, the list of demands from other caste groups continues to increase.With elections just two years away, Yediyurappa has been making promises of increasing allocations and changing reservation categories to help consolidate groups that have traditionally backed the saffron party and those who are seen to side with the opposition parties to better its chances of returning to power in 2023.According to political analysts, the increasing number of caste groups demanding changes makes it easier for Yediyurappa to reorganise the structure by moving everyone one step forward and not seen to be favouring any one of them.“He may welcome the chance to renegotiate the caste representation. The resistance will come from backward castes who have to part with a portion from their existing quota (with a bigger community who may be moved up in category or allocations),” Narendar Pani, political analyst and faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), said.This resistance was capitalised by Siddaramaiah of the Congress who mobilised the AHINDA (Kannada acronym for Dalits, backward classes and minorities) and stormed to power with an absolute majority in the 2013 elections.Though caste plays an important role in politics across the country, Karnataka takes it to a whole new level where each group has identified itself with the major parties in the state.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enjoys the backing of the dominant Lingayats, while Dalits, communities that come under other backward classes and minorities back the Congress.Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and his JD(S) rely heavily on the Vokkaliga’s, another dominant and politically influential community found largely in the Old Mysuru region.In the hope of consolidating existing caste-based support, Yediyurappa has constituted a Brahmin board and administrative entities for Maratha and Lingayat communities in the state as well.The saffron party does not yet have a credible replacement for the 77-year-old Yediyurappa, who has taken it upon himself to bring the party back to power with a majority on its own in 2023. To get a majority on their own, the BJP has to look beyond the existing support groups.Also Read: Yatnal sets Yediyurappa new timeframe for 2A reservation for PanchamasaliPolitical analysts say that Siddaramaiah, a member of the Kuruba community, tried to challenge the existing dominant caste theory in the state after his rise to power as the chief minister with the backing of AHINDA.His plan, however, to get the support of the Lingayats backfired when he, on the advice of some of his ministers, mooted to accord the community the status of a separate religion just before the 2018 assembly elections.His proposal to distinguish between Veerashaivas and Lingayats cost him dearly in the 2018 elections and forced Congress to strike a coalition with its arch-rivals, the JD(S), to keep the BJP at bay.A Social and Educational Survey-2015 or better known as caste census, commissioned by a Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015, the first anywhere in the country since 1931, is yet to be officially released.Though the leaked findings bring down the percentage of Lingayats and Vokkaliga, who were believed to account for around 17% and 14%, respectively to under 10%.The renewed demands by the Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, has now diluted the earlier consolidation and political demarcation, analysts say.Influential seers of the Panchamasali sect have renewed their demand to be categorised under 2A from 3B category, experts on caste say.“This is nothing but an attempt to scuttle the earlier unity and they have succeeded,” an expert on caste said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue.The Kuruba community’s demand to be included in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category is an attempt by the BJP to mobilise a community that has so far firmly backed its tallest leader, Siddaramaiah.The Valmiki, already classified as ST, have demanded an increase in allocation from 3.5% to 7.5%.Yediyurappa has assured to “look into” all three requests as seers and pontiffs at influential Mathas (or monasteries) have the ability to swing votes in their respective strongholds.All three campaigns have senior and prominent BJP leaders, including ministers, leading from the front.Analysts say that if the Centre backs Yediyurappa, and does consider requests for better reservation opportunities, it would make more room for upper castes in the state.If the Centre does move the politically-influential Kuruba community into ST category, then it would free up space to move the Lingayats and Vokkaligas a step higher, Pani said. “This also frees up quotas for upper castes who will now have more opportunities and play into the BJP’s narrative,” Pani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/new-quota-requests-add-to-karnataka-s-existing-pile-101613965828340.html
22-02-2021||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah targets PM Modi and Yediyurappa over ‘unfulfilled’ promises||Former Karnataka chief minister and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Sunday lashed out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state and central governments over unfulfilled promises to the people.“The synonym for lie is Narendra Modi. His speeches before elections and today’s conditions are completely opposite of each other. People who chanted Modi, Modi have been duped. His true colours will be exposed by the Congress,” he posted in Kannada on Twitter with hashtag #BJPFailsIndia.Siddaramaiah also targeted chief minister BS Yediyurappa, stating that if the latter could not handle the state finances, why was he still in power. He added that Yediyurappa should step down and allow those who have the power to continue.Also Read: Narendra Modi’s new political narrativeThe Congress, the principal opposition in Karnataka, has upped the ante against the BJP whose government has been rattled by dissent and shortage of funds due to the reduction of revenue inflows from the Centre. Yediyurappa has found himself seemingly isolated within his own government and party, leaving himself more vulnerable to opposition attacks.Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said the party will take decisions to corner the government and make its stand clear on issues like reservation in the coming days.Siddaramaiah has also attacked the donations collected for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and sought details of the collections.“We are also building a Ram Mandir in our village. Even we have faith in God. Our beliefs are our personal issues and should not be used as a political tool. It is unfortunate that @BJP4India leaders are using the Ram Mandir construction for their political benefits,” Siddaramaiah had said on Saturday.KS Eshwarappa, senior BJP leader and cabinet minister, on Sunday lashed out at Siddaramaiah’s remarks. “Who is he to ask for an account?” he asked.Former chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy, who has allied with the BJP in the upper house of the state legislature, has also questioned donations being collected by people in the name of the temple. He even said that people had threatened him over donating for the cause.Yediyurappa is facing challenges not just from the opposition or his own government but also from communities that have traditionally backed him throughout his political career.Shivakumar also invited all disgruntled elements within the BJP to join the Congress.Sharath Bachegowda, the legislator from Hosakote and son of BJP MP from Chikkaballapur, is scheduled to join the Congress later this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/siddaramaiah-targets-pm-modi-and-yediyurappa-over-unfulfilled-promises-101613965209384.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Fuel price hike: Shiv Sena puts up 'yahi hai acche din?' banners at petrol pumps||Two days after petrol price touched an all-time high of ₹97 in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena’s youth wing on Monday put up banners at several petrol pumps in the city targeting the Centre over the rising fuel prices. Taking a swipe at the BJP government, whose slogan during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was 'Acche Din Aane Wale Hain' (good days are about to come), Yuva Sena hung hoardings at petrol pumps and roadside in Bandra West. The hoardings asked ‘Yahi Hain Acche Din?’ (are these the good days?). The remark was followed by a comparison of fuel prices in 2015 and 2021, according to which the price of gas, diesel and petrol ranged between ₹50- ₹65 in the former year and corresponding prices are nearing or have already ₹90 mark in the latter. On Monday, petrol was selling at ₹97 per litre in Mumbai while diesel cost ₹88.06 per litre. Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that India has urged the Opec (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) to ease the production cuts as they were hurting the consumers in the economy, which has just begun to revive after the coronavirus pandemic. "There are two main reasons for the fuel price rise. The international market has reduced fuel production and manufacturing countries are producing less fuel to gain more profit. This is making the consumer countries suffer," the minister said.The opposition has been slamming the government for soaring fuel prices triggered by production cuts by global oil producers. On Sunday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi expressed her “anguish and deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel and gas prices”.Earlier this month, key functionaries of the ruling Shiv Sena led protests in Mumbai as part of a state-wide campaign against the rising fuel and cooking gas prices. The party has warned it would intensify the protests if the Centre does not take steps to reduce the prices. “The Union government has been looting the common man for months by increasing the fuel prices... This has to stop. Shiv Sena will intensify protests if the Centre does not arrest the price rise,” Sena leader Ashish Chemburkar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/yahi-hai-acche-din-sena-s-banners-at-mumbai-petrol-pumps-amid-fuel-price-hike-101613965012168.html
22-02-2021||Bangalore||Dark web, drugs and bitcoins send Bengaluru police into a tizzy||How do you seize a Bitcoin? This was one of the several questions that puzzled Bengaluru Police while probing a hacker caught for purchasing drugs from the dark web using bitcoins in November last year. The case was among the 30 registered by the cops over the past year, wherein synthetic drugs and other contrabands were procured from the dark web.Taking note of the surge in cases, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai last week had directed the police to focus more on crimes originating from the dark web. With the anonymity and complexity of the dark web providing a safety net for criminals, police are now forced to improvise on their conventional investigation methods to tackle the new challenge.The dark web is a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by search engines like Google. From synthetic drugs to stolen credit cards and details of weapons, users can buy from a large inventory of contrabands from this part of the internet, without any government surveillance.“The key here is anonymity. To access the dark web, the user has to use a browser which hides the identity and location of the user,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said. This further makes it difficult to monitor the procurement of synthetic drugs from the dark web.Also Read: Bitcoin hits $1 trillion market cap, soars to a record high“We have found that many criminals have procured synthetic drugs from abroad, especially Scandinavian countries. First, we cannot track who is purchasing what from the dark web. Second, it is hard to track them when they arrive in India. To give an example, in the case of LSD, also known as acid, it is a sheet of paper. When the order arrives at an airport in India, it becomes difficult to find it among other larger consignments,” the officer added.On November 18, while interrogating eight men who were arrested for possessing hydro marijuana, police learnt that a man had helped the gang procure the drug from Amsterdam. The arrest of Srikrishna (25), who procured these drugs via the dark web, opened the pandora’s box.The accused confessed that he had hacked three three Bitcoin exchanges and 10 poker sites among others to procure the drugs. Bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were seized from him.Unlike normal money, the officer explained, seizing the bitcoins proved to be a difficult task.“There is no physical money, unlike other recoveries. This is a cryptocurrency that exists on the web. In this case, the police opened an account and asked the accused to transfer his bitcoins to this account. This is how we found a way around seizing cryptocurrency,” an official familiar with the probe said.Besides this, Srikrishna, police said, would hack into people and their companies’ WiFi accounts and mirror those devices to steal credit card details among other data. In some cases, he used to resort to online extortion, where he would hack into the internal network of companies and demand ransom for not releasing the data on the dark web.“He has sold credit cards details and much more on the dark web. We learnt a lot about the marketplaces in the dark web during this time and that there could be much more than drugs that can be obtained from the dark web,” the official added.Police say the investigation into this new era of crime carries new challenges. Unlike other crimes, where police could survey locations or trace suspects, it is difficult to track the dark web.“We can’t get into the details of how we are adapting to the new challenges but we are improvising on our investigation. For example, we are keeping an eye on consignments from certain countries with the help of customs,” an official from the cyber division said, preferring anonymity. However, the biggest challenge for them is expected to be the prosecution. According to police, communicating the nuances of such cyber-crimes would be hard. “In most of the cases, we have to argue hard to deny the suspect bail as the evidence against them are on the internet and they could easily destroy them. Making a strong case explaining the functioning of the dark web is also a challenge,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dark-web-drugs-and-bitcoins-send-bengaluru-police-into-a-tizzy-101613964407423.html

22-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Straight out of a fairy tale||All sorts of colours and curiosities spring up along the street, with shoppers and sellers engaging in a most comely harmony. This has to be Delhi’s dreamiest and most eclectic pavement market. When so many visitors come to Old Delhi for its monuments, cuisines and street life, it is astonishing that this pavement market isn’t featured in any guidebook.According to one seller, it has been functioning since the 1950s. In that sense, it is a historic landmark too. The bazar is located in the Walled City’s Chitli Qabar neighbourhood. Every day, hawkers claim the pavements from the early hours of the morning, decking their many stalls with their specialities. The entire street is clouded with impressions of all kinds, as if one were walking through a fairy tale. To list just some of the bazar sellers and what they sell is like reading that famous episode of the Iliad, in which Homer catalogues the ships and warriors of the Achaean army.Gulfam is selling ice. Bhure Khan is selling plastic dastarkhwan — dining mats for people who dine on the floor. Muhammed Ismail is selling frocks. Aamir is selling serving trays. Anish is selling a variety of unconnected things such as ear buds, wipers, kitchen lighters and combs. Muhammed Waseem is selling glass bangles. Shaad is selling boxes of “pasta masala” and “chocolate facial kit.” Nadeem is selling bedsheets. Muhammed Ismail is selling “sleeves of ladies kurtas.” Aashiq is selling track suits. Rashiq is selling “ladies suits.” Muhammed Mustakeem is selling plastic flowers. Qumar Ahmad is selling pencil boxes. Rabab is selling kitchen utensils. Ajmal is selling “ladies bra.” Iftikhar Ahmad is selling plastic bags. Mukhtar Ahmad is selling laces. Raees is selling hand bags. Vipin is selling many kinds of cello tapes.

22-02-2021||Bhopal||MP police arrest dentist who killed woman, hid body in Drishyam style||A dentist in Madhya Pradesh’s Satna district allegedly killed a woman and buried her body in an empty plot similar to the crime committed in popular Malayalam film Drishyam. But was arrested as his mobile location was traced to the plot, police said on Sunday.When asked about the reasons for being at the vacant plot for a long time, Dr Ashutosh Tripathi gave in and confessed to the crime, said Satna, superintendent of police, Dharamveer Singh Yadav.Police excavated the decomposed body of the woman, a resident of Satna, Vibha Kevat, 24, from an empty plot on Saturday. Police arrested the accused Dr Ashutosh Tripathi under section 302 (murder) of IPC for killing the woman and burying her body with a dog to dodge the police.“The woman used to work at Dr Ashutosh Tripathi’s clinic. On December 14, 2020, she didn’t return to her home from the clinic. When the woman’s parents asked Tripathi, he said Vibha was upset with her family and started living independently,” Yadav said.“The parents tried to contact Vibha many times, when they didn’t receive any response they filed a police complaint on February 1. Police started investigation and also interrogated Tripathi but he denied having any information about Vibha,” said the SP.In the investigation, police found the tower location of Vibha’s mobile and Ashutosh at the same place on December 14. Police detained Tripathi and interrogated him. Tripathi confessed to his crime, he added.Also Read: BJP leader among four booked for abduction, rape of 19-yr-old in MPIn his confession to police, Tripathi said, “We were in a relationship. Vibha was pressuring me for marriage but I didn’t want to marry her. On December 14, we fought on this issue and I strangled her to death. Later to hide the body, I asked some labourers to dig a pit to bury a dog. I arranged a dead dog. I buried the woman first and covered her body with clay and later buried the dog in the same pit. If anybody showed suspicion due to stink, I could say I buried a dog there in the empty plot.”Police are interrogating him to know whether he committed the crime alone. There are many questions still unanswered like who arranged a dead dog and how he took the body to the pit, said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-police-arrest-dentist-who-killed-woman-hid-body-in-drishyam-style-101613959258112.html

The accused had fled the village, but was arrested within 24 hours, he added.During the interrogation, Shah confessed to raping and murdering the girl, when she visited his house to play with his two-year-old son.Special public prosecutor Daroga Singh said the police submitted the charge sheet within two months, while the judgment came within 25 days of framing of charges against the culprit.Earlier on February 15, a Pocso court in Patna awarded death penalty to a private school principal Arvind Kumar, alias Raj Singhania, raping an 11-year-old girl on the institution premises.Besides Singhania, the court also handed over rigorous life imprisonment to schoolteacher Abhishek Kumar (29) for conniving with Arvind.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of crimes against women in India increased by 7.3% between 2018 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/man-sentenced-to-death-for-girl-s-rapemurder-101613957261744.html
22-02-2021||Bhopal||BJP leader among four booked for abduction, rape of 19-yr-old in MP||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and three others have been booked for allegedly abducting and raping a 19-year-old woman in Shahdol, 592 km east of Bhopal, the police said on Sunday.“The accused have been identified as BJP’s Jaitpur mandal president Vijay Tripathi, a school teacher, Rajesh Shukla, and two locals, Munna Singh and Monu Maharaj. They abducted the woman on February 18 from near her house, raped her for two days and then threw her off the car near her house on Saturday night,” said superintendent of police, Shahdol, Awadesh Goswami. The woman was rushed to a hospital in Jaitpur by her family from where she was referred to Shahdol district hospital on Sunday afternoon where her condition is stated to be critical. The accused are absconding, said Goswami. “An FIR has been registered against all four accused under sections 363 (abduction) and 376 (d) (gang rape). Police are investigating the matter and trying to nab the accused,” he added.The survivor’s family has, meanwhile, alleged that the police didn’t take immediate action in the matter and even the FIR was registered after 15-16 hours.“The woman was abducted on February 18 night from her house. The family lodged a complaint with Jaitpur police. On Saturday night, the accused threw her off their car and fled the spot,” the woman’s brother-in-law alleged.“The woman was in an unconscious state. She was admitted to a hospital in Jaitpur. After she gained consciousness, the survivor informed the police about the incident. Rajesh Shukla abducted her and took her to his farmhouse, where she was forced to drink liquor. The four accused, including the BJP leader, then raped her for two days. She identified all the accused as they were known to her and her family members,” he added.According to the brother-in-law, the woman was found at 10pm on Saturday near the house and the police registered the FIR around 4pm on Sunday, after the matter caught the attention of media.The SP, however, refuted the family’s allegations and said the case was registered immediately after completing preliminary investigation. BJP Madhya Pradesh president VD Sharma couldn’t be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bjp-leader-among-four-booked-for-abduction-rape-of-19-yr-old-in-mp-101613955695017.html
22-02-2021||Ranchi||Tribal people are not Hindus, says Soren; BJP launches attack||Advocating a separate religious code for tribal people in the country, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren has underlined that they were never Hindus by faith and the Centre needs to provide a separate column for indigenous people in the upcoming Census. The remarks drew a sharp response from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which accused Soren of “speaking the language of the Vatican”.Soren was speaking on Saturday at the India Conference at Harvard 2021, organised by students of Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School. Replying to a specific question by the moderator whether tribals were not Hindus, Soren said, “There is no confusion on it. Tribal was never a Hindu, nor are they Hindus now. Tribals are worshippers of nature and have a separate set of customs and practices. And that is the reason why they are classified as tribals and indigenous people.” Prior to this, the chief minister, who is also the JMM working president, underlined that the Centre should provide the tribals a distinct column to mark their religion in the upcoming national Census. The Jharkhand assembly in November last year had unanimously adopted a resolution demanding a Sarna Tribal Religious Code for tribal people in the Census.It was for the second time during the day that the CM raised the issue of a separate religious code. Earlier in the day, speaking at the NITI Aayog council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Soren took up the issue and urged the Centre to consider the proposal sent by the Jharkhand assembly over the issue sympathetically.Reacting to the CM’s view, Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “By saying such things on an international platform, the CM is playing in the hands of the Vatican. We have constitutional bodies like legislature and judiciary to decide on such issues like the Sarna code. But by saying such things at an international platform, he is even allowing foreign hands to meddle into our affairs.”Jharkhand Congress spokesperson Kishore Shadeo said, “It won’t be proper to comment on the CM’s specific statement as I don’t know what exactly he said. However, Congress had promised Sarna code in election. In the government we decided and got a resolution passed in assembly. Now the Centre must honour it and provide a separate column for the tribals in census.”As per the 2011 Census, tribals make up nearly 26% of the 32.4 million population of Jharkhand. According to tribal rights activists, a majority of the tribal people in the state who are not Christians opted for the “Others” column while marking their religious identity in the 2011 Census.At the India Conference event, Soren also spoke about a host of other issues related to tribal people, migrant workers and other key sectors of development in the state. On the overall condition of tribals, Soren said despite the constitutional provisions, a dedicated ministry and laws in place for the betterment of tribals, they are still at the receiving end of exploitation and discrimination and it has “not been easy” even for him to reach the position he currently holds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/tribal-people-are-not-hindus-says-soren-bjp-launches-attack-101613954650435.html

We have stood before guns in the past. We won’t be scared of fighting rats. I will not surrender as long as I am alive. You cannot break our spine. A tiger cub is not scared of cats and rats,” Banerjee said addressing an event to celebrate International Mother Language Day.Earlier in the day, Abhishek Banerjee tweeted a photograph of the notice that CBI additional superintendent of police Umesh Kumar left at his residence.

22-02-2021||Delhi||Six months after proposals, only six names cleared||Days after the Supreme Court urged the Centre to frame a timeline for appointing judges to high courts and the apex court upon receiving recommendations of the collegium, the government has cleared only six of 16 names for high courts despite sitting on the proposals for over six months.The government has cleared appointments of two judges in the Delhi high court and four in the Kerala high court while choosing not to clear some other names that have been pending for more than a year now, HT has learnt through people familiar with the matter.While the government cleared all four names recommended by the collegium for appointments to the Kerala high court, it has approved only two of six names in case of the Delhi high court. The notifications for the appointment of these six judges are expected to be issued on Monday.Also Read | All Delhi High Court benches to resume physical hearing daily from March 15The SC collegium comprises the Chief Justice of India and the two most senior judges of the apex court in matters of appointment and transfer of high court judges.The government had 16 names pending approval after the collegium’s recommendation. Even as it decided to clear the names sent in August 2020, it did not take any decision on the five names for the Calcutta high court, pending since July 2019, and one name for the Jammu and Kashmir high court, pending since October 2019.The law ministry did not respond to queries about these pending names till the time of going to press.According to people in the know, the government has cleared the names of advocates Jasmeet Singh and Amit Bansal as judges in the Delhi high court while four other names recommended by the collegium in August 2020 have been kept pending. The other four lawyers yet to be cleared for appointment are Tara Vitasta Ganju, Anish Dayal, Amit Sharma and Mini Pushkarna.Of the total sanctioned strength of 60, Delhi high court currently has a vacancy of 31 judges which will come down to 29 once the notifications are issued.The government has also chosen to segregate the names sent together by the collegium despite disapproval of this practice by justice RM Lodha, who as CJI in July 2014 had written a letter to Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, stating that the government should not adopt such “unilateral segregation” in the future.Justice Lodha sent this missive after the NDA government segregated former solicitor general Gopal Subramanium from the panel of four names recommended for appointment as Supreme Court judges by the collegium.All the four names for the Kerala high court have been cleared by the government. Principal sessions judges Kauser Edappagath of Ernakulam and K Babu of Thiruvananthapuram and lawyers Ziyad Rahman and Murali Purushothaman will now be appointed as judges in the Kerala high court.These recommendations have also been cleared by the government after six months. Currently, there are 37 judges against the sanctioned strength of 47 in the Kerala high court. Seven judges will retire this year. There are four other names pending for appointment to the Kerala high court with the Supreme Court collegium.HT reported earlier this month that currently there are 188 names in contemplation for appointment as high court judges as against a staggering vacancy of 419 judges -- more than a third of the total positions. Of the 188 names being considered, 112 are pending with the government, with the oldest recommendations for appointment going back to July 2019.Hearing a petition on a related issue on January 27, the bench, which included CJI SA Bobde and justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, called it a “matter of great concern” that the collegium had not heard from the government for months.The bench said a proposal will get stuck without knowing the reason and asked the government to consider laying down a timeline for the executive to clear appointments in the higher judiciary, with every stage of appointment marked by a definite time period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/six-months-after-proposals-only-six-names-cleared-101613949691114.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||First high dam on Yamuna may pose flood risk to city: Experts||The Chamoli flash floods of February 7 have brought the spotlight back on the first high dam on the Yamuna scheduled to come up at Lakhwar in Dehradun and Tehri in Uttarakhand after the Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee recommended the 300MW Lakhwar Multipurpose Project for environmental clearance in its December 2 meeting last year.The move has reignited a three-decade old worry among environmentalists who have been flagging the project as a potential risk for the national capital.River activists have warned that the project could push Delhi to water scarcity, depletion of groundwater levels and major flooding and loss in case of a disaster.Also Read | Jewar airport: Service lane parallel to Yamuna E-way likely to be ready by March-end, says YeidaThe Lakhwar Multipurpose Project is expected to provide 19.03 MCM (million cubic metres) of drinking water to Delhi, according to the project details on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website. It is also likely to provide irrigation on 33,780 hectares and water for domestic and industrial use — 78.83 MCM to neighbouring states, including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Watch: First high dam on Yamuna raises environmental concernsOver 50% of the land affected by the proposed project is forest land. Clearance was first issued to Lakhwar and Vyasi, which together make the Lakhwar Vyasi Multipurpose project, by the environment ministry in 1987. Work was started by UP’s department of irrigation and tunnels; an underground powerhouse was completed by 1992. After the formation of Uttarakhand, the project was handed over to NHPC and bifurcated into two parts -- Lakhwar MPP (300 MW) with Katapathar Barrage and Vyasi hydroelectric project (120MW).After environmentalists moved the National Green Tribunal on the lack of environmental appraisal of the project, the tribunal on January 10, 2019 directed the expert appraisal committee to appraise the project afresh under the environment impact assessment notification 2006.Dam authorities brushed aside the concerns raised by environmentalists.“Yes, it’s the biggest high dam on the Yamuna with the highest storage capacity. But all these fears are baseless. We have conducted very detailed studies on environmental implications. Also, locals are waiting desperately for the dam. It’s a major developmental project for this region,” said a senior official of the Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited who did not wish to be named.Manoj Mishra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said the Lakhwar dam is an “invitation to trouble” for Delhi. Located right on the Yamuna and being the first city downstream, the Capital will be the first to be impacted in case of anything going wrong with the dam.“Unlike cities such as Panipat, Sonepat, Karnal and Yamunanagar, which also fall along the route of the Yamuna, Delhi is right on the river. If the Lakhwar dam breaks or if there is any disaster there, Delhi has had it. The first to be submerged will be east Delhi and parts of south Delhi. Other cities are still a few kilometres away from the river, but Delhi will not even have the time to respond,” Mishra said.The proposed height of the dam is 204 metres, which is as tall as a 70-metre building, and the impact of water gushing from such a height will be first faced by Delhi, he added.Mishra said along with facing the risk of a possible disaster, Delhi could also be water starved. During monsoon rains currently, the Yamuna and its aquifers get rejuvenated because there is nothing holding the river back upstream. Since such big dams primarily hold monsoon water, Delhi will be drastically starved of Yamuna’s water.The Delhi Jal Board’s documents show that the Capital currently gets 50 gallons per person per day, which is nearly 200 litres per person per day, much higher than the average in other cities. Delhi’s requirement is around 100 litres per person per day, according to experts. The DJB’s water management plans are also centred on making the city self-sufficient in its water needs.“Compared to the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi the sediment load and volumes are much lower in the Yamuna and this dam is quite downstream. It is also fed by a number of glaciers. We have to see what kinds of checks they have against flooding or disasters,” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad.Residents of Lohari village along the Yamuna are both happy that the project may finally take off after over 30 years and the locals may benefit from compensation, rehabilitation and jobs but they are also anxious about what this could mean for the river. “We are very happy that the dam is coming. This is because it will bring livelihood opportunities to us. There are so many young boys here who have no jobs. Residents have been waiting for the project to take off for over 30 years now. We were children then,” said Ramesh Chauhan, a resident of Lohari. At the same time, the Yamuna is of enormous spiritual and religious significance to people here.“The Yamuna is our mother. Our life is linked to the river. Whenever water levels have risen, we have prayed to the Yamuna and she has saved us from disaster. Even in 2013, during the floods, water levels had risen dangerously, so we went to the temple on the Yamuna banks and prayed for hours. All the villagers were there. We believe that we were saved from being washed away because of our faith in the river,” said Tikam Singh, another resident.One of the risks associated with dams is a break that may result in a flood wave up to tens of metres high, travelling along a valley at high speeds.The impact of such a wave on developed areas can be sufficient to completely destroy infrastructure, according to documents on the Parivesh website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/first-high-dam-on-yamuna-may-pose-flood-risk-to-city-experts-101613948432803.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||FYUP may return to DU colleges this year||The Delhi University (DU) may reintroduce its four-year undergraduate (UG) programmes from the upcoming academic session of 2021-22, officials said on Sunday.The programme will return as a part of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. A committee that was constituted last year to formulate the guidelines for the implementation of the policy in DU has already submitted its recommendations on the structure of bachelors courses under the four-year model.The university had once before in 2014 introduced the Four-Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP). It, however, was scrapped by the government after protests by students and teachers the same year.According to the proposed structure of UG programmes submitted by the committee — that is known as the National Education Policy 2020 Implementation Committee (NIC) — students in DU will now get the option of pursuing three-year honours or four-year honours in a discipline or a four-year honours in a discipline with research.DU Vice-Chancellor (acting) PC Joshi said that the recommendations will now be sent to the university’s statutory bodies — academic council (AC) and executive council (EC) — for their approval.“The university has extensively worked on it in the last 6-7 months and we are ready to implement it now. We are only waiting to get nods from the statutory bodies. I don’t think there will be an issue in the implementation, since we are not replacing anything. We are only adding on to the existing. It’s in fact in sync with what we are already running,” he said.When asked about the necessity of introduction of fourr-year programme, Joshi said, “The University will introduce four year courses following the NEP recommendations. It’s going to be good for students since it’s giving more opportunities to them. Besides, the exit options are good for students from marginalised background who would want to discontinue studies temporarily due to their circumstances.”Under the new programme, students will get multiple exit options. For instance, they can exit after one year and get a certificate, after two years they will get a diploma and after three years they will be awarded an honours degree. These exit options have also been advocated by the NEP, 2020.In the fourth year of the program, the students can choose between pursuing the Bachelors of Arts / Science / Commerce (Honours) in Discipline or the Bachelors of Arts / Science / Commerce (Honours) in Discipline with Research. “In case a student chooses the first option, she would be required to study four generic elective (minors) papers in the fourth year. The student shall also study two discipline specific elective papers. He/ she would be required to complete a research dissertation on her major discipline of study, and an inter-disciplinary research dissertation on her major and minor disciplines of study,” the recommendations stated.“In case a student chooses the second option, she would study two generic elective (minors) papers in the fourth year. The student shall also study two discipline specific elective papers. He/ she would need to complete a thesis/internship in the last two semesters,” it added.Under the DU’s existing choice-based credit system, the major disciplines are the subjects in which students are aiming to get degrees, generic elective or minor courses are interdisciplinary subjects they chose along with the majors, and discipline-specific elective papers are extensions of the major subjects.The committee has also recommended changing the names of the existing programme courses such as BA/BCom/ BSc programmes to Honours courses. If implemented, these programmes will be known as the Bachelors of Science (Honours), Bachelors of Arts (Honours) in Humanities and Social Sciences, and Bachelors of Commerce Studies (Honours).It has also proposed the introduction of new subjects in the first three years in addition to the already existing ones. It includes language and literature, social and emotional learning, innovation and entrepreneurship, co-curricular, and ethics and culture, among others.Several EC and AC members said that proper discussion on the recommendations is required before implementation. EC member Seema Das, who was also a member of the NEP Committee, said, “Initially, the NEP committee had proposed to do away with honours courses. They decided to accommodated this after my strong objections and retained all honours degree courses and also upgraded existing programme courses into honours courses. As per the assurance, these recommendations shall only be implemented after proper discussion in the statutory bodies.”Principals of several DU colleges said that they will have to upgrade their infrastructure in order to accommodate students for four-years. “The colleges still have another three years to plan and make whatever changes we will require once students enter their fourth-year,” said Manoj Sinha, secretary of Delhi University Principal Association (DUPA) and principal of Aryabhatta College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fyup-may-return-to-du-colleges-this-year-101613947776458.html
22-02-2021||Other||Puducherry test today; two ruling MLAs resign||Two more MLAs of the Congress-led ruling combine resigned from the Puducherry assembly on Sunday, a day before a floor test, in a jolt to chief minister V Narayanasamy’s government as it stood at a reduced strength of 12 MLAs in the 33-member House.Congress MLA K Lakshminarayanan and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) legislator Venkatesan announced their resignations on Sunday, while the Opposition’s strength stood at 14. The assembly now has seven vacancies, resulting in an effective strength of 26. The simple majority figure is 14 after the Sunday’s resignations.Four Congress MLAs – including former ministers A Namassivayam and Malladi Krishna Rao – quit earlier, while another party legislator was disqualified for anti-party activities last year.Also Read | Congress govt in Puducherry faces exit as 2 more MLAs quit ahead of floor testIn the 33-member assembly, 30 are elected seats and three are nominated members belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress currently has nine MLAs. These include assembly speaker SP Sivakolundhi, who is not allowed to vote unless there is a tie.The Congress has the support of two DMK MLAs and an independent MLA from Mahe. The Opposition has seven MLAs from the All Indian NR Congress, led by former chief minister N Rangasamy, and four from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). It also includes the BJP’s nominated members, who are allowed to vote.Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was handed additional charge of Puducherry on Tuesday last week, directed Narayanasamy on Thursday to prove majority by ordering a floor test scheduled for February 22. Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi was replaced by Soundararajan on Tuesday, hours after a Congress MLA’s resignation.The resignations of two more MLAs came on a day the ruling alliance’s members met the chief minister to discuss the future course of action. The sitting MLAs will also meet for an hour on Monday. “We have to take a decision on whether to attend the trust vote or submit our resignation to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G),” said a Puducherry Congress leader, asking not to be named.Lieutenant governor Soundararajan has asked the ruling alliance to prove its majority by 5pm. The voting will take place by a show of hands. Even if all ruling MLAs are present, the Congress-led government will fall short of the simple majority mark, with 11 votes. “Elections are less than two months away so we will work towards the elections where people will give us the majority,” a senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. A senior Puducherry BJP leader said that they may not stake claim to form the government. “In a week, poll dates will be announced so what is the point of running a government for about 60 days?” the BJP leader said. President’s Rule seems imminent in that scenario.Lakshminarayanan resigned from his post as MLA and quit the Congress, stating that he was disrespected in the party and the Opposition was welcoming him. “The government is not failing because of my resignation. It has already lost its majority,” he told reporters on Sunday.The DMK’s Venkatesan also submitted his resignation to the Speaker, saying he was dissatisfied with the government. “The BJP has used muscle and money power and threatened the MLAs,” said Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee president AV Subramanian.After holding consultations with the Congress-led alliance, chief minister Narayanasamy told reporters that he will announce his decision on the floor of the House, when the assembly convenes at 10am on Monday. “We discussed the strategy to be adopted with alliance parties in the legislative assembly. Several suggestions were given by ministers, MLAs, MP and the deputy speaker. Finally, we decided that we will disclose our strategy on the floor of the house when it convenes.”Political analysts say that the Congress could turn this crisis into an emotive issue. “It’s clear that Narayanasamy won’t be able to win the trust vote so he may use the floor test to highlight his achievements and his victimisation for the ensuing election similar to what VP Singh (former Prime Minister from 1989 to 1990 until he lost the vote of no-confidence) did when the BJP pulled out its support,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/puducherry-test-today-two-ruling-mlas-resign-101613942002514.html
22-02-2021||Chandigarh||BKU Ugrahan appeals to Punjab farmers to reach Delhi border in large numbers for February 27 rally||Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan on Sunday appealed to the farmers and farm labourers from Punjab to reach the Delhi borders in large numbers for the February 27 rally against the Centre’s agriculture laws. Addressing a rally organised by the farmer union in the grain market of Barnala town, the BKU leader said the ongoing farmers’ agitation is not just against the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre but also the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “The agitation came back on track after the Red Fort incident on January 26, in which the Centre in connivance with some people tried to give a communal colour to the farmers’ struggle. We have conveyed the people that it is not a fight of a particular religion but the battle of all citizens of the country. After the Delhi incident, the people of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh raised questions over the movement and distanced themselves from the protest. But we managed the situation and saved the struggle from communal forces,” said Ugrahan.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) Balbir Singh Rajewal said, “The Delhi Police have registered several cases against farmers. There is no need to appear before the police if they send you notices. Residents should oppose the police if they conduct raids in villages.”Ruldu Singh Mansa, a leader of the Punjab Kissan Union, which is part of the SKM said the people of Punjab should boycott the BJP workers in the state. “We will not make any compromise against the farmers interests. The struggle will be fought until the repeal of three laws,” he added.During the rally, appeals were also made to reach Delhi on February 23 to mark the birth anniversary of Pagri Sambhal Jatta movement leader and Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s uncle Ajit Singh as well as on the Women’s Day on March 8. People from all walks of life, including intellectuals, artists, unemployed youths and government employees joined hands with the farmers and labourers during the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bku-ugrahan-appeals-to-punjab-farmers-to-reach-delhi-border-in-large-numbers-for-february-27-rally-101613937320169.html
22-02-2021||Chandigarh||Austria refugee home saved by Punjab-origin man||The white paint has not yet dried, but as Sukhdeep Singh walks through the house where he used to live in the Austrian town of Baden, he is already picturing the refugees who -- thanks to him -- will soon be calling it home. It was where he himself lived after he left his native Punjab region of India as a teenager to start a new life in Europe. When the Christian NGO that previously ran the site as a home for unaccompanied migrant children said it was impossible to continue running it, Singh stepped in to save it from being sold off to developers. “I didn’t want anyone to buy it who had no connection to the house and its history,” says Singh, now married with three small children. Singh’s connection to the house and its founder is a deep one. The story begins with his arduous journey through Russia and Eastern Europe before arriving in Austria and at the Laura Gatner house, a shelter for about 50 unaccompanied youths. “To be honest, my first impression was horrible,” Singh recalls. On the top floor of the three storey house, he points at one corner of a 12-metre-square room to the other. “Here was my bed, and here was the second bed,” he says of the space he shared with a teen from Afghanistan. But over the six years he spent here, he learned to speak the language, made friends and played football. The nondescript house in an industrial area came to symbolise perseverance and benevolence for Singh. HOLOCAUST MEMORIES Key to Singh’s fond memories of the home is his bond with Jewish actor and writer Otto Tausig, who was key in setting up the house after his own experience of being forced into exile by the Nazis. Tausig dedicated the latter half of his life to charity. After raising the funds to buy the house -- including a large personal donation -- Tausig gifted it to Protestant charity Diakonie for use as a shelter for youths. The house is named after Tausig’s grandmother, Laura Gatner, who died in a Nazi concentration camp. Social workers, teachers and psychologists here helped Singh understand the local culture and master the language. He says he was treated with respect, and graduated from technical high school. And Tausig became something of a mentor to him personally. When Singh went on to a degree at the Technical University, it was Tausig who sponsored him. NO LONGER WELCOME Singh, now in his mid-30s and a project manager at multinational Siemens, learned from an old friend that the building he’d called home was to be sold. Diakonie says the decision was taken due to “insufficient referrals” of residents coming from the regional authorities in Lower Austria. As the EU has fortified its borders in recent years, the rate of new arrivals has plummeted. The number of “unaccompanied underaged asylum-seekers” went from 8,300 in 2015 to just 390 three years later. At the same time, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has prided himself on his tough anti-migration stances, winning many voters from the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) in the process. “The welcome I received, it is not the same anymore,” Singh says. The new Laura Gatner house, however, will be an antidote, with red, blue and yellow mosaic tiles spelling her name still gracing the hallways. Though most of the 16 apartments will have to be rented out at a profit to pay off the mortgage, at least four will be reserved for asylum-seeker families -- who will not be expected to pay a set rent. A young mother and her 12-year-old daughter, currently in a government-run asylum centre, will be among the first residents. “Can you imagine the girl in this centre, where she can’t even study?” Singh says. The apartment for the two of them will include a separate space for the girl to study. A further three families are expected to find a home here when construction is finished in March, the same month Singh arrived here in 2003. Singh is proud of his achievements, and of carrying on Tausig’s legacy. “If you look for a role model, don’t look towards those who are rich, who have a lot of money,” he says. “Look to those who have a big heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/austria-refugee-home-saved-by-punjab-origin-man-101613936838489.html
22-02-2021||Chandigarh||Highlight Centre’s denial of permission to jatha to Nankana Sahib, Akal Takht tells Sikhs||The Akal Takht on Sunday issued an edict to the Sikh community directing it to organise functions across the world for a month and highlight the denial of permission to a jatha from going to Pakistan to attend the centenary event of the Nankana Sahib massacre at the birthplace of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak. The edict was read out by Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh during a brief function at the temporal seat to pay tributes to those killed in the massacre. He also fixed responsibilities of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Delhi Singh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), other gurdwara bodies and Sikh organisations for the purpose. “The community members must be told about the Centre’s excesses of not permitting the jatha from going to Nankana Sahib”, he said.Earlier, during a function organised by the SGPC at Gurdaspur district’s Godharpur village, the jathedar said, “The community will remember the government’s move while remembering the martyrs of this massacre every year.”“When the Nankana Sahib massacre took place, a hukamnama (decree) was issued from the Akal Takht asking the community to organise congregations everywhere wearing black turbans in protest against the British government that supported the killers. The government of the day has made the Sikhs realise the same pain they experienced 100 years ago when they heard the news of the massacre,” he added. He said, “BJP-led central government stopped Sikhs from proceeding to Nankana Sahib in the same manner as the British stopped a jatha led by Kartar Singh Jhabbar that went to free the shrine from the control of the mahants.” He said the Centre denied permission to the jatha as it wanted the community to call back its members protesting at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws. “This will never happen and we shall not bow down even if the government refuses permission to Sikh jathas every year,” he added.He also condemned the politics of polarisation in the country. “Minorities like Sikhs and Muslims could be persecuted in future. The ruling party at the Centre is spreading hate in the minds of majority community against the minorities to garner votes. This type of politics is neither good for the government nor for the country. We should unite and become powerful politically to thwart this,” he said.Sukhbir questions CM’s silence on issueAddressing the gathering, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal questioned the “silence” of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh over denial of the permission to the Sikh jatha. “Even few days back, some people were granted permission to visit Pakistan at the instance of the CM. Why he has not taken up the issue of the need to accord permission to the jatha with the Centre?” he asked.Jagir Kaur apologises for SGPC’s ‘past mistakes’SGPC president Jagir Kaur apologised to the community for the mistakes of the gurdwara body functionaries that “they committed in the past” and urged the Sikhs to unite for a common cause. She also announced that the SGPC would observe year-long events in various institutes and construct a Guru Ka Langar hall in remembrance of Mata Inderjit Kaur and a library in memory of the martyrs of Nankana Sahib in their villages.Cong holds separate function A separate function was organised by the ruling Congress at Dharowali village near Dera Baba Nanak to remember those killed in the Nankana Sahib massacre. The event was organised with the efforts of state jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa,Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, all the party MLAs from Gurdaspur district and other leaders attended the function.Pak minister addresses PSGPC devotees Pakistan’s federal minister for narcotics control and local member of national assembly Brig Ijaz Ahmad Shah (retd) addressed the devotees during an event organised by the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) in collaboration with Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, to mark centenary of Nankana Sahib massacre. Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh and Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh also addressed the devotees, who came from various parts of Pakistan, on Zoom. Controversial Sikh leader and former member of the PSGPC Gopal Singh Chawla was also given time to speak on the dais.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/highlight-centre-s-denial-of-permission-to-jatha-to-nankana-sahib-akal-takht-tells-sikhs-101613936540895.html
22-02-2021||Other||The wait to adopt a child got longer amid pandemic||The ongoing pandemic has left prospective parents (PPs), hoping to adopt a child, in uncertainty. The outbreak of the pandemic in March had brought the adoption process to a standstill for several reasons – lack of information, closure of courts and fear of contracting the infection. These reasons refrained PPs from approaching adoption centres. After being halted for April and May 2020 owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the process of adoptions – considered lengthy and tedious – restarted in June. Since then, 437 children have been adopted domestically and internationally in the state. Of these 378 were adopted by domestic applicants, while 59 children were adopted by international applicants between June and December last year, data provided by the State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA) stated. During the financial year 2019-20, 539 children were adopted domestically, while 69 were adopted internationally in Maharashtra. “Even a day matters after waiting for years” Amidst all the outbreak, the waiting period for PPs who were on the verge of getting a child, after already waiting for years, got further extended. In December 2017, 36-year-old Bengaluru resident Digangana Mukherjee registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) to adopt a child. After waiting for two years and seven months, the Mukherjees finally adopted their daughter Upolobdhi (meaning realisation) in July 2020, but not without going through trying times and difficult situations owing to the pandemic, which had stretched their waiting period by four months. The couple were almost on the verge of getting a match for a baby in the first week of April 2020. But when the national lockdown was declared on March 25, they were left with no other choice but to wait. “It may sound that four months is a small period of time. But after waiting for years, even one day matters,” said Mukherjee. Finally, in the first week of July, they got their match from an adoption centre in Aurangabad. But due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru, a complete lockdown was declared in the city from July 14 for a week. “We needed to send notarised documents to the agency, but everything was closed due to the lockdown. My husband had to hunt for an advocate and begged him to sign the documents,” she recollected. Their struggle did not end there. As the couple could not find a direct flight amid the lockdown restrictions, the couple left their four-year-old biological son with their close friend during the travel. The duo travelled for 20 hours in their private vehicle and reached Aurangabad via Pune. On July 28, the couple managed to reach the adoption centre where they met their daughter for the first time. The next day, they appeared at the district court for formalities, following which they decided to rest at a hotel for a day before heading back on July 30. However, the adoption centre did not allow the couple to take their five-month-old baby to a hotel out of fear of contracting Covid-19. “So after completing the court formalities in the afternoon, we rested for three hours at the hotel. By 5pm, we reached the adoption centre and left for Bengaluru with our daughter. We drove the entire night. When one has to go through such hurdles after waiting for years, it does leave a bitter taste in the mouth,” said Mukherjee. Similar to Mukherjee’s tale is the one of a 37-year-old government employee from Khar who waited for nine months to adopt his nephew. In 2017, the boy, now aged seven, lost both his parents in a car accident, and was living with his paternal uncle since then. In 2018, the uncle applied to CARA for the adoption process, but it went haywire due to some technical issues. In January 2020, through a new lawyer, they filed a petition at Bombay high court (HC) for ‘within family’ adoption. It generally takes two-three months for the completion of the process, but the pandemic stretched their waiting period for almost nine months. “Even for the ‘within family’ criteria, the adoption process is an extremely strenuous. Though it was proven that I am the boy’s paternal uncle, I was asked to submit several notarised documents. Just when we were about to get the process done in March, the pandemic hit,” he said. On January 14, 2021, the court approved the adoption petition. PPs can’t meet the children To adopt a child, a person needs to apply on CARA, following which the applicant’s financial stability, health conditions, among others, undergo scrutiny. A waiting number is handed out to acquire a match as per their requirement which takes a minimum of two years. Once PPs approve the profile of a shortlisted child, they are allowed to meet the child. However, they have the right to refuse adopting the child after a face-to-face interaction. “This is the most crucial part of the adoption process. The eye and skin contact helps to develop a bond with the child,” said Siddharth Jagusthe, an advocate who also handles adoption cases in HC. But during the beginning of the pandemic, CARA instructed SARAs to prohibit PPs from visiting the children for their safety. This dampened the spirit of many parents who waited for years to see a child. “In the beginning of 2020, our centre had six requests for domestic adoption. But when the pandemic broke out, we had to follow the guidelines and did not allow PPs to meet the shortlisted children to maintain social distance. Later, four of the applicants withdrew their forms,” said Rahul Jadhav, in-charge of Adharashram adoption centre, Nashik. Following this new rule, adoption centres started setting up virtual meetings with PPs where children would try to connect with the families through video calls. In fact, Mukherjee decided to adopt her daughter after conducting several virtual interactions with her. However, for some parents it was quite an emotionally challenging phase as they craved for the human touch. A 46-year-old Rajasthan resident had to wait for two years and three months before getting a call to see a child for adoption in Mumbai on March 18. But before they couple could reach the adoption centre, the national lockdown was declared. “The first lockdown was only for 21 days so we decided to wait. But then it got extended for an unknown period. We could see the child only on video calls arranged by the counsellors. But we would grow restless as I wanted to hug and kiss the girl,” she said. Finally, in October, the family met the girl. Currently, they have filed an adoption petition in the district court to adopt the child. International adoptions the most hit Data shared by SARA shows that between 2015-2016 and 2020 (till December), 776 children have been adopted internationally from the state. Parents from the US and Europe adopt the highest number of children. However, due to the outbreak, the adoption centres as well as the judges refused to give permission for adoption until the pandemic curve flattened. For instance, Kanjurmarg-based Vatsalya Trust did not record any international adoption last year since March. It was only in January 2021 that the court granted the approval to adopt two children by parents settled in the US and Italy. Similarly, the Adharashram centre recorded the first two international adoptions from the US last month, since March 2020. “Before approving an international adoption petition for parents residing in the US – which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases – judges also have to consider the safety of a child in this uncertain situation. This is for the safety of the child and no one can be blamed for it,” said Rakesh Kapoor, one of the most prominent adoption lawyers in the city. Due to the stringent rules of CARA, international adoption is gradually losing its shine. For instance, in 2015-2016, 183 children from the state were adopted by parents from other countries, which dropped to 69 in 2019-20. Experts also blame it on fewer children available for adoption. Data shows that 3,300 Indian couples and 80 foreign couples are on the waitlist for adoption. “There are 44 children at the centre, but only nine of them are up for adoption. Most domestic parents demand children in the age bracket of less than two years, which further narrows down the availability of children for adoption,” said Dr Vilas Ainapure, president, Vatsalya Trust, Mumbai. In a bid to encourage adoption of specially-abled children, CARA has instructed SARAs to allow international parents to adopt only children with special needs such as those suffering from congenital heart defects or learning disabilities, among others. “Indian parents generally don’t want to adopt such children. However, we have seen that foreign parents are quite welcoming in this matter. If we could remove this stringent rule, international adoptions could have increased. But at present, our priority is domestic adoption,” said a programme coordinator at SARA. ‘Cases fast tracked now’Adoption lawyers and officers from the women and child development (WCD) department claim that Maharashtra is doing far better than other states in the adoption process. “In August 2020, after the initial relaxation of the lockdown, the Bombay high court ordered to fasten the adoption processes. This helped us fast track the cases that were pending. Many other states refused to hear adoption petitions and adjourned them for an uncertain period. The court should be appreciated for it which brought smiles on parents’ faces,” said Kapoor. Now, adoption centres are getting many PPs from neighbouring states for the process. “Considering the pleas of parents, CARA in December permitted to start the face-to-face interaction again by maintaining social distance,” said Dr Ainapure. Kapoor said that only one adoption case from last year’s pending cases are left, with all others been resolved by December 2020. Last week, the Mukherjees again visited Aurangabad to appear at the district court to get the final approval stamp of their adoption. But this time, they did not have to struggle like they did in July 2020. “The roads and shops opened up. There were more people at the court. It seemed like good old pre-pandemic days,” said Mukherjee. Six months down the line from the time of her adoption, she appreciates her four-month wait which helped her to coincidentally meet her daughter. “In March, my daughter was only a month old. But as per the rules, only children above the age of two-and-a-half months are given for adoption. So, if we had undergone adoption in March, I would have gotten another baby, not her. Now I think, we were destined to wait to meet my daughter after those four months,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-wait-to-adopt-a-child-got-longer-amid-pandemic-101613936178297.html
22-02-2021||Other||Mumbai civic body cracks down on marriage halls, hotels; stringent norms likely||Amid a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city in a week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has swung into action and raided several establishments over the weekend. With cases almost doubling in a week, the civic body is expected to impose more curbs in the city after a review meeting on Monday. Continuing its upward Covid-19 graph on Sunday, Mumbai reported 921 new infections – its sharpest single-day spike since November 29 when 940 cases were recorded. As on Sunday, Mumbai’s caseload stands at 319,128, while the toll has reached 11,446. The recovery rate is 94.30% with 300,959 recoveries and fatality rate is 3.58%. There are 5,859 active cases in the city. Since the past one week, the city has been reporting high single-day cases since November 2020, when the city was recording over 1,000 cases daily. The numbers had fallen in December, with the average daily cases hovering between 600 and 700, according to the state’s dashboard. Taking the spike very seriously, BMC got its act together by starting the strict implementation of the lockdown norms. BMC took action against at least four establishments in Bandra and Khar and seven establishments, including marriage halls, in Dadar and Mahim for violating Covid-19 norms. A first information report (FIR) has been filed against a Bandra cafe for overcrowding and violating Covid-19 norms. The cafe owner was also asked to pay a fine of ₹50,000. BMC also filed a police complaint against four people for escaping the seven-day mandatory hotel quarantine after returning from Dubai. In a statement, BMC said it collected over Rs32-lakh fines from citizens for not wearing a mask at hotels, night clubs, bars and marriage halls. Mayor Kishori Pednekar warned that Covid-19 rules would be further tightened if citizens continue violating the norms. “I’m not saying we will again impose a lockdown. But stricter norms during the unlocking will be imposed if citizens are found violating Covid-19 norms. We will be cautious when it comes to unlocking of schools and colleges, and their reopening might be on hold for a few more days. We’ll take a final call on the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai on Monday during a review meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackerayji,” said Pednekar on Sunday. It is likely that a decision over putting a hold on reopening of schools and colleges in the wake of an increase in Covid-19 cases will be taken on Monday. “The final decision on further restrictions will be taken after the review meeting on Monday,” a senior BMC official said. Pednekar appealed to the clean-up marshals to treat the citizens of Mumbai with courtesy and to carry out their responsibilities properly. She made the statement after a video of clean-up marshals misbehaving with citizens while levying fines for not wearing a mask went viral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-cracks-down-on-marriage-halls-hotels-stringent-norms-likely-101613935518924.html

Efforts are now on to trace the guests and customers who had come in contact with the staffers.The hotel is located in Versova area on Ghodbunder Road, Kashimira, and witnesses many guests from Gujarat and nearby areas. MBMC ward officer Swapnil Sawant said, “Our medical team immediately launched an aggressive testing drive in all hotels, bars, dhabas, restaurants and other eateries located in the vicinity of the hotel after 21 staffers were found positive for Covid-19, following which two eateries were sealed.”While those detected positive have been moved to healthcare facilities for treatment, others are kept in quarantine and the testing drive is on, said Sawant. After the figures had dipped, the civic body has recorded 112 cases last week, with 65 cases on Saturday alone. The caseload has reached 26,730, of which 25,544 patients have recovered, said Sawant. While no deaths have been reported in this week, the total toll in Mira-Bhayander stands at 801 till Saturday. “We have appealed to citizens to follow regular sanitisation, wear masks and maintaining social distancing. MBMC has further urged people to get themselves tested even if they develop the slightest symptoms of the virus,” said Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hotel-near-mumbai-sealed-after-21-staffers-test-positive-for-covid19-101613934978244.html

Citizens aged above 50 are most vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 owing to their underlying health conditions. Now, as there is a growing speculation that the city might be heading to the second wave of the pandemic like Europe, doctors are suggesting the start of the third phase at the earliest to improve the immunity of the elderly population. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) cannot start the third phase without the nod of the central government. Civic officials also claim that they are yet to receive guidelines for the third phase – expected to begin from the first week of March. “When we started the first two phases of the inoculation, the Centre had given us guidelines on who the healthcare and frontline workers are, who should be administered the jab as well as the criteria for their health check-ups. But we haven’t received any such guidelines for the third phase yet,” said a senior civic official. In the first week of February, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan stated in Lok Sabha that the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination is likely to commence in March and will cover 270 million crore people aged 50 years and above as well as those with comorbidities. As HT had reported earlier, in a meeting held with the civic officials last week, the state Covid-19 task force officers emphasised on the need for starting the third phase. “It generally takes over two weeks after the first shot to develop antibodies to fight the virus. Thus, the sooner we start the mass immunisation process, the faster we can stop its infection rate among senior citizens,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital who was part of the meeting. BMC claims that during the door-to-door survey under the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign, it has recorded the details of citizens with comorbidities such as tuberculosis (TB), hypertension, cardiac ailments, among others. But the civic officials are unaware on how to use the data for the third phase of vaccination. “A person may have more than one comorbidity, such as TB along with hypertension. But we don’t have that bifurcation. Also, a large number of patients go to private hospitals for treatment, so we don’t even have that data for cross verification,” said the officer. The civic body fears that lack of clarity may lead to further confusion and dampen the vaccination process in the third phase. “The centralised Co-WIN app is functioning better, but it still has a few glitches. To start the vaccination process for over 3 million public, we need better guidance and clearer instructions from the central government,” said another civic official, who is working on the mass vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-yet-to-receive-guidelines-for-phase-3-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101613934438105.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra schools seek increase in internal component for Class 10 board exams||Worried that schools in the city will not be allowed to reopen soon due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases, schools are now requesting the state education department to reduce the weightage of Class 10 board exams for this year.In the last few days, many teachers and principals have requested the department to give 50% weightage to internal exams and the remaining 50% to the written board exams. “Students have very little time to prepare for the board exams now. They need the practice to write exams and require face-to-face classes if they have to write the exams. Since schools are still closed for physical classes, the government must consider changing the evaluation model,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of the Teachers’ Democratic Front.While schools in other parts of the state reopened for Classes 9 to 12, those in the city are still not allowed to reopen pending approval from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Schools under consulates and embassies in Mumbai have been allowed to reopen from January 18, while other schools remain shut until further notice. Principals said pointed out that city students will suffer due to the delay. “For the entire state, there will be a single board exam with a common syllabus and the same question papers. But students from the city have not got any practice, while those elsewhere have been attending schools for nearly three months now. This is unfair,” said the principal of a civic school in the eastern suburbs.Currently, the written component for the board exams is 80%, and the internal component, which includes orals and practicals, is 20%, in each subject.As per a recent survey conducted by Jaywant Kulkarni, a teacher from Gandhi Bal Mandir high school in Kurla, 83% of students in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai want internal evaluations to be 50% of the total weightage of the board exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-schools-seek-increase-in-internal-component-for-class-10-board-exams-101613934018203.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Second Covid-19 wave nearing, lockdown decision in citizens’ hands: Uddhav||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a televised address on Sunday, said a second Covid-19 wave is knocking on the state’s doors and warned citizens of another lockdown if protocol is not being followed. Thackeray said a decision will be taken after eight days, even as he announced a ban on all religious, social and political gatherings from today and empowered local administrations to impose area-specific lockdowns if necessary. Thackeray, in his 40-minute speech, said, “It will be known in the next eight-15 days whether it is a second wave. We have been struggling with it [the pandemic] during the first wave because of poor health infrastructure, but it will be worse if another peak of cases happens. I am worried about the severity of a second wave if it hits the state,” he said. Thackeray said he was leaving the decision of another lockdown to the people of Maharashtra.“I am asking you whether you want curbs to be imposed again. The simple mantra is wear a mask, follow discipline and avoid lockdown. We will review the situation again in the next eight days and decide on a lockdown,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 6,971 new Covid-19 infections, its highest one-day spike in 121 days (since October 23 when the state clocked 7,347 cases). The state’s case tally reached 2,100,884, while the toll went up to 51,799 with 35 more deaths. Many districts such as Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola, Nashik and Pune imposed curbs in the wake of rise in number of cases over the past two weeks. “In districts such as Amravati, the cases have mounted to the level that was there during the peak of the pandemic. I have instructed district administrations from Amravati and other Vidarbha districts to take a decision about the lockdown and other curbs at their level. I also urge political parties to go back to digital platforms for their meetings and gatherings. The political, religious, social gatherings and protests that lead to crowding will be banned in the state from tomorrow [Monday],” he said. He also said that the offices should resort to staggered working hours. “I have requested the central government during our meeting with NITI Aayog to plan for staggered working hours of offices. The offices should stagger their timings by dividing their employees in batches and encouraging them to the work from home. This would help in avoiding crowding in trains and public places,” he said. Thackeray also announced to launch an “I am responsible” drive urging people to keep the virus’ spread at bay by wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and frequently sanitising hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-covid-19-wave-nearing-lockdown-decision-in-citizens-hands-uddhav-101613933718349.html

22-02-2021||Mumbai||BMC to map probable disasters across Mumbai to help plan city infrastructure||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will carry out mapping of all probable disasters, generate scenarios of their geographical impact zones and magnitude of destruction to life, livelihood, and property at the ward level. The city is prone to 35 natural and manmade disasters, such as tsunamis, impact of earthquake due to the fault line at Panvel near Mumbai, cyclones, flooding, landslides, bomb blasts, fires, oil spills, building collapses, tree collapses, road-over and foot overbridges collapses, stampede, power failures, nuclear and radiological disasters, and even sinking or collisions of ships, or war, according to a list of probable disasters prepared for the city by the Disaster Management Department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body will conduct seismic microzonation, hazard vulnerable risk assessment (HVRA) and develop tsunami atlas, to help administrative authorities, fire fighters, and builders in decision making while developing infrastructure in the city. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s disaster management department, said, “Many probable disasters are likely to strike Mumbai. Some are man-made, and some natural disasters. Many manmade disasters can be triggered by natural disasters, such as building collapses and fires can be triggered by natural disasters [earthquakes, cyclones]. We are going to map areas that are prone to disasters and investigate their impact. Basis this information, we will come up with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for disaster response.”A senior civic officer said, “This mapping will be linked to artificial intelligence – an IT based platform – for predictable analysis of probable disasters. This can be used for earlier warning and early evacuation.”A mini-prototype of this plan is already active for disaster response during monsoon flooding for Mumbai. The system is used for evacuation in flood-prone spots through predictions of water logging based on rain forecasts. It also has disaster response and evacuation plan for residents living along the banks of the four rivers of the city – Dahisar, Mithi, Oshiwara and Poisar. It has been most successfully used by the BMC for evacuating residents of areas on the banks of Mithi river during the past two-three monsoons. An SOP is automatically activated, and also has evacuation details for these areas complete with information on nearby civic shelters, transport services which can commute distressed residents and commuters caught up in flood to the shelters, food services in the area which have agreed to supply food to shelters, and nearby medical facilities. A second part of this prototype includes tying up with mobile service providers to send out area specific messages to residents living in the vicinity of the spot.As part of HVRA, the BMC will also study short-term and long-term impact of disasters on livelihood of Mumbaiite and post disaster rehabilitation. In cases where livelihood of people is impacted, predictions will also include how long it will take for people to get back on their feet economically, and what can be done to prevent loss of lives and livelihood in case a disaster strikes.A senior civic officer said, “The Dharavi, for example, is a hub for small- and medium-scale industries that support the livelihood of lakhs of people. There are many such small industrial areas across the city. If a disaster strikes such an area, it will impact the livelihood of countless families. To prevent such an impact, we need early prediction of probable disasters, and timely response. The artificial intelligence based system will help determine policy decisions.”This data will be digitally available to the general public as well, to determine the hazard to their plot or property, and take decisions about construction designs of their properties. Once the entire exercise is complete, the BMC will conduct training sessions for elected representatives and locals to identify possibility of manmade disasters, and how to act fast in case of a natural disaster.Kakani said, “This will also help us convince the public to evacuate dangerous premises. Right now, we have noticed there is a lot of resistance in moving out of a landslide prone area, or a dilapidated building for example. If we can educate people on the impact of such disasters, we will be able to communicate with them better.”Through disaster response over the past decades, the BMC authorities already know what areas are prone to what disasters. For example, Malad is prone to landslides; the active faultline at Panvel will impact residents of Chembur, Govandi, and other areas in the east; tsunamis or cyclones will impact residents living along the coast of Mumbai the most, and south Mumbai has the most number of old buildings.The list of 35 disasters prepared by BMC is further divided based on magnitude of impact. For example, bomb blast as a disaster has been divided into blast in a train, blast in a hospital, blast at a public place, and blast in a vehicle. Tree collapse has been divided into signs that the tree or only a branch will collapse, versus a tree collapse, and a branch collapse. Building collapse has been divided into partial collapse and building collapse, along with signs that a building will collapse or partially collapse; destruction of road traffic has been categories as disruption due to strike, water logging, or mere traffic jams.Kakani said, “The details will help the civic body train people who are first responders, to save themselves and rescue others.”A budgetary provision of ₹18.26 crore has been made for this project, in BMC’s budget 2021-22 presented before the standing committee by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-map-probable-disasters-across-mumbai-to-help-plan-city-infrastructure-101613932219193.html
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC fines 5 Jalna civic officials ₹1 lakh each for misleading court||Observing that the majesty of law had to be upheld by high-ranking officers, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently imposed a cost of ₹1 lakh each on five officials of the Jalna Municipal Corporation who were found to have given false statements in a bid to mislead the court in a public interest litigation (PIL). The officials, while giving their statement regarding a slaughter-house which the PIL had alleged was illegal, had assured the court that the slaughter-house was legal and had all the requisite permissions from various authorities. However, on perusal of records and other documents, the court found the statements to be false. To deter others to act in a similar way, the court imposed the cost on the officials. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar, while hearing the PIL filed by Ashpak Ansari and others, was informed by advocate Milind Patil that the slaughter house at Mangal Bazar, Kadrabad area, which was purportedly under the authority of Jalna Municipal Corporation was functioning illegally as it did not have a clearance from the pollution control board (PCB) since its inception in 2015-16. In earlier hearings in January, the concerned officials had told the court the slaughter house had the requisite clearance and was working as per the sanitation and hygiene norms of the civic authority. However, after the petitioners submitted photographs of the dilapidated and extremely unhealthy environment of the structure, the civic officials pressed their machinery to clear the garbage and whitewash the entire premise to show that the allegations of the petitioners were untrue. However, the counsel for PCB submitted that no clearance had been granted to the slaughter-house and added that it was even disposing waste in civic nullahs. When the court confronted the officials, they admitted to making false statements to mislead the court but sought a pardon on the grounds that they had done it for the first time and were willing to pay a penalty. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “We are of the view that the majesty of law has to be upheld and any person; howsoever high office he may hold, should not be permitted to mislead the court.” While acceding to the request of the officials not to initiate contempt of court proceedings against them, the court imposed a cost of ₹1 lakh on each of them and asked them to deposit the same with the court within March 6. “We intend to donate the said amount to the account of the District Collector, Jalna to be utilised for Covid-19 vaccination in Jalna district in those areas where poverty-stricken persons are held eligible for vaccination,” the court noted. The court, while seeking the names of the officials concerned, directed the PCB counsel to place a list of officials who had done dereliction of duty and posted the PIL for hearing on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-fines-5-jalna-civic-officials-1-lakh-each-for-misleading-court-101613932218153.html

As a guarantee, Singh had kept Tehlan’s Hyundai Creta car with him. On February 1, Tehlan went to Singh’s house and took his car. This led to an argument between them and both threatened each other of dire consequences,” the officer added.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said it seems that following the enmity over the money and the car, Tehlan killed Singh on Sunday evening. “Preliminary medical examination has confirmed that he was shot at least ten times.

Opposition parties — including the Congress, Shiv Sena, Shiromani Akali Dal, Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party and Left parties — have attacked the Centre over these laws in the past two months.“The farmers also demanded that the BJP-led Central government should give a legal guarantee on the MSP. They demanded that MSP guarantee should be implemented on all the 23 crops. The farmers also demanded that the MSP should be implemented following the recommendation of the Swaminathan commission,” Kejriwal said.Farmer leader and president of Rashtriya Jat Mahasangh, Rohit Jakhar, who attended the meeting with Kejriwal, said they will continue to protest.“By inviting farmers of western Uttar Pradesh to the Delhi legislative assembly, Kejriwal has broken all barriers of caste, religion and sect and embraced the entire Chaudhary community of UP. Kejriwal has given us respect just the way Lord Krishna gave respect to Sudama,” he said.Kuldeep Tyagi, president, Bharatiya Kisan Andolan (Meerut) said the Centre should immediately roll back the three farm laws.“The central government should rather bring a law which gives us a guarantee on MSP and this should be based on the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission. The farmer protest will continue. In the villages, the panchayats will reach out to the people and raise these demands. This battle is for the farmers, but this battle will become a battle for every citizen because farmers provide food to the entire country,” Tyagi said.On January 9, agricultural scientist Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, known as the father of India’s Green Revolution, said the Union government should fix minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce by using a broader and more comprehensive measure of cultivation costs than the one being currently used.Swaminathan first recommended that MSPs – which act as a floor price to avoid distress sales – should be “at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production” in the fifth report of the National Commission on Farmers set up under his chairmanship.The President gave his assent to The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 (FPTC), the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 (FAPAFS), and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, on September 27.The first law aims to permit the sale of agricultural produce outside the mandis regulated by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC), the second provides for contract farming and the third deregulates the production, supply, distribution of food items like cereals, pulses, potatoes, onion and edible oilseeds.The Opposition criticised the government for the way the laws were passed with the BJP oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal parting ways over the laws.The Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday passed a political resolution hailing the passage of the farm laws, which it said are aimed at improving the lot of the farmers and increasing their income. The resolution, passed at the end of a day-long national office bearers meeting, which was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A Delhi BJP spokesperson refused to comment on the chief minister’s remark on the three farm laws.On January 12, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three farm laws till further orders after several petitions were filed challenging their constitutional validity, and decided to set up a four-member committee to resolve the deadlock between the Centre and farmers’ unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-farm-laws-are-death-warrant-for-the-country-s-farmers-kejriwal-101613929880417.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport likely to have fourth runway operational by September||Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport is likely to throw open its fourth runway for operations September this year, officials said, adding that construction work was nearing completion and the operator was looking to wrap up work and hand it over to the air traffic control by July.Thereafter, the strip will undergo a certification by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and if all goes as planned, will be made operational, latest by September, the officials said.Once operational, the fourth runway will not only increase the per hour flight handling capacity of the Delhi airport, but will also cut down the waiting time for approaching and departing flights, the officials said.The new runway will be equipped with advanced landing systems allowing flight operations in visibility as low as 50 metres. The strip will be capable of catering to the biggest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, they said.Officials in the know of the development said that the basic structural construction work of the runway is almost complete and that the next few months will be spent installing equipment, testing them and in construction of other required structures near the strip.A senior officer in the ministry of civil aviation, who is aware of the development said that the runway is being built between the existing Terminal 3 and runway 29/11, which at present is the longest runway in India.“The construction work of the fourth runway had started in 2019 and is in full swing. It is likely to be completed by July. As per the plan, the airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) will hand over the air strip to its air side team and to the Delhi air traffic control in July, after which the runway will be audited by the DGCA. After due certifications and approvals, if all goes well, it is likely to be made operational by September,” the officer said.The airport operator, DIAL, declined to comment on the development.Another officer from the Delhi airport said that the construction work of the fourth runway was impacted and had to be stopped briefly in 2020 because of the raging Covid-19 pandemic. “The airport has managed to make up for lost time and will hopefully deliver the runway on time,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Delhi may bring back Covid checks for domestic flyersThe officer said that the length of the fourth runway is 4,400 metres, a little less than the existing third runway 29/11 (4,430 metres). “Delhi will have both the longest and the second longest runway in the country. Total width of the runway will be 75 metres, making it capable of handling new generation large aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-400,” the officer said.The fourth runway will also have instrument landing systems at both its ends to allow compatible aircraft to land even when the visibility is as low as 50 metres during dense fog. “This will also make Delhi airport the only one in the country to have three runways with advanced landing system,” the officer added.Talking about how the fourth runway will enhance the flight operations capacity of the airport, an official from the Delhi air traffic control said, once in use, runway 29/11 and the new runway will be used, parallelly, for arrivals and departures.“This will take the per hour capacity of Delhi airport from 75-80 flights to 105-110 flights, thereby reducing the congestion over Delhi’s airspace. At present aircraft are forced to hover and wait in queue before landing. The fourth runway will help save time making air operations smoother,” the ATC official said.The expansionDelhi airport at present is undergoing expansion to attain a passenger handling capacity of up to 140 million per year. The current capacity of the airport is of around 100 million passengers.As planned, apart from the fourth runway, the revamped airport will have a first of its kind ‘dual elevated cross taxiway’ which would help in reducing the taxiing time of aircraft. Terminal 1, which is at present closed for operations, is also being expanded and its total area will increase taking its passenger handling capacity from 20 million passengers per year to 40 million.As per the plan, the arrival and departure terminals of the airport will be integrated under a single roof to form the new integrated Terminal 1. The international transfer area of Terminal 3 will also be increased, and a 7th check-in island will be added in T3 with a connected baggage handling stems and two arrival carousels.The ongoing expansion will also impact the city side as the Central Spine Road (the main approach road to the T3) is being widened from 8 lanes to 12 lanes to cater to the expected increase in traffic. Once T1 is completed, additional lanes will be added to the departure ramp of T1 to improve traffic circulation and a dedicated corridor for cargo movement in and out of the airport, with a flyover close to NH8, will also be constructed to segregate the heavy vehicle movement from passenger vehicles.Aviation expert, Mark D Martin said that new runway will also boost efficiency of the existing 29/11. “Because of the Shiv Murti, the existing biggest runway 29/11 is not being used to its full capacity. The fourth runway will not only be an additional air strip, but in fact will be helpful in putting the runway 29/11 to its full use,” he said.Martin said even though landing on 29/11 is not a challenge task but having a displaced thresh hold because of the obstacles, it can be a challenge specially during bad weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-airport-likely-to-have-fourth-runway-operational-by-september-101613929879858.html

Polling in the five wards will be held on February 28.Two former AAP MLAs are in the fray besides other three local leaders for the five seats. Political parties in Delhi are seeing byelections to the five municipal wards - 32N (Rohini-C), 2-E (Trilokpuri), 08-E (Kalyanpuri), 41-E (Chauhan Bangar) and 62N (Shalimar Bagh North) - as a testing ground for the municipal polls next year. While the AAP is in power in the Delhi government, all three municipal corporations are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)Sisodia held a ‘padyatra’ in east Delhi’s Kondli and Trilokpuri areas in support of AAP candidate Dhirendra (Bunty Gautam) who is an AAP leader from Kondli. Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam also campaigned in the same areas, health minister Satyendar Jain held a public meeting at Rohini Sector-24.Also Read | AAP leader Gopal Rai confident of victory in MCD bypollsEnvironment minister Gopal Rai, who is also AAP’s Delhi unit convener, held a meeting with booth-level workers of the AAP at the Chauhan Bangar ward in Seelampur constituency. Former AAP MLA from Seelampur Mohammad Ishraq Khan is contesting from Chauhan Bangar.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot campaigned for Ram Chander, the AAP candidate from 32N (Rohini-C) ward. Chander had won the Bawana assembly seat in the bypoll in 2017 on AAP ticket.“The AAP leaders are trying to reach out to most of the Delhi residents by going door to door ahead of the MCD by-elections. During the campaigns, the AAP leaders are telling the citizens of Delhi about the rampant corruption in the BJP-ruled MCD for the last 15 years. Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP is the only political party that can bring development to Delhi,” said Sisodia.Rai said this is not just the election of five wards, but also the “semi-final” to overthrow the corrupt 15-year rule of BJP in the MCD.“The BJP did politics of hatred during the Delhi assembly elections, but people choose AAP again under CM Kejriwal. The AAP will defeat BJP with a historical majority in the MCD by-election just the way it did in the Delhi assembly election. The Congress will not do any good to the citizens of Delhi, but only cut votes,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/municipal-bypolls-sisodia-other-cabinet-ministers-campaign-for-party-candidates-101613929879172.html
22-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi forest dept tells infra agencies how to preserve environment||Following the orders of the Delhi high court, the city’s forest department has arranged for a workshop for all road-owning agencies, to apprise them of ways to preserve the ecology of an area while it carries out digging and construction activities.The forest department on February 19 sent a meeting notice to all road-owning, construction and development agencies in Delhi, asking them to attend the workshop, where they will be given a walk-through on ways in which construction and digging work can carried out while also preserving the ecology of the area.Along with officials from the forest department, the training session will be carried out by reputed experts in the field. Invitations have been sent out to Pradip Krishen, author and environmentalist, Prabhakar Rao, member of Kalpkrish, an environment action group, Vimlendu Jha, founder of environment NGO Swechha and a former independent member of Delhi’s Ridge Management Board, and Vallari Sheel, researcher and urban ecologist, who will also be discussing best practices with the agencies.Also Read | Forest dept restrains DJB from work on deemed forest stretch in west DelhiThe workshop will be conducted on February 23.“All officials and experts are requested to participate in the said workshop.

Complaints were received by the forest department of 30 trees being damaged on Meera Marg by the PWD work in September last year, while in January again another 12 trees were damaged by this.“The imperative to preserve, nurture and augment the green cover in the city cannot be over-emphasized. It is expected that by the next date, due measures would have been initiated by the GNCTD (Government of the National Capital of Delhi) and appropriate orders/directions would have been issued for care of, obviating harm to and for preservation of the tree cover,” the court order read.The order added, “Necessary capacity-building measures through workshops and training sessions too may be initiated within two weeks from today. The GNCTD may take the assistance of reputed NGOs to assist in the process.”The court again on February 18 acknowledged the response of the government and approved the setting up of the workshop date, highlighting that the sessions should be conducted by senior forest department officials, scientists and academicians.“Considering that there are so many agencies that undertake construction work of some form in Delhi, it is important that agencies are guided on ways in which they can carry out their work while also not harming the trees that fall in the way. We will try to give a comprehensive session to the agencies on the ways in which the ecology can be preserved as has been ordered by the court,” said a senior forest department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-forest-dept-tells-infra-agencies-how-to-preserve-environment-101613929818017.html

On Saturday, the Public Works Department (PWD) wrote to the Delhi Police asking them to take action against the construction. The PWD in its complaint clearly mentioned that the structure has come up without any permission from any of the agencies executing the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said he has called a meeting on Monday to check if the temple can be provided a legal status.Also Read | Makeshift structure comes up near site of razed Chandni Chowk temple“I have called a meeting tomorrow (Monday) to explore options to provide a legal status to the temple as it is a centre of faith of thousands of Hindus living in the area. Once a legal status is given, the structure will remain at the site and cannot be removed,” Prakash said.He said that the meeting would be attended by not only the political executives, but also officials of legal and land-related departments. “If we find that it is possible to grant the temple a legal status, then we will draft a proposal and get it approved in a House meeting on Thursday,” Prakash said.On Friday and Saturday, leaders of all the three political parties — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress — had visited the makeshift temple in Chandni Chowk and offered prayers, performed Hawan and chanted religious hymns such as Hanuman Chalisa and sundar kand.

22-02-2021||Delhi||Bullet train, Metro, bus and train: All at Sarai Kale Khan||Sarai Kale Khan is going to be the biggest transport hub of India a few years down the line with the Central government planning to integrate the area with its ambitious bullet train project.According to National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which is planning and executing the bullet train project, the Delhi to Varanasi corridor will be one of the first high-speed rail links that will come up in the country, after the Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor.“For Delhi, we are planning one station which will be in close proximity to Sarai Kale Khan and the Nizamuddin railway station. This station is being planned as the starting point for the Delhi-Varanasi corridor,” said Sushma Gaur, spokesperson of NHSRCL.The proposed Delhi Varanasi High-Speed Rail (DVHSR) corridor will have a length of about 800km and will connect the national capital with major cities in Uttar Pradesh such as Mathura, Agra, Etawah, Lucknow, Raebareli, Prayagraj, Bhadohi, Varanasi and Ayodhya. It will also be connected with the upcoming international airport in Jewar in neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district. The project will, however, take over five years to be ready as the NHSRCL is still only preparing the detailed project report.In Delhi, the idea is to connect all modes of transport with the high-speed rail (HSR), Gaur said. The corporation is planning the station in Sarai Kale Khan with this idea in mind so that people can reach the corridor via road (the Outer Ring Road), via the Delhi Metro (the Pink Line’s Hazrat Nizamuddin station), via interstate buses (Sarai Kale Khan ISBT), and via regional rail connectivity (the upcoming Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS)). It will also be connected to the Nizamuddin railway station, officials said.Already, all three RRTS corridors under Phse 1 -- the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut; Delhi-Gurugram-SNB-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat -- are slated to converge at Sarai Kale Khan when ready.Integration with Airport Express LineApart from the Delhi-Varanasi corridor, the NHSRCL is planning two more corridors from the national capital -- the Delhi-Ahmedabad line and the Delhi-Amritsar line.On January 13, the corporation wrote to the Delhi government seeking assistance in the DPR preparation of the Delhi-Ahmedabad corridor.“The NHSRCL has been entrusted with the DPR work for HSR corridor of Delhi-Jaipur-Udaipur-Gandhi Nagar- Ahmedabad. The total project length is 886km, of which approximately 4.5km are in Delhi. It is estimated to traverse through the two districts of New Delhi and south-west Delhi,” read the letter addressed to chief secretary Vijay Dev.Senior officials said currently, one common station is being planned for both the Delhi-Ahmedabad and Delhi-Amritsar corridors.“We intend to build this station in close proximity of Dwarka’s Sector 21 Metro station and the Bijwasan railway station. While preparing the DPR, integration of this station with the operational Airport Express Metro Line is also being worked out as that will give connectivity to HSR users to not just to the Delhi airport but also to Central Delhi,” the spokesperson said.It will also provide connectivity to the upcoming International Convention Centre at Dwarka’s Sector 25 and Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bullet-train-metro-bus-and-train-all-at-sarai-kale-khan-101613929698035.html

The agency will tender six such projects by the end of March, a senior DDA official said.These projects, located in Rohini, Pitampura, Shalimar Bagh, Dilshad Garden, Pooth Kalan and Haiderpur, will entail the revamp of 10 JJ clusters.There are four clusters with over 4,000 households in Rohini’s sectors 18,19 and 20. Similarly, in Haiderpur and Dilshad Garden, flats will be constructed for 1,991 and 2,645 households respectively.Also Read | DDA receives nearly 31,000 applications for its housing scheme this year“The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the six is ready. We will float the tender for one of the projects by the end of this month, and the remaining by March-end. Close to 9,600 flats will be constructed under these six projects. Tenders for more in-situ slum rehabilitation projects will be floated in the coming months.”Of the 675 slum clusters in Delhi, 499 are on Central government land, including plots owned by the DDA and the Northern Railways. Under the Centre’s PMAY, the DDA is carrying out in-situ redevelopment of 376 clusters on its land. In 2019, the land-owning agency started the household survey work in 23 slum clusters.Currently, the DDA has three in-situ redevelopment projects underway at Katputhli Colony, Jailorwala Bagh and Kalkaji Extension. A total of 5,990 flats are under-construction in these three projects.A senior DDA official said all the new in-situ rehabilitation projects will be implemented on the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis, just like the Katputhli Colony project — the first in-situ project implemented on such an arrangement.In these in-situ slum development projects, DDA plans to hire a private developer who will construct a multi-storeyed housing facility for slum dwellers (or beneficiaries identified through survey) along with a commercial component on the land where the slum exists.The commercial component will be used by the developer to recover the total cost of the project. The land will be leased to the developer, the period of which will be decided by DDA.“Learning from our past experience from Katputhli Colony project, which is likely to be constructed by the end of this year, we eased the development control norms so that the developer can recover the cost of construction and complete the work on time,” said a senior DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-to-start-work-on-26-500-ews-flats-tenders-for-six-projects-by-march-101613929697302.html

22-02-2021||Pune||Night curfew in Pune district from 11pm-6am; hotels, restaurants and bars to shut at 11 pm||The Pune district administration, on Saturday, announced curbs on the movement of residents during the night hours, equivalent to the night curfew that city witnessed during lockdown. Following a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that in the light of the increasing number of Covid patients in Pune district, there will be restrictions on public movement in the district (including Pune Municipal Corporation, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and rural areas) from 11pm to 6 am. However, essential services, such as medical stores and hospitals, milk and vegetable supply, newspaper distribution and transport of food grains, will be excluded from the restrictions. This order will be implemented from Monday, February 22, midnight. Rao also announced that hotels, restaurants and bars will be allowed to be operate only till 11 pm. “Hoteliers will have to manage the timings by advancing the last orders as public movement will be restricted from 11 pm onward,” said Rao. The timings for other shops are unchanged. “We have taken a detailed review of the Covid situation in Pune district in the meeting. As a precautionary measure we have taken some important decisions in this meeting,” said Rao, addressing the media after the meeting. “As an advanced precaution, public movement, except for essential activities, will be prohibited from 11 pm to 6 am. Closing timings of hotels, bars and restaurants will be 11 pm,” said Rao. Earlier, on February 10, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar had extended the closure timings for bars, restaurants, food courts and banquet halls, till 1 am. Pune Mayor Muralidhar Mohol warned of action against citizens if they are found roaming in the city without valid reasons. “Do not travel or roam around in the city after 11 pm unnecessarily. Strict legal action will be taken against those violating this order. Hotels and bars will have to be closed before 11 pm. Separate detailed guidelines will be issued by PMC regarding this,” Mohol tweeted. “Our business was just coming on track and these new restrictions have been imposed. This deadline will impact our business at least by 10-15 per cent. Though the closing timings of hotels and bars were extended to 1 am, very few areas had customer movement after 11 pm. When such restrictions are imposed people get scared. It will surely impact our business,” said Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune restaurant and hoteliers association. Rajesh Deshmukh, district collector, Pune, has already ordered authorities to conduct surprise inspections at marriage halls, multiplexes, theatres, schools, coaching classes, gardens, religious places, shopping malls, and restaurants, to take action against Covid violations such as not wearing of masks, not following social distancing and improper sanitisation arrangements.

22-02-2021||Jaipur||Hand over 57-kg gold, meant to weigh ex-PM Shastri, to CGST dept: Udaipur court||A court in Rajasthan's Udaipur has ordered the custody of 56.83 kilograms of gold, which was handed over by a local of Chittorgarh to the district collector in 1965 for weighing the then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, be given to the central GST department of the Union government.Former prime minister Shastri could not be weighed with the gold due to his death in Tashkent. The gold, whose market value stands at ₹27.29 crore, is lying in the treasury of the Udaipur collector.Speaking about the background of the case, Praveen Khandelwal, the standing counsel for the Government of India who is representing the CGST department, said one Gunwantlal Anjana of Chhoti Sadri in Chittorgarh claimed that he had given the gold to Ganpatlal Anjana to keep it safe. Ganpatlal claimed that the gold was his and he had handed it over it to the Chittor district collector in 1965 for weighing the then PM.Gunwantlal had filed an FIR alleging breach of trust by Ganpatlal. Acting on the FIR, Chittor police obtained the gold from the collector’s treasury in 1966.Also read: India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccinesThe additional sessions court of Udaipur, in its order on January 11, 1975, convicted Ganpatlal of breach of trust and ordered that the gold must be handed over to the Gold Control Officer appointed under the India Defence Rule.As per the rule, enforced from 1 April 1965, any gold present with anyone, if not transformed into ornament within 6 months of possession, will be declared contraband and confiscated by the government. That’s why gold custody was not given to Gunwantlal, said Khandelwal.Later, Ganpatlal challenged his conviction in the Udaipur district court and Gunwantlal appealed against giving away the gold to the Gold Control Officer. In August 1978, an additional district judge of Udaipur acquitted Ganpatlal over the benefit of the doubt and turned down Gunwantlal's plea, upholding the additional sessions court’s 1975 decision.The state government then moved the Rajasthan High Court and appealed against Ganpatlal's acquittal. Gunwantlal also appealed in the HC against the order that gave the gold's custody to the Gold Control Officer. The High Court quashed the appeals of the state government and Gunwantlal on September 14, 2007, said Khandelwal.In 2012, Ganpatlal's son Govardhan Anjana filed a writ petition in the High Court, claiming custody of the gold.Meanwhile, assistant Commissioner, CGST Chittor, also filed an application in the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) court in Udaipur, saying the gold should be handed over to them as per the 1975 order of the additional sessions court.Govardhan also filed a writ before the CJM court, seeking custody of the gold. But the CJM court ruled in favour of the CGST department.Goverdhan then moved the additional district sessions court, Udaipur. On February 17, the district sessions court ordered that the custody of the gold should be handed over to the CGST department.Khandelwal said, “Although the additional district sessions court has given its verdict in favour of the CGST, the matter is still pending before the Rajasthan High Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/hand-over-57-kg-gold-meant-to-weigh-ex-pm-shastri-to-cgst-dept-udaipur-court-101613844789299.html
