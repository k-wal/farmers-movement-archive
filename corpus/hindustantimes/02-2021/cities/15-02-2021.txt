Another meeting on late Sunday evening between chief minister Nitish Kumar and LJP MP from Nawada, Chandan Singh, led to another round of exchange of words between JD(U) and the LJP leaders.Choudhary, a close aide of CM Kumar, had been instrumental recently in enlisting the support of the sole BSP MLA Zama Khan and independent legislator Sumit Singh, both of whom were inducted into the cabinet last week. He had also caused anxieties in the LJP after his meeting with its sole MLA Raj Kumar Singh to his residence for a book launch function a few weeks back.Kanhaiya’s meeting with the JD(U) leader comes at a time when the former JNU leader is facing heat from the party after a censure motion was passed by his party at the national committee meeting at Hyderabad following alleged manhandling of a key CPI official attached to the state headquarters in Patna by him and his supporters.If CPI sources are to be believed, there had been tensions between the former JNU president and his party during the Lok Sabha elections when the CPI reportedly insisted that he shared a part of the money he had raised through crowdfunding.Though Kanhaiya was not available for comments, Choudhary denied that it was a political meeting. “People from different parties keep meeting for development related works. Nothing is cooking,” he said.Also read: Worry for Maharashtra - Local trains, laxity fuel spikeSources close to Kanhaiya insisted that it was a “non-political” meeting and that both have known each other for long. The meeting, however, was not liked by JD(U) alliance partner, the BJP.Subhash Singh, state minister from the BJP quota, called the former JNUSU president a lunatic and said his meeting with a senior leader of an alliance partner was not appropriate. JD (U) spokesperson Ajay Alok said, “Kanhaiya is welcome into our party if he chooses to give up his perverse (vikrit) ideology".Kanhaiya is also understood to have been disappointed with his party’s decision to side with the RJD, which had queered the pitch for him in the Lok Sabha polls by fielding its candidate and acknowledge Tejashwi Yadav as the undisputed leader of the five-party Grand Alliance.Leaders in the NDA, on condition of anonymity, said they feel this is another try by the JD(U) to raise its stock after its unsatisfactory performance in the assembly elections.Meeting with LJP MPAnother meeting which evoked keen interest was the meeting of Nawada LJP MP Chandan Singh with the CM late on Sunday evening. The meeting between the MP and the CM gave a chance to the JD(U) to attack the LJP, which had been questioning the development in Bihar.“Chirag Paswan has been alleging that his constituency of Jamui has been neglected and there has been no progress in Bihar at all. The meeting between his party MP and the chief minister is a rebuff to his brand of politics the CM believes in,” said JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad.The LJP sought to downplay the significance of the meeting. “Our respected MP must have met the chief minister concerning development works in his constituency. We wonder what is there to be so excited about,” LJP spokesman Ashraf Ansari said in a video statement.Paswan’s party had fielded candidates against all JD(U) nominees, which affected the performance of the ruling party in many seats. The LJP has six MPs in Lok Sabha from Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/kanhaiya-ljp-mp-meet-jdu-leaders-fuel-speculation-101613413303820.html
15-02-2021||Noida||GB Nagar records 76% turn out for second dose; few takers for mop-up round||At least 76% of 393 health workers, who got inoculated on January 16, turned up on Monday for their second Covid-19 vaccine dose, said health officials, adding that a total of 8,183 health workers out of a total of 24,453 beneficiaries have refrained from getting the Covid-19 jab in the mop-up round of the first phase of inoculation in Gautam Budh Nagar. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district vaccination officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that taking a serious note of the directions given by the state health department for increasing the vaccination turnout, the department set up 80 booths across 28 different locations in the district, for the mop-up round of Covid-19 phase-1 vaccination on Monday. “Only 2,126 health workers, out of 12,911 who were left out in the first phase, turned up for their inoculation in the mop-up round on Monday. These left-out beneficiaries could not get the jab in any of the six sessions of the first phase of vaccination,” he said. He further said that after the mop-up round, the final figure of vaccine beneficiaries in the first phase stands at 66.53%. “As many as 16,270 health workers could be inoculated in all six sessions and the mop-up round. Now, the failure of beneficiaries to get vaccinated in the mop-up round will automatically push them to the age-appropriate vaccination category, which will perhaps take place after the last round of vaccination,” he said. When asked about the reasons behind the lukewarm response to the mop-up drive, Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that while a lack of confidence in the vaccine among the health workers appears to be the main reason, the response towards the vaccine among health professionals in the private sector has also been less enthusiastic than among those employed with the government. “While many of them remained sceptical about the efficacy of the vaccine, others claimed that they do not need it as their bodies have developed immunity against the virus. Many clerical and hospital administration staff, besides some medical students, were reported to give the vaccination a miss deliberately as they claimed that since they were never on active Covid-19 duty, they didn’t want to get vaccinated,” he said. The CMO said that the health department officials had informed the beneficiaries two days ahead of their stipulated date of vaccination. “We had also informed the departments concerned of the beneficiaries about their presence or absence during the vaccination. I admit that we need to increase confidence in the vaccine and improve the public understanding of how people can help control the spread of Covid-19 in their families and their communities,” he said. Many health workers in private hospitals said they did not have a clear idea of what to expect of the vaccine; many were unhappy with the way the vaccination drive has been conducted. As a result, a large chunk of corona warriors remained undecided on the vaccine. A resident from private hospital cited absence of names as a reason for not taking the jab yet.”Since, my name is not listed, how can I take it? I’ll take it when my name appears on the list,” she said. Echoing similar views, a resident from another hospital said that before launching the vaccination drive, the opinions of doctors were not taken. “The administration prepared the list in a hurry. The low turnout is only a proof that the drive may be more of a political move rather than for actual immunisation,” he said, preferring anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-records-76-turn-out-for-second-dose-few-takers-for-mop-up-round-101613413250985.html
15-02-2021||Noida||Man kills wife, injures self in Vaishali flat; probe on||Ghaziabad: A 38-year-old man allegedly killed his wife at their house in Vaishali Sector 5 late Sunday night, and later hurt himself. The family of the deceased has filed a complaint against the man.The man, identified as Devjeet Datta, was admitted to a hospital, police said.“The couple was alone in the house when the incident took place — possibly in the intervening night of February 14-15. From the scene of crime, it seems that the man probably strangled his wife late Sunday night and later slashed his wrist. It is possible he wanted to kill himself. The cause of her death will be clear once we get the post-mortem report. The injured man was spotted by his neighbours after he walked out of his house on Monday. The locals informed the police,” said superintendent of police (City 2) Gyanendra Singh.The woman was identified as 35-year-old Puja Datta. Their 10-year-old son was staying at his grandparents’ house in Delhi’s Karol Bagh.“The motive behind the murder is still unclear as the suspect is still in the hospital, undergoing treatment. He has, however, left a note at his house, saying it was his fault and no one else should be blamed for the incident,” Singh added.According to police sources, the man had written two timings on the white board at his house — 11.35 pm on February 14, and 5 am on February 15. Police suspect he mentioned about the timing of the murder, and when he injured himself.One CCTV footage from near the flat has also emerged, in which the man could be seen walking out of his house around 9 am on Monday.The suspect works at an online platform to earn a livelihood. He also heads a parents’ association at a private school in Indirapuram, where his wife was a teacher two years ago, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-kills-wife-injures-self-in-vaishali-flat-probe-on-101613413011606.html
15-02-2021||Noida||12 days after man’s death over parking spot, family ‘awaits’ police action||Twelve days after a 55-year-old businessman died following an altercation with his neighbour over a parking spot, the family has alleged that Noida Police is yet to take due action in the case.The deceased, Rajiv Lal (55), was a resident of Sector 15A. On the evening of December 26, Lal found his parking spot outside his house being blocked by a neighbour. When he confronted, his family became aggressive. The two got in an argument, and the suspect attacked Lal, who ended up with chest injuries.He was taken to a private hospital in Sector 27 for treatment, from where he was discharged days later. He, however, again complained of chest pain on January 31 and eventually died on February 3 at the same hospital.A case had initially been registered at the Sector 20 police against the neighbour for an attempt to commit culpable homicide. However, the section was later changed to 323 of the Indian Penal Code (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), because of which the suspect was granted bail.The family has vehemently objected to the manner in which the case was handled, following which the investigation was transferred from the Noida Zone to Central Noida’s Phase 2 police station. However, they are still awaiting police action.“It has been more than ten days since he passed away and the police are yet to take any action. We are still waiting for justice to be served,” said Ayushi Lal, daughter of the deceased.The family members have also taken extensively to social media to demand thorough police action in the case.Meanwhile, Noida Police has claimed that a probe in the matter is underway.“The investigating officer is reviewing all the evidence. All medico-legal statements are being recorded and the case is being thoroughly reviewed after which we will take the necessary action,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/12-days-after-man-s-death-over-parking-spot-family-awaits-police-action-101613413010989.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Only around 51% health workers have taken 2nd vaccine dose in Delhi||Just over half the health care workers in the city who received a shot of the coronavirus vaccine during the first two days of the inoculation drive have returned for their second shot in the two days since the state government began administering the final dose of the jab, district data shows. So far, 4,047, or 51.1%, of health care workers have received the second dose of the vaccine, including 2,191 who turned up to get the second dose of the vaccine on Monday. Beneficiaries who received a dose of the coronavirus vaccine on January 16, when the nationwide inoculation programme kicked off, were eligible to get the second dose on Saturday. While 1,856 health care workers received the second shot on Saturday, experts said they hoped the turnout would significantly increase after the weekend. Both the vaccines being administered in the country, Covaxin and Covishield, require two doses be given four to six weeks apart, as per the national drug regulator. However, some data suggests that the vaccine by Oxford/Astrazeneca (whose Indian variant is covishield) has better efficacy if administered after 12 weeks. “There are a lot of messages going around among doctors and other healthcare workers that the immune response is better when the doses are given 12 weeks apart. This may be a reason many might want to wait till the six week cut-off to get the shot,” Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College had told HT on Saturday. Meanwhile on Monday, nearly 15,000 people in Delhi received the first dose of the vaccines, across 265 centres. This puts the overall vaccine coverage — proportion of people who received the vaccines among those targeted — in Delhi at 56.4%. Government data shows that over half the people who were given the shots on Monday were front line workers, while the rest were those classified as “front line workers”. “The number of health care workers coming to the centres is slowly going down, with more and more frontline workers, especially police personnel, coming to get the shots. We have asked the healthcare workers who haven’t received the vaccine yet to do so at the earliest because we have to end the drive for them on February 20,” said a senior district official. The central government has set a February 20 deadline to vaccinate all health care workers who want to get the shots, and March 1 for frontline workers. An additional five days will be allowed for “mop-up” activity to immunise anyone who is left out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-around-51-health-workers-have-taken-2nd-vaccine-dose-in-delhi-101613412953452.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Co-WIN app develops glitch again: Names of many Mumbai health workers go missing||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started administering the second jab of Covid-19 vaccines to beneficiaries who were inoculated on January 16, many healthcare workers (HCWs) could not get the shot as their names were missing in the ‘partially vaccinated’ section owing to a technical glitch on the centralised Co-WIN app. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) rules, beneficiaries of Covishield and Covaxin have to take the second dose after 28 days of taking the first vaccine. All 1,926 beneficiaries who were vaccinated on January 16, the first day of the nation-wide mass immunisation drive, were supposed to get the second dose on Monday. BMC claims they don’t have the cumulative data. “Names of some HCWs who took the first vaccines were missing from the Co-WIN app on Monday. So, we couldn’t vaccinate them. We had to send them home,” said Dr Sankhe Lalit, incharge of the Covaxin immunisation programme at JJ hospital. Dr Sandhaya More, a dentist, who went to Nair Hospital, said, “I had to change my appointments to get my second shot. But after reaching the hospital, I was told that my name was not visible on the app. I was again asked to come next week.” Also, doctors whose names were showing on the app didn’t get any auto generated message from Co-WIN about their scheduled appointment for the second dose. Dr Gautam Bhansali, a consultant physician with Bombay Hospital was informed telephonically on Sunday night to reach BKC jumbo centre for his vaccination. A senior health officer seeking anonymity said on January 16, as the application didn’t work, it didn’t register the names of the beneficiaries who got the first shot. So now, the application is failing to generate the names of those HCWs for their second shot. Another staff from BYL Nair hospital said they haven’t been allowed to give second dose offline if their names don’t get reflected on the system. According to experts, the first dose of the vaccine helps recognise the virus and ramp up the immune system which helps the body fight against diseases. The second dose is called the booster shot, which helps in further boosting of the immune system. Dr Rahul Pandit, director-Critical Care, Fortis Hospital, Mumbai, said, “Scientific evidence and data available for Covishield says the second dose must be taken within 8-12 weeks because the efficacy is better. No such data is available for Covaxin. In the public health set-up, one needs to follow the guidelines and if our national immunisation guidelines say the second dose must be taken on completion of four weeks, we should abide by it,” he said. Of the 1,926 beneficiaries who got first dose on January 16, only 71 got their second dose, which stands as 3.68% turnout. BMC, in its press release, blamed the glitch in the CoWIN app as the reason behind the low turnout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cowin-app-develops-glitch-again-names-of-many-mumbai-health-workers-go-missing-101613412952950.html
15-02-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Man kills minor girl for rejecting his proposal; held||Greater Noida: A 25-year-old man was arrested on Monday for allegedly strangling a 15-year-old girl to death in Surajpur after she rejected his marriage proposal. The victim’s family members alleged that the victim was sexually assaulted before murder, citing the post-mortem report.The suspect, Sunil Yadav who is a native of Ghazipur, had shifted to a rented accommodation in the victim’s neighbourhood on January 20, police said, adding that the incident took place on February 8.The victim was a native of Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh. The complainant, victim’s elder brother, said that he, along with his wife, 2.5-year-old son, father, and two sisters aged 15 and 10 years had shifted to a rented accommodation in Surajpur on January 17. According to the police, the building has 11 rooms at the ground floor, while first and second floors are incomplete and presently vacant where the murder took place. The suspect also lived in one of the rooms at the ground floor of the building. The complainant said he, along with his wife and father, went for work at a private company while his sisters looked after his son at home. “On February 8 evening, my sister went missing from the house. We launched a search and found her dead at the first floor. She had injuries in head and neck. The post-mortem report states cause of death as ‘asphyxia due to strangulation’ and also suggests sexual assault,” he alleged.A case was registered under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code at Surajpur police station.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said, “Police investigation shows the girl had rejected Yadav’s proposal as she was in a relationship with another boy from her native town. That boy had visited her on February 8. The suspect became jealous of their friendship after seeing them together, and he planned to murder the girl,” he said.According to police, when the girl’s friend left the house and the victim went upstairs to bring clothes, Yadav approached her and strangled her on the first floor and dumped the body in a vacant room.Chander said police scanned the victim’s call records and first detained her friend. “He revealed that he was in a relationship with her and did not kill her. He revealed it was Yadav who was trying to make friendship with the victim. Police then picked up Yadav who admitted his role in the murder,” he said.On the allegation of sexual assault, the DCP said, “The medical report does not clearly state if there was a sexual assault. We will seek medical opinion, and if rape is confirmed, we will add the rape charges to the FIR as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-man-kills-minor-girl-for-rejecting-his-proposal-held-101613412951088.html

The government, which has held several rounds of talks with the farmers, says that all assets of farmers will be safeguarded and the new laws will not scrap the Minimum Support Price or MSP. Kejriwal has visited the protesting farmers at the Singhu border at least twice. He visited the protest site on December 7 to review the arrangements by the Delhi government which included tents and sanitation facilities. On December 8, when the protesting farmers called for a Bharat Bandh, Kejriwal said the Delhi Police put him under “house arrest” to prevent him from meeting the farmers.

15-02-2021||Noida||Noida begins developing park on landfill site||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Monday planted hundreds of saplings to develop part of a landfill site in Sector 145 as a park after remediation of about 200,000 tonnes of waste. The authority has planned to convert the entire landfill into a green zone in the next eight months, officials said.“Today, we planted 250 saplings on the land, which is freed of at least 2 lakh tonnes of waste. We are developing around 8,000 square metres area as park, and gradually we will convert entire 20,000 square metres of the landfill into a park,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority.In June 2018, the authority had identified around 20,000 square metres land for the remediation of waste. Now, the authority has decided to make sure that the waste is treated in respective sectors, said the officials.As per the official figures, the city produces about 900 metric tonne waste daily. The authority has been emphasising on the treatment of biodegradable waste at generation point and encouraging the citizens to segregate waste at source so that green waste reaches the compost plants being set up at multiple locations.“We have set up construction and demolition plant to treat construction waste. Besides, green waste is being treated at compost plants and other waste is also handled as per the rules. In the next eight months, we will convert entire 20,000 square metres landfill site into a green zone. We will plant trees daily and will develop a green zone on the 8,000 square metres area in the next one month,” said Singh.This temporary landfill site is surrounded by a large forest reserve on one side and Hindon river on the other. Mubarakpur village is at a distance of around 2km from Hindon. The land is located off the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. People living around the landfill had been demanding to clear the waste from the site.“As per the waste management rules 2016, it is advised that waste should be treated by the bulk waste producers and individuals so that there is no need of a landfill site,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-begins-developing-park-on-landfill-site-101613412830978.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Chembur area to go under lockdown?||With M-West ward that covers Chembur clocking in the highest number of new Covid-19 cases, a majority of them from high-rises, the ward office on Monday started issuing new guidelines to societies and directed the hawkers to undergo Covid-19 tests. Civic officials also hinted at the possibility of “imposition of local lockdown measures” to control rising cases, and insisted on starting the drive for the elderly in the ward at the earliest.A week ago, the ward was recording less than 15 new cases daily, which has now increased to more than 25 cases. The daily Covid-19 growth rate of the ward is 0.28%, higher than the city’s average growth rate of 0.14%. Civic officials have blamed negligent behaviour by citizens who are violating guidelines issued by the Centre and state government. Taking cognisance of the situation, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started issuing stringent guidelines to residential societies in the ward with the subject line—‘Appeal/Instructions to all societies to follow strict covid guidelines’.Also Watch | Covid update: 18-19 vaccines in India pipeline; IIT on virus life; SII promiseThe notice has laid down five basic guidelines that societies need to implement. These are – “Your society will restrict entry of outsiders to minimum including maids/milk man etc; measures like thermal screening to be strictly implemented; positive cases, if any in society, to follow strict quarantine guidelines by family for 14 days; others in the family to get tested compulsorily as high-risk contacts and any other symptomatic person in society to get checked for Covid through MCGM.”The notice further reads that the civic body has started sealing buildings and societies with higher prevalence of Covid-19 cases.As HT reported on Monday, there has been an increase in group infections in the ward with public dropping their guard. “We have also started a house-to-house survey. We are getting cases of group infection where seven-eight people from the same family have tested positive for the virus. It is the responsibility of the public to follow safety rules,” said Prithviraj Chauhan, assistant municipal commissioner, M/W ward. “Weddings and family functions are turning into super spreader events.”While issuing guidelines to residential societies, the ward officer also hinted at imposition of a local lockdown if citizens are not cautious in controlling the cases.The notice available with HT reads, “At present M-W ward is reporting the highest daily cases which is matter of concern and there are chances that we might have to impose local lockdown measures.” When asked, Chauhan said he has already informed the higher authority about it. “The final call on imposing local lockdown has to be taken by the BMC,” he added.To control the spread, the ward officer has suggested starting the vaccination programme for the elderly at the earliest. “The AMC (the additional municipal commissioner) will be reviewing the issue on vaccination, and take a decision on it tomorrow,” he added.Additionally, the ward, starting February 14, started testing hawkers and shopkeepers. “Just like the past, we have started focusing on places that get a high number of people. So, we are testing hawkers from ‘khao gallies’ and vegetables sellers,” said Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical officer health (MOH) of the ward.As per BMC dashboard, M-W ward has the lowest doubling rate (245 days). Till February 13, the average doubling rate of the city stood at 479 days.On Sunday, the city recorded more than 600 new cases. Talking to HT, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, attributed it to four factors —foreign travellers, domestic passengers from Kerala, more testing and resumption of local trains for all. “On a daily basis, we are conducting over 15,000 tests, which is contributing to new Covid-19 cases. Opening local trains for everyone can also be a factor, but it would be too early to say so. We have to wait for another week to make an assessment,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-chembur-area-to-go-under-lockdown-101613412712148.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Worry for Maharashtra: Local trains, laxity fuel spike||Maharashtra, the state worst-hit by Covid-19 in India, is again seeing a resurgence of new cases bringing an end to a three-month-long plateau, two weeks after the state government started relaxing norms of social movement, including the wider restart of local trains in Mumbai.This spike in cases is particularly noticeable in Mumbai and surrounding areas, and is being attributed by experts to the resumption in local train services since February 1, lifting of most curbs in recent weeks, and laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour.In the past week, the state reported 21,356 new infections of Covid-19 – the highest in any week since the week ending January 17. On Sunday, the state reported 4,092 new cases – the highest single-day cases since January 6. And on Monday, when number generally dip due to drop in testing numbers over the weekend, there were 3,365 new cases – the most reported on a Monday since January 4.The state government insists that it won’t be reimposing restrictions on movement in the immediate future. State health minister Rajesh Tope said they see reimposition of curbs as the last resort. For now, they are focusing on preventive measures.Read more: Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra minister looks at ‘3T formula’However, state deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said they may have to take some harsh decisions as people have “stopped following Covid-appropriate rules”.The state government has directed all district collectors and commissioners to strictly follow the “3T principle (testing, tracking and treatment)” and take measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. The health minister also said they have directed officials to increase testing at locations where they notice a rise in cases.In Mumbai, this resurgence in cases has come two weeks after the local trains, considered the lifeline of the city, were restarted for the general public from February 1. General public is now allowed to travel from the first train of the day till 7am, 12pm to 4pm, and post 9pm till the last train. In the last two weeks, at least 15 million people have travelled on the local trains, according to official figures.There is no cap in Mumbai for passengers per coach in local trains. Social distancing norms such as masks and social distancing have been requested, but not enforced. In contrast, Delhi Metro enforces a limit of 50 persons in a single coach, queue management outside stations and members of a special task force conduct visits on stations and trains to fine passengers violating mask and social distancing norms.Read more: ‘Statement distorted, I said BJP should be...’: Maharashtra home minister Deshmukh on probe into celebrities’ tweetsOfficials from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said they are having second thoughts about any further relaxations in local train timings for the general public. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We are not taking any decision yet. We will monitor the situation until February 22.”The city has been reporting over 500 cases since February 10, and on Sunday, the city reported 645 Covid-19 cases on Sunday followed by four deaths. Overall, the city has reported 314,076 Covid-19 cases and 11,419 deaths. Mumbai is one of the worst-hit regions in the country with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.63% — more than double the national average of 1.43%.Tope dismissed the idea of suspending local train services. He said that they have started local train services only recently and that too with staggered timings to avoid crowding. “We are monitoring the situation and see no reason to take extreme steps immediately... It has certainly alarmed us...

If this is not done then lockdown is required to be re-imposed to control the situation,” Tope told reporters in Aurangabad.Experts said that restriction of some norms such as night curfews may be required if cases continue to rise.“We might notice some spike in the number of cases owing to gradual reopening and unlocking, but this does not mean we go on shutting the city again. We will have to restrict movement and maybe night curfew can be one solution here. Secondly, the government should also focus on increasing the speed of vaccination. With vaccination, cases will come under control gradually,” said Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a physician from the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/worry-for-maharashtra-local-trains-laxity-fuel-spike-101613412420070.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai breathes cleanest air of the year, pollution levels drop||The city breathed its cleanest air so far this year as rising temperatures and wind from the sea cleared up pollution levels.Mumbai recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI)—a pollution measuring indicator—of 115 on Monday, significantly down from 186 on Sunday. The AQI was in the 'moderate' category. Before this, the city’s lowest AQI was 156 (moderate) on January 19.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded across 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as 'good'; 51-100 as 'satisfactory'; 101-200 as 'moderate'; 201-300 as 'poor'; 301-400 as 'very poor' and above 400 as 'severe'.Of the 10 locations measured, only Andheri recorded poor quality air with an AQI of 208. Malad recorded an AQI of 173 and Navi Mumbai recorded 157 but both were in the moderate category.Also read: Disengagement in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso in full swing, may be over soonOn September 4, 2019, Mumbai recorded its all-time best AQI of 12 since SAFAR began measuring air quality in June 2015. Last year on June 30, the city equalled its best AQI of 12.“Temperatures have been on the rise for some time now, bringing down pollution levels. Clean winds from the ocean have further improved the air quality in Mumbai. It is expected to remain in the moderate category for the next two days,” said a SAFAR spokesperson.Meanwhile, minimum temperatures increased slightly. At the Colaba station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), minimum temperature of 21.2 degrees Celsius was recorded, up from Sunday’s 20.5 degrees Celsius and a degree above normal. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature was up from Sunday’s 19.4 degrees Celsius to 20.2 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees above normal.The maximum temperature at Colaba was 29.4 degrees Celsius, at par with normal. At Santacruz, the maximum temperature was 29.9 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-breathes-cleanest-air-of-the-year-pollution-levels-drop-101613411710778.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||City air worsens due to low wind speed||The city’s air quality entered the ‘very poor’ zone on Monday with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin recording the air quality index (AQI) at 306 — a rise from Sunday’s AQI reading of 288 in the ‘poor’ category. While the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature on Monday, the IMD’s AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 12.6 degrees Celsius. The city’s maximum temperature stood at 27 degrees Celsius. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 27 and 10 degrees Celsius respectively on Tuesday. The IMD, on Monday, also said that warmer night temperatures are likely to continue over the plains of North India during the next five days. Experts said that the deterioration of air quality was on the account of low surface winds which were not favourable for effective dispersal of pollutants. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that the AQI is expected to improve in the next two days due to better ventilation conditions. “While the wind speed is not improving much, the mixing height is increasing day by day due to which we can expect better ventilation and subsequently better air quality in the next two days,” said Soni. The mixing height is the vertical height at which suspended particles mix with the air The level of ultra-fine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 232.55 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 540.25µg/m3 on Monday.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve marginally on account of better ventilation but remain in the lower range of ‘very poor’ category until Wednesday. Subsequently, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the lower range of ‘very poor’ category over the next five days. Further improvement in air quality is expected after February 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-air-worsens-due-to-low-wind-speed-101613411691592.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Two men attacked by group near Ghata crossing; case filed||Two men were assaulted by unidentified persons near Ghata crossing on Gurugram-Faridabad Road on Friday night. The victims were travelling returning home with their families in two cars, when one got punctured. They got down from their cars and went to a nearby shop, where they were attacked by unidentified men. No arrests were made so far. The incident took place on Friday night, while the case was filed on Sunday, said the police, adding that they are yet a find a reason behind the attack. Victims alleged that they got down and took the punctured tyre to a nearby shop. As they were waiting for the tyre to get fixed, seven to eight unidentified men started abusing and assaulting them all of a sudden. They alleged that they even pelted stones at them, following which they ran towards other side of the road and raised alarm. Pawan Kumar, station house officer(SHO) of Sector 56 police station said few of commuters stopped by the road side and asked them the matter. “The victims narrated their ordeal. Meanwhile the suspects fled the spot fearing police action. The commuters waited until the victims collected their tyre from the repair shop and went on their way,” he said. Jagat Singh, one of the victims said the incident took place ahead of Ghatta crossing around 1.40am. “We went to Faridabad and got first aid. We were frightened as we could not figure out as why would anyone attack us randomly,” he said. The police registered a case under sections 323 (assault), 506(criminal intimidation), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 56 police station on Sunday. Kumar said they have registered a case against the unidentified persons and are conducting investigation. “We have recorded statement of the victims and are recording statements of the eye witnesses, including the shop keeper. We are also scanning CCTV footage from a few locations nearby to identify the suspects. So far, we are unaware of the reason behind the incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-men-attacked-by-group-near-ghata-crossing-case-filed-101613411690859.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Healthcare workers start receiving second dose of Covid-19 vaccines||The administration of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines on Monday got off to a slow start, with a 61.5% coverage, according to the district health department data. Of the 608 people who received the first doses of the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines on January 16, only 369 turned up for the second shot after 29 days. Officials expect the footfall to increase on the next day of the vaccination drive, scheduled for February 18. “Healthcare workers are aware of the two-shot regimen against coronavirus disease. They will gradually come for the second dose as there is a window period of four to six weeks to take the second vaccine jab,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Both the vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — comprise two doses, to be administered at a time interval of 28 days. But according to apex drug regulator and experts, the second dose can be given anytime between four and six weeks. Officials said that the inoculation could become challenging for the health department if partially vaccinated healthcare workers have switched jobs in the one-month period. “If a health worker has switched to a facility within the city, then they can easily walk-in at the session site at the facility or they will be informed to visit the previous vaccination site where they took the first dose. There is, however, no clarity regarding inoculation of people who have moved to other districts in Haryana or a different state,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. In Gurugram more than 24,000 healthcare workers have already taken the first shot and are registered as partially vaccinated on the Co-WIN, a digital platform handling real time data on vaccination. There are almost 30,000 healthcare workers, after removing duplicity, registered as vaccine beneficiaries on the platform. Since the inoculation process has been slow, the district health department has been holding single-session vaccinations every day for the healthcare staff. On Monday, nine of 50 healthcare workers turned up to take the first shot of their vaccine. With the beginning of second dose drive, it has become a daunting task for the health department to set up vaccination sites at private hospitals where the first round has been conducted, while simultaneously managing vaccination sites for front-line workers. “After the first dose, private and public health facilities have limited targeted beneficiaries to be covered, considering that vaccination sites for healthcare workers will decrease in every hospital. On the other hand, the state health department has not conveyed any specific deadline for completing the vaccination of front-line workers. Therefore, the department will continue with that too,” said Singh. On Monday, as a part of the weekly statewide mega vaccination drive, the health department targeted at least 4,900 front-line workers from the police department, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), National Security Guards (NSG), panchayati raj institutions, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB), Border Security Force (BSF), revenue department and Bhondsi jail. Among the targeted, 2,902 took the first dose of the vaccine. MCG vaccination sites reported a poor footfall, with only 398 of 1,100 targeted staff turning up for the vaccine jab. Similarly, only 253 police personnel of the 1,000 targeted personnel got inoculated. The revenue department reported the least footfall, with only five of 100 taking the shot. “Department heads have been informed about the poor footfall. It is likely that in the vaccination drive to be held on February 18, employees will turn up,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/healthcare-workers-start-receiving-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccines-101613411634336.html

Mewat residents have alleged that the lack of a railway line has held back the region in terms of development, despite it being located close to Delhi and Gurugram. Addressing a gathering at the Gurugram railway station, Singh said that the proposal to set up a 104-kilometre railway line connecting Delhi, Nuh Firozepur Jhirka and Alwar has been approved in the latest railway budget and provision for funds has also been made. “The proposed railway line in Mewat will ensure all-round development and growth. Several other rail infrastructure projects have also been approved,” he said. On the occasion, the Gurugram MP also inaugurated a foot overbridge and an escalator at the railway station, both of which have been jointly set up by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and the Indian Railways. He also, digitally, laid the foundation stone of an underpass at the Jatoli railway crossing. Singh also said that the proposal to electrify the railway line between Farrukhnagar and Garhi Harsaru has also been approved and this will ensure that pollution in the city is reduced considerably. Speaking on the occasion, SC Jain, division railway manager, Delhi, said that in the last three years, 16 underpasses and six railway overbridges have been constructed in the region and more such works are on the anvil in coming years. Senior officials from the Gurugram district administration and MCG were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/new-rail-line-will-connect-nuh-with-delhi-says-inderjit-singh-in-gurugram-101613411633772.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Govt launches web portal to garner information on unauthorised colonies||The government on Monday launched a new web portal to get information about lack of basic facilities in unauthorised colonies across the state. The web portal — tcpharyana.gov.in/uac — was launched by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Chandigarh to help residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and developers to share information about the lack of basic amenities and infrastructure in their colonies. A statement issued by the state government said that this information will help authorities in making policy decisions regarding these colonies and will further assist in rendering basic amenities to the illegal colonies. As per the statement, the RWAs/colony developers can submit information regarding the deficient basic amenities by March 31, 2021, on the web portal. Speaking on the occasion, Khattar said that people residing in these colonies have invested their hard-earned money to build their houses without knowing the status of the colonies, due to which they have faced departmental action. He said that state government is committed to providing basic amenities to all its citizens.During the launch of the portal, the officers of Town and Country Planning Department informed that taking cognizance of these illegal colonies, the authorities have taken strict action against such developments. A total of 2,183 FIRs were registered by the police department and 2,430 demolition drives have been conducted throughout the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/govt-launches-web-portal-to-garner-information-on-unauthorised-colonies-101613411632464.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Technical glitches hinder online test for students||Online assessments for students in government schools across the city were hampered due to technical glitches on Monday, the first day of app-based assessment for students of classes 3 to 8 and class 11. Officials said that technical hiccups had occurred to a server overload. Mini Satija, primary in-charge, Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said that while students had to face intermittent technical issues, they were giving the tests and had time till tomorrow to complete the same. “The response from students in the morning was good but there were technical issues in the afternoon. The site was inaccessible and there were some issues with the formatting of the questions. Some questions were not getting displayed,” said Satija. She said that the department had been apprised about the technical faults that had occurred throughout the day. “We are tracking the progress of students and calling students who are yet to take the test. We had also called some parents to school since they were facing issues with the app,” said Satija. Structured online assessment tests are being conducted for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic started last year. These tests are being conducted through an app called AVSAR, which will allow students to take the test within 24 hours from its commencement. Teachers said that the tests will give them an idea about the progress made by students during the previous year, since in-person school visits for these students are either restricted or were started only this month. Ashok Kumar, head teacher of primary school, Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that the app did not work on Monday and only a few students were able to complete the test. “Very few students were able to complete the test since the app was not working. Some students did not have phones, so we asked to them visit the school. They were able to use the app on our phones,” said Kumar. District elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that technical issues that had arisen on account of heavy server load were being addressed. “The app server was down since it’s being used across the whole state today. Students have 24 hours to take the test and can attempt it tomorrow,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/technical-glitches-hinder-online-test-for-students-101613411633238.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Man booked for killing wife, search on to trace him||A 38-year-old man was booked on Sunday for allegedly murdering his wife at their residence in Sirhaul village. According to the police, the man brutally assaulted his wife in an argument over a suspected extramarital affair and fled the spot. The police identified the suspect as Satish Kumar, who works as a security guard at a private company and was living at a rented accommodation in Sirhaul village for the past three years with his wife, Ruby, 32, and their two children. They belonged to Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh.Akshay Singh, Ruby’s brother, who lives in Delhi, told the police that he received a call from his sister’s friend who had found her body at the residence. “I came to Gurugram and saw her lying on the bed. I immediately informed the police control room and tried to wake her up but she was dead. Her nose, mouth and ears were bleeding and she had suffered severe injuries all over her body,” he said.

15-02-2021||Gurugram||Toll payment to go digital-only, deployment increased in Kherki Daula||The Gurugram police and highway concessionaire have decided to increase deployment of traffic personnel and marshals at the Kherki Daula toll plaza to prevent jams on Tuesday morning, when the toll goes fully digital and will accept payments only through FASTags.Personnel have also been deployed to guide motorists to FASTag sale point, set up at the spot, in case they don’t have one. The union ministry has made it mandatory for all toll payments to be made through FASTags from February 16.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the concessionaire Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) and the police are bracing for heavy congestion as around 20% of the vehicles that pass through are yet to obtain FASTags while 10-15% of them don’t maintain the minimum balance. Besides, several government vehicles also do not have FASTags.MCEPL officials said that this 30% of commuters are responsible for the bottlenecks at the 25-laned toll plaza, as found during the dry runs in the past three to four months.Gurugram police officials also held a detailed meeting with the NHAI and toll concessionaire on Monday on the strategy to manage the situation.On Monday, a large queue was witnessed at the FASTag counter at the toll plaza as commuters ahead of the deadline. A senior MCEPL official said that the sale of SMARTags, which averaged around 200 per day earlier, had increased to 500 over the last three days. “The vehicle owners should buy tags, keep minimum balance in their accounts and the government vehicles should also get these at the earliest. We have deployed marshals and our teams would be ready in the morning for traffic management,” an MCEPL official said, requesting anonymity.The NHAI has also issued directions to concessionaire that motorists without a FASTag must be directed to purchase one on the spot, activate it and then enter the toll plaza. In case this is not possible, the marshals should divert these vehicles to the lane on the extreme left, through which they will be allowed to cross after paying double the toll fee, as per an order issued by Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI, Gurugram.The Gurugram police, meanwhile, is taking no chances as any major jam on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway would impact traffic movement on city roads. The recent spurt in traffic on city roads and the expressway is also a major cause for concern, said police officials.More than 50 traffic police personnel will be deployed to manage and monitor traffic at the toll plaza and a unit is already stationed there to maintain order and ensure smooth traffic movement, said officials.Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Manesar, said that starting midnight, four personnel will be deployed on each lane to monitor traffic. “The deployment will start by 12 midnight as traffic congestion is expected and most of the commuters are unaware of the implementation of digital payments that will come into force from Tuesday morning,” he said.The police officials also said that the main challenge at the plaza will be posed by locals, who use their ID cards for claiming exemption and hence, have not got the tags for their vehicles.KK Rao, the commissioner of police said that traffic officials and Manesar police has been asked to keep a tab on the traffic movement and to ensure all the commuters are dealt with ease and supported. “We aim to ensure congestion-free movement of vehicles and smooth passage for commuters. Precautions have been taken for the same and the toll staff has also been asked not to land in any argument or scuffle with the commuters. Our teams will keep a close watch on all the lanes,” he said.Rao observed that there are a few RFID readers that are old and slow in processing tags. “We have asked them to either replace the machines or repair them to ensure smooth traffic. Our teams are coordinating with the toll operators and have planned and chalked out plans to guide commuters to get FASTags installed before entering the lanes. We have started awareness on the stretch so that those do not have these digital tags can get them before tonight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/toll-payment-to-go-digital-only-deployment-increased-in-kherki-daula-101613411630906.html

On Sunday, the police arrested three suspects and are conducting raids to arrest five more of the gang.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), who is in charge of cracking down on illegal mining in the region, said that these gangs are so powerful that they attack the police teams and snatch their impounded vehicles. “The mining operations have been taking place in these three districts for over two decades. In November 2019, special teams were formed to crack down on illegal mining operations in the Aravallis and the operations had started in December 2019. Since then, we have been successful in controlling the mining in Nuh, Tauru and Faridabad belt,” he said.In 2020, 1,862 cases were registered against 900 people while in 2019, 185 people were arrested over 150 cases were registered.A total of 2,804 vehicles, including tippers, trucks, tractor-trolleys, and earthmovers, have been seized by the police between December 2019 and February 15, 2021. This number also includes 425 vehicles seized in November— the highest so far. This year, the police have already impounded 123 vehicles.Sangwan said that first-time offenders can get back their vehicles upon paying a fine of ₹4 lakh, while second-time offenders have to pay at least 50% of the showroom value of the vehicle impounded. “Also, the impounded vehicle owner has to pay a royalty — the value of the mineral loaded on the vehicles, either crushed stones or clay sand, — along with ₹10,000 for releasing impounded vehicles,” he said.During the incident that took place last Saturday, two policemen deployed at Kathpula bridge intercepted a vehicle ferrying clay sand on Saturday night, following which the drivers called more people, assaulted the police and fled the spot.A case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 379 (theft), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Faridabad police station on Sunday.The three members arrested were identified as Rajpal Singh, Brahm Dutt and Jiten Kumar of Faridabad, and were sent to judicial custody on Monday.

Kappan was upset with the move. However, it is said that the UDF would have fielded Kappan for the seat.The former NCP leader had claimed the support of seven district presidents and nine office bearers of the NCP and had decided to part ways with the party and the LDF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-expels-kerala-legislator-mani-kappan-over-anti-party-activities-101613411214201.html
15-02-2021||Gurugram||Proposed petrol pump on Aravalli land in violation of environment ministry norms, rules NGT||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ruled that land allotted for a proposed petrol pump in Chakkarpur village violates norms set by the union environment ministry. Upholding the status of the land parcel — allotted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to a public sector oil and gas company — as Aravalli forest, the NGT has directed the district administration to “enforce the law” in the matter and file an action taken report.This development comes on the back of a petition filed by a city-based NGO, Manav Awaaj Trust, in January. The petition, a copy of which is with HT, alleges that the MCG’s allotment of land for the project amounts to an “unlawful diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes”.As per revenue records, reviewed by HT, the land in question is also categorised as “gair mumkin pahad” or uncultivable hilly lands. The petition also references a letter from the district forest department to the deputy commissioner, dated July 29, 2020, pointing out this violation.The letter from the forest department to the district administration states that the land “comes under the Aravalli plantation zone. This zone is considered as a forest as per the Supreme Court (SC). Any non-forestry activity conducted in the forest area without the permission of MoEF&CC is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and orders of the SC.”The letter further states that the implementing agency must first take permission from the Centre before proceeding with the project.Hearing the matter on February 9, the NGT noted, “In spite of the said stand of the forest department, the MCG has failed to take the remedial action to enforce the law. Use of forest land for non-forest purposes is also in violation of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) notification dated 07.05.1992 with regard to the Aravalli range”. A copy of the order was shared with HT on Monday.Despite the current laws, the MCG had, on March 15, 2019, leased out a 150-square metre land parcel in Chakkarpur to a private sector entity for a period of 30 years, with a payable rent of ₹2.25 lakh per month (subject to a 25% increase every three years). The petrol pump, however, is yet to come up.Abhay Jain, spokesperson, Manav Awaaj Trust said, “We took the matter to NGT after the government did not take any action despite repeated requests to not go ahead with the project on forest land. The NGT has now taken cognizance of the issue of land leased by the municipal corporation to install petrol pumps in an area of the forest department in Gurugram.”Vinay Pratap Singh, municipal commissioner, Gurugam, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. However, speaking to HT regarding the matter in December last year, Singh had said, “We have received representation regarding the apprehensions related to grant of lease of land for fuel retail outlet (petrol pump). Environmental concerns about forest and Aravalli notification have been raised, citing various environmental regulations and orders of courts. We are examining the case to clear all apprehensions before moving forward with the lease. The applicant will have to get all environmental and forest clearances from concerned government department before getting permission from MCG.” On January 16, 2021, Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla also wrote to the principal secretary of Urban Local Bodies department, Haryana government, requesting cancellation of the land allotment.Singla, in the letter, wrote, “…The allotted land is a gair mumkin pahar and forms part of the National Conservation Zone and the protected forest area.

We will mention it in property tax bills which will be issued in March.”“In the next year’s property owners who failed to implement rain harvesting, vermiculture and solar panel systems will get bills without the rebate,” he added.PMC introduced rain harvesting, vermiculture and solar panel installation under the eco-housing project scheme. The scheme was introduced in 2008. The civic body is giving a five to ten per cent rebate on property tax for such owners. Till date, 1,0,1022 property owners are part of such scheme and are availing rebate in property tax.During an inspection in December 2020, the corporation found that 3,081 of these properties are not maintaining the eco-freindly projects or they are not in working conditions.Last month, the property tax department sent notices to 3,081 such property holders and informed them about discontinuing the rebate.Every year, property tax bills are delivered to owners in March-April via post.At present, PMC has a total of 10.81 lakh properties in the city out of that, around eight lakh are residential properties, commercial properties numbers are more than one lakh and open spaces are 28,755.

15-02-2021||Pune||We should prefer a hybrid model of teaching: Nitin Karmalkar||From Monday onwards, universities and colleges across the state were allowed to reopen for offline classes. HT spoke to Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar about restarting SPPU and its affiliated colleges. From today, universities and colleges across the state is reopening for physical classes, how do you look at it? The decision is welcomed, and it was expected that colleges will now start soon. The teaching in colleges is complete and students are now waiting for examinations. Now, the other newly started courses must begin offline classes, therefore it is a welcome step that after around a year, students will be back on campus. Peer learning is more important than the online learning mode, as you cannot have control over many things in online mode. What challenges do you expect now while reopening the university and colleges? There are some challenges, the reason being students coming from the outside state or those who are going to stay at hostels. UGC guidelines suggest that hostels should not be allocated on sharing basis, so that is going to be a big sort of stumbling block in bringing all 100 per cent of students to campus. At the same time, Covid is not yet gone completely so there are some concerns. Parents might hesitate to send their children to campus or to colleges. That is what I have been asking, we should go more or less for a mixed-model or hybrid model of teaching. In this you should not bring 100 per cent students on campus, instead may be in batches and that liberty is given to the colleges as such. What would your emphasis be from now onwards going forward in this academic year? Our emphasis would be to bring students initially for practical purposes in batches as the practical portion has been missed out completely during Covid-19. There cannot be a match for practical courses in online mode, therefore initially we should concentrate more on the practical and then bring in students in batches to classroom lectures in batches, maybe of 20 each batch. When things normalise then we can bring in more students to the campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/we-should-prefer-a-hybrid-model-of-teaching-nitin-karmalkar-101613410551502.html

They will get a platter of rice, dal, a vegetable and egg curry for ₹5. "The government will bear a subsidy of ₹15 (per plate) while people will get it at ₹5," Banerjee said. Self-help groups will operate the kitchens from 1 pm to 3 pm every day and such kitchens will be set up everywhere in the state gradually, the chief minister said."I will go and taste it one day," Banerjee said. People will get the meal on a first-come-first-serve basis."This is a unique idea. We had announced this scheme in the budget and managed to launch it within eight days," she said thanking officials of various departments for making it possible within such a short time.The state government has allotted ₹1,00-crore for the scheme, said Banerjee who is also the Trinamool Congress supremo. "It started on an experimental basis and there may be initial hiccups," Banerjee said.On the first day, Maa kitchens started functioning at a few places in Kolkata and districts such as Malda, Dakshin Dinajpur, Paschim Medinipur and Howrah.The ruling Trinamool Congress had in September last year launched a similar initiative named -- 'Didir Rannaghar' in the state to provide meals at ₹5 to migrant workers who lost their jobs during the lockdown.The assembly election is due in the state in April- May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-launches-scheme-to-provide-meal-at-rs-5-for-needy-101613409356720.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||AAP govt to observe first anniversary of its third term on Tuesday||The AAP government, which took the reins of Delhi at the onset of Covid-19 pandemic last year, will observe the first anniversary of its third term in power on Tuesday.Party convener Arvind Kejriwal took oath of chief minister for the third term on February 16, days before massive communal violence broke out in northeast Delhi.Sources in the Delhi government, however, said the first anniversary will be a "low key affair" with no event planned to mark the occasion due to Covid-19 pandemic.After taking the reins of the national capital, the new government in Delhi had its task cut out as it dealt first with the riots that claimed over 50 lives and led to extensive damage to property, and then Covid-19 pandemic.As matters worsened with the Centre declaring a nationwide lockdown in the third week of March last year and galloping coronavirus infections as well as rising number deaths in coming months, the Kejriwal government came out with "Delhi Model" comprising home isolation, plasma therapy and plasma banks to tackle the burgeoning pandemic situation.The Delhi government also launched a massive relief operation, providing food and dry ration amid an exodus of migrant workers from the city, and then providing financial assistance to vulnerable sections like construction workers and auto drivers.A survey conducted by community social media platform LocalCircles claimed that 56 per cent of Delhi residents approve the one year performance of AAP government 2.0, mainly for "overcoming challenges" induced by Covid-19.It further claimed that 52 per cent residents of Delhi approved of the Kejriwal government's lockdown and 'unlock' management, Covid-19 testing and reporting, and arrangement of hospital beds for coronavirus patients.From a high of 8,600 infections and 131 deaths on single days during third wave of the pandemic in November, the situation improved in the coming months.Delhi government's Health bulletin reported 141 fresh Covid-19 cases and two deaths due to the virus on Monday.The government was also the first in the country to announce financial assistance of ₹one crore to the dependants of its employees who succumbed on duty due to Covid-19.Besides Covid-19 pandemic management, the government also came out with ambitious policies to make Delhi a hub of service and hi-tech sectors and a leader in adoption of electric vehicles.In November last year, Kejriwal announced that only service and hi-tech industries will be allowed in new industrial parks and the manufacturing units in existing ones will be encouraged to make the switch. The government has also started work on an industrial park to be set up at Ranikhera.Even as the city was in the grip of the pandemic, Kejriwal government launched the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy in August 2020, aiming to make the national capital a global leader in adoption of pollution-free vehicles.In the field of public transport, the government issued work orders in December 2020, paving way for procurement of 1,000 buses by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) after a gap of nearly 10 years.The government also started work on its other schemes including redesigning of city roads and doorstep delivery of ration.Despite sharp drop in revenue due to the pandemic, the government continued its flagship scheme of free power and water supply, benefitting 38.23 lakh consumers with zero electricity bills and 13.66 lakh with zero water bills, as per latest official figures.However, there were some areas including water supply, air pollution, 'Jahan Jhuggi Whan Makan' and procurement of electric buses where the government faced flack from its political adversaries BJP and the Congress.The LocalCircles survey based on over 54,000 responses of Delhiites, claimed 37 per cent respondents found "some improvement" in the water supply situation and 35 per cent approved Delhi Government's efforts to improve air quality in the last one year, said Sachin Taparia, founder and chairman of LocalCircles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-govt-to-observe-first-anniversary-of-its-third-term-on-tuesday-101613407009514.html

He called for a change of mindset and move towards a clean environment to prevent mankind from other such outbreaks in future.Also read: Disengagement in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso in full swing, may be over soonThe CM also urged the officials of urban development authority to supply garbage bags to women vendors so that garbage and spoiled vegetables could be put to the same and collected for proper disposal. Such conduct would help maintain cleanliness in and around the market places and prevent the women vendors from certain diseases, he added.Biren also asked the women vendors to allot a day in a month for the maintenance and cleaning work of the market areas.Many women vendors at the Nupi Keithel also expressed their happiness over the reopening of the market. “With the re-opening of the market today, we prayed that we lead a better life with our respective families,” said Kh Mangi, a functionary of a women’s vendor body at Nupi Keithel.Sharing a similar sentiment, another woman vendor Aribam Sunita, who sells locally-made blouses in the market, said, “We are so happy about the reopening of the market.”During the market re-opening function, the CM also announced the new names of the three Nupi Keithel (women market) buildings as Leimarel Sidabi Ima Keithel for market number 1, Imoinu Ima Keithel for market number 2 and Phouoibi Ima Keithel for market number 3.Last month, an independent researcher named Serto Tondana Kom in Imphal had even claimed that the shutting down of Nupi Keithel might have caused a minimum loss of ₹3,879 crore to vendors in the last 10 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manipurs-iconic-women-run-market-reopens-after-nearly-11-months-101613404140575.html

The BJP corporators said that as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has not yet given clear instructions on holding the meet offline, the next general body meeting would be held virtual. Last week, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Congress and the Shiv Sena corporators had staged an agitation at the mayor’s office raising slogans against the BJP for not holding the general body meeting in person despite the state government’s order. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC, said on Monday, “The Maharashtra government’s disaster management department gave the permission to hold the general body meeting offline on February 8, but mentioned to convene it for only one day and the orders were given only for Pune Municipal Corporation. We are seeking the state government’s okay for holding the general body meeting in person. As no permission has been received from the state authorities yet, we have decided to hold the meeting online on February 16.” According to Bidkar, many developmental projects in the city are pending as the general body meetings have not been convened. “Almost 300 proposals are pending. If the general body does not meet and reject the hike in property tax before February 20, residents will end up paying the rate as per the proposed tax hike,” the BJP leader said, adding that with no clear instructions coming from the state government, PMC will go ahead and conduct general body meetings online. The BJP blamed the opposition parties who staged an agitation at the mayor’s office for failing to get the permission from the state government to hold GB offline. “Hence, the February 8 dharna was just a drama by corporators of the opposition parties,” he said. Meanwhile, Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “It is our demand that the BJP should convene general body meeting offline. The state government gave instructions to start the meeting in person, but the BJP said that it needs instructions from the urban development department.” The PMC is yet to hold any general body meeting in the presence of all corporators since the beginning of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-decides-to-continue-pmc-general-body-meet-online-oppn-parties-cry-foul-101613402150416.html

This is being done to register their displeasure on restrictions imposed on pilgrims and tourists for Mahakumbh fair, starting next month in Haridwar.Traders, local priests, Ganga Sabha, hoteliers, guest house/lodge owners, travel agencies operators and seers are opposing the strict guidelines set under the standard operating procedures (SOP) set by the Union ministry of health and Uttarakhand government respectively for Mahakumbh.To raise this issue, small scale traders, including vendors, are also resorting to showering flowers on pilgrims, signifying their importance in the context of Kumbh fair as well as for traders.State president of Small-Scale Trader's Association, Sanjay Chopra, said that both pilgrims and traders wait for 12 years for Mahakumbh fair and not allowing them to visit Haridwar during the Kumbh is not a fair decision."From a spiritual, religious and economic point of view, Kumbh fair is of immense importance. When there will be no pilgrims owing to tough SOP guidelines and Covid-19 protocols what will be the Kumbh scenario?" said Chopra.The Ganga Sabha, which manages the affairs of the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri, is also openly opposing the SOP laid down for Mahakumbh.Also read: ‘Not subject to removal’ - Twitter on Haryana minister Vij’s tweet on Disha Ravi"When Union government has already announced the lifting of lockdown, Covid-19 positive cases are well below 12,000-10,000 mark, vaccination is being done, public places are open for all and sundry then why is a negative Covid-19 report mandatory for pilgrims for Kumbh fair?" said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha.The Haridwar Hotel Association and the Budget Hotel Association have termed the restrictions for Kumbh-bound pilgrims and tourists as “tyrant orders”."In the name of Covid-19 restrictions and precautions, the government, the mela and the local administration are hurting sentiments of people. Kumbh fair is being held since ancient times. Just in Haridwar, a negative Covid-19 report has been made mandatory but elsewhere in the country no such restriction is there for any such event," said Haridwar Hotel Association president Ashutosh Sharma.Traders are demanding compensation if the government goes ahead with the Mahakumbh SOP."Traders wait for twelve years to earn something but in the last year, owing to the Covid pandemic, we have already suffered a lot. Now we had high hopes with the Mahakumbh but the government doesn't seem to be interested in organising the mega fair in a grand way," said district president of Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal, Sunil Shetty.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri said that it seems the government and the mela administration aren't interested in organising a full-fledged Kumbh. Why are the new guidelines being imposed every now and then? he questioned.While urban development minister Madan Kaushik said that the SOP guidelines are to be adhered to, he added that the government is committed to hosting a grand and spiritual Kumbh fair with almost all permanent works completed for the fair.He added that amidst the SOP guidelines and Covid-19 safety norms too, it is possible to organise a grand Mahakumbh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/agitators-shower-flowers-on-pilgrims-in-a-unique-way-to-protest-mahakumbh-sop-101613395373724.html

The BJP should first take action against its own IT Cell members who are spreading fake news. Why two sets of rules ?" Banerjee told a press conference here.Banerjee alleged that the IT cell members of the saffron party are calling up people posing as TMC members and are maligning her party."I have asked Kolkata police to look into it," she said."Besides, every day LPG and fuel prices are going up and the Centre is not bothered about it. It is only interested in making false promises ahead of elections," she said.West Bengal Assembly poll is due in April-May and BJP which made deep inroads in the politically polarised state is looking to deseat the 10-year-old TMC regime in the state.Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old climate activist was arrested from Bengaluru recently for allegedly sharing with Greta Thunberg the "toolkit" related to the farmer''s protest against the Centre's agri laws, police said on Sunday.Delhi Police claimed that Disha Ravi, who was arrested by a cyber cell team of the force on Saturday, was an editor of the "toolkit Google doc" and the "key conspirator" in the document's formulation and dissemination.Thunberg, a teen climate activist, had shared the "toolkit" to lend her support to the farmers'' agitation against the three farm reform laws. In the document, various urgent actions, including creating a Twitter storm and protesting outside Indian embassies, were listed which were needed to be taken to support the farmers'' protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-slams-bjp-over-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613390496041.html

Deshmukh said his statement was distorted adding that it is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) information technology (IT) cell which should be investigated in this matter.Prominent figures such as cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, singer Lata Mangeshkar and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar among others had tweeted on the protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws. This comes after the movement gained international attention on February 3 with international celebrities such as Rihanna and Greta Thunberg taking to social media to express their support for the farmers, who have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 26 last year.“My statement was distorted. I said the BJP’s IT cell should be investigated. The BJP’s IT cell chief and names of 12 influencers have come out in probe,” Deshmukh had said while speaking to reporters on Monday.On February 8, the Maharashtra home minister had ordered the state’s intelligence department to investigate allegations that some celebrities were pressured to tweet on the farmers’ protest. Earlier, the Congress, which is the ruling coalition in Maharashtra had sought an investigation into BJP’s alleged involvement with the tweets of such celebrities, some of which have been conferred with the Bharat Ratna.My statement was distorted.

The first girls’ school was named after the owner of the wada, Tatyarao Bhide, who was a social worker. Bhide wada is a private owner’s property.According to Bhide Wada Smarak Samiti, the school was shut down more than 15 years. To preserve it, Bhide Wada Smarak Samiti appealed to the Bombay High Court in 2010 to declare it a national monument, but the issue is pending in court.Minister Bhujbal organised a meeting at Mantralya in Mumbai to discuss issue of turning Bhide wada into a memorial. PMC additional municipal commissioner took part in meeting through video conferencing along with Pune district land estate officer on Thursday.Rubal Agrawal, additional municipal commissioner said, “The issue is sub judice. Tenants have approached the court. State cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal instructed us PMC and district administration to call meeting of tenants and convince them and to settle the issue outside the court.”“Minister also instructed us to form a committee of state cultural department officials, state urban development department officials, PMC commissioner, state revenue department and Pune district administrator officials, she added.Dr Siddharth Dhende, who was one of the member of Bhide Wada Smarak Samiti during his tenure as deputy mayor of PMC, said, “The then mayor, Chanchala Kodre, had called meeting of tenants and owner. Tenants demanded cash compensation as commercial property because tenants have shops in this structure. Then, municipal commissioner Mahesh Pathak (now he is principal secretary of urban development department) had shown positive response and put demand to provide compensation to residential rates instead of commercial as there is no such classification of residential and commercial compensation to land or property.”He further added, “Samiti submitted the corporation say in the Bombay High Court. After that, the court had given directives to the state government to submit their say in court. Unfortunately, neither the National Congress Party (NCP)-Congress government, nor the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena government could not find time to present their opinion in court. Therefore, the case is pending. There is no need to form a new committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/minister-orders-pmc-dist-admin-to-form-committee-to-solve-bhide-wada-issue-101613387150337.html

Truck drivers from several states were in touch with them, said Deepak Bhargav, superintendent of police (SP), Chittorgarh. The accused will take only 15 to 20 minutes to replicate transport department documents like licenses, registration certificates (RC) toll slips, etc., he added.The SP revealed that the accused were caught following the development of leads, beginning with input about truck drivers routinely parking their vehicles on Mangalwad intersection on the highway and visiting the town. Investigations revealed that the drivers visited one Devendradas alias Devraj, to procure fake documents.The police then laid a trap by sending a cop in a decoy operation to the accused posing as a customer to procure a fake license, which was delivered in about 15 minutes. The police team then raided Devendra's house.Also Read: Narcotics cases in Rajasthan increased by 45.32% in 3 years: Govt data“Around 200 chip cards with blank driving licenses, 48 cards without a chip, two laptops, color printers, five tray cards, screwdriver machine, glue gun, gear heater, hard disk, iPod, and dongles were recovered from the possession of the accused,” said Bhargava.Police have arrested 33-year-old Devendradas, who used to produce fake documents and Rishi Agarwal, who was used to work as his agent under Section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.“More secrets are likely to be revealed by the investigation of the laptop. In Devendra’s laptop, software used to create a driving license, RC, and toll plaza slips, have been recovered,” Bhargava said and added that the RTO has been informed about the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-police-busts-fake-regional-transport-office-in-chittorgarh-2-held-101613386048876.html
15-02-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal’s ginger to boost Delhi’s immunity||With the demand for ginger produced in Himachal Pradesh increasing during the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to its immunity-boosting property, growers in the hill state’s Sirmaur district are hoping for global recognition for the indigenous rhizome cultivars, the main cash crop of the region. Though the farmers grow ginger in a traditional way in Sirmaur, the district has emerged as the biggest producer of the spice in the state and will be supplying the produce to the National Capital Region (NCR), too. State agriculture minister Virender Kanwar said the state government will soon sell ginger through Mother Dairy’s Safal outlets that offer fresh food and vegetables in NCR. “We will eventually target the market for spices in the metropolitan cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru before exploring prospects in the West,” he said. The state plans to promote Sirmaur’s ginger growers under the Centre’s One District, One Product scheme that will enable them to cultivate products on a large scale and get better prices. “We will support farm producers’ organisations, self-help groups, cottage industries and processing units through a framework for value chain development and alignment of support infrastructure,” Kanwar said. Increase in domestic demand opens doors At present, Sirmaur is the largest producer of ginger in the state with the highest area coverage of 1,500 hectares. Himgiri and local varieties of ginger are commercially grown in the district. While ginger is also cultivated in some parts of Solan district, growing the spice is the mainstay of 600 families in Sirmaur with most of the produce coming from Nahan, Paonta Sahib, Pachhad, Rajgarh, Sangrah and Shillai areas. In fact, 55% of the total area under ginger cultivation is in Paonta Sahib and Sangrah. The annual production of ginger in Sirmaur is 16,650 tonnes and the total cost incurred in cultivating it is about ₹3,60,620 per hectare, while the net income is ₹7,06,880 per hectare. This year, the pandemic led to an increase in domestic demand for ginger with prices in wholesale and retail markets increasing rapidly as it is considered an immunity booster to fight Covid-19. Modernising cultivation, processing and marketing Most ginger growers in Sirmaur lack the technical knowhow and resort to traditional farming. Value addition and processing facilities can boost their prospects. The state agriculture department has drawn up a mega plan to boost ginger cultivation in the district that includes organising training camps for farmers to encourage them to adopt the latest techniques. State agriculture director Naresh Kumar Badhan says, “We are looking forward to business support for setting up processing plants.” At present, ginger is grown on hill slopes and most growers practise terrace farming. They sell their produce in the local farm mandi (market) and sell the seed in other districts of the state besides adjoining Uttarakhand and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachals-ginger-to-boost-delhi-s-immunity-101613386070472.html
15-02-2021||Lucknow||Over 83% of UP families hit by road mishap see dip in income: World Bank report||Over 83% of poor families in Uttar Pradesh reported a fall in their income and on average suffered a loss of more than seven month’s household income after a family member was injured in a road accident, according to a World Bank report.Titled “Traffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society,” the report released by Union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari in Delhi on Saturday highlights the disproportionate impact of a road crash on poor households that pushes them into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt.The study was conducted in collaboration with SaveLIFE Foundation – a national non-governmental organisation focused on road safety. It is based on the survey in four Indian states – UP, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra."The decline in household income was more acutely felt in Uttar Pradesh. Over 83% of LIHs (low-income households) and 64% of HIHs (high-income households) reported a decline in household income after a road crash, which is higher than the overall figure of 75% and 54% for LIHs and HIHs, respectively,” Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder of SaveLIFE Foundation, said.About 48.2% of LIHs had to arrange for a loan, as opposed to 10.9% of HIH to deal with the financial fallout of the accident. Further, a larger proportion of LIHs had to resort to selling assets and taking on extra work. A larger proportion of HIH (89.1%) spent from family savings to cope with the losses than LIH (71.9%).As low as 7.5% of LIH victims, and 30.7% of HIH victims/family members, availed motor vehicle insurance compensation. Among those that availed compensation, just 41.9% of LIH victims and 38.7% of HIH victims received the eligible compensation.“This shows the need for greater institutional support for road accident victims, which as we understand, UP is working to develop as part of the new road safety policy,” Tewari said.The report revealed that the loss suffered by poor households was equivalent to less than one month’s household income for rich families on average. It further notes that a larger number of cases of property-sale, money borrowing and relocation were observed after the road accidents among LIHs in comparison to HIHs.A larger proportion of HIHs -89.8% also reported out of pocket expenses (OOPE) compared to the LIHs-72.3%, the report said. The OOPE for LIHs was about 5.8% higher than for HIHs. Total OOPE in Uttar Pradesh was ₹79,433 for LIHs and ₹75,110 for HIHs.As per the report, OOPE is the payment made directly by individuals at the point of service where the entire cost of health, goods, or service is not covered under any financial protection scheme.In UP, as high as 49.1% of household members from LIHs faced difficulty in sleeping after an accident, while only 3.2% of household members from HIHs faced the same problem. A total 62.6% of LIHs and 19.4% of HIHs reported that the victim, or a household member suffered from depression after a crash.Significantly, 50.6% of the LIHs and 50.5% of HIHs claimed that no FIR was filed for road accidents involving a family member.Also Read: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath launches Abhyudaya schemeIn UP, a total of 514 respondents (victims and household members) participated in the survey.

Further, on average, it took LIHs 105 days to find a new occupation.“The findings of the report identify the areas that require immediate improvements such as post-crash emergency care and protocols, insurance and compensation systems,” said Tewari.The report, according to Tewari, also presents an opportunity for development agencies, policymakers and state governments for a complete policy overhaul of the existing system and to implement sustainable solution-oriented, inclusive measures to improve their performance on road safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/over-83-of-up-families-hit-by-road-mishap-see-dip-in-income-world-bank-report-101613383344451.html

Their petition stated that lodging of the complaint by Chakraborty was nothing but a feeble attempt on her part to scuttle investigations against her by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and blame Rajput’s family for his suicide, as she was on the verge of being arrested by NCB. Rhea was arrested by NCB on September 8.Their counsel, senior advocate Vikas Singh, had submitted that there was gross delay in registering the offence, when Chakraborty was aware of the WhatsApp chats exchanged between the late actor and Singh on June 8, but she lodged her complaint on September 7.Also Read | ‘Sushant Singh Rajput was sober, innocent,’ observes Bombay high court, reserves order on plea by his sistersSingh had also pointed out that the telemedicine guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India permitted prescription of the medicines even on first consultation.Advocate Satish Maneshinde, who represented Chakraborty during the hearing, had also urged the court to allow the investigation into the allegations, contending that in a case of abetment to suicide, proximate reasons are most important and since the actor allegedly ended his life six days after the prescription, it could be the most proximate reason behind his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssr-case-bombay-hc-refuses-to-quash-fir-against-actor-s-sister-101613381269546.html

Several factors, including restarting local train services for all, increased mingling among groups and non-compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, are some of the reasons for increase in daily cases in the past five days. According to BMC, a decision for further relaxation and unlocking will be taken on February 22 after monitoring the situation.On whether timing for the general public for travelling in local trains will be increased, BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We are not taking any decision on the same yet. We will monitor the situation until February 22 first.”The city has been reporting over 500 cases since February 10, and on Sunday, the city reported 645 Covid-19 cases and four deaths on Sunday. Overall, the city has reported 314,076 Covid-19 cases and 11,419 deaths. Its recovery rate is 94% and mortality rate is 3.63%.Also Read | Maharashtra reports 4,092 new Covid-19 cases, 40 deaths in 24 hoursThe increase in cases has come ten days after local train service was restarted for the general public on February 1. Now, general public can travel from the first train of the day up to 7 am, 12 -4 pm and later, from 9 pm till the last train. In the past two weeks, at least 15 million citizens have used the local train services.Last week, the BMC also wrote to Mumbai University on how it will monitor the situation till February 22 before allowing colleges to reopen in the city. This, as the Maharashtra government had allowed reopening of colleges from February 15.Kakani added, “Daily cases being reported has increased, and one of the reasons can be local trains, but there are other factors too. One is unlocking, now almost everything has been opened up. Social mingling has increased, and citizens have also stopped practising Covid-19 appropriate behaviour...Also, we are testing almost 17,000 samples a day which has also resulted in cases going up.”City physician Dr Siddarth Paliwal said, “We might notice a spike in the number of cases owing to gradual reopening and unlocking, but this does not mean we go on shutting the city again. We will have to restrict movement and maybe, night curfew can be a solution. The government should also focus on vaccination. With vaccination, cases will come under control in the coming months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-cases-spike-mumbai-may-not-see-further-unlock-yet-101613379470238.html

The police registered a case of accidental death though officials said the investigation is on.“There is no doubt that her death was reported under suspicious circumstances. The chief minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray has already assured that detailed investigation will be carried out in the case and no one will be spared. The voice of people heard in the audio clips however needs to be corroborated,” said Gorhe.On being asked whether a fair investigation will be conducted if the minister in question does not resign from the post, Gorhe said, “This call will be taken by top officials in the government.”Earlier on Saturday, Thackeray said a detailed probe will be conducted and those responsible will not be spared, six days after the woman allegedly died by suicide in Pune.Following her death, 11 audio clips of a person allegedly talking with another man about deceased went viral. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that one of the persons in the audio clip is Maharashtra minister.Former CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has also written a letter to Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Hemant Nagrale demanding a probe in the matter.On Sunday in Nagpur, Fadnavis said, “The government and police are not serious about the case. Everyone knows whose voice in the audio clip and yet everyone is washing off hands.

15-02-2021||Pune||‘Involvement of juveniles in murders has increased over the past three years’||The direct and indirect involvement of underage children in cases of murder has increased over the past three years, according to the number of recorded murder cases with minor accused.In 2018, there were five murder cases with six minor accused; in 2019, the number of cases jumped to 10 and the accused to 23. In 2020, even with the lockdown in place, the number of cases remained 10 and the number of accused was 26, according to records of the Pune police.Of the 10 cases in 2020, two each were registered in Yerawada and Hadapsar, while one each was registered at Kothrud, Dattawadi, Sinhgad road, Vishrantwadi, Wanowrie, and Kondhwa.While the involvement of children in the act of killing is not as high as the number of children who are involved as an accessory to the crime. The reason is the easily impressionable minds of these children, according to a social activist who has worked extensively and has written a book about her experiences with children in conflict with the law (CCL).“The actual involvement in the killings was very less. They were involved in things like keeping a watchout for police or subduing the victim. The children who were involved in killings, they were seldom involved without an adult. In my book, there are case studies of children involved in gangwar, murder, attempted murder, theft, rape, kidnapping and I have worked closely with them,” said Amita Naidu, author of a book called “Pahila Nambarkari”, Manovikas publication, based on the lives of CCL.The age of the children involved in murder cases have also often found to be between 15-18 years of age, observes Bachchan Singh, Deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune. According to their involvement, their punishment by the Juvenile Justice Board and their treatment during their time in the observation home also varies.“Of all the cases, only 5% must be involved in actual cases. Most cases of under-15 CCL in murder cases are those where there is no motive or intention and between age group of 16-18 years. In most cases, they are just a part of the group which is involved in the violence. There are issues like lack of attention from children, abusive parents, broken families, economic weakness which are paired with lucrative offers for things like junk food, drugs, among other things,” said a lawyer who has been working closely with CCLs in Pune.“Those accused in murder cases are generally found to be between the age of 14-18 years. Every child’s story post-observation home is different. Even the judge grants bail based on specific conditions and can be planned. Conditions generally include things like not visiting the specific location for some time, not getting in touch with the ones who provoked the child in the first place, community service, completion of studies, among other things,” said Zaid Sayed, social worker who was formerly attached with the Tata Insitute of Social Science (TISS) collaboration with the Juvenile Justice Board.When asked about a case registered at Dattawadi police station of a minor involved in a murder case, senior police inspector Krishna Indalkar said, “The case was of a 17-year-old who, along with two others, caught a person late in the night for the purpose of robbery. But they were enraged that the man did not have much on him and they beat him to death. He was involved in the violent part of it.”However, every once in a while, there are cases of violent murders in which children below the age of 15 years. The recent case in Kothrud was a rude awakening after a lull in such cases where children commit violent murders. A 13-year-old had bludgeoned an 11-year-old boy to death with a stone.“The main reason in such cases, I have observed, is that the child has not yet grasped the entirety of what they have done. In the recent case in Kothrud, the child was calm right up till the point where he realised that there were so many people looking for him. There was a case of two 16-year-olds involved in a case of sexual assault and murder of a minor girl in Hingoli. After the amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act, they were awarded capital punishment by the sessions court,” recounts Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of police, crime, Pune.The child is in the observation home and is also being counselled by the Bharosa Cell of Pune police that helps women, senior citizens and children.“Our job is on a case-by-case basis. We talk to the children as and when such a case is registered. Currently, we are working with the child who was booked in the Kothrud case. No two cases are similar,” said police inspector Uttam Chakre of Bharosa Cell.There are multiple other social activists and officers who observed that the socio-economic conditions of CCLs are closely linked with their actions and circle of influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/involvement-of-underage-children-in-cases-of-murder-has-increased-over-the-past-three-years-101613379350594.html
15-02-2021||Pune||Former state minister offers revised formula for Purandar airport||As stiff opposition to the Purandar airport continues from villages of the proposed new site, former state minister and Shiv Sena leader Vijay Shivtare has written a letter to NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and has suggested a new formula for the airport project. In the letter written on February 13, Shivtare requested Pawar to declare the rates of land acquisition immediately and shift the project to the old site. In his letter, Shivatare has said that if the rates of land acquisition is declared then opposition from the old site will get diluted and people accept it. In his letter, Vijay Shivatare has also mentioned that initially farmers had objected to the land acquisition for the Samruddhi Mahamarg project but once the actual rates were announced the process got going. Shivatare said that he was sure it would happen in this case also. He has suggested that in case of the old site, the opposition was strong from Pargaon. If Pargaon is excluded from the project site, the construction of the project would be possible. “No one can understand why the project site was shifted without consulting farmers and villagers. There is strong opposition from villagers to the new site. If the rates of land acquisition or arrangement of the acquisition is declared then people are ready to proceed with it. There is no point in delaying the project with fresh permissions,” said Vijay Shivtare. The old site for the Purandar airport was constituted of the villages Pargaon, Rajewadi, Munjewadi, Vanpuri, Kumbalvalan, Ekhatpur and Udachi Wadi. After opposition from these villages the project site was shifted to 2 kms away from these villages and a fresh proposal for the new project site was submitted. While speaking at a press conference in Pune, Ajit Pawar had said that after the suggestion from the defence minister, a joint report regarding the new airport site has been submitted to the central government by the district collector, airport authority and defence authorities. Villagers from the (new site) RisePise, Naygaon, Pandeshwar, Rajouri, Mavadi-Pimpri in Purandar taluka have come together and constituted the anti-airport coordination committee. members of the anti-airport coordination committee met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to oppose the proposed construction of the airport in their villages in Purandar taluka. The committee members have also submitted a letter to Sharad Pawar. In this letter they have highlighted the reasons behind opposing the airport project on their lands. Villagers from RisePise, Naygaon, Pandeshwar, Rajouri, Mavadi-Pimpri in Purandar taluka have come together and constituted the anti-airport coordination committee.“We met Pawar Saheb in Jejuri and expressed our concerns. We want the administration to listen to us. When the proposal for the new site was submitted, no one talked to us or tried to consult us on this issue. So, now we have to make them listen to us,” said Pandharinath Sonawane from Pandeshwar village, who is the vice-president of the anti-airport coordination committee. “We told him that our lands are under irrigation and our lives will be destroyed if our land is taken from us. We have asked him for a meeting to discuss this issue in detail. He said he will let us know later,” said Pandharinath Sonawane.In the letter, the committee members have emphasised that almost 80% of the land in the newly proposed site is under irrigation and the land owners mainly rely on farming as their livelihood. “There was no consultation with the locals before the new site for the airport was proposed and somehow the administration has got the wrong impression that ours is a drought-prone area. Now we are going to conduct gram sabhas in our villages and convey our resistance to the authorities,” Santosh Kolte, secretary anti-airport coordination committee.The committee members had earlier met NCP leader and Member of Parliament from Baramati constituency Supriya Sule to raise their issues. They had asked her for a meeting to discuss the issues in detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/former-state-minister-offers-revised-formula-for-purandar-airport-101613379349973.html
15-02-2021||Pune||PMC traced seven contacts for every positive case as opposed to 50||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has traced only seven contacts on an average for every positive Covid-19 case reported in the city. This, despite the district collector’s order dated September 4, ordering the civic body to trace at least 50 contacts for every positive case. For every positive case, the state guidelines suggest that the local authority must trace the high-risk contacts, those who possibly came in close contacts and are at high risk, while the low-risk contacts are those who might be at a lesser risk. Contact tracing works as an effective mechanism to check the spread of the infection. As of February 6, as per the data shared by the PMC, the city had reported 1.92 lakh Covid-19 positive cases for which the civic body had traced only 25.91 lakh contacts including 6.46 lakh high-risk contacts and the remaining were low-risk contacts. High-risk contacts can include family members and also those with comorbidities who might have come in close contact with the patient while low-risk contact includes those that might have come in contact with the patients. The civic body has traced about 7.4 contacts for every positive case on an average since the first case was reported in the city. This is far less than what the district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had ordered on September 4 when the pandemic was at its peak. The order stated that ‘civic bodies and rural administration has to trace at least 50 contacts for every single Covid-19 patient, which includes at least 20 high-risk contacts and 30 low-risk contacts. These 50 people must be tested either through Rapid Antigen Detection tests or RTPCR depending on their symptoms and ICMR guidelines. The high risk contacts will be institutionally quarantined at a Covid centre till results are awaited while low-risk contacts will be quarantined at home’.The city’s contact tracing was earlier slammed by the state administration for being below the advised rate. With more cases being reported now the city’s positivity rate is also going up in the past few days. While the positivity rate was at 5%, its lowest in the past five weeks, it jumped up back to 7% between February 4 and 10 which is the highest since January 7. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “We were expecting about 15-20 contacts to be traced and so the current number is at the lower end. However, given that the current machinery was involved in contact tracing, isolation and admissions in the earlier few months when the pandemic struck, now they are engaged with other things to do, including vaccination. So seven still seems like a good number, but we can do better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-traced-seven-contacts-for-every-positive-case-as-opposed-to-50-101613379348770.html

Gogoi, a Rajya Sabha MP, had criticised the judicial system saying it is in a “ramshackled” condition in the country. Gogoi’s remarks came a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the judiciary for safeguarding peoples’ rights and personal liberty. “Last week I read that the country’s judicial system is the best. The statement was made by the Prime Minister in a meeting with Supreme Court judges. Obviously, we all felt happy about it but the remarks of Gogoi who is also the former CJI and was nominated by the central government in the Parliament, are shocking. I don’t know if, in a way, he (Gogoi) tried to bring out the truth but it is certainly a matter of concern for all,” said Pawar. Speaking at a conclave organised by India Today, former CJI was quoted as saying that if one goes to Indian courts they have to wait endlessly for a verdict. “How important the judiciary is as a constitutional body need not be emphasised. You want a 5 trillion-dollar economy, but your judiciary is ramshackled,” Gogoi said Gogoi was nominated on March 16 last year by President Ram Nath Kovind, four months after his retirement in November 2019. He is the first former CJI to become a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. His most significant judgment was in the Ram Janmabhoomi case, where he led a bench which granted the disputed land in Ayodhya to the Hindu parties, paving the way for the construction of the Ram Temple, a key political agenda of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pawar-says-ranjan-gogoi-s-remarks-on-judicial-system-worrisome-101613379349327.html
15-02-2021||Pune||Double toll penalty for vehicles without FASTag from Monday||Starting February 15, Monday, the FASTag electronic payment system at the toll nakas will be mandatory for all vehicles after the earlier deadline of January 1, 2021, was extended. The Union minister of road transport Nitin Gadkari too made it clear on Sunday that no more extension will be given for FASTag implementation at the toll nakas across the country. “After several extensions, we have now decided to not give another deadline. FASTag will come into force from Monday as decided. To ensure seamless traffic, we have decided to sell tags at toll plazas,” said Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari at Nagpur on Sunday. The FASTag technology helps in seamless collection of toll without the need to stop the vehicle at the toll plaza. The sticker of FASTag is stuck at the windshield of the car and deploys Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to collect tolls. The RFID technology is indigenously developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The code in the FASTag sticker is detected using the RFID technology at the toll plaza that helps the payment of toll by the vehicle.Sagar Abnawe, who regularly travels to Kolhapur for work, at Khed Shivapur toll naka said, “I have two cars, one has the FASTag in place, but another doesn’t have it. Till now I was paying cash at toll nakas or it would get deducted from the FASTag of the car. Now if I drive with another car which does not have the FASTag, I would have to pay double the toll, so I am thinking of getting it done immediately.” Rohan Nalawade, who was travelling to Mumbai via Pune-Mumbai expressway, said, “I have not got the FASTag issued for my car and today, I had to wait for more than half an hour in the cash queue at the Urse and other toll nakas on the expressway. There should be lanes for FASTag and cash at the toll nakas, as it is not possible to have 100 per cent FASTag cars in place immediately from February 15. I would try to get it done next week as it is compulsory now.” Suhas Chitnis, Pune project director of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), said, “There is a penalty for every vehicle which does not have FASTag in place from February 15, so we appeal to all vehicle owners to get it issued immediately to avoid penalties. The earlier deadline was extended so that people would get it done.” Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, Highway State Police (HSP), Pune, said, “As FASTag is now compulsory at the toll nakas for all the vehicles from Monday, there might be long queues of vehicles. Our highway traffic policemen will ensure that the traffic movement is smooth and they will clear the rush as early as possible.” Major toll nakasThere are two major toll nakas around Pune city of the 30 toll nakas on the National highways in Maharashtra. One at Khed Shivapur on Pune – Bengaluru (NH 48) highway and another at Urse on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. Private players of banks and online payment services have installed temporary FASTag booths nearby toll nakas for the public to buy it on the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/double-toll-penalty-for-vehicles-without-fastag-from-monday-101613379288698.html

That helped us crack the case and arrest the three men on Friday,” said the officer.

When the deal was fixed, the man told her that he would send a small amount to confirm her bank details are correct.The man first sent her ₹2 and asked her to confirm receipt. After that, he sent her a QR code, asking her to scan it using her phone, to receive the remaining payment. As soon as she scanned the code, ₹20,000 was withdrawn from her account first and then ₹14,000 immediately after that. A first information report was subsequently registered at Civil Lines police station.“We focused on the bank account in which the money was deposited. We got to know that the deposited money was withdrawn from an ATM in Agra. That led us to the account holder, 18-year-old Kapil Kumar Rajouria,” said the officer. Rajouria would allegedly lend his bank account, for a commission, to the perpetraters of the fraud.“Rajouria opened seven bank accounts, but using fake address proofs,” the officer said. At Rajouria’s instance, the police also arrested Wajid, 26, and Manvinder Singh, 25.Wajod, a resident of Nuh in Haryana, works as a driver for a cab aggregator platform. He and another man Sajid, who remains on the run, were the alleged perpetraters of the crime. The police are working to help recover the amount, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-3-arrested-for-duping-kejriwal-s-daughter-of-34-000-in-e-commerce-fraud-101613372629528.html

There are more than 70 lakh farmers in West Bengal. It is sad to know that the state government has not come up with any proper plan for the benefits of the farmers. The farmers of the state are being deprived of welfare programme developed by the Centre.""More importantly, there is not even 'fasal bima' (crop insurance) for the farmers. The Minimum Support Price has scaled up to 50 per cent in last six years," said Sarkar.Krishok Surakkha Abhiyan commenced on January 9. Through this programme, Sarkar claims to have reached 25 lakh farmer families and around 7000 farmers with 'Soho bhoj'.Initially, this Abhiyan had aimed at having 'Soho bhoj' with as many as 3,354 gram panchayat. However, after the success they are now reaching out to the mandals. In Soho bhoj, every farmer's family gives 'ek mutho chal' (one fistful of uncooked rice) along with other ingredients and cooked together. Later, all the family members sit together for the meal.This comes amid the continuing farmers' protest at Delhi border areas since November 26 demanding the repeal of three farm laws. The agriculture laws include 'Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce Bill, 2020', 'Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020' and 'Essential Commodities Bill 2020.'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjps-farmer-outreach-program-in-west-bengal-to-be-held-on-february-18-101613371343555.html

The victim has been identified as Maidul Islam Midda who allegedly sustained severe injuries on February 11 when police used tear gas, water cannons and resorted to lathicharge to disperse protesters in central Kolkata. “He was murdered on the chief minister’s orders. We want justice. We are going for a state-wide protest,” DYFI secretary Sayandip Mitra said. Midda, an auto-rickshaw driver and a resident of Bankura district, had come to Kolkata to participate in the protest. The activists were marching towards the state secretariat at Nabanna with a set of demands, including jobs. When police stopped them in central Kolkata, the activists reportedly tried to break the barricades and a clash followed. The activists reportedly attacked the police with stones and sticks. Dozens of Congress and Left activists, and some police personnel were injured in the clash. The next day, the Left Front called for a 12-hour state-wide bandh with the Congress supporting it. Reacting to the death, minister Subrata Mukherjee said, “Any death is unfortunate. But I am aware of the CPIM’s game plan as I have been fighting them for the past few decades. They wanted this to happen. Police were restrained on that day. But if someone wants to commit suicide, no one can help them.” Meanwhile, the Opposition mounted attack on the Mamata Banerjee administration, saying that the government was trying to throttle all protests. “This is a murder by the state government. The way police attacked the students can only be compared with the Jallianwala Bagh incident. More than 500 students were injured when police brutally attacked them,” CPIM leader Sujan Chakraborty said. “This is an autocratic government. The administration is trying to snatch the people’s democratic rights. People are not being allowed to protest...People have to organise a mass movement against this,” said Abdul Mannan, veteran Congress leader and the Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal assembly. “Police have turned violent. Even BJP protesters were attacked when they marched towards Nabanna on October 8, 2020. Even protesting teachers were attacked. The administration has lost the people’s confidence and is now unleashing terror,” said Dilip Ghosh, state president of BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cpim-youth-wing-activist-dies-in-bengal-party-alleges-police-brutality-101613370288718.html
15-02-2021||Lucknow||In wake of Priyanka Gandhi’s frequent visits to UP, BJP plans farmer outreach||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have readied a counter-plan amid Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s frequent visits to Uttar Pradesh in the last few weeks, said people familiar with the matter. The BJP is planning a series of pro-farmer meetings that would include small, rural gatherings, and its leaders have started visiting villages. Besides, some Jat leaders could be given prominence in the party, as well as in the anticipated reshuffle and expansion of the Yogi Adityanath ministry, a local party leader said. “I won’t be surprised if some of them are given prominence at the Centre in some capacity,” the BJP leader said. Also Read | AAP says will bring back old pension scheme in UP if voted to power: ReportSeveral farmers agitating in western UP are Jats and the BJP, it is expected, is hoping to reach out to them in a variety of ways. Groups of farmers backing the new farm laws, too, are active. The BJP leaders see a pattern in Gandhi’s visits—a combination of a pro-farmer approach and a touch of public display centered on “soft Hindutva”. In the past two weeks, the Congress’ general secretary has been in the state thrice. On February 4, she visited the family of a farmer from Rampur who died during the ongoing stir against the farm laws. In Saharanpur, she attended a kisan panchayat on February 10. The next day, she took a dip in the Sangam during Mauni Amavasya in Prayagraj. On Monday, Gandhi will again visit western UP to attend yet another farmer panchayat. The Congress leaders, too, say they anticipate a damage control plan and hence feel Gandhi’s visits would be tactically scheduled to tap the discontent against the BJP. “Yes, Gandhi is the face of the Congress in UP and, naturally, in the run-up to the elections, she would visit every assembly constituency in the state. People are looking to her with hope,” said Congress leader and former lawmaker Akhilesh Pratap Singh. As the Congress readies Gandhi’s itinerary, the BJP, too, has swung into action. Its state leaders are attending farmers’ meets. Leaders vested with organisational matters have tasked cadres to collect information on all assembly seats, including the 84 seats that the BJP lost in the 2017 UP polls when it won power in the state after a long hiatus. “Information on all the seats is being collected. We have cadre right down to the rural level. The process to gather feedback on each seat is underway. We are also looking into factors that caused us to lose the seats we did in 2017. And this exercise isn’t governed by any political party or its leader, but by our own desire to excel, set newer benchmarks in public outreach,” a BJP lawmaker privy to the party plan said. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh has been leading the party’s rural connect activity, one that comes just ahead of the panchayat polls likely in April-May. Immediately after, the stage will be set for the 2022 UP assembly polls and the BJP, those in the know of things said, has started work on winning the confidence of the farmers by approaching them in small groups in western UP. Along with Gandhi, Jayant Chaudhary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), too, has featured prominently in farmer meets. With political activity increasing in the region, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh met Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait in Muzaffarnagar. In Farrukhabad, veteran Congress leader and former union minister Salman Khurshid also attended a farmers’ panchayat. “As of now, the farmers’ stir appears to be hurting the BJP while RLD and the Samajwadi Party (SP) seem to be gaining. But then, the elections are still far away and by then, we would have recovered lost ground,” a BJP functionary from western UP said on condition of anonymity. Political experts said the Congress was looking at these farmer panchayats to reclaim lost political ground. “The Congress is desperate to recover lost political space in the most populous state which holds the key to power in Delhi. But, unlike the main Opposition Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Congress doesn’t have a solid organisational base. So, a popular leader of theirs attending kisan mahapanchayats could grab headlines, but it would take much more than that for making political headway,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist. “Moreover, more than the BJP, would the SP and the BSP be comfortable if the Congress rises politically in UP?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-wake-of-priyanka-gandhi-s-frequent-visits-to-up-bjp-plans-farmer-outreach-101613369688933.html

The relief will be offered by way of reduction in commission to the regional development councils and partial waiver in the Goods and Services Tax (GST).“The government has agreed to reduce the regional development council commission on crushing of sugarcane to 0.20% from the existing 1.80% of the amount,” said Bihar Sugar Mills Association (BSMA) secretary Naresh Bhatt.He said the state sugarcane industries department had also given assurance to waive off tax on the purchase of sugarcane after implementation of the GST on crushing of sugarcane. He further claimed that the department has also decided to increase the minimum support price (MSP) on all varieties of sugarcane by ₹5 per quintal. The mills would purchase the best quality sugarcane from farmers at ₹ 315 per quintal at the mills’ entrance, while the medium quality would be paid ₹295 per quintal. The lower quality of sugarcane would fetch ₹272 per quintal to the farmers, he said, adding that the millers have been authorized to purchase sugarcane from the farmers from the field or market at ₹20 lower than the MSP at the mills’ gate.Assurances to the effect came during a meeting between a BSMA delegation and sugarcane industries minister Pramod Kumar on Saturday.The sugarcane industries department faces the challenge to revive sugar mills, which are on the verge of closure due to financial stress. Currently, only nine out of 28 sugar mills are operational, while the rest have been closed due to various reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-reduce-taxes-on-crushing-of-sugarcanes-in-a-bid-to-help-sugar-mills-101613368155938.html

Let me tell the brothers of Mamata didi that BJP will form the government in West Bengal. I know there will be attempts to stop the yatra so I am here to meet you. We will ensure that you are able to cast your votes,” Ghosh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Ghosh also warned TMC workers and said that any incident of violence will not be taken lightly saying that BJP workers are not weak. He said, “Opposition is telling us that our game is over but let me tell them that our game is on. Be ready. Tell mothers to keep their children under control if they want to see their faces after polls. We're civilised and follow rule of law but it does not mean that we are weak.”Incidents of clashes and violence between Trinamool Congress workers and BJP workers have cast a shadow of fear over the upcoming legislative session assembly elections.Suvendu Adhikari, the TMC-rebel leader who joined BJP back in December, said that the TMC-led government is planning to turn West Bengal into ‘Bangladesh’. He directed his criticism at the ‘Khela Hobe’ slogan coined by the Trinamool Congress and said that it was coined by Bangladesh’s Awami League MP Shamim Osman. He alleged that importing slogans from politicians from across the border indicates the mentality of the Trinamool Congress.He said, “The 'Khela hobe’ slogan was coined by Narayanganj MP Shamim Osman 4 years ago. TMC wants to turn West Bengal into Bangladesh that is why they've imported the ‘Joy Bangla’ slogan. Our slogan is ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Jai Shri Ram.”He also said that BJP will improve its performance in these elections and has built on the success of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party had won 18 out of the 22 Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal. He said, “2019 main half, 2021 main saaf as said by PM Modi and home minister Shah will happen.”West Bengal is likely to hold its legislative assembly elections in the months of April-May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/bjp-leaders-challenge-bengal-cm-says-cadres-are-civilised-but-not-weak-101613367563039.html

The writ petition was filed on behalf of SEC on February 11 and is expected to be taken up by the court soon, they added.Elections for a total of 2.58 lakh posts in the three-tier rural local bodies are due in Bihar and the state poll panel has been busy updating the voter's list, verifying poll booths, finalising security and logistics among others. The purchase of EVMs has been sanctioned by the state government.The SEC has been trying to obtain the multi-post EVMs—with multiple voting options-- of secured detachable memory module (SDMM) from the ECIL, Bangalore, in keeping with its tentative schedule for the panchayat polls.An official, pleading anonymity, said the SEC has been communicating with the ECIL since last year for the purchase of 15,000 EVMs but ECIL did not get the requisite clearances from the ECI.The SEC, which plans to hold panchayat polls in nine phases, is keen to complete the election process by June 15 when the term of the three-tier local bodies end.

15-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records over 4,000 Covid-19 cases after 39 days, experts sound alarm||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded over 4,000 Covid-19 cases after a gap of 39 days, while Mumbai reported over 600 cases after exactly a month. With the number of cases seeing an upward trajectory for the past four or five days, health experts have sounded an alarm stating that administration will have to increase tracing and testing, while the people will have to strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. They also suggested that areas where cases have seen an uptick should be put on “red alert”.Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 4,092 Covid-19 infections, over 4,000 for the first time since January 6, taking its tally to 2,064,278. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported over 600 cases after 31 days with 645 fresh infections. The city last saw over 600 cases in a day on January 14.Health experts, who are also on state government panels and task forces, have attributed the rise in cases to the increased movement of people post the resumption of activities and the operation of trains in Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and Covid fatigue in wearing masks and sanitising.Also Read | India records 11,649 Covid-19 new cases, daily toll remains below 100Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid task force in the state, said, “Kerala and Maharashtra are outliers. And the increase in cases has coincided with three things—full unlocking, gram panchayat elections, and some degree of schools and colleges reopening. All these three things have a significant role. In geographies like Mumbai, MMR, the population in trains is increasing. These are the reasons for the increase in the cases and need to be looked at urgently.”Dr Joshi added that footfall in Mumbai trains has gone up from 2 million to 3.4 million after the general public was allowed to use trains from February 1. “We definitely need to remain alert and should avoid complacency,” he said.For Mumbai, Dr Joshi said that the population that was thus far unexposed to the virus could be getting affected. He suggested that areas should be re-looked at and put on “red alert”. “Covid is going to become an endemic in Mumbai. We will routinely see cases between 400 and 600 daily. But it should not drastically spike. The exposed population could have herd immunity, but the unexposed population is getting hurt now. For example, children who never stepped out earlier are now going to schools. We might see a spurt in these cases. We need to increase testing, tracking and isolation,” Dr Joshi said.Meanwhile, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services, said that he was “warning” of a possible surge in daily cases. He painted a grim picture saying Mumbai, which was a hotspot of Covid-19, could be in more “trouble” with train traffic increasing.“Mumbai could get into trouble with local trains starting and flow of people increasing from its surrounding areas. The numbers were expected to rise as people are lax in Covid-appropriate behaviour. We are seeing a similar rise in Pune as well as people are behaving as if the pandemic has passed,” Salunkhe said.He added that the vaccination drive is progressing slowly and it will take time for herd immunity to build after inoculation. He said, “The vaccination is taking place at a slow pace. The inoculation of the general public (above age 50, and with comorbidities) will start only next month. Till that period at least, people have to remain vigilant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-4k-covid-19-cases-after-39-days-health-experts-sound-alarm-101613362908989.html

He also said the deduction of pensions of the elderly is akin to insulting them at the twilight of their lives.Soni further said that the AAP aims to implement the Delhi model of governance in Uttar Pradesh. He also said that the party wants to bring changes to the recruitment process and in the way government employees work under contractual terms.

15-02-2021||Patna||Craze for learning Chinese among Bihar tourist guides falls sharply||The craze for learning the Chinese language among the tourist guides of Bihar, a skill once considered a money-spinner, is diminishing fast due to the strained relations between India and China over boundary disputes and the severe drop in tourism due to Covid-19 pandemic, said several people in the tourism industry.The tourist guides based at Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Nalanda, who speak Mandarin, say they were facing an unprecedented crisis and would never advise their juniors to learn the Chinese language.At Bodh Gaya, the tourist guides say the young generation of guides is flocking to learn Japanese instead.“Due to the strained relations between India and China post the Doklam and Galwan incidents and also because of Covid-19, the tourist guides are less attracted towards learning Chinese. They are flocking to learn Japanese or other languages instead. At this point of time, it is difficult to predict how will be the flow of Chinese tourists when the international flights resume,” said Dayanand Kumar, a post-graduate in Chinese language from Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, and a tourist guide-cum-escort, based at Bodh Gaya.In 2019, 1,093,141 foreign tourists visited Bihar, as against 33,990,038 domestic tourists in the same period, a sizeable number of these were Chinese.Earlier some guides used to teach Chinese at Bodh Gaya, but now they don’t have students. “At Bodh Gaya, an institute teaches Japanese and there are many takers for it,” said Rakesh Kumar, president, Bodh Gaya Tourist Guides Association.Bodh Gaya Hotel Association’s general secretary, Sudama Singh, who along with his Japanese wife runs a Japanese training center, said they had a batch of about 400-450 students. “However, Covid has reduced the count of Japanese learners,” he said.Bodh Gaya Tourist Guides Association’s general secretary, Deepak Kumar, who is also a Chinese interpreter, one cannot acquire proficiency in the Chinese language without learning the language in China. He said many tourist guides are under huge debts after investing in learning Chinese but now without any earning to pay back the loan. He said some have joined cell phone companies where there is a limited opening for Chinese interpreters.Also Read: Bihar gets its act together for Paddy procurement after Nitish Kumar’s warningAjay Kumar, a tourist guide at Bodh Gaya had a similar story to narrate, “Two years ago I managed about ₹12 lakh by borrowing from different sources and got myself admitted to the Kunming University in China. Initially, I got work as a Chinese interpreter-cum-tourist guide in December 2019. Unfortunately, after Covid-19 hit the world, there is no work at all. Our lot is apprehensive about how the situation will pan out once things normalize as visa norms for Chinese citizens have been tightened by the Indian government. In this situation, I will not advise anyone to learn Chinese.”There are many guides like Kumar in Bodh Gaya who sold their land or took money from their parents’ provident fund to learn the language in China. “However, now their condition is pitiable, said a guide.Principal secretary, tourism department, Ravi Manubhai Parmar, said the entire tourism industry was hit by Covid-19. “The honourable minister has just joined. In a few days we will look into the guides’ problems,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/craze-for-learning-chinese-among-bihar-tourist-guides-falls-sharply-101613361189807.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||SSR case: Bombay HC judgment on sisters’ plea for quashing of Bandra FIR today||The Bombay high court will pronounce on Monday its judgment on the petition filed by Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, sisters of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, for quashing an FIR registered against them by Bandra Police on September 7, 2020. The FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Rajput’s friend, actor Rhea Chakraborty.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik is scheduled to pronounce orders on the petition in the afternoon.On September 7, 2020, Bandra Police registered an offence against the sisters on the basis of a complaint lodged by Chakraborty, alleging that Priyanka Singh had, on June 8, 2020, sent the late actor prescriptions by one Dr Tarun Kumar, a cardiologist attached to Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, with medicines containing psychotropic substances controlled under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Chakraborty alleged that the doctor had not examined the actor, and consumption the of the psychotropic substances “may have caused and contributed to the suicidal death of the actor.”Also Read | Sajid Nadiadwala dedicates award won by Chhichhore to Sushant Singh RajputThe sisters have moved the high court through advocate Madhav Thorat, claiming the statements made therein did not make out any cognisable offence. Their petition stated the complaint was nothing but a feeble attempt on Chakraborty’s part to scuttle investigations against her by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and blame Rajput’s family members for his suicide, as she was on the verge of being arrested by NCB. Chakraborty was arrested by NCB on September 8.Their counsel, senior advocate Vikas Singh, had submitted that there was a gross delay in registering the offence, when Chakraborty was well-aware of the WhatsApp chats exchanged between the late actor and Priyanka Singh on June 8, but she lodged complaint on September 7.Vikas Singh had also pointed out that the Telemedicine Guidelines issued by the medical council of India permitted prescription of the medicines even on first consultation, and there was nothing wrong in the prescription.The senior advocate had asserted that the FIR registered by Bandra Police was non-est in the eyes of the law for being a second offence on the same cause of action and thus liable to be struck down on this ground as well. The senior advocate relied on the ruling in Jacob Matthew’s case, in which Supreme Court has held that an offence cannot be directly registered against a registered medical practitioner.Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) supported the petitioners by terming Chakraborty’s allegations “mostly presumptive and speculative in nature” and claiming the FIR was “vitiated and bad in law” for being the second FIR on the same cause of action—the death of Rajput.Senior advocate Devdatt Kamat, who represented Bandra Police, had maintained that there was no illegality in registering the offence. Kamat submitted that the prescription (sent by Priyanka Singh to Rajput) was prima facie a fabricated document.Kamat had pointed out that the WhatsApp messages exchanged by and between the deceased actor and Priyanka Singh falsified the claim that the prescription was followed by online consultation. He pointed out from the documents that somebody other than the late actor had gone to Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital as an indoor patient and obtained the prescription.With regard to the contention of second FIR on the same cause of action, Kamat said that the Bandra FIR was in the nature of a counter-complaint and an FIR on the basis of a counter-complaint can’t be termed as a second FIR on the same subject.Advocate Satish Maneshinde had represented Chakraborty during the hearing. He had insisted that the circumstances relating to Rajput’s death need to be investigated. Responding to the grounds of delay in lodging the complaint, he had said that Chakraborty was aware of the messages exchanged by and between the late actor and Priyanka Singh on June 8 and Rajput had asked her to leave his residence as she insisted that he should not take the illegally prescribed medicines.However, Maneshinde said, she realised that the medicines were actually procured and consumption of the same could have led to untimely death of the actor only after certain other messages were leaked by an investigation agency and thereafter she lodged the complaint.Maneshinde had also urged the court to allow the investigation into Chakraborty’s allegations, contending that in a case of abetment to suicide, proximate reasons are most important and since the prescription was dated June 8 and the actor had ended his life six days later, on June 14, it could be the most proximate reason behind his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-judgment-on-ssr-sisters-petition-for-quashing-of-bandra-fir-today-101613360148231.html

15-02-2021||Delhi||Water supply in parts of Delhi likely to be hit due to Uttarakhand glacier burst||Aam Aadmi Party leader and vice chairperson of Delhi Jal Board Raghav Chadha on Sunday informed that parts of the national capital are likely to face inadequate water supply as a fallout of the glacier burst in Uttarakhand that led to flash floods in the hill state’s Chamoli district.In a series of tweets, Chadha urged residents to use water judiciously as two of the city’s water treatment plants were not operating at their full capacity following the disruptions due to Uttarakhand calamity.“In the aftermath of #UttarakhandDisaster, turbidity in raw water fetched by Delhi from Upper Ganga Canal has increased to unprecedented levels (8000 NTU). As a result, @DelhiJalBoard's Sonia Vihar & Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plants currently operating at reduced capacity,” the DLB vice chairperson tweeted.Chadha informed about the areas that were likely to face water shortage and assured that arrangement will be made to assist them. “Water supply in parts of South, East and North East Delhi is likely to be affected. We urge citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers etc. in adequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity,” he wrote in another post on the microblogging site.What is turbidity?Chadha also explained what is meant by turbidity. “Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water,” he tweeted.Uttarakhand glacial burstA glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli district last Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.The rescue and search operations were briefly halted at NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project on Thursday afternoon after police in Uttarakhand issued an alert over rising water levels in the Alaknanda river and its tributary Dhauliganga, officials said.

15-02-2021||Chandigarh||J&K scraps 15 NOCs, opens door for investors||To revive the business sector and boost investor confidence with a business-friendly environment, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has approved a series of measures for simplifying business establishment process, an official spokesperson said on Sunday.As per the decision taken by the Administrative Council (AC), which met under the chairpersonship of lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha here on Saturday, the pre-requisite ‘no objection certificates’ (NoCs) or approvals have been relaxed for setting up of a business unit, the spokesman said.He said the Udyog Aadhaar memorandum as per the condition of the Government of India would be the only requirement for a business unit to be set up.Earlier, as many as 15 NoCs or clearances were required for a business unit to be established, which have now been reduced to a bare minimum.“These bare minimum NoCs/approvals shall be required subsequently, for which two sets of single-window committees have been established — one for business units coming up within industrial estates and another committee for units outside the industrial estates,” the spokesman said.He said these committees would ensure time-bound issuance of the NoCs or approvals pertaining to power connection, water connection and building plan as per specified timelines on a case-to-case basis.Further, the spokesman said a divisional-level committee has been approved, which would periodically monitor the working of the committees and address issues, if any, related to issuance of NoCs or approvals.“No pre-requisite approvals shall be required as a general rule except for NoCs/ approvals from departments like pollution control board (CTE/CTO), NoC from fire and emergency department, change of land use from revenue department, etc, wherever applicable,” the spokesman said.The lieutenant governor said consistent policy actions are being taken to encourage large-scale investment, innovation, restoring Jammu & Kashmir’s advantage in resources and skilled workforce to create a business-friendly environment and drive economic growth.“The recent decisions taken by the government in business sector including new Industrial Developmental Scheme will give a fillip to Jammu and Kashmir’s economy.“These ambitious structural reforms will not only improve J&K’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index but also create an unshakeable foundation for business entities, industries planning to invest in the Union Territory,” Sinha observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-scraps-15-nocs-opens-door-for-investors-101613356368168.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro to go contactless as DMRC pushes for QR code, RuPay-based ticketing||Spurred on by the pandemic, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has decided to introduce Quick Response (QR) codes and other digital payment-based systems on its network to make ticketing contactless. The Metro has invited Expression of Interest from private firms to upgrade its existing Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) system to enable QR code, bank account and RuPay based ticketing on its network.Currently, the QR code-based ticketing system is available only on Delhi Metro’s airport express line. The tickets on the airport express line are issued using a mobile application and the commuters have to scan the QR code ticket, which is sent on the user’s mobile phone, at the AFC gate at the station. Apart from the QR code facility, the airport Metro also allows the use of National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December last year.In the QR code system, users have to register on the mobile application, Ridlr, using mobile number and email ID and buy QR tickets by selecting the starting point, the destination station and the number of passengers who will travel. At a time, a maximum of six tickets can be purchased. Metro users can use their credit or debit card (new cards which have NCMC facility) while travelling on Metro’s airport express.The Metro now plans to make the QR code system available on its nine corridors, spread over 314 kilometres, and 245 stations by 2022. DMRC official said that this is being done following the National Common Mobility Card standard model specified by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry. The DMRC’s average daily ridership is 2.86 million and it served 100 crore riders in the financial year 2019-20.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “DMRC has invited expression of interest for implementation of QR code, EMV (enabled Account Based Ticketing (Master/VISA), and RuPay based ticketing.”The expression of interest also includes upgrading and maintenance of the existing AFC technology. Currently, Metro users have to swipe the Metro travel card or token against the AFC gates to gain entry.DMRC officials said that the entry AFC system on all corridors developed in Phase I, II and III will have to be upgraded. “There is a need for comprehensive maintenance of the AFC system of our Phase I, II and III stations. The existing AFC technology and infrastructure (hardware and software) needs to be updated. The key dates for delivery and commissioning will be detailed out in the Request for Proposal document,” said Dayal.As per the expression of interest document, the work will be awarded for a period of almost 11.5 years, including five years of operation and maintenance, from date of commencement.While DMRC has been planning to upgrade its ticketing system to become cashless for a while, the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has now only made the need for such technology a necessity.The NCMC will allow passengers with RuPay debit cards, issued in the last 20 months by nearly 23 banks, to be swiped for Metro travel.” It is currently available only on the Airport Express line. The NCMC will enable seamless travel across public transport modes in the country besides shopping and purchases, said the official.Metro services were closed for a period of 169 days last year due to the pandemic. The Centre had allowed Metro operations to resume in September but in a graded manner and with social distancing inside trains and on stations. As part of preventive measures, the DMRC has stopped the sale of tokens at its counters on Metro stations. Currently, metro users have to use DMRC’s travel card while commuting. While Metro trains continue to operate on 50% occupancy, transport and health experts say, contactless ticketing will have long term benefits for different reasons.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “This is a good move. In the next few years, there will be different modes of transportation — such as RRTS — will be available. While infrastructure integration is already being done by various agencies to provide seamless travel to commuters, common mobility card will be an added benefit. In the long run it will help in collecting data about passenger movement which will prove beneficial in improving the public transport services. But this facility should also be extended to feeder system.”Public health experts say that while the vaccine will soon be available for the public at large, people will have to continue to observe social distancing, hand hygiene and other basic precautions. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department community medicine, Safdarjung hospital, said, “QR code ticketing will help in ensuring public safety. But hygiene in public transport and other preventive measure should continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-to-go-cashless-touchfree-101613340496585.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools to focus on weak Class 10, 12 students||With less than three months to go for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) board examination for students of classes 10 and 12, teachers and principals of Delhi government schools said they are concerned about low-scoring children who were promoted from classes 9 and 11 as per a revised assessment policy involving scores based on assignment and grace marks.The move led to a significant increase in pass percentages for students of classes 9 and 11. In May last year, HT had reported that the pass percentage in class 9 had gone up from 58.6% in the previous academic session to 64.5%. For class 11, this number went from 84.8% to 96.2%.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said most schools, including his, are engaging in targeted intervention for these students. “Children who were promoted on the basis of revised promotion policy are mostly the ones who weren’t able to attend online classes during the pandemic and don’t attend offline classes now..”Last year following the Covid-19 lockdown, the Delhi government had devised a one-time revised promotion policy for students of class 9 and 11 where students were promoted using grace marks and assignments. Students who could not appear for their exams either due to the pandemic or the Delhi riots were given marks proportional to their mid-term results as well.A senior education department official, who asked not be named, said, “These students are on the radar of our teachers and targeted interventions are being made for their learning. Schools have made a list of these students and are monitoring their performance and attendance regularly. Apart from sufficient writing practice and regular tests, teachers are focusing on lessons which will help students score easily. Additionally, teachers have ‘adopted’ such students and will look after the performance of that particular student.”In addition to these, schools and teachers have devised their own methods to address the learning gaps. For instance, Jha said he had divided students into two groups on the basis of how they were promoted — via grace marks or assignment. “This helped teachers focus their attention to a homogenous group. We are now planning to print three sets of sample papers prepared by the education department for a particular subject, write the answers on those papers, and distribute among these students,” he said.Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, said the school had also taken help from the local community. “We have a lot of Afghan students who face language issues, or visually-impaired children who need assistance. Since we have been involved with the local community for the past few years, we roped in homemakers, volunteers, or members of resident welfare associations or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who could help us,” he said.Several principals said many among these students were not attending offline classes that started last month due to a host of reasons. Many were either untraceable, while some are now engaged in other work.Mudassir Jahan, head of school at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya at Noor Nagar, said, “The attendance for these students is also low and we are trying to get them to school. We have made announcements through local mosques, asking students to attend for classes. The challenge here is that these students have to be motivated more than others to even attend school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-to-focus-on-weak-class-10-12-students-101613340303157.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Man nabbed for giving saline jabs to students||The police have booked a 20-year-old college student for allegedly giving normal saline injections to students of classes 6-9 who used to take tuitions from him in east Delhi’s Mandawali.The suspect told the police during questioning that he did so to boost memory of his students. He said picked up the idea from videos on the internet, said an officer who is associated with the probe. The suspect has been detained for “detailed investigation” and booked under section 336 of the IPC for acts endangering human life or personal safety of others.Police said so far none of the parents of the suspect’s students have reported any medical complications to their children because of the injections. They are all, however, being medically examined, the police said.Another investigator said the matter was reported on Saturday when one of the students, a resident of the same neighbourhood, returned home with the injection after telling the suspect that he would take it from a doctor known to his parents. The child showed the injection to his parents and told them that they were getting the jab at the coaching centre to boost their memory, the investigator said quoting information given by the suspect.The parents of the child reported the matter to the police. They handed over the fluid to a team from Mandawali police station.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said during initial examination it was found that the liquid was NS solution (normal sodium chloride). “We also found that the tuition teacher is a second year gradation student. He told police that he saw on YouTube that the memory of the children improves if NS solution is administered to them. He was booked under section 336 of the IPC for acts endangering human life or personal safety of others,” Yadav said.The DCP said tuition teacher was yet to be formally arrested. “The matter is being probed from all possible angles,” he said.Normal saline is a prescription medicine used for fluid and electrolyte replenishment for intravenous administration. Faster heart beat, fever are among probable side effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-nabbed-for-giving-saline-jabs-to-students-101613339114664.html

According to recent reports, North Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation will soon issue licences for food trucks and carts, bringing back the world of meals on wheels to the Capital. Promote Delhi’s rich food cultureFood truck owners and restaurateurs feel this move, long in the pipeline, will promote the multi-regional food culture that Delhi boasts of. Hershvardhan Kumar, who owns a food truck in Dwarka, says, “It was legal to park food trucks in Delhi until authorities decided against issuing new licenses over a decade ago... Now, I hope to expand to North Campus and Greater Kailash.”An alternative experience for foodiesFood truck culture is a rage across the world, particularly attracting young professionals, and the concept has found favour in several Indian cities as well. Restaurateur Saurabh Khanijo, who introduced the food trucks Wanchai By Kylin, calls the return of food trucks to Delhi’s streets a “good news” for food lovers as well as mobile eatery business owners, as it allows everyone to enjoy a “diverse range of experiences”. Food truck spaces, a popular feature in the NCR, such as Sector 29 Leisure Valley Parking in Gurugram, can be replicated in Delhi as well, feels Khanijo. Need for designated spaces and hygieneTo ensure the sustainability of food truck culture in Delhi, Khanijo states that certain amenities must be taken care of first. “There needs to be designated areas where we can park, make sanitary seating arrangement, have mist fans in summer,” he says. Jyoti Ganapathi, who runs a food truck business named Dosa Inc, along with her partner Satya, adds that there also needs to be a proper procedural understanding between business owners and the authorities. “We understand that food trucks can’t be permitted on congested streets. However, clarity will be needed on whether we’ll be expected to park permanently or come and go according to fixed hours. The existing vending zones also need to be updated... Running water supply, fixed metre reading, waste disposal system — these need to be put into place to make sure food trucks serving on the roads can adhere to hygiene standards,” she explains, adding on an enthusiastic note, “We’d love to have places like Dilli Haat or Hauz Khas be made into food truck lots.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/food-trucks-need-prep-to-roll-in-delhi-get-set-for-meals-on-wheels-101613338802231.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Capital’s most beautiful door, perhaps||Found. At long last, Delhi’s arguably most beautiful door has been discovered. It doesn’t have a doorbell. It’s not in any of the forts or palaces, or museums. Surely not in the bungalow districts of Golf Links or Vasant Vihar. It doesn’t belong to a temple, nor to a mosque. It’s not part of any grand haveli. It is in Old Delhi, true. But not in Gali Naughara Street, famous for its old houses and doorways.It is somewhere you might never have stepped in. Gali Badliyan is a part of Gali Chooriwallan street, a kind of long winding alley, the turning to it so discreet and the street itself so ordinary that one needs to be very optimistic to imagine finding there a thing of great beauty.The entrance to a private house with rust-coloured walls and a finely sculpted balcony, the very sight of the wooden door takes the breath away. The primary aspect of its uniqueness is that, unlike doorways of such nature, it’s not broad at all, but very narrow. The door itself is like a coffee table art book. Its entire surface is sculpted with sceneries seeming to depict countless legends and stories. One pane shows a hunter, with a moustache and hat, aiming his gun towards a lion, himself running after a deer — a hapless deer, that seems to be plunging into a ravine.Another pane is the very antithesis of the aforementioned violence. It shows a vase crowded with a dense offering of flowers, the stalks disproportionately tall compared to the vase. The panes at the bottom show parrots.The door is the centerpiece of an arched niche, accompanied with taaks and columns, covered in decorations that look like creamy icings on a cake.The building has a set of two smaller doors, sculpted too. Though exquisite, they have the misfortune to be too close to the main door, which is such a grand distraction. A marble plaque on the wall identifies the building as Lala Ramsaran Das Bhawan.The door faces a lane full of residences, some of them seemingly uninhabited. A few passersby are walking in front of the door without tossing a look at it. Their supreme disinterest to such gloriousness, too, is breathtaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-capital-s-most-beautiful-door-perhaps-101613333913469.html

Out of the 2.03 lakh registered voters across the six councils in Ludhiana, 93,584 are in Khanna, including 49,121 males and 44,461 females.Payal recorded the highest polling at 83.1%, followed by Doraha with 74.8%.Due to foggy weather, the day started with low polling across all municipalities.While 14.1% votes were polled till 10am in Samrala, voting percentage remained dismal at 18.7% till 10am at Raikot. Similarly, just 12.7% voters came out to exercise their franchise in Khanna till 10am, while in Payal the figure was 16.81% till this time.Voting picked up after 2pm, when 69% votes were polled in all.In Raikot, party workers were seen visiting houses and urging the residents to visit the polling booths after 2pm. Some supporters even ferried the elderly to the polling booths in their vehicles. Officials dealing with the election process said the dip in the voter turnout could be attributed to these elections being the first since the Covid-19 outbreak in Ludhiana, adding that drop was also a reflection of free and fair polling.Voters of all ages come forwardAt a number of polling booths across Payal, Doraha, Khanna, Jagraon and Raikot, a large number of youngsters, mostly in their 20s, were seen escorting their elderly family members to the polling booths.At other places, adults had brought their children along. “I wanted to show my six-year-old daughter the voting process. It is important to vote and I have never missed any election,” said Jatinder Singh, a 35-year-old resident of Khanna.Senior citizens were seen in large number at all polling booths. A 90-year-old voter, Om Parkash, showed his indomitable spirit by arriving in a wheelchair, along with a glucose drip. He had never missed a chance to vote all his life, he said enthusiastically.The chance to vote for the first time had youngsters all enthused.The first-timers, who came to the polling stations with their family members or friends, said they were excited to be a part of the process and the youth should come forward to elect educated and unbiased candidates for a better future. “It is exciting to be a part of the democratic process. It was my first time, so I was bit nervous, but my grandfather joined me,” said Gursimran Singh, 20, with his grandfather Mohinder Singh, 79, beaming behind him.Most give masks the go-byWhile the election staff and all police officials on duty were sporting face masks, majority of the voters, even the elderly, arrived without masks. At some places, those on election duty were seen directing the voters to wear masks, but to no avail.(With inputs by Harsimran Singh Batra and Mohit Khanna)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-municipal-polls-73-9-voters-turn-up-to-seal-fate-of-112-101613333266243.html
15-02-2021||Chandigarh||Civic polls: 9 hurt in stone-pelting in Rupnagar, booth capturing alleged in Samana||Polling passed off peacefully in Patiala, Ropar and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, except some skirmishes and an instance of stone pelting in which nine persons were injured. In Samana Nagar council, Congress workers were accused of manhandling the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate and former MC President Kapoor Chand Bansal, after which former SAD minister Surjit Singh Rakhra, along with supporters, blocked the Samana-Patiala highway. Congress and SAD also clashed in Rupnagar with six persons sustaining injuries. The clash happened in ward number 1, after both accused each other of distributing cash for votes. Nine persons sustained injuries during the stone pelting. SAD alleged booth capturing in Patran, Samana, Nabha and other MC areas. The BJP kept a low-profile, and did not set up a booth outside the polling station.“Congress has murdered democracy and has let loose its goons. Booths were captured with the help of police. The election was rigged,” alleged Rakhra. Local MLA Rajinder Singh claimed that it was Rakhra and his supporters, who were trying to enter the polling station, leading to heated arguments. “No one has manhandled anyone. Rakhra has lost his constituency. Rakha’s allegations are baseless,” he said. At Nabha, SAD alleged police high-handedness. Rajpura recorded 64.1% polling; Nabha recorded 70.5%, Samana 67 % and Patran recorded highest 78.7%, said DC Kumar Amit.In Fatehgarh Sahib district, Khamano recorded 79%; in Rupnagar district, Kiratpur Sahib recorded 84%. *************************************Glitches in EVMs  at Bathinda, Moga

One incident each of poll violence took place in Sultanpur Lodhi town of Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur. In Sultanpur Lodhi, 15 persons were booked in two cases of violence after the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) workers clashed and hurled stones at each other near the block and panchayat development office in the evening. The Akali workers alleged that Congress activists even fired bullets in the air. “The ruling party workers tried to disrupt the election process right under the administration’s nose,” SAD leader Sajjan Singh Cheema said. Kapurthala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kanwardeep Kaur said they are identifying those involved in the incident involving firing in the air. “At least two persons were injured in the stone pelting,” she said.In Hoshiarpur district’s Garhdiwala town, BJP district (rural) president Sanjiv Minhas’ car was attacked by some people said to be farmers’ sympathisers. The incident took place when a crowd gathered outside the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha office and asked him to leave. When he came out, the protesters raised anti-BJP slogans and hit his car with rods. The police gave him a safe passage. The BJP leader alleged that the attack was carried out by Congress goons.

15-02-2021||Chandigarh||71% turnout in Punjab municipal polls amid stray violence||Barring few incidents of scuffle between workers of political parties and isolated cases of police resorting to cane-charging to disperse unruly crowds, polling for 117 civic bodies in Punjab remained peaceful on Sunday. The overall turnout was 71.4%. In the previous civic body elections for six municipal corporations held in February 2015, 69% polling was recorded. This time, elections have also been held for eight municipal corporations. These polls have been delayed by at least six months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polling in Mohali district was the lowest at 60%, while the highest turnout was 83% in Mansa. Punjab cabinet ministers were seen in the field welcoming voters to polling stations. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cadre and its leaders remained low-key. The SAD and the BJP contested these polls separately, after the Akalis broke up with the saffron party last year over the three agri-laws passed in Parliament.The State Election Commission (SEC) had set up 4,102 polling stations, of which 1,708 were sensitive and 861 hypersensitive. Over 19,000 police personnel were deployed. At least five persons were injured in scuffles between political parties. At most places, the saffron party was unable to put up its polling camps, generally done by the workers of all political parties outside polling stations, with farmers opposing this. In these elections, 9,222 candidates were in fray for municipal corporations and A and B-grade councils. Of total nominees, 2,037 are from the Congress; 1,606 of the principal opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP); 1,569 of the SAD, and 1,003 nominees belong to the BJP. Elections for C-level councils are being held without party symbols. Three firing incidents were reported, including two in Patti and Bhikhwind towns of border district Tarn Taran. At both places, the workers of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress clashed after an argument over allegations of bogus voting. Firing was also reported from Sultanpur Lodhi in Jalandhar. A BJP leader was hurt in a clash with Congress supporters in Batala. In a group clash between SAD supporters and the Congress in Fatehgarh Churian, police resorted to a mild cane-charge to disperse crowd. In Pathankot, BJP state president Ashwini Sharma staged a dharna, alleging that a party worker’s house was attacked with swords by Congress workers. The State Election Commission (SEC) has termed the polls as completely peaceful, saying that it did not receive any complaint. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal wrote on twitter, “Failed on all fronts, Congress leaders knew they would lose, so they resorted to booth capturing and violence. (It’s a) shame on the state election commission for its absolute incompetence.” Congress state president Sunil Jakhar thanked voters for peaceful polls. The counting of votes will take place on February 17 and it will be a dry day for liquor in the state. *****************************StrapAllegations of bogus voting, booth capturing by oppn parties; state election commission terms polls as completely peaceful, even as state BJP chief protests in PathankotHeadlineThe highs and the lowsIntro HT brings you the top three districts in terms of the highest turnout and the lowest turnout.Highest turnout districtsMansa 83%Bathinda 79%Sangrur 77.4%Lowest turnout districtsMohali 60%Tarn Taran 63.1%Moga 69.5%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/71-turnout-in-punjab-municipal-polls-amid-stray-violence-101613331945256.html

Bhavishya Bhardwaj, 21, a resident of Phase 10, Mohali, said, “The representatives of people should be approachable to people and should resolve the issues of locals timely.”The young voters appeared to have more clarity on what issues and which candidates were they voting for. “The representatives should be loyal and more young people should be given a chance for representation,” said 18-year-old Anmolpreet Kaur, a first-time voter from Phase 3B2.Pearl Bansal, 19, a resident of Phase 5, who is a first-time voter, said, “Residents, especially the young people, should feel safer. There should be a check on minors who drive without licence and cycling should be promoted in the city on the lines of Chandigarh.”Cleaner and safer societyEshaan Sandhir, 20, of Phase 3A, Mohali, said, “The society should be cleaner and safer. Everyone’s needs should be met.

15-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai almost gets back on track with train services for all||At least 15 million people have travelled by local trains on the Central, Western and Harbour lines since February 1 when the suburban train network allowed general commuters after nearly a year. All 1,774 Central Railway trains and 1,367 Western Railways trains in the network were stopped on March 23, 2020, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Four months later, in July, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray allowed essential care workers like doctors, nurses and medical staff to use local trains. In the following months, women, persons with disabilities, and lawyers were also allowed to travel.Now, with everyone back on the trains, restrictions have been put in place in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The timings are staggered and it will be so till the government takes a call on complete resumption of services: 4.45am to 7am; 12pm to 4pm; 9pm to 11.30pm. Those found without a mask are fined ₹200 by the Government Railway Police. Railway Protection Force personnel have been deputed to control the crowds.A fortnight on, the positivity rate in Mumbai has begun to rise — experts cite the crowding in trains as one of the factors responsible — we speak to five Mumbaiites to ask them why they’re boarding the local. Read their profiles:‘My commute has come down from 7 hours to 2’“There is no Mumbai if there are no local trains operating,” Jyoti Nair, a resident of Dombivli, Thane said, as she took a seat in the train compartment last week. She has been travelling by local trains on the Central and Western lines for the past 20 years.The 44-year-old works as an office assistant in a private firm that sells pipe valves, located in Masjid Bunder. Her husband works with the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) as a depot manager and her son goes to school.When Nair resumed office in August, her commute often took up to seven hours.“I began to take a bus to work. The journey took two hours in the morning and nearly five hours in the evening because of the evening rush hour. It was simply horrific,” Nair said.Not only was it expensive — Nair would spend ₹400 every day travelling in the AC bus — it also meant that she would barely get a few hours of sleep she also had to leave her home early. “I would get up by 3am to do the household work before heading to the office. I developed a back pain travelling on the bad roads,” she said.Then, in October, Nair was robbed close to the bus stop near her house.“I have never had such a terrifying experience. Somewhere near the bus stop, a few people snatched the chain I was wearing,” Nair recalled.Now that Nair takes the local, she said, her life is easier. She still leaves early — she takes the train in the earliest time slot — but she’s saving on both time, and money.“I am not just saving money but also travelling time. My commute time has come down to two hours,” said Nair.What would help is if more trains begin to ply, Nair said.Nair is not worried about crowds, she said. “Crowding inside local train compartments is bound to happen. I take precautions, wear a face mask and use hand sanitizer,” she said.‘Normalcy once all offices open’Train commuters often kept time with the 5,000-strong network of dabbawalas who delivered home-cooked food to office goers from Ambernath and Virar to Colaba and Churchgate between 12.30pm to 1.30pm every day (except Sundays). However, once the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25, the dabbawalas went out of work.Sandeep Gaikar, who has been a dabbawala for 30 years, missed his itinerant lifestyle. “I travelled everywhere by the local train to deliver tiffins across the city. I travelled on the Central and Harbour lines,” said the 45-year-old.Though Gaikar’s landlord waived his ₹5,000 rent for some months during the lockdown, his family faced hard days. The Kalyan resident was the only earning member of his family till the pandemic hit. As his monthly income, which ranged at around ₹15,000 came down to zero,Gaikar eventually moved back to his village in Junnar in Pune district — which he had left at 15 to work in the big city — where he farmed on his family’s small landholding. Gaikar returned to Mumbai in three months and took up a part-time gig as a security guard.Gaikar’s wife, Kavita (37) now works in a small tailoring unit while daughter, Pratiksha (18), will begin college this year. Son, Sahil (16) will now attend school in the village.“The cost of education is high in Mumbai,” Gaikar said.“It is a blessing that the local train services have finally resumed for the general public. We have suffered for one year as no other mode of public transport is possible for moving the number of tiffins we do,” Gaikar said when we met him at Sanpada station.It’s not the same however, he said. “Many dabbawalas have returned to their village. People are working from home, so there are not many tiffins to deliver,” he said.“Earlier, one dabbawala would carry 30 tiffins. Now we carry barely eight,” said Gaikar, who collects tiffins from Kalyan and delivers them to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee in Vashi.The staggered timings do not affect Gaikar. In fact, he said, he often finds the trains empty enough for him and his tiffin stand. But he isn’t happy about it.Only after all offices resume, our work will get back to normal,” he said.‘I’m worried about putting my grandmother at risk’“Travelling by local trains is a compulsion and no passenger follows the coronavirus protocol,” 21-year old Vishwa Shah said, on her way to Bandra.A student of clinical psychology at RD National College, Shah has been a regular commuter on the local trains since her school-going days.Now, a whole year after she last boarded the train, Shah, a resident of Kandivli’s Mahavir Nagar, has begun travelling to college to submit her assignments in person. Physical classes will resume on February 15 at 10am sharp, Shah said.Once classes resume, Shah will have to leave in the first slot (4.45am to 7am) of staggered timings — a full three hours before her first class. Her classes will end by 8pm, which means Shah will have to wait an hour before she takes the train back home. Shah said the other option of travelling by auto and cab is too expensive — she will have to shell out ₹500 both ways.“I don’t have any other option,” Shah said.For Shah, this is all the more worrisome as she lives with her grandparents (both 75; her grandmother is on medication for hypothyroidism) and her parents (her father aged 51 is diabetic; her 47-year-old mother does not have any co-morbidities).Travelling frequently by local trains will increase her exposure to the virus, and in turn put her family at risk, she said. “At least I follow all the coronavirus protocols and wear gloves and masks during commuting,” she said.‘Traffic made travelling by road a horror’The local train has been Kalbadevi resident Nirmal Jain’s trusted mode of transportation since he started his garment wholesale business. His business takes him to Santacruz and Thane frequently besides other parts of the city, visiting shopkeepers and increasingly, online sellers.But when the lockdown was announced in end-March 2020, thousands of businessmen like Jain were affected. The 62-year-old began to use his Hero Honda motorcycle to make his rounds once restrictions on movement were eased.From spending two hours in the local, his commute went up to four hours a day on road. “I could not travel everyday because of the cost of fuel, which increased significantly.” said Jain. “I was forced to spend four to five hours commuting. Traffic in the western suburbs and on the Eastern Freeway made travelling a horror,” he said.Now that the trains are back on track, albeit with staggered timings, Jain is happy. The lone breadwinner of his family— he lives with wife, Manju, children Swagat and Prashansa and daughter-in-law, Sohi—Jain is happy that he’s back to saving money on travelling.On average, Jain said that he spent up to ₹1,000 every day on fuel, travelling from his south Mumbai home to the western suburbs and Thane.“The fuel cost was double of what a railway pass costs. Initially I had to dip into my savings for this additional cost,” Jain said.The local train timings work well for Jain as he begins his work day only after lunch and returns late. “I finish my meal and then take a local train from Marine Lines railway station. I visit multiple shops and online store owners throughout the day and return home at night,” Jain said.Jain said that a majority of his fellow passengers stick to the protocols, but crowding is a difficult issue to manage.“A few passengers do not wear masks inside the compartment but they are immediately told off and asked to mask up by the others around them. People are knowledgeable about the virus but there are incidents of crowding inside compartments. All passengers want to board at once,” Jain said.Nevertheless, he is happy the trains have resumed. “Even with restricted timings the local trains are a boon. Like me there are other businessmen who are saving time and cutting down on travelling costs. The city will come back to normalcy as the markets slowly open,” he said.‘It’s impossible to board the train’Rakesh Patil, a 32-year-old resident of Kasara, works as a coordinator in the district collector office in Thane.“My work involves a lot of travelling,” said Patil, who lives with his wife Sadhna, 28; daughter Sarah, 4; and his brother’s family.Patil’s work involves inspection visits to forest sites. He is also required to meet officials from different government agencies like Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).Though this involves a good deal of travelling, Patil uses the bus and other public transportation modes quite regularly. So the staggered timings do not affect him, he said.“It’s the people coming from far away areas like Igatpuri to reach Kasara station who are most affected by the restricted timings. I live close to the station,” he said.Patil has been travelling by local trains for 16 years — as a student, and later, for work — so he was excited when the trains resumed on February 1.But he gets worried when he sees crowds, Patil said. “It’s almost impossible to board a train,” he said.“It is not possible to avoid crowds completely. I wear facial masks and wash my hands regularly. It is necessary to take precautions and I follow the protocols,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-almost-gets-back-on-track-with-train-services-for-all-101613329008419.html
15-02-2021||Chandigarh||56% voters turn up to elect new Mohali MC House||As many as 56% of the registered voters turned up to elect the 50-member General House of the Mohali municipal corporation, which went to the polls along with seven other municipal councils in the district on Sunday. Mohali (urban) saw a drop of 5% in the turnout, as compared to 61% recorded in 2015, when elections were held for the first time. Overall, the district reported 60% voter turnout, with Banur leading at 78% and Zirakpur lagging behind at 55%.In all, 901 candidates are in the fray from 195 wards in the civic bodies of Mohali, Kharar, Kurali, Dera Bassi, Zirakpur, Lalru, Banur and Nayagaon. The counting will take place on February 17. The polling largely passed off peacefully, though four people were injured in minor clashes in Dera Bassi and there was an allegation of booth capturing in Mohali city. Questions were also raised over the slow pace of work by officials at booths set up in villages and colonies. EVM glitches delay polling in LalruIt seemed like a festive occasion in several villages and towns of the municipal councils as voters started queuing up as early as 7:30am. Though officials were carrying thermal scanners at the entrance to every polling booth, most of them were found not using them. Most of the officials were also without masks despite directions issued in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Polling, which was supposed to begin at 8am across 509 booths in the district, was delayed by half an hour in Lalru due to a glitch in electronic voting machines. It took time to pick up the pace, and only 13% voters turned up in Mohali (urban) by 10am. However, the number shot up to 42% by 2pm and reached 56% in the next two hours as entry was stopped at 4pm and only those people still in the queue were allowed to vote. All political parties had set up desks at all polling booths to assist of voters. Candidates, who had expected a higher turnout, said that many voters apparently chose to stay home due to the pandemic. In Mohali, long queues were seen only at a few polling stations, in Phases 2, 3 and 7.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, who is also the district electoral officer and visited most of the polling booths, said: “Initially, there were some glitches, which were sorted out soon. Overall, voters expressed satisfaction over the arrangements, which included drinking water, seating and better queue management.” Dayalan said the administration will study the reasons behind the drop in turnout despite organising extensive awareness programmes, “but it seems people did not turn up due to Covid-19”. The district witnessed a multi-cornered contest between Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party and Azad Group-Aam Aadmi Party combine led by former mayor Kulwant Singh. In the previous elections to the Mohali MC, Kulwant had led the Azad group (of independents) and won 10 seats. With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 last year. “We are satisfied with the way the elections were held. We thank the administration and police for ensuring peaceful polling,” said Kulwant. Even Punjab health minister and local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu expressed satisfaction over the conduct of polls.Azad group candidate demands repollingParamjeet Singh Kahlon, Azad group candidate from Ward No. 10, has lodged a complaint with the state election commission against Congress candidate Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, demanding repolling in the ward.In his complaint, he alleged that police forcibly removed his polling agents from the booth in connivance with Congress workers. Balbir Singh Sidhu, who is Amarjeet’s brother, rubbished the allegations. Charanjeet Singh Brar, senior SAD leader and co-observer in Mohali, also claimed to have received reports about Congress workers deleting votes of Akali workers. “We will check it and lodge a complaint with the state election commission,” he said. Meanwhile, six men of Mauli Baidwan village were arrested for uprooting a tent pitched by BJP candidate Rakhi Pathak to assist voters at Mohali’s ward number 31. Pathak’s husband Suresh Kumar alleged that around a dozen men reached the spot around 10:30am and said they won’t let a party that has enacted anti-farmer laws to pitch a tent there.Four injured in minor clashes at Dera BassiMinor clashes left four people injured in different wards of Dera Bassi. BJP leader and lawyer Mukesh Gandhi was injured after being attacked at the party’s booth in Ward No. 12. He alleged he was attacked at the behest of a Congress candidate after he stopped the men from barging into a polling booth. The assailants were later arrested. In Ward No. 18, SAD candidate Harwinder Singh Pinka’s supporter Madan Lal was attacked with sharp-edged weapons by unknown men, who barged into his house. Madan had to be shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital in Chandigarh. A scuffle broke out between former municipal council president Harjinder Singh Rangi and Congress candidate Ranjit Singh Reddy over alleged fake votes in Ward No. 18. Police had to intervene to bring the situation under control. In Ward No. 8, a scuffle broke out between BJP candidate Nirmal Singh Nimma and Congress candidate Jaswinder Singh. Deputy superintendent of police Gurbakhshish Singh said there were minor incidents in some wards, which were being investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/56-voters-turn-up-to-elect-new-mohali-mc-house-101613328825640.html
15-02-2021||Chandigarh||Waste collection in Chandigarh: MC House to finalise MoU||Going ahead with its plan to take over pan-city door-to-door garbage collection, the Chandigarh municipal corporation is keeping its both options open: either the existing cart-based waste lifters get on board or it would outsource the work of helpers and drivers. On Monday, it is set to seek the approval of the MC General House on both the issues. The civic body has already received all 390 garbage collection vehicles, and is ready to extend collection of segregated waste to the entire city. The only stumbling block is the missing personnel to man its vehicles.So far, of 1,342 garbage collectors in the city, only 609 have enrolled with the MC and 147 have started working on its vehicles as helpers and drivers. Notably, last week, the main union of garbage collectors agreed to the MC’s offer. The General House will decide on the model memorandum of understanding (MoU)on Monday.For enroling garbage collectors for the MC’s takeover, various public notices were given in leading newspapers, with the last one on January 29.“For ensuring smooth functioning of the door-to-door garbage collection project, helpers may be deployed on outsource basis if the number of helpers required on these vehicles is not met with the existing waste lifters,” said an MC official, on the condition of anonymity. Various meetings have been held with representatives of garbage collector associations to finalise the MoU, said the official. Payments to collectors from the monthly utility bills, revenue from reusable garbage and insurance are some of the key features of the MoU. It will be effective from the date they start working on the garbage collection vehicles.The Door-To-Door Garbage Collectors Society, which represents majority of this unorganised sector, on February 8 gave its go ahead to the revised terms and conditions for signing the agreements between individual waste lifters and MC. Another group is still opposing the MC takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waste-collection-in-chandigarh-mc-house-to-finalise-mou-101613328585618.html
15-02-2021||Chandigarh||Safety, proper civic amenities key issues for Mohali women voters||Women who cast their vote during the Mohali municipal corporation elections on Sunday said that women’s safety, proper civic amenities and a solution to the stray cattle and dog menace are their priorities. With more women candidates in fray this time, they are hopeful that the issue of safety will be addressed by ensuring functional streetlights, increased patrolling and safe public transportation. With 50% seats reserved for them, unlike 33% in the previous election, the 50-member MC House will have at least 25 women councillors this time. Of 1.4 lakh registered voters, 68,715 are women. Palak, a resident of Phase 4, who works as an IT professional, said, “With women working round-the-clock, it is necessary to make the city safe for them. There are also many senior citizens who might fall prey to crimes. So, the MC must ensure that all street lights are working and there are no dark stretches.” “More female councillors will be elected to the MC house this time and we are hopeful that they work actively to address key issues being faced by residents,” said Drishti Singh, a homemaker living in Sector 63. Shubhangi, a resident of Sector 68, who works with a consultancy firm, said, “ Keeping in mind the increasing number of vehicles in the city, it is a must to develop multi-level parking.” Sukhwant Kaur, who lives with her family at a rented accommodation in Mataur, said, “The stray dog and cattle menace needs to be resolved on priority. The MC House also needs to address the long-pending demand for a local bus service to make transportation cost effective and safe.” Some residents also felt that councillors need to address the issue of hooliganism in Mohali markets. “With more working women in the city now, the civic body must ensure that hooliganism prevalent in city markets at night is stopped. Councillors must ensure increased patrolling in the prominent markets of the town,” said Asha Sharma, a law graduate living in Phase 5. “Traffic violators needs to be dealt with strictly to ensure safety. Youngsters zipping around without helmets, playing loud music and jumping red lights is a common sight in the city. CCTV cameras should be used to issue challans, similar to Chandigarh,” added Ridhima Kumar, a resident of Phase 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/safety-proper-civic-amenities-key-issues-for-mohali-women-voters-101613328406704.html

15-02-2021||Mumbai||Greatship Rohini fire: 3 trapped crew members found dead||The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) has recovered the bodies of three crew members who were reported trapped inside the engine room of the ill-fated offshore supply ship ‘Greatship Rohini’ which caught fire on Saturday. The bodies were found on Sunday morning, in a search operation conducted jointly by 19 persons, including eight crew members of Greatship Rohini and 11 members from ICG.The bodies of two seafarers found from the tween deck area are burnt beyond recognition and a third seafarer found from the engine control room, is reported to have sustained burn injuries, said director general of shipping, Amitabh Kumar.An inquiry has been ordered and an official of the rank of joint director general, technical (principal officer MMD, Mumbai), will conduct an inquiry, said Kumar. “The cause of the will be known after proper investigation,” added Kumar.The ship was 92 nautical miles off Mumbai coast when the fire broke out, near the NQO platform of Mumbai High. A total of 18 crew members were on-board the vessel at the time of the incident. The fire started in the engine room. One officer identified as Gurbeender Singh, who works as an electro-technological officer, sustained burn injuries and was evacuated in a chopper and shifted to a hospital. He is out of danger and recuperating in the hospital, said ICG officer.As soon as the ICG operation centre received information about the fire, offshore patrol vessel Samarth was diverted to provide help. Meanwhile, a Dornier aircraft was launched for assessment of the situation. ICG ship Samarth, with its advanced external fire-fighting system, offshore vessel Priya 27, and several other boats were involved in rescue and boundary cooling operations. The major part of the fire was doused till Saturday late evening, but because of heat, it kept simmering and reigniting. The foam was used last night and today morning to douse the fire completely, said ICG officers. The coast guard officials and company’s staff members boarded the vessel at 7:30am to resume searching for missing crew members. The search was focused on the tween deck area which, also houses the engine control room. Bodies of three seafarers were found at around 10:30am. The bodies of two seafarers were found from the tween deck area and that of a third seafarer from the engine control room also reported to have sustained burn injuries. The deceased’s family have been informed. The vessel is safe but has a sad part and unfortunately lost three lives, added Kumar.Greatship Rohini is an offshore supply vessel and assists the ONGC platform. All assisting vessels were there. The Greatship Anjali towed away from the vessel to a safe place from the sensitive installation. So if there is any problem sensitive installation should not damage, added Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/greatship-rohini-fire-3-trapped-crew-members-found-dead-101613327925435.html
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Family functions, vacations new Covid-19 super spreaders||Amid the lifting of curbs, family gatherings for weddings and birthday parties, holidays at nearby tourist destinations and visiting families and friends outside Mumbai have now become Covid-19 super-spreader events, according to doctors.With the starting of the interstate trains and airport flights capacity increased to 85%, health care experts said a large number of Mumbaiites have started heading out for mini vacations. “People are also attending family dos. Also, the number of people who can be invited for wedding receptions has increased from the initial 50 to 200. People are tired of being indoors for almost a year and have dropped their guard. This is leading to violation of social distancing norms, not wearing masks during family. If people had been more careful, the number of new cases could have been reduced by half,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants (AMC).A case in point is a 33-year-old Borivli resident, who visited her sister in Pune in early January, after 10 months. While she largely stayed indoors, her sister employed at a non-government organisation had to step out for work thrice a week. All was well till January 12, when she returned home. She developed fever with sore throat. Barring her senior citizen parents, three from the family, including her, tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 and spent eight days at Bhagwati hospital, Borivli.Also Watch | Covid update: India's new office rules; special mask coating; USA vs China“Throughout the pandemic, I have been extremely careful as my parents suffer from diabetes. After staying indoors for almost 10 months, I visited my sister for a vacation. Despite taking all precautionary measures, we still don’t know how we got infected,” she said.With the city’s Covid-19 pandemic curve flattening, the state started to ease restrictions that were imposed to break the chain and control the spread and transmission of the virus. “Sars-Cov-2—the virus that causes Covid-19 – spreads through air droplets. The virus can remain on surfaces for hours. While travelling, if people don’t wear masks and continue touching their faces frequently, the chances of getting infected are high. While travelling, it is not possible to sanitise all door handles and railings, so individual precautions are compulsory,” said Dr Vikrant Shah, infection specialist, Zen hospital.“Currently, we are observing that a majority of new cases are of those with recent travel history or those who attended a family gathering. We are getting more group infections among family members,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer of the R/C ward that covers Borivli.In yet another incident, in October, 2020, 14 people got infected when they participated in a birthday party at Andheri. As per a family member, a senior citizen who had a mild fever was present throughout the celebration. The person who was a carrier of the pathogen of Covid-19 infected 14 of them. One of the infected couples spread the virus to their parents when they went back home.“A total of 16 people were infected and six had to get hospitalised. One of them was kept on oxygen support due to breathing difficulty. The rest were home quarantined,” said a family member, requesting anonymity.Over the past seven days, Covid-19 cases in the city grew at a rate of 0.13%. However, nine wards in the city, covering Mulund, Vikhroli, Bandra, Khar, among others, have recorded higher growth rates of 0.14% to 0.21%. As per ward officers, new Covid-19 cases are mainly from non-slum areas. In Mumbai, 1,880 buildings are currently sealed and K/W ward that covers Andheri west tops the list.Medical officer health, Dr Gulnar Khan from the ward said, “Over 40% of the new patients have a history of vacation or family functions.”“Household transmission during parties can be a major source of infection. One doesn’t know if an invited guest is infected or not. So the infected particles may remain floating in the atmosphere of the house which can infect others if they don’t wear masks,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist.Dr Anita Mathew, infectious disease specialist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said, “We need to understand that to control the pandemic, we need a vaccine, but we can protect ourselves with basic measures such as wearing a mask, washing hands and maintaining the required physical distance at work and family functions.”Health experts seek stringent rules for defaulters. “During the start of the lockdown, the civic body was issuing fines to people who weren’t wearing masks. But now, no such action is being taken against defaulters. Until all get vaccinated, it is essential for the civic body to remain stringent and issues guidelines for travellers and family functions,” said Dr Abhijit More, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-family-functions-vacations-new-covid-19-super-spreaders-101613327805912.html

The motorists have complained that despite having balance in their accounts, they are not able to pay the toll, and they end up paying cash. The others said that even as they make the payment through FASTag, the process takes a longer time, resulting in traffic snarls on the busy highway.FASTag uses radio-frequency identification (RFID), which enables automatic deduction of toll charges at NHAI toll plazas. The tag must be linked with the motorists’ adequately funded prepaid or savings/current account. After the tag account gets active, the motorists can affix the tag on the windscreen of their vehicles. It enables them to drive through toll plazas, without having to stop to pay.The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) introduced this system at 50% of the toll gates at Vashi toll naka around eight months ago.Farhan Azmi, restaurateur and politician from Mumbai, on Saturday, tweeted, “Over 3km long ques at the gates of #mumbai Vashi Toll. Most of the #Fasttag scanners are malfunctioning! Even though the account shows balance, you end up paying cash. Absolute chaos!! Why are we still paying #toll ? #stoppayingtoll #SpeakUp.” BN Kumar, 65, a resident of Kopar Khairane said, “On Saturday, around 4pm, I was on my way to Mumbai from Vashi. I paid through FASTag, however, it took me 25 minutes to cross a stretch of two-kilometres before reaching the toll naka.”Kamlakar Phand, chief general manager of MSRDC (toll) said, “The new FASTag system may take some time due to certain technical glitches. But we are upgrading the system and it will take us only 15 more days to complete it. There will be no delays after that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-traffic-snarls-near-vashi-toll-naka-commuters-blame-fastag-101613327565624.html

15-02-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Common retirement planning mistakes that you must avoid||If you’ve been reading these pieces, you’ll know that we are a keen follower of taking a long view when it comes to financial planning. Take retirement, for instance. It’s not something to take lightly, because it involves acute planning and we make many mistakes along the way. Here are a few common ones:Delayed savingsOne of the foremost rules of retirement planning is to start investing early. Investing money early in life means that you allow more time to let it grow. Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra, an omnichannel financial services marketplace said, “One of the best friends for your retirement financial planning is ‘compounding interest,’ i.e., the earlier you start your savings, the better yield you will fetch.” What’s more, long-term investments in equity markets help to average investments and creating a corpus for retirement. Starting earlier also helps you make the best returns from equity-linked investment products. According to Vivek Jain, head-Investments, Policybazaar.com, an online portal for insurance purchase, products that promise guaranteed returns are best given the fluctuating market scenario and low-interest-rate environment. “The rate reduction in interest on bank deposits has greatly impacted the financial planning of millions of households. Some investments that guarantee returns, irrespective of the changes in market conditions and interest rates, also have an inbuilt ‘life protection’ component,” Jain said.Lack of clarityConfusion over your own financial goals — and being unsteady in your investment — is a big impediment to building your retirement corpus. As your income and allowances increase so do your expenses and responsibilities. Plan to pay for big ticket expenses like higher education, home and vehicle loans, weddings etc, through short-term or liquid investments. Add to this expenditure during emergencies and you will be able to gauge how much money you would need each month post retirement. Any kind of cash flow projection requires making correct assumptions about your financial status in future based on what you have earned, saved and invested till date. Sometimes, life may throw you a curveball like a job loss — we dealt with that in a previous piece on financial planning for an emergency.Savings not in sync with current lifestyleYour lifestyle matters while deciding to save for retirement. While planning for retirement, you must save to maintain your current lifestyle. According to Khosla, “To ensure the current lifestyle after retirement you should create a financial plan at least 30 years in advance, factoring in your life expectancy, inflation and cash flow requirements. After retirement, your focus should be on health-related expenses and monthly expenses as most of the other financial commitments such as loan repayment, child education etc will be over by then.”Zero legacy planningDo you discuss your finances with your spouse? Most couples do not realize how retirement can affect their relationship, especially, in the face of zero earnings and limited investments. Also, not many understand the relevance of including their partners in their investment making decisions. This can impact your perspective regarding savings that must last for both of you in the last years of your lives. The first step is to discuss how much you can save and invest keeping in mind your mutual goals. The concept of legacy seems far-fetched, but must be discussed and decided. Decide on what and how much you wish to set aside for your children. Buying a life insurance policy with an adequate policy term can also be another way to leave behind a legacy for your children to cherish. “Term insurance helps you avail a high sum assured cover at a low premium. The plan pays a lump sum benefit in case of a person’s premature death or disability. Thus, it provides one cost-effective insurance against all the liabilities and ensures the family is taken care of financially even in one’s absence or incapacity,” Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online market place for financial products, said.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-common-retirement-planning-mistakes-that-you-must-avoid-101613326966879.html
15-02-2021||Other||Mumbai-based BARC designs first research reactor through PPP model||The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has designed a research reactor that can make radioisotopes available at low costs to medical and other industries. In a first, the premiere nuclear research organisation of the department of atomic energy (DAE) will share the technology with industries through a public-private partnership. This is expected to bring down costs of cancer treatment in India. Radioisotopes are radioactive isotopes that have an unstable atomic nucleus. They emit energy and particles when they change to a more stable form. Radioisotopes are widely used in nuclear medicine for diagnostics as well as to treat diseases such as cancer. The industrial uses of radioisotopes include identifications of flow malfunctions, measurement of flow parameters, evaluation of design of chemical reactors, monitoring of product quality and process efficacy. In India, all major radioisotopes are produced by the BARC, which houses research reactors in its Trombay campus and an accelerator in Kolkata. Some radioisotopes are imported from Europe, Australia and other Asian countries. Radioisotopes in India can be procured and handled only by the users duly authorised by the radiological safety division (RSD), atomic energy regulatory board (AERB). Private entities that are willing to invest in the construction of the research reactor and its processing units will get exclusive rights to process and market the radioisotopes produced in the reactor. Meanwhile, the demand for radioisotopes for nuclear medicine is on the rise. Between 2018 and 2020, the number of nuclear medicine departments in the country’s hospitals has grown from 293 to 349, according to AERB. “Typically, research reactors have facilities such as radioisotope production, testing of structural materials for its use in nuclear reactors, making neutrons available for material science studies etc. The research reactor planned by BARC primarily has facilities for radioisotope production. Apart from medical radioisotopes, provisions are also made for producing radioisotopes for industrial use like Cobalt-60, Iridium-192, Bromine-82 etc,” said an email response from the office of KN Vyas, secretary, DAE. The proposed research reactor is expected to bring down the cost of nuclear medicine, which are extensively used for cancer treatment. “As the research reactor (under planning stage) is expected to produce a relatively large quantity of radioisotopes and the associated facilities are also catering to relatively large quantities of radiopharmaceuticals, it is felt that the cost of producing radiopharmaceuticals may reduce. As the radiopharmaceuticals are being manufactured indigenously, it is expected that increased self-sufficiency will lead to cheaper radiopharmaceuticals and consequently reduce the cost of cancer treatment,” read the response from Vyas. DAE has said that it is in discussion with potential Indian and global investors and the identification of a suitable site for the reactor is in process. The research reactor is expected to come online in five years after the construct begins, said DAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbaibased-barc-designs-first-research-reactor-through-ppp-model-101613326906279.html
15-02-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad most polluted cities||The air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad worsened on Sunday due to unfavourable weather conditions, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The air quality index (AQI) bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) stated that the twin cities of Ghaziabad and Noida stood as the most polluted across the country with an AQI of 416 (‘severe’) each.Greater Noida, which was also among the three top polluted cities, registered an AQI of 402 (‘severe’). The three cities on Sunday were the only ones among the 126 cities on the CPCB bulletin to record AQI under ‘severe’ category, CPCB said.IMD officials said that the foggy conditions, which are also leading to smog as a result of slow wind speed, will continue to prevail during the morning hours in the three cities for the next two days.“The wind speed pattern, which is anti-clockwise at present and ranging from Punjab to eastern UP, is having centred around Ghaziabad and Noida. So, the slow wind speed, coupled with smog, is affecting dispersal of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre at IMD.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 is ‘severe’.Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP pollution control board, said, “The meteorological conditions due to slow wind speed is causing pollution in both Ghaziabad and Noida. Besides, major congestion at border areas has resulted in high levels of pollution. In Ghaziabad, both Indirapuram and Vasundhara monitoring stations are highly impacted by pollution resulting out of traffic congestions.”The traffic congestions in trans-Hindon areas of Ghaziabad have resulted due to blockade of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) since December 3 last year by protesting farmers.IMD’s Srivastava also said that the foggy conditions will prevail for two more days in parts of Delhi-NCR. “In Delhi, fog will be moderate to dense while in areas like Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, it will be dense to very dense with visibility likely to fall below 100 metres. The conditions will prevail more during the earlier part of the day from 6am to 10am. The conditions are likely to improve Tuesday onwards,” he added.The IMD officials said that the normal maximum temperature range during this time of the year is about 24 degrees Celsius but it is hovering at about 28-29 degrees Celsius at present. The minimum temperature is normal at about 10-11 degrees Celsius at present, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-and-ghaziabad-most-polluted-cities-101613326785965.html
15-02-2021||Noida||Low turnout for Covid vaccination: Noida, Ghaziabad told to take steps||Taking serious note of the low turnout of frontline workers during the vaccination drive against the coronavirus (Covid-19) February 11 and 12, state officials wrote to the district officials to take up suitable measures to increase the same.The letter was sent by Uttar Pradesh’s additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi to Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar district admins.Sources in the health department said that the letter has highlighted two counts – one in which more than one beneficiaries were registered on a single mobile number, and one in while some mobile numbers were either wrong or found switched off – due to which the beneficiaries could not receive messages.The letter also mentions that many frontline workers were on duty in other districts and could not come for vaccination, above sources added.“The communication has stated that more the Covid-vaccination coverage is to be increased and that those who are posted outside the district can get the shot at any session across the state. It also says that frontline workers who go for the vaccination should be given an off from work that day,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.“We have asked different departments to expedite vaccination coverage and spread more awareness among frontline workers. Our coverage for healthcare workers was high but it reduced considerably in case of frontline workers.” Dr Gupta added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls for his comments over the issue.On February 11, the turnout in Ghaziabad district stood at 45.34%, with 1,559 taking the shots out of the day’s target of 3,439. The next day, the turnout fell to 39.41%, with 1,555 getting the shot out of a target of 3,946.In Gautam Budh Nagar, only 2,518 of the target of 5,750 (43.8%) took the shots on February 11 while 2,850 out of the target of 5,625 (51%) took the shots on February 12.“We will implement all directions issued by the ACS (home) in his communication. To further increase the vaccination coverage, we are taking steps to ensure availability of frontline workers on a particular date and time. We are also taking steps to increase awareness,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.February 11 and 12 were the first two days that the health department of Ghaziabad administered the Covaxin vaccine to beneficiaries in the district. In neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar, Covaxin was administered first on February 12.According to guidelines from the Uttar Pradesh government, the initial sessions, from January 16 to February 5, were devoted to healthcare workers who came in large numbers to get the shots, while the later sessions – on February 11 and 12 – were primarily devoted to frontline workers which include police personnel, home guards, jail staff and employees of Nagar Palikas, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/low-turnout-for-covid-vaccination-noida-ghaziabad-told-to-take-steps-101613326304760.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade barbs over Mangolpuri murder, demand ₹1 crore as compensation||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the law and order situation in Delhi and demanded that the Central government give ₹1 crore compensation to the family of Rinku Sharma, whose murder had triggered tension in the city’s Mangolpuri area last week.The BJP hit back accusing the AAP of engaging in “petty politics” on the issue and instead demanded that the Delhi government pay ₹1 crore compensation to Sharma’s family.Sharma, who worked as a lab technician at a private hospital, was stabbed while returning home from a birthday party on Wednesday night.The murder of the 25-year-old had taken communal colours on Friday, with some leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stating on social media that Sharma was collecting money for construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.While the AAP is in charge of the elected government in Delhi, law and order (which involves the charge of the Delhi Police) comes under the purview BJP-led Central government.“The family of victim Rinku Sharma alleged that the utterance of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ has resulted in Rinku Sharma’s murder. People belonging to all communities are unsafe in Delhi, such is the law and order situation. People of Delhi voted for the BJP in the Centre in a huge majority for the last two consecutive terms, but the BJP has miserably failed to protect them. Why has Union home minister Amit Shah not visited the family of Rinku Sharma yet and why didn’t he at least tweet about this matter?” said the AAP’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha.While the AAP won the last two Assembly elections in Delhi with thumping majorities, the BJP won all seven seats in both the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Chadha further said, “Is it right for the home minister of a country to go on an election campaign in West Bengal and not to be present in Delhi, when such an incident has taken place? When will the BJP-ruled Central government announce ₹1 crore compensation for the victim’s family? The Aam Aadmi Party stands with the family of Rinku Sharma and it will provide all financial assistance.”Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, however, hit back saying, “The Arvind Kejriwal is engaging in petty politics over the issue. Where is the award wapsi movement now and where are the people who organise candle light vigils? Why have they not organised a protest yet? Kejriwal is showing solidarity with the same bunch of people. Kejriwal stands with Tahir Hussain, Sharjil Imam and other accused of Delhi riots, but he cannot visit the family of Rinku Sharma. Why? Rinku Sharma’s family was manhandled when they went to meet the CM at his residence. Why? We demand the he should pay the family ₹1 crore as compensation immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-trade-barbs-over-mangolpuri-murder-demand-rs-1-crore-as-compensation-101613326065444.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||NDMC to re-invite bids for its e-scooter project||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will soon re-invite bids for its ambitious electric scooter project, which was earlier put on the back-burner after the concessionaire chosen the last time “did not come forward” to execute the project.Officials of the civic body said that the project was delayed mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once launched, the project aims at curbing air pollution by providing last-mile connectivity by renting out electric scooters to users in areas under its jurisdiction. It will work on NDMC’s already popular smart bike-sharing system.Dharmendra, chairman NDMC, confirmed that because of Covid-19 pandemic some projects, including the e-scooter one, had got delayed. “We had given the contract to someone, who didn’t come forward later to set up infrastructure for the same. So, we will be again bidding it out,” the NDMC chairman said.NDMC officials said that it will be the second time when fresh bids will be called.A senior NDMC official said that first bids of the project were called in early 2019 but those were rejected due to technical problems in drafting the proposals by the participant companies. The civic body later that year again floated tenders for the project and a concessionaire was appointed .“Before work could begin, the Covid pandemic struck the country and a lockdown was imposed. After that, the contractor did not show any interest in the project, citing loss in business. So, we are now going to re-invite bids very soon. Files have been sent to higher authorities for formal approval. We are looking to launch the project by the end of the year,” the official said.He added that it will take nearly six months, after allotment of a tender to the contractor, to set up the infrastructure and start operations.He further said that bidding parameters for the project will include per minute charge to hire scooters, efficiency, maximum speed and the model of the e-scooters.Another official, privy to the matter, said that as per previous bids, residents would be able to hire e-scooters for less than ₹10 for 15 minutes. He said that in the last bid, the per-minute charge was kept at 50 paisa, which would increase to 62 paisa after two hours. “The charges are likely to remain similar. However, it may change in the fresh bids. The prices will be fixed keeping in mind that the scheme remains affordable,” said the official.Under the plan, the civic body will procure 1,000 e-scooters on public-private partnership (PPP) model and will set up at 100 locations across the NDMC area. In the first phase, only 500 e-scooters will be procured and set up at 50 commuter-friendly locations — such as metro stations, bus stops, hospitals, railway stations, among others.He said that once launched, these e-scooters will help a lot in curbing pollution attracting customers who at the moment use private vehicles to travel for short distances.Users will be able to hire the vehicle through ‘NDMC-311’ mobile application. To book an e-scooter, users will have to register on the ‘NDMC-311’ app, which will help them locate a nearby e-scooter stands. Users can use the touchpad on the back of the e-scooters to unlock it through a one-time password (OTP) sent on their cellphone. The app will record the time when the scooter is unlocked and the user will be charged a fee accordingly.The e-scooters will have a range of 80 km to 100 km on full charge. One e-scooter can run with speed up to 55km per hour with maximum occupancy.Anuj Malhotra, knowledge partner to Union ministry of home affairs, and who has helped civic agencies on a number of urban mobility projects, said that the initiative will help in “pollution abatement” in the city. He, however, stressed upon developing “priority lanes” for e-vehicles and also improvement of integrated traffic management system for the success of such projects. “Introduction of e-scooters is a good effort towards reducing pollution in the city but we need a congenial atmosphere too for such projects to succeed. The authorities should now also work upon creating priority lanes, which is already being practiced in many foreign countries, for e-vehicles and pool cabs. Projects such as e-scooter or private e-vehicles will get more encouragement if we have separate lanes for such traffic,” Malhotra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ndmc-to-re-invite-bids-for-its-e-scooter-project-101613326064851.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt may soon start facilitating registration of e-autos||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Sunday kick-started the second drive of the Switch Delhi campaign by appealing to three-wheeler owners to switch to electric vehicles (EV).“The second week of the campaign will focus on outreach on the three-wheeler segment, which includes e-autos, e-rickshaws and e-carts, to accelerate their adoption… The Delhi government will soon start facilitating the registration of e-autos… Under Delhi’s EV policy, 177 three-wheeler models are available for purchase… By switching to electronic three-wheelers, a person can save around ₹29,000 per year on fuel… Scrapping incentives are also available for 68 models,” said Gahlot in a press statement.The Switch Delhi campaign was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this month to promote e-vehicles in Delhi. The campaign is in lines with the government’s long-term plans to reduce air pollution in Delhi.Under Delhi’s electric vehicle policy, 177 three-wheeler models are available and eligible for purchase and scrapping incentives.The Switch Delhi campaign is an eight-week electric vehicle mass awareness campaign to sensitise Delhiites about the benefits of switching to electric vehicles. The second week of the campaign focuses on the outreach for electric three-wheelers and aims to sensitise, inform, and encourage Delhiites to adopt electric three-wheelers in the national capital, said a Delhi government statement.Three-wheelers are one of the major contributors to vehicular emissions in Delhi and the policy lays special focus on incentivising the transition of this segment to electric.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-may-soon-start-facilitating-registration-of-eautos-101613326006001.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Govt asks Covid vaccination centres to send out reminders about second jab||The Delhi government has directed all Covid-19 vaccination centres to ensure setting up a system to remind beneficiaries about the second dose of vaccine, which according to the government can be taken from any of the 261 functional vaccination centres, irrespective of where the first dose had been taken from.“All Covid-19 vaccination centres have maintained records of beneficiaries who have taken the first shot in those centres. Nodal officers in these centres have been asked to ensure that they call up each and every one of them a day ahead of their second dose. There is a system in place which is supposed to send automated text messages. But we cannot take second chance,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.The official further said, “Also, beneficiaries can take the second dose in any centre, irrespective of where they had taken the first dose. Every centre has access to a master file concerning beneficiaries. They have to ensure that the file is properly updated and the data is appropriately fed into the government’s CoWin system.”Officials, however, made clear that beneficiaries can only receive the second dose of the same vaccine that they got in the first round.Around 1,82,000 health care and front line workers have got the first round of jabs so far.Only 1,856 beneficiaries, out of 4,319 who were scheduled for the second dose on Saturday, turned up at the centres, government records showed. On Monday, 3,598 beneficiaries are scheduled to take the second dose. For the first dose, the drive is currently open for both health workers and front line workers.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, said: “A 28-days window between two doses is followed for most immunisation vaccines globally. I will still recommend that beneficiaries should take the second dose within a maximum gap of six weeks. It is important to note that herd immunity will come only with two doses of vaccination. Also, we need to go ahead with the drive and open it up for other priority groups.”The Delhi government has plans to open the vaccination drive for people aged over 50 years and individuals with comorbidities by March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-asks-covid-vaccination-centres-to-send-out-reminders-about-second-jab-101613325947118.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||Ghazipur flower market to get a cold storage, roads and amenities||The Delhi government will hire an agency for the redevelopment of the flower wholesale market in Ghazipur, which includes setting up amenities such as water supply, drainage, roads, constructing a centrally air-conditioned building and a cold storage facility in another two years – a move that is likely to improve the supply of several varieties of flower in the Capital.The government has issued a tender for the project estimated to cost around ₹197.45 crore, for which the bids are open till March 5, said a senior government official and according to documents that HT has seen.“We are developing a modern flower market in Ghazipur. The facilities will be helpful for the traders, customers and hundreds of people who work in the market. The cold storage facility, in particular, will be immensely helpful in terms of scaling up supply, which will eventually increase the scale of flower trade in Delhi,” said Vijay Sisodia, chairperson of the agricultural produce market committee for flowers in Ghazipur.Read more: Waste-to-energy unit inaugurated at Ghazipur marketFlower markets in Mehrauli, Fatehpuri and Baba Kharak Singh Marg (Connaught Place) were merged with a flower market in Ghazipur in 2011, giving shape to the present-day wholesale market that is said to be the biggest in Delhi. There are 420-odd licensed flower traders who operate from the market, and together they record an average annual turnout of around ₹250 crore, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified, adding that the trade is seasonal and witnesses a sharp rise during festivities and marriage seasons.Flowers from across states – including Karnataka, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh – arrive in the market. It also records imports from countries that include New Zealand, the Netherlands, South Africa and Thailand. The most common import varieties are protea, banksia, hydrangea, amaryllis, waxflower, calla lily and varieties of tulips. The most common export destinations are the US, the UK, Germany and UAE, said traders.Read more: Disha Ravi shared Google 'toolkit' with Greta Thunberg, say Delhi PoliceGiven the perishable nature of the product, cold storage is mandatory for the business. Some of them – such as daisies and tulips – need it more than others, said traders. Currently, most traders have either set up small storages within their shops or they hire services of cold storage facilities scattered across the city and manage with ice slabs and cold water in their shops.“Because of inadequate cold storage facilities, traders often have to limit their stocks. This is one reason why wholesale traders in the city often run out of roses, tulips, daisies and gerberas when there is a spike in demand, especially if it is summer. A large centralised cold storage for the wholesale market would help addressing such shortages,” said Kisan Saini, a wholesale flower trader from Ghazipur.Neeraj Singh of Virender florist, a retailer in New Friends Colony, said: The shortage has a cascading effect, which starts at the wholesale level and affects stocks of neighbourhood retail florists. The supply often fails to meet the demand. A central storage in Ghazipur can bridge the gap”Read more: Delhi-NCR experienced 13 mild earthquakes in 2020: Govt dataThe tender document for the redevelopment project emphasises on a common cold storage facility that is supposed to be set up in the basement – measuring 26,440 square metre – of a yet-to-be constructed building. Other facilities for which the government is looking forward to hiring an agency include a parking area, better sheds for trade and ensuring other facilities that include proper power connections, water supply, toilets, drainage, internal roads, and a firefighting system, said the document.Anil Sharma, COO retail and franchise in Ferns N Petals, said: “A large cold storage facility in Delhi would increase the availability of several varieties of flowers throughout the year. For instance, tulips of Srinagar and varieties of orchids that come from the Northeastern states. Secondly, it would help bring uniformity in terms of prices, especially during the periods when demands witness a sharp spike. Third, traders will be more comfortable importing flowers and maintaining larger stocks”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghazipur-flower-market-to-get-a-cold-storage-roads-and-amenities-101613325945590.html
15-02-2021||Delhi||South Delhi parks, north Delhi schools to start yoga classes soon||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is likely to start appointing instructors from March-end for its project of starting yoga classes in parks managed by the civic body.The south civic body had in its budget presented before the standing committee last month proposed starting of yoga classes in its parks.The civic body will charge a nominal fee from participants for the classes, with officials saying that the move will help increase SDMC’s revenue.Narendra Chawla, the south corporation’s leader of the house, said that the civic body has started the process of finalising modalities of the project and appoint yoga instructors to educate people about the exercise.“The proposal has already been passed and now we are planning to implement it as soon as possible. We plan to start appointing yoga professionals at parks from the end of the next month (March) to teach people about right postures and asanas. We are in touch with some NGOs and organisations who deal in this sector to hire yoga professionals. We will hire instructors on a contractual basis,” Chawla said.He added that people often use SDMC parks to practice yoga, so it has been decided that the civic body will provide professional teachers, and in return charge a nominal fee from the participants. “We are yet to decide the fee but it will be nominal. Modalities of the project are being worked out. This move will help us in generating more revenue,” Chawla said.According to SDMC officials, the civic body manages around 6,400 small and big parks in its jurisdiction.On similar lines, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has also decided to introduce yoga classes for students at its schools. The north corporation authorities said that the move is aimed at improving fitness and immunity toits students.North civic body officials said that students will be taught about yoga and its asanas by schools teachers only. “Special yoga instructors will be engaged to impart yoga training to municipal teachers. We will hire qualified trainers on contract. This proposal has been approved by the north corporation in its final budget last week,” the official said.There are 714 primary schools which are run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. Nearly 9,000 teachers are employed across these schools by the civic body.Yogesh Verma, leader of the House in north corporation, said that the project is likely to start from March this year.“These yoga classes will be only for children studying at our primary schools. These will be conducted three days in a week. First period of the day at schools will be reserved for yoga classes where students are taught about importance of yoga and its asanas,” Verma said.He added that to train teachers,trainers will be hired. “We are in touch with a few NGOs and have asked them to conduct a few training sessions for our teachers so that they can teach students yoga in a better way. The training is likely to start in March and yoga classes at schools will start when schools reopen,” Verma said.KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MCD, said that both the initiative are good and aimed at public welfare. He said that introduction of yoga classes at schools will help in improving physical fitness of students.In reference to hiring professionals for yoga classes at SDMC park, Mehra said that the move will offer better service to the public. “But it (yoga at parks by professionals) should not be free because no one cares about anything which is offered free of cost. The civic body should take a nominal fee, hence helping it generate more revenue and also paying professionals with that money,” Mehra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-delhi-parks-north-delhi-schools-to-start-yoga-classes-soon-101613325885957.html
15-02-2021||Other||Coding courses for kids pick up amid pandemic, but experts raise red flags||For eight-year-old Aashna Sheth, the lockdown period turned out to be a time to learn new things online. Aashna, who studies at a south Mumbai school, learnt mandala art and also took up an online coding course for beginners. Over the past few months, she has created her own website and is also working on developing an app to address the problem of hunger in India.With children cooped in their homes owing to the pandemic and the resultant shift to online learning since March 2020, parents are insisting on children to learn coding.“We wanted to take up an activity, and coding seemed to be an interesting option because Aashna is really interested in computers,” said her mother, Namrata.Several experts are, however, worried about the negative repercussions that programmes offered by ed-tech companies could have on young minds. Over the past one year, several engineers and technology enthusiasts have been publicly flagging concerns about coding programmes that are currently being offered in the market.In mid-2020, Pradeep Poonia and Dr Aniruddha Malpani started noticing issues in the way companies that teach coding to students operate. They later began creating awareness among parents about what they said were false claims made by ed-tech companies to sell their coding programmes.“Indian parents might get swayed to get the first movers advantage, thinking that their kids will get an edge over other children, but that won’t happen. What these six year olds will learn in a year, a high school kid can learn in a couple of days. And coding won’t make anyone smarter,” said Poonia, an engineer.He added, “These companies are selling coding by telling it will make the children logical, but first one needs to be logical and then learn coding. When companies claim they can teach kids machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence), that’s a complete sham. Without subjects like calculus, probability etc. which are taught in Class 11 and Class 12, no one can actually understand the mathematical models behind the codes.”Poonia’s campaign on social media, which made a reference to advertisements released by WhiteHat Jr that promised big fat packages for students who learnt coding, became a hit. Soon enough, the company filed a Rs20 crore defamation suit against Poonia, and the case is still being heard in Delhi high court. It also sued Dr Malpani over the matter.Coding programmes in India cost between Rs6,000 and Rs5 lakh, depending on the difficulty level of the course and the number of sessions opted by the child.Several companies offer ‘free trial classes’ and ‘easy EMI (equated monthly instalments)’ options to lure parents into taking up the programmes. These programmes are offered to children between the ages of three and 15. In many cases, parents are promised that coding would make their children eligible for the top paying tech jobs in the Silicon Valley in the future.Dr Malpani, an angel investor who funds social impact start-ups, said ed-tech companies are fleecing parents by repackaging freely available content with tacky advertisements and false claims.“If a child is genuinely interested in trying out coding, they can use open source websites like code.org which are free to use and can teach them the concepts required at their own pace. In fact, the programmes offered by ed-tech companies are not even teaching real coding to the kids. They are just teaching them to move blocks in an assisted environment. Even if the child learns something, the content that the firms are teaching has already become obsolete,” added Malpani.Most ed-tech companies who are offering coding for students have seen a surge in the demand for its various programmes after the lockdown in March 2020. For instance, Toppr, an ed-tech platform has seen a 500% surge in the demand for coding programmes post lockdown. Super coders, a programme launched by Vedantu in April 2020, already has more than 1 lakh registered students. Of them, over 50,000 students have already taken coding classes through the portal. WhiteHat Jr, a company which runs four different levels of the programme – Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Professional – for students in Class 1-9, has over 1.5 lakh students across India, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia and conduct more than 40,000 classes every day.Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association who has written a book about coding for kids, said that while coding opens up a lot of possibilities for higher order thinking among children, a fair amount of caution in how it is taught is the key.“When you teach implementation before understanding then there is a problem with coding and that is the mistake by many companies that sell coding. Analog comes before digital, which means screen-less coding before teaching the coding language. Coding is a language with which we communicate with computers, and like in any language you teach the sounds, letters, speaking first before writing an essay. Similarly in coding, children should be taught the hands-on basics of sequencing, algorithms, debugging, conditionals etc. with games and activities before they can use these to programme,” she added.There is a concern among experts that the obsession for coding might put pressure on children into taking up yet another activity which is driven around fierce competition, and an expectation to excel. City-based psychiatrist Sagar Mundada said, “Kids can instead be taught to build social skills by taking up hobbies and pursuing group activities instead of remaining glued to the screen and taking up coding. Parents should not obsess about something just because everybody seems to be doing it. This would put an additional burden on the kids,” he added.Abhit Kalsotra, co-founder, GTROPY Systems, a location-based analytics company, has worked with some big tech companies such as Microsoft and Nokia in the past. He said, “If everyone is getting a job in Silicon Valley, why do we need entrance exams to get into top engineering colleges? Let’s talk about a hypothetical example: Google starts putting IoT (Internet of things) sensors in football to monitor the physics when any player touches and kicks the ball. Now will Google hire guys who have done such drag-and-drop coding or engineers who have passion for physics and can write codes well?”Karan Bajaj, founder and CEO of WhiteHat Jr, believes that any seismic shift in a field is met with some resistance.“Coding is a tool which allows a child to build and create things, empowers and makes them confident of their natural destiny as builders and creators. The outcome is not that significant as much as the process is. While there are several open platforms available to learn coding, we all know that there is a dramatic difference between a personalised training and self-learning as children need feedback, recognition, and encouragement during their early years which self-learning can be limited to offer.”While the movement against the coding market for children is still very active on social media, Ruchita Dar Shah, a parent who runs online parenting platform First Moms Club, said parents need to be extra cautious before jumping the coding bandwagon.“While there is no harm to enrol children who are genuinely interested in such courses, I am worried that off late it has become an obsession for parents, so much so that they expect returns from it, like expecting kids to develop websites or apps instead of just letting them learn for. For children who are especially younger, it makes no sense to force them into an activity which they are too young to understand or develop a liking,” she added.Poonia said even as the movement against these programmes is picking up, it needs to be amplified further across different parts of the country. Many like him worry that the lack of awareness about such programmes especially among rural and less wealthy parents might have disastrous consequences. “Parents save a lot of money for the education of their children and when companies mislead them, it is really disturbing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/coding-courses-for-kids-pick-up-amid-pandemic-but-experts-raise-red-flags-101613324446027.html
