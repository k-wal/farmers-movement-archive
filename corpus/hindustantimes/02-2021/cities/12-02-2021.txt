12-02-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination drive sees 50.25% turnout in Maharashtra||Despite the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state and city, the response to the vaccination drive has been dwindling in Maharashtra. After reporting a daily caseload of less than 3,000 for more than 20 days, the state has been breaching the mark for the past three days. On Friday, the state saw 3,670 cases, taking the tally to 2,056,575 and toll to 51,451, with 36 new deaths. Mumbai too reported more than 500 cases for the third day in a row, after staying below the mark for more than two weeks. With 599 new cases, the city’s tally touched 312,902 and toll 11,409 with 4 new deaths. The vaccination drive saw 50.25% turnout on Friday, as 40,000 citizens got inoculated at 796 vaccination centres that have the target of 100 beneficiaries each. With 23,012 vaccinations, frontline workers outnumbered health care workers (16,988) in daily vaccination on Friday. On Friday, the BMC vaccinated 6,361 beneficiaries in Mumbai that included 2,382 health care workers and 3,979 frontline workers. Overall, in the last one month the BMC has vaccinated 107,725 vaccine beneficiaries. As of February 9, the state has 1,054,822 healthcare and 691,222 frontline workers registered on CoWIN app. The total number of beneficiaries to receive the shots stands at 648,573, including 112,952 frontline workers. A total of 5,524 were given Covaxin, while remaining were given Covishield doses. The initial rate of the vaccination was over 60% after the launch on January 16 and dropped to below 50% over last few weeks even as the number of centres improved from 285 on the day of launch. Maharashtra has 19,72,400 shots of the Covaxin (1,70,400) and Covishield (18,02,000) vaccine provided by the Centre. “We have been vaccinating around 40,000 beneficiaries daily. We expect the response from the healthcare workers to improve and will have to gear up the drive. The turnout is high in districts where our department has strictly implemented it. We have been taken the vaccination drive very seriously and if the turnout remains the same, we will have to launch an awareness drive,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. According to the officials from Mantralaya, the state health department’s approach has been sluggish towards the drive. “Maharashtra is lagging behind other states. A few doctors who lead the department have themselves not taken the vaccine,” an officer who is closely associated with the drive said requesting anonymity. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is part of the task force constituted for the vaccination, said, “There is hesitancy among doctors and health care workers because of the fear about immunogenicity and tests of the vaccine. There should be a more aggressive programme for awareness among beneficiaries. The Centre should decentralise the drive by roping in private sector and bringing more transparency.” The state will start giving the second dose to the beneficiaries from Monday. The state is waiting for the Central guidelines to begin the round of second dose to healthcare worker who have completed the mandatory period of 28 days from the first shot. “We are beginning it from Monday. We expect the guidelines by then,” said Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer. The BMC on Friday said the second dosage of Covid-19 vaccination will start in Mumbai from Monday, instead of the earlier plan to start it from Saturday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are planning to complete the cycle of 28 days that will happen on Saturday. After this, the second dosage will be administered starting Monday.” The state has 31,474 active cases after 2,422 were discharged from hospitals. The recovery rate stands at 95.91%, while its case fatality rate stands at 2.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-sees-50-25-turnout-in-maharashtra-101613154269125.html

12-02-2021||Mumbai||New Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole vows to take party to the top||Maharashtra Congress on Friday accused the Central government of being anti-people and anti-farmer. The party passed a resolution, from the historic August Kranti Maidan, giving a call of ‘Modi Sarkar Chale Jao’ (Modi Government Go Away) and vowed to make Congress, a number one party in the state.Newly appointed state president of the party Nana Patole took charge from his predecessor and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Friday. Before the public rally, the resolution was passed in a meeting of key leaders at Gokuldas Tejpal Hall of the party.The resolution stated, “The [Narendra] Modi government is working in a dictatorial manner and is crushing the democratic, constitutional and parliamentary values. It has been working for a few industrialists instead of the common people of the country. Demonetisation, GST and lockdown were imposed without any preparations and hurt the economy, resulting in massive unemployment. The farmers of the country have been destroyed by passing the black legislations. The Modi government has exploited almost all the sections of the society in the last six years of its stint. The government has lost the moral right to continue in power and thus we are passing the resolution to give a call of ‘Modi Sarkar Chale Jao’.”Patole, after taking charge, said that the Modi government has started selling off public sector undertakings, but added that they will not allow touching any such entity in the state. “Prime Minister Modi has not kept his promises made before elected to the post. He had been talking about the common man, improving the value of Indian rupee and bringing down the price of the fuel. He has succeeded in nothing. I am taking charge to take away Narendra Modi’s charge as prime minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-maharashtra-congress-chief-nana-patole-vows-to-take-party-to-the-top-101613153488160.html

This plan is a part of a new project taken up at the zoo, which includes the construction of an underwater viewing facility for alligators and crocodiles. The zoo presently has an in-house veterinary clinic for small animals and birds.Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo said, “As part of the zoo expansion plan, we will bring in many exotic large animals, such as giraffe even. The hospital is being made in preparation for that. The underwater viewing gallery for ghariyal (reptiles) is going to be one of the major attractions. As per the design conceptualised now, there will be a steep slope that will take tourists to an underwater viewing area.”Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently floated tenders for this project. The cost of the project is ₹50 crore, and includes other construction works in the zoo premises, such as animal holdings for the reptiles, construction of water bodies with 10 lakh litre capacity, landscaping work, quarantine facility for aquatic, arboreal and territorial work, and other plumbing electric work.As part of phase 3 of the zoo expansion project, BMC will bring in animals such as giraffe, zebra, white lion, black jaguar, chimpanzees, oryx, emu, cassowary, ostrich, okapi, ringtail lemur, and cheetah.

It was not immediately known if the attackers were protesters, locals, or criminals. The injured policeman was admitted to a nearby hospital. A first information report (FIR) was being registered in connection with the incident, police said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (outer district) was not available for sharing details about the assault on the policeman despite repeated calls and a message being sent to him. Delhi Police have increased security at the three borders — Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur— since the violence on January 26 when protesting farmers clashed with security personnel, often fighting pitched battles. At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured during the Republic Day’s tractor rally violence, after what police claimed protesting farmers deviated from the pre-approved routes of the rally. The protesters clashed with the police they tried stopping farmers from entering parts of Central and New Delhi. Many protesters later that day had managed to storm into Red Fort and hoisted two flags — one religious and the other of the farmers’ union at the ASI protected structure. Police have arrested 143 persons for the violence that happened in different parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-personnel-posted-at-tikri-assaulted-by-unknown-men-101613153009211.html

12-02-2021||Mumbai||Amid realty sector slowdown, Cidco sells 19 plots in Navi Mumbai for ₹677 crore||Despite the realty slowdown, builders continue to buy land at high rates as was evident when the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) on Friday sold 19 plots for ₹677 crore.The Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI), an association of builders, has described the sales as “costly and impractical”.The costliest deal was a 5,858.85 square metre Sanpada plot which was sold for ₹153 crore.Priya Ratambe, public relations officer, Cidco, said it was the best deal for the corporation. “Despite the slowdown, our plots got a fabulous response and we fetched good prices,” said Ratambe.MCHI called the sales speculative deals which do not augur well for the realty sector. “There are a lot of projects coming up in Navi Mumbai, especially in New Panvel. Such exorbitant pricing tends to spoil the market conditions and sends the wrong signals regarding the realty market,” said Manohar Shroff, senior vice-president, MCHI (Navi Mumbai).Real estate research firm Liases Foras, while commenting on the sale of the plot for ₹153 crore, said that only an ultra-luxury project is possible on that land. “The builder can construct only ultra-luxury apartments costing more than ₹2 crore. He will find it difficult to sell them in the present conditions where the luxury market has taken a huge hit,” said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras.This is Cidco’s third auction in the last one month. Two weeks back, it was able to sell four plots worth ₹56 crore, and a month back, it garnered ₹56 crore from its auction of 12 row-house plots.The city of Navi Mumbai, created to decongest Mumbai, has excellent connectivity and infrastructure. For years, builders, supported by investors, have purchased land at exorbitant prices, resulting in a speculative realty market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-realty-sector-slowdown-cidco-sells-19-plots-in-navi-mumbai-for-677-crore-101613152770582.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Schools focused on learning story||New Delhi: With less than three months to go for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) board examination for students of classes 10 and 12, teachers and principals of Delhi government schools are concerned about low-scoring children who were promoted from classes 9 and 11 as per a revised assessment policy involving scores based on assignment and grace marks. The move led to a significant increase in pass percentages for students of classes 9 and 11. In May last year, HT had reported that the pass percentage in class 9 had gone up from 58.6% in the previous academic session to 64.5%. For class 11, this number went from 84.8% to 96.2%. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said most schools, including his, are engaging in targeted intervention for these students. “Children who were promoted on the basis of revised promotion policy are mostly the same ones who weren’t able to attend online classes during the pandemic and don’t attend offline classes even now. They are the ones that need focused attention.” Last year following the Covid-19 lockdown, the Delhi government had devised a one-time revised promotion policy for students of class 9 and 11 where students were promoted using grace marks and assignments. Students who could not appear for their exams either due to the pandemic or the Delhi riots were given marks proportional to their mid-term results as well. A senior education department official, who asked not be named, said, “These students are on the radar of our teachers and targeted interventions are being made for their learning. Schools have made a list of these students and are monitoring their performance and attendance regularly. Apart from sufficient writing practice and regular tests, teachers are focusing on chapters or lessons which will help the students score easily. In addition to this, teachers have ‘adopted’ such students and will be looking after the performance of that particular student under them along with their mental well-being.” In addition to these, schools and teachers have devised their own methods to address the learning gaps. For instance, Jha said he had divided students into two groups on the basis of how they were promoted — via grace marks or assignment. “This helped teachers focus their attention to a homogenous group. We are now planning to print three sets of sample papers prepared by the education department for a particular subject, write the answers on those papers, and distribute among these students. Internal tests on these papers will ensure that students are able to retain the information and perform well in their board exams,” he said. Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, said the school had also taken help from the local community. “We have a lot of Afghan students who face language issues, or visually-impaired children who need assistance. Since we have been involved with the local community for the past few years, we roped in homemakers, volunteers, or members of resident welfare associations or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who could help us in the matter,” he said. Several principals said that many among these students were not attending school even now — making it even more difficult for teachers. Mudassir Jahan, head of school at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya at Noor Nagar, said, “The attendance for these students is also low and we are trying to get them to school. We have made announcements through local mosques, asking students to attend for classes. The challenge here is that these students have to be motivated more than others to even attend school. Even in class 9 or previous classes, they reported a low attendance record affecting their academic performance.” CBSE schools reopening On Thursday, CBSE said it would be “appropriate” to start the 2021-22 academic session from April 1 as per the feasibility of state governments. A senior education department official had said that it would not be feasible as mid-term exams in Delhi government schools are slated to continue till mid-April. Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said, “In addition to mid-terms which will continue till mid-April, schools have to follow social distancing for students of class 9 to 12. Classes have been split into multiple batches and all our rooms are being used for these purposes. Calling other classes from April 1 won’t be feasible. What we can do is complete the admission process by then and start schools in July once board exams are also completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-focused-on-learning-story-101613152648605.html

Yatnal, however, remained unapologetic for his statements and denied making any remarks that is “shocking”. “I have made no statement or practice politics for which I have to apologize or regret. I haven’t made any statements against the party or national leaders. I shall respond to the notice after I have seen the content,” he said.The show cause notice comes after weeks of attacks against Yediyurappa. The BJP legislator had made several statements indicative of a change in leadership in the state, much to the annoyance of the chief minister. But the eerie silence by the party’s central leadership on the comments had raised doubts if the saffron party would take any action against Yatnal. At the same time, there were doubts if the high command had indeed isolated Yeddiurappa. “Our Prime Minister’s dreams are of development, end of dynasty politics and a corruption-free government. I will request our national president that only one person from a household should be given the power. It cannot be that there is an MP, MLC, MLA, board heads and even people in-charge of party affairs from only one family,” a disgruntled Yatnal had said on January 21, after he missed securing a place in the cabinet expansion exercise. He has also, on multiple occasions, said that the 77-year-old chief minister would be replaced. Yatnal is also an active participant in the ongoing Panchamasali Lingayat padayatra or march by one of the most dominant and politically influential communities. The Panchamasali, the largest sect within the dominant Lingayat community, have demanded that their existing reservation category be changed from 3B to 2A. Despite assurances from Yediyurappa to review and study the socio-economic conditions of the community, the participants of the campaign continue with their 465-km march from Kudalasangama towards Bengaluru where a rally has been scheduled for February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-issues-show-cause-notice-to-legislator-for-remarks-on-cm-101613152647310.html
12-02-2021||Noida||Noida: Several front-line workers refuse to take Covaxin jab||NOIDA: A sub-inspector of the Gautam Budh Nagar police was waiting for his turn to get Covid-19 vaccine at the Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPGTI) in Sector 30. However, the moment he came to know that he would be administered Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, he refused to take the jab. “It’s a complete discrimination. There must be a uniformity in vaccination. If my colleagues have got Covishield vaccine, why’ll I get another vaccine? Unlike the beneficiaries of other sessions, we are being asked to fill a form. Even my family doctor has advised me against taking the vaccine,” he said. A CRPF jawan at a private hospital in the city created the similar scene. “I had been waiting for my turn since morning. But, when I came to know that I would be administered other brand of vaccine, I chose not to take the shot,” he said. HT has withheld names of the two persons who refused to take the shots.After administering the Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield vaccine in six sessions of phase 1 and first two sessions of phase 2 of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the GB Nagar health department on Friday began giving Covaxin shots to the front-line workers for the first time in the district. But the beneficiaries appeared more confused about the efficacy of Covaxin. According to official data, only 2,850 out of 5,625 front-line workers listed for the day took the shots, with a turnout of around 51%. The GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, agreed that many front-line workers are doubtful about the accuracy of Covaxin. “We are trying to convince them about the efficacy and accuracy of the vaccine. But, so far it has not yielded very encouraging results,” he said.District vaccination officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that inoculation took place at 45 booths in the district on Friday. “We administered Covaxin for the first time to 2,080 out of 4,375 enlisted for it (47.54%) at 34 booths and 770 Covishield to 1,250 registered for it (61.6%) at 11 booths. We’ve given certificates of inoculation to the beneficiaries, who have been administered Covaxin today,” he said. Tyagi further said that with one session left in phase 2 of vaccination, the district health department has to inoculate the remaining 12,349 front-line workers (out of 18,717 registered beneficiaries) in that session. “We’ll try to accommodate the remaining beneficiaries in that session. And the left out front-line workers will be inoculated during the mop up round on February 22,” he said. On the other hand, Ohri said that the low turnout has become a matter of concern for the district health department. “We’ll try to increase it to an optimum level in the coming sessions. However, during Friday’s inoculation, no adverse event following immunization (AEFI) was reported,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-several-front-line-workers-refuse-to-take-covaxin-jab-101613152407762.html

It seems the government is hell-bent to finish the road transport sector and the 20 crore people associated with this trade. The rising diesel price is exerting acute pressure on small road transport operators as they are unable to run their business. The distress in the road transport sector is similar to the farm sector… the slogan of ‘aatmnirbhar’ is transforming to ‘aatmhatya’,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress.

12-02-2021||Noida||Police escort Tikait’s car for ‘security’ near UP Gate||Ghaziabad: Farmer leaders at the UP Gate protest site said that on Friday morning an ‘anti-romeo squad’ vehicle of the Ghaziabad police was allegedly seen accompanying the SUV in which Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait was travelling, to attend a farmers’ rally at Bahadurgarh in Haryana. The police, however, did a flip flop as they first confirmed it but then later denied this ever happened. The BKU leader has been attending farmers’ meetings and panchayats in different areas of the national Capital region and frequently comes to and leaves the UP Gate protest site, where he has been camping with farmers since November 28, 2020.In the afternoon, senior officers of the Ghaziabad police said that they had indeed provided a conditional police escort vehicle to Tikait in view of “security” and “traffic issues”.“There is only one vehicle which is deployed in view of traffic issues, and safety and security concerns, if any. One sub-inspector has also been deputed with him ever since he received a threat over the phone. The vehicle has not been deputed permanently but only to guide him to the Ghaziabad border when he moves out. It will also guide him once he returns,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).Tikait in December last year had allegedly received a threat call from an unidentified person, following which BKU leaders had submitted a police complaint at the Kaushambi police station.The Ghaziabad police said that they had registered an FIR under Section 507 (criminal intimidation by anonymous communication) of the Indian Penal Code against an unidentified person who allegedly issued threats to Tikait.However, when approached for response on the said provision of the police vehicle, Ghaziabad’s senior superintendent of police Kalanidhi Naithani said that “no escort vehicle was provided,” without elaborating further.Dharmendra Malik, the media in-charge of the BKU, however, confirmed that “the police vehicle was there on Friday morning when Tikait ji was going to attend the rally.” Digambar Singh, state vice-president of the BKU’s youth wing, on January 28 had given another complaint to the Kaushambi police naming two MLAs from Ghaziabad, alleging that they, along with a group of people, had allegedly attacked farmers and damaged their tents.The two MLAs had rubbished the allegations as false, saying that they were not present anywhere near the UP Gate protest site. Tikait and other farmer leaders have been booked in various FIRs filed by the Delhi Police following incidents of violence that took place amid the tractor rally call given by the farmers in Delhi on Republic Day.The farmers have been protesting at the various borders of Delhi demanding repeal of the three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. Several rounds of talks, including the last discussion on January 22, have failed to break the deadlock between the farmers and government. Tikait on Friday reiterated the demand of the farmers at the rally held in Bahadurgarh.“We will return home only when the three new farm laws are taken back. No one should misunderstand us. Our leaders (of the core-committee at Singhu border) think the same and feel that the government should talk to us. There is a saying in villages that if a child goes missing in fairs at Tigri and Garh, they will be found next year at the same fair,” Tikait said, referring to the deadline of October 2 till which, the farmers said, they will be stationed at the protest site.“People say that I have given a deadline of October 2 for the agitation. I just said this on the basis of an old saying by our elders,” he added. Tikait on Friday also said that more mahapanchayats will be held in the coming days, adding that they will go to Gujarat as well.He alleged that farmers from Gujarat were being “pressured” not to lend support to the agitation.“We will hold meetings in Gujarat and other states,” he said.He also said “business on hunger” will not be allowed and those wanting it will be “driven out” of the country.Hitting out at the three new farm laws, he claimed these will lead to the dismantling of the MSP and exploitation of farmers, from whom big companies will procure their produce at cheaper rates and then store it in godowns.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha at the Singhu Border, in a press statement on Thursday, had clarified that the agitation will go on till the demands of the farmers are met.

Five inmates of Nagpur Central Prison, including Gawli, tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. The Mumbai underworld don was later shifted to the government hospital after his condition deteriorated. Jail superintendent Anup Kumre said that Gawli and the four other infected inmates were treated by the prison doctors initially. However, Gawli was shifted to the trauma centre of the government hospital when his condition worsened. After undergoing numerous tests, he was shifted back to the central prison on Friday, informed Dr Sajal Mitra, dean of the medical college and hospital. Known as “Daddy” among his supporters, Gawli, 66, was active in the Mumbai underworld since the 1970s and engaged in a bloody gang war with the absconding mafia don Dawood Ibrahim till the 1990s. Gawli was convicted in 2012 for the murder of Shiv Sena leader and corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar, and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is currently serving at Nagpur Central Prison. In 1997, Gawli floated a political party, Akhil Bharatiya Sena, and was elected member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly in 2004.

12-02-2021||Other||Noida sectors to get Ganga water by November||NOIDA: Work on the Ganga water supply project for several sectors in Noida has received a new deadline of November 2021, officials of Noida authority said on Friday. The project was supposed to be complete by November last year.As of now, residents of sectors 112, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 128, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137, 143, 144, 145B, 146, 147, 151 and 168, among some other areas, are provided ground water, which is saline and does not taste good.The Noida authority currently procures 240 million litre daily (MLD) Ganga water to most of the sectors in the city. It also procures some groundwater when the Upper Ganga canal, that supplies the water to Noida, is cleaned, which happens in the month of November every year, said the officials. Work on the project, to supply Ganga water to households in the above mentioned sectors, was started in March 2018. However, work to lay the pipeline was delayed due to Metro construction work in Sector 62 and other areas, said officials.“We have completed 67% of the work on this project and have put works on fast track, so that the project can be completed by November-end this year and residents can be supplied Ganga water,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority.When the pipeline comes into operation, Noida will get an additional 90 MLD of Ganga water thus reducing dependence on ground water.Officials said that Noida’s population is expected to increase to about 2.5 million in a couple of years,and the water capacity of the city needs to be expanded in anticipation of the growing demand. At present, the city has a total of 165 sectors with an estimated population of around two million.“With this project, we want to increase Ganga water availability from the existing 240 MLD to 330 MLD in order to meet the water demands that will come from the upcoming residential areas along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway as well as other parts of the city,” Tyagi said.The UttarPradesh Jal Nigam requires an estimated ₹200 crore to finish this project. “We are providing 56% Ganga water and 44% groundwater to Noida. In the future too, this ratio of 56:44 will continue,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-sectors-to-get-ganga-water-by-november-101613151867831.html

In January last year, the authority banned plot sale, lease permission, registry of plots and refused to give occupancy certificates if developers had not fulfilled this condition.“We formed a separate company on Fridaywith 10 developers as stakeholders to develop a golf course, cricket ground and other sports facilities in the sector,” said Subodh Goyal, promoter of Civitech and leader of the consortium. “We are preparing estimates on how much funds are required to develop the required facilities,” Goyal said. However, he refused to reveal the other companies in the consortium. Together, they have about 150 acres, allotted in 2016, in the sector and were scheduled to develop 5,000 apartments, authority officials said.“We will issue certificates, allow plot sale and facilitate flat registry if the developers build facilities, pay dues and fulfil other terms. Without these conditions, we cannot allow these permissions,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-builders-form-group-to-develop-sports-facilities-101613151867259.html
12-02-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad records lowest turnout for Covid-19 vaccination||Ghaziabad: The turnout for Covid-19 vaccination in Ghaziabad went down further on Friday with the district recording only 39.41% coverage when it was the turn of front-line workers to take shots. Friday’s turnout is the lowest so far among all the vaccination sessions that started on January 16 in Ghaziabad, officials of the district health department said. Also, the officials said that Covaxin was administered to front-line workers on Thursday and Friday and resulted in no adverse event following immunization (AEFI). On Friday, as many as 1,555 people got the shots out of the day’s target of 3,946. On Thursday, the coverage had stood at 45.33% with 1,559 front-line workers getting the shots out of a target of 3,439. “The turnout remained at an all-time low on Friday as many front-line workers of different departments did not come up at the centres. We have time and again told their department heads to spread awareness and expedite the vaccination process, but the things have remained slow,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical office, Ghaziabad. He said that it was the first time that Covaxin was administered to beneficiaries on Thursday and Friday. “On both the days of administration of Covaxin, there were no AEFI events reported in the district. Prior to this, we administered Covishield which resulted in minor AEFI events in some cases during earlier days of vaccination. However, our experience with both the vaccines has been very encouraging and no beneficiary suffered any health complication,” Gupta added. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls for his comments over the issue of declining vaccination coverage in the district. This was the eighth day of the vaccination drive that began on January 16. On the first day, 94.75% (379 of 400) beneficiaries received their shots. On January 22, the turnout dropped to 81.28% (3,251 of 4,000), on January 28 it was 71.91% (4,095 of 5,695), January 29 had 72.69% (4,190 of 5,764), February 4 had 70.05% (3,557 of 5,078), and on February 5 the figure was 63.74% (3,129 of 4,909). “Vaccination is the need of hour and there has to be more awareness among people to take it up. The present time is also suitable as the Covid cases in the state as well as in the district are at their lowest level. So, vaccination coverage needs to be increased further,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.District’s overall coverage at the end of sessions on Friday stood at 65.35% with a total of 21,715 people vaccinated out of a target of 33,231 beneficiaries so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-records-lowest-turnout-for-covid-19-vaccination-101613151807219.html
12-02-2021||Noida||One of three arrested for murdering man in Vaishali apartment||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad police late Thursday arrested a 55-year-old man who was allegedly part of the group that had murdered a 25-year-old man in a flat in Vaishali’s Sector 4. The police said that based on the statements of the suspect, the conspiracy of murder was allegedly planned by a 32-year-old woman. Upon receiving information, the police on February 10 had reached the apartment in Vaishali and recovered the body of a man identified as Nitin Chaudhary, a resident of Tila Morh in Sahibabad. The police said he had left his house on February 6, telling his family that he would be out for a couple of days. However, he did not return while his mobile phone remained switched off. “Based on information collected and electronic surveillance, we arrested a 55-year-old Vinod Kumar, a resident of Shahdara in Delhi. He said that the victim had a relationship with the woman for past several years and was blackmailing her. He was also pressurising her for marriage,” Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said adding that the identity of the woman will be revealed later. The police added that the woman, a resident of Shalimar Garden in Ghaziabad, allegedly planned the murder along with Vinod and Kulwinder Singh, whom she had intended to marry. Kulwinder is a resident of Yamuna Vihar in Delhi. Both Kulwinder and the woman have been on the run since the murder, said police. “The woman called up the deceased to the apartment, which was vacant and belongs to a friend of Vinod. There, the three suspects bludgeoned the victim with iron rods and sticks, and rolled his body in bedsheet and curtain before fleeing,” the SP added.Police said that on February 10, Vinod allegedly called up the police saying that there was some foul smell emanating from the flat. However, police became suspicious as officers found that Vinod was in Delhi and could not have detected any smell next to his flat in Ghaziabad. The police said that teams are searching for the woman and Kulwinder, and that more information will be revealed once they get arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/one-of-three-arrested-for-murdering-man-in-vaishali-apartment-101613151687298.html
12-02-2021||Noida||Dense fog likely, air quality gets worse||Noida: The city and its adjoining areas are likely to witness dense fog and haze for the next two days due to low wind speed, leading to rise in the air pollution levels, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.On Friday, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were the top three polluted cities of country -- a second in the past four days -- with the pollution monitoring agencies seeing no respite for the next three days.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad on Friday was 375 (‘very poor’) -- worst in the country just like on February 9 and 10 -- against 356 on Thursday. Similarly, Noida’s AQI was 363 -- second most polluted city in country -- against 311 a day earlier, followed by Greater Noida with an AQI value of 352 against 344 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to weather analysts, the wind speed on Friday dropped as the region fell into a low pressure area and is likely to continue to be so till Sunday.“The region will see dense fog on Saturday, bringing down the visibility to around 100 metres,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.The experts said that temperatures are around season’s average only but the wind speed are very low. “Due to low wind speed during the morning hours, the condensation of moisture would continue. Also, since the low speed of winds leads to accumulation of particles, the haze formatting will be there. This could bring the visibility down to less than 100 metres from early morning hours to about 9am,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Meanwhile, the minimum and maximum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 12.6 degrees and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), not much change in the pollution situation is expected over the next few days. “Surface winds are low and wind speed is likely to marginally improve during day time. The ventilation is likely to stay in the same range and no significant change in AQI is expecting for the next couple of days. AQI is likely to stay in the very poor category for the next two days. AQI likely to marginally improve to lower end of very poor to poor category is forecasted for February 15,” said a SAFAR statement on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dense-fog-likely-air-quality-gets-worse-101613151627299.html

They hoped the app will be available soon.“We had a wonderful learning session. We learnt about using the iPad on Friday. We may, however, have to come for more training sessions on Saturday and Sunday to learn more. The budget app was not available on Friday. We have been told about the use of the app that is likely to be available on Saturday,” said Puran Prakash, MLA from Mathura.“We had a good learning experience. We will come again for more sessions in the next two days.

12-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor not allowed on state aircraft; state to seek report||The state general administration department will seek a report from Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s secretary Santosh Kumar over Thursday’s incident, when Koshyari was not allowed to fly to Uttarakhand in the state’s aircraft, chief secretary Sanjay Kumar told Hindustan Times on Friday. According to Raj Bhavan, Koshyari had to face an embarrassment on Thursday as he went to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) and boarded the state’s six-seater Cessna Citation XLS aircraft to travel to Dehradun, but had to deplane and take a commercial flight, as the chief minister’s office (CMO) had not approved the use. After the incident, the CMO on Thursday blamed the Raj Bhavan secretariat, saying the latter should have ensured they had the permission to use the aircraft before the governor’s departure from his official residence. Indicating action against the officials for not informing the governor about permission updates, the CMO also said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had already directed the administration to fix the responsibility for the negligence on the officials concerned. Sanjay Kumar said on Friday: “A report will be sought from the governor’s secretary (Santosh Kumar) over the incident. The state aviation department secretary will be directed to seek the report and further decisions will be taken by the state government.” On Friday, Thackeray avoided reacting to the controversy and remarked the government would be developing an air strip at Palghar, so everyone’s aircraft can land there. He was responding to a question over the incident. Thackeray also chose to use a helipad at Mahalaxmi racecourse instead of the one at Raj Bhavan (Governor’s house at Malabar Hill) following the aircraft controversy, the officials said. The incident, however, is likely to worsen the already strained relations between the Thackeray government and Koshyari. According to senior government officials, Koshyari and Thackeray are not on talking terms beyond customary exchanges for the past many months. Recently, they met at the state’s Republic Day function at Shivaji Park, Dadar, but there was hardly any interaction, the officials said. “He [Uddhav Thackeray] should understand we also have some political compulsions. The governor told this to Rashmi, Thackeray’s wife during a brief interaction,” said a senior bureaucrat, requesting anonymity. Koshyari was referring to the appointment of 12 members of the legislative council under his quota. The state cabinet had made the recommendation to Koshyari to nominate them to the Upper House as per the norms on November 6, last year. However, he is yet to take the decision, which has upset the chief minister and MVA leaders. The chief minister has not visited Raj Bhavan, official residence-cum-office of the governor, for nine months. Last time, he called on Koshyari after being elected as the member of the legislative council on May 18. His wife and son and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray were also present. Before that, Thackeray called on the governor at Raj Bhavan on May 1. The meeting lasted for about 20 minutes. It was held a day after Koshyari wrote to the Election commission of India (ECI), requesting it to hold biennial elections to the nine vacant seats of the council at the earliest to facilitate Thackeray’s election to the Upper House of the state legislature. The biennial elections for the nine vacant seats were postponed in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Later, Thackeray also skipped a meeting called by the governor to review the Covid-19 pandemic on May 21, the officials said. Meanwhile, Koshyari attended the 122th IAS induction programme at the Lal Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, on Friday. He also met Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and discussed the ongoing rescue operation following the glacier disaster. The governor was expected to return in the state government’s aircraft, but now he will be returning to Mumbai in a commercial flight on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-not-allowed-on-state-aircraft-state-to-seek-report-101613149887751.html

Later, NCP leader Sharad Pawar suggested an alternate land for the airport at the same taluka.Defence minister Rajnath Singh chaired a meeting on the issue and instructed authorities to submit a report for the new location.Pawar said, “As suggested by Rajnath Singh, district collector, airport authority and defence authorities jointly submitted a report to the central government. The proposed land is near the existing site. The new site is in the same locality and falls under Purandar. The site also has less land acquisition cases.”Congress MLA Sanjay Jagtap said, “It will be too early to declare the location of the new site. If the new location is approved, the government would need to acquire less land for the airport as maximum land is owned by the government. We carried out an in-depth study before suggesting the new site as the farmers from the previous site were not ready to hand over their land for the airport project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/report-of-new-site-for-purandar-airport-submitted-101613148207004.html

Pawar was in the city to review district plans before presenting the Maharashtra’s budget at the state assembly on March 8. Pawar said, “The Centre is giving vaccination to doctors and frontline workers. The Union health minister had announced that vaccination will cover all citizens, before stating that only health and frontline workers will get free vaccination. Instead of creating confusion about free vaccination, the Centre should take responsibility and bear the cost of inoculating all citizens instead of putting financial burden on state governments.” According to the deputy minister, the central government is yet to release the GST (goods and services tax) share of Maharashtra. As per the parliament act, all state governments should be given the GST share immediately. “We are hoping that our GST shared will be released early as we need money to carry our various developmental works,” he said. Fire at Serum institute Pawar, who is also the Pune district guardian minister, said that he has received the report from fire department and police on the fire at Serum Institute of India’s Manjari premises on January 21. “Electric short circuit was the sole reason behind the fire,” he said. No relation appointment of MLCs and guv’s air travel The Maha Vikas Aghadi government did not have any intention to insult the governor while denying use of government-owned aircraft, said Pawar. “The Chief Minister’s office had given clarification about it. I don’t know the exact reason why the governor did not get permission for using the official aircraft. It’s a machine, some technical problem must have occurred. There is no connection between the appointment of 12 governor-appointed MLCs and governor’s travel issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-should-bear-cost-of-vaccinating-citizens-pawar-101613147486911.html
12-02-2021||Pune||We will wrest power from BJP in PMC: Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Challenging former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s claim, Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said on Friday that Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will see the exit of Bharatiya Janata Party in the upcoming civic body polls. “I would snatch power from BJP in Pune Municipal Corporation,” said Pawar while interacting with the media. Fadnavis has visited the Pune Municipal Corporation headquarters on Thursday and reviewed various projects. While interacting with the media, Fadnavis had claimed that the BJP is performing better in Pune and would retain power in the coming municipal election. The BJP leader said that the party will do not enter into an alliance, especially the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, in the coming civic polls. Pawar said, “Every ruling party claim to retain power in the forthcoming polls, but I would ensure the BJP’s exit in Pune. Many rebels from various parties joined the BJP during the previous years. Now some of them wish to join the NCP. We would accept workers from other parties on merit basis only and show them before the media at the right time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/we-will-wrest-power-from-bjp-in-pmc-ajit-pawar-101613146226939.html

12-02-2021||City||After Kotia, Andhra officials try to conduct panchayat polls in another district||On a day the Supreme Court deferred the hearing in the matter of Andhra Pradesh conducting panchayat polls in three bordering villages of Odisha, a team of officials of Andhra Pradesh had to make a hasty retreat in Gajapati district where they had come to conduct panchayat polls.On Friday, the top court asked Andhra Pradesh government to file a response after Odisha government moved a contempt of court petition, seeking action against the neighbouring state over its violation of the apex court's order in 1968 and 2006. The Odisha government, in its petition, informed the court that the three villages where elections are to be held this Saturday fall within Odisha and form part of 21 villages in respect of which a suit was filed in 1968 by Odisha before the Supreme Court. It alleged that the recent action taken by Andhra Pradesh was in violation of the status quo granted on December 2, 1968.While the hearing in the Kotia case is scheduled on February 19, a team of BJP officials, who had gone to Manikpatna village under Gangabada Grampanchayat in Gajapati district, found some Andhra officials, including an SP and Sub-Collector, discussing the modalities of conducting the gram panchayat polls. The officials fled the spot on Friday without being able to answer questions posed by Odisha BJP leaders touring the villages of Odisha-AP border in Koraput and Gajapati.Also read: India sends 22.9 mn doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 20 countries, more in pipelineThe BJP team led by Leader of Opposition Pradipta Naik said the team confronted the Andhra Pradesh officials about the intention of their visit. "The officials of Andhra Pradesh were trying to persuade the villagers to vote in the panchayat polls. When we asked the officials to show their documents to prove Andhra Pradesh's claim on Manikpatna, they left the place," said Naik.While Andhra Pradesh is staking its claim on three villages of Kotia gram panchayat of Koraput district, it is eyeing six other villages under the Gangabada gram panchayat of Gajapati district including Manikpatna. "The Andhra Pradesh officials have managed to persuade people of four villages to take part in panchayat polls. Even though Andhra Pradesh has been sending its officials to mislead our people, Odisha government has turned a mute spectator to this. The continuous negligence by the State government has led to such a situation. People do not even have the basic amenities here," said Bhrugu Buxipatra, BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-kotia-andhra-officials-try-to-conduct-panchayat-polls-in-another-district-101613145037671.html
12-02-2021||Kolkata||BJP MLA who met CM Banerjee accuses MP of pressuring Shah on CAA||Biswajit Das, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator who met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her chamber at the state assembly on February 8, stoking speculations on his return to his old party, on Friday accused BJP Lok Sabha MP Shantanu Thakur of misleading the Dalit Matua community, which the latter belongs to, about the new citizenship law.Das also accused Thakur of "blackmailing the BJP" on the citizenship issue.The MLA made the statements at a press conference, a day after Union home minister Amit Shah announced during his visit to North 24 Parganas district’s Thakurnagar, the headquarters of the Matua community, that the Centre will enforce the citizenship law once Covid-19 vaccination across the country is over and the pandemic ends.The Centre is in the process of framing laws for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act which the Parliament passed last year. It offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. CM Banerjee figures among the law’s staunch critics who insist that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out Muslims and links citizenship to faith in a secular country.“Shantanu Thakur is misleading the Matua community and pressuring the BJP leadership to enforce the new law as early as possible. Why this rush? The Matuas are simple people. This is unfair. Thakur is mobilising them for his political goal. He is blackmailing the party,” Das, who represents the Bongaon North assembly constituency in North 24 Parganas, said.Also read: ‘Very important business’ - BJP issues 3-line whip to Lok Sabha membersThakur is the Bongaon Lok Sabha MP and one of the heads of the Matua Mahasangha.“His statement clearly shows who is blackmailing whom. I did not introduce the CAA. It was done by the Union home minister and his ministry. Das has insulted Shah as well with such remarks. He possibly wants to return to the TMC. It was the Matua Mahasangha that decided who would address Thursday’s rally. If I tried to stop him from attending the event how could he appear on the dais?” Thakur told the media.The BJP wrested the Bongaon Lok Sabha seat in 2019 by fielding Thakur against his aunt and then sitting TMC MP Mamata Bala Thakur. There has been a split in Matua votes since then. Although the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, Hindu backward class voters are now crucial for the saffron camp. The Matuas are a part of the three million strong Hindu Namasudra (Dalit) community that can influence poll results in around 80 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. The BJP aims to win at least 200.The Matuas, who support Thakur, have demanded immediate implementation of the citizenship law since these people came to West Bengal as refugees from East Pakistan in 1947 and after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to escape religious persecution.There is resentment among a section of Bengal BJP leaders over the manner in which the rally Shah addressed was organised by the Matua community. There was no BJP flag at the venue and many BJP leaders, including Das, were not given the opportunity to address the crowd. Only the triangular yellow flags of the community were seen at the event.Seeking support of the Matuas in the coming polls, Shah also announced sops which he said would be delivered if the BJP comes to power in Bengal.“Some people are disgruntled because they were not allowed to speak and there were no BJP flags at the event. But one has to understand that it was organised by the Matuas and not our party. They invited Shah and some leaders. Das is not leaving the BJP. People are leaving the TMC and not joining it,” said BJP Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh while making an effort to play down the wrangling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-mla-who-met-cm-banerjee-accuses-mp-of-pressuring-shah-on-caa-101613144028338.html

On Friday, they resumed drilling and till evening had drilled till 11.50 metres deep.""The drilling operation had to be stopped at 11.50 metres because of slush coming out.

12-02-2021||Pune||Vadgaon Maval court JMFC under ACB scanner in bribery case||Pune: A judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) attached to Vadgaon Maval court is under the radar of anti-corruption bureau (ACB) sleuths in connection with the arrest of an impostor woman who had accepted a bribe of ₹2.5 lakh stating that the decision will be done in favour of the complainant by “managing” the court that is handling the criminal case.The JMFC, who was in touch with the accused identified as Shubhavari Bhalchandra Gaikwad (29), a resident of Talegaon, has applied for anticipatory bail from the Pune district and sessions court. A first information report (FIR) was lodged at Dehu road police station under Sections 7 and 12 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 on January 14, according to the police.While hearing the anticipatory bail application of the JMFC, the district court in its order dated February 2 stated: “Read application. Heard learned advocate for the applicant. Perused FIR and the documents filed along with main application. Applicant is a judicial officer. From the documents, what appears is that she was in contact with main accused, namely, Shubhavari Gaikwad, who has been arrested in a trap laid by the anti­corruption bureau. On going through the statement of the applicant annexed to the application, there appears frequency of phone calls between herself and the main accused. The allegations are of very serious nature. Considering nature of allegations and considering the overall facts of the case, no interim relief can be granted to the public servant, unless opportunity of hearing is given to the State.”The FIR lodged by ACB stated that Gaikwad impersonated as a court employee and identified herself as one Mhatre Madam as an alias. Gaikwad said that she would “manage” a court case lodged by Amul Co-operative Dairy in favour of the milkman who has been made an accused in the case. The initial bribe amount demanded was ₹5 lakh.The case was filed as the milkman did not return the milk cooling machine to the company. She also made him speak to two persons claiming that they were judges. Instead, the milkman approached ACB sleuths and lodged a complaint against Gaikwad. She was caught red-handed with a bribe amount of ₹50,000 at Kiwale phata on January 13. The bribe was scaled down to ₹2.50 lakh as the milkman expressed his inability of pay the said amount followed by negotiations, the FIR stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vadgaon-maval-court-jmfc-under-acb-scanner-in-bribery-case-101613139086485.html

Currently, the Zilla Parishad is running at a ₹8 crore loss, as it has not been able to recover the infrastructure cost and does not have machinery in place to recover water charges efficiently. With a private player in place the administration also hopes to minimise leakages and wastage of water. Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “This is the first time we are engaging private players for ad-ministrative work. As of now, we do provide quality water but there are issues with regards to collection of water charges. The tenders have been floated for eight regional areas from rural pune which would cover approximately 50 villages. This is just a pilot project and we will see how it goes. The water charges collected from the villages will be shared as per the approved tender between the ZP and the private entity. The private organisation can use innovative ideas including meter systems to ensure that there is regular water supply and also that there is no wastage of water. However, they would not be allowed to charge more than the current rates, which are as per the respective gram panchayats.”Pune Zilla Parishad has 1,405 gram panchayats in its jurisdic-tion, of which 50 will be covered under the regional schemes, while others have water supply regulated by the respective gram panchayats. Although the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started a meter water supply initiative under its 24x7 water supply scheme, it has not been able to connect as many households as the scheme aimed to do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zp-floats-tenders-for-private-players-to-run-water-supply-to-50-villages-in-rural-pune-101613138426486.html

A wrong message is going in public," the Leader of Opposition said in the House. He said that as per the Supreme Court's directions, approval should be given by the government within three months. Cases are pending from years and the morale of corrupt officials is high. So, approval should be given at the earliest so that action can be taken. The former home minister said that after keeping a case pending for a long time, department disapproves it for action. He said that if a case has to be disapproved then it should be sent in three-four months but keeping it pending for years breaks the morale of honest officers. Targeting the state government, Kataria said that speaking about zero-tolerance policy against corruption is easy buy keeping the pendency for long is a conspiracy to flourish corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/279-cases-of-officers-arrested-for-bribery-pending-approval-in-rajasthan-bjp-mla-101613136701759.html

No police officer from the area was willing to comment despite repeated queries.The BJP planned five roadshows in the run-up to the assembly polls due in April-May. Four of these have been flagged off. The roadshows will pass through the state’s 294 assembly constituencies of which the BJP has sworn to win at least 200.BJP leaders present at the roadshow in Murshidabad claimed that the police stopped them saying supporters of the 12-hour general strike called by the Congress and Left parties had blocked the road but they could not see any mass agitation in progress.Also read: 'Suffocated' - Trinamool's Dinesh Trivedi announces resignation from Rajya SabhaThe strike was called in protest against baton charge and use of tear gas shells during an agitation in Kolkata and Howrah by youth and student fronts of Bengal’s Left parties, including the CPI(M), on Thursday.BJP's Murshidabad (north) unit president Sujit Das said, "The local police were aware of the route. They stopped us and said that some bandh supporters had blocked the road. But we could not see any blockade. We were later told that some local people were offering Friday prayers on the thoroughfare.”Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01 per cent during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30 per cent now. At 66.28 per cent, the population is highest in Murshidabad district.On Friday afternoon, the vehicles in the roadshow travelled from Jangipur to Sagardighi assembly constituency. These were allowed to proceed after about two hours. There was an altercation between the police and BJP leaders. The BJP leaders, including Rajesh Kumar from Uttarakhand, got off the leading bus, referred to as the rath or chariot, and walked for three kilometres.Das alleged that the police were making excuses to stop the roadshow in Murshidabad. "Every other day they are coming up with some new excuse,” he said.Gautam Ghosh, the Murshidabad district spokesperson of Trinamool Congress (TMC), said, “The BJP is trying to mislead people through these roadshows. Only a handful of people are participating in it. So, the party is creating some drama to make news. If the administration stopped the roadshow there must have been some valid reason.”This was the third time the BJP had to either stop the roadshow or change its route in the district.On Tuesday, the police asked the party to change its route in view of chief minister Mamata Bannerjee’s election rally. The TMC chief on Tuesday started her two-day tour of Murshidabad, Malda, North Dinajpur and East Burdwan, the districts with the highest Muslim populations in Bengal.On Monday, BJP workers held agitation for almost two hours at Beldanga after the police stopped the roadshow. The BJP wanted the roadshow to pass through Beldanga, Nowda and Hariharpara but was told to follow NH-34 instead. BJP leaders were told that there could be communal tension if the roadshow passed through these regions since Muslims comprise a major chunk of the local population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-rath-yatra-stopped-for-3rd-time-in-bengal-s-murshidabad-101613133203469.html

However, the Covishield vaccine production was not impacted due to the blaze.Pawar, while addressing the media after the annual general meeting of districts under Pune division ahead of the state budget, said he had visited the institute after the fire in the presence of senior officials, including the collector."The premises where the blaze erupted was empty and work was going on there. It is a private institute and they are carrying out their audit. The government is also investigating. There is no other cause behind the fire other than short circuit," he said.Speaking about the vaccination drive against Covid-19, Pawar said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had initially given a statement that the Centre will be providing vaccination to all."He later gave a statement that they will be providing vaccine to three crore people, including paramedical staff and security forces. And now, he has again given a statement that 30 crore people will be given the vaccine," Pawar said."The health minister has been giving different statements, but if you ask the state government's opinion, every state feels that it is the Centre's responsibility to provide the vaccine," he added.If all states request the Centre, it will have to accept their demand, he said.Meanwhile, Pawar reiterated that Shiv Jayanti or the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji should be celebrated in a simple manner in view of the pandemic."Not more than 100 people should gather at one place for the celebrations," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/short-circuit-caused-fire-at-serum-institute-ajit-pawar-101613133918525.html

With civic body polls slated to be held next year, Fadnavis visited the PMC headquarters and reviewed development projects. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders discussed the amenity spaces lease out policy issue with Fadnavis. BJP-ruled PMC has taken a wait and see stand regarding the policy draft as it fears challenge from civic activists and the public that could adversely affect the upcoming civic elections. Fadnavis’s suggestion to PMC During the meeting, Fadnavis said, “As per the drafted policy, PMC will not get a positive response in terms of revenue for 30 years of lease and it does not have the powers to lease out the amenity spaces for long term (99 years). PMC will have to forward the proposal to the state government urban development department for approval and it may take time to get the sanction.” According to Fadnavis, during the BJP-Shiv Sena government, a provision was made in the tourism policy to allow municipal corporations to lease out amenity spaces on 99-year lease. “There was no need to take permission from the state government,” he said. BJP insists for long-term lease Hemant Rasne, PMC standing committee chairman said, “As Fadnavis has suggested to seek for long-term lease for amenity spaces under the tourism policy, we have instructed the administration to look for this option. The amenity spaces will be rented out as per Pune Municipal Corporation Property Rent Rules-2008 (Milkat Vatap Niyamavali). The lease out period as per these rules is only 30 years. If we want to lease for longer period, we have to terminate the lease after 30 years and make a new contract every 30 years. It is a tiresome process and private firms will not show interest to take PMC properties on lease.” Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner of estate and management department, said that long-term lease may get good response. “We will check the norms mentioned in the state government tourism policy and incorporate in the amenity spaces lease out policy draft,” he said. Rate of lease As per the policy draft, PMC has set lease rent of 125 per cent on Ready Reckoner. The rate of immovable property is based on market value and stamp duty charged as per Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958. The annual statement rate determined by the state government differs as per urban, influence and rural areas. Development of amenity spaces According to a civic official, development of amenity space may be carried out by the authority or the private developer may be allowed to develop as per priorities after getting the okay from the municipal commissioner. The priority for development of particular amenity, namely playground, garden, park, school, hospital, dispensary, fire brigade station, police station, electric substation, parking and other services, in residential areas shall be decided by the municipal commissioner. If the municipal commissioner is of the opinion that an amenity space is not required for the above mentioned purposes then the owner may be allowed to develop other amenities after getting the former’s approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/public-amenity-space-lease-policy-fadnavis-suggests-pmc-to-include-tourism-benefit-101613133326167.html
12-02-2021||Bangalore||Kichcha Sudeep: I don’t believe in stardom, I just believe in saleability||He is one of Kannada cinema’s biggest stars, but Kichcha Sudeep exudes humility that few actors with his fan following would. Having just completed 25 years in the film industry, the 47-year-old is looking forward to the release of Vikrant Rona, the world’s first film that unraveled its logo at Dubai’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa. In a late night chat with us, the actor, filmmaker and television host talks competition, aversion to tags, and why he thought he wasn’t big enough to have a make up man for years. Excerpts:How does it feel hitting the 25 year milestone? The feeling remains the same, it doesn’t make a difference. I feel 25 glorious years for me is the fact that I survived for 25 years, because this field has got too much competition and things happening these days. First of all, your fans show loyalty, they stick to your films, and come to the theatres to watch you even after all these years. That’s a blessing. That I managed to be around for these years and maintain a certain positioning, a lot of people’s contribution went into that. I’m happy I’m still being able to do what I do, just like how I started my first day. I feel the same about films.It must have been a special moment to see the Burj Khalifa light up in Dubai recently, to celebrate your journey, along with the launch of your next film Vikrant Rona, isn’t it? Whatever happened was an entire team’s effort. It takes certain money. Even when Dubai wanted to host me for this milestone... I didn’t expect all this to happen in my life, I’m just going out and doing my job, the producers of Vikrant Rona wanted to do certain things. When somebody starts believing in your product, it makes you get up earlier and work better. The way people gathered there irrespective of the Covid situation… there are humongous restrictions in Dubai, not more than seven people can stand anywhere, there’s a penalty. Keeping all that aside, they wanted to stand. It was a precious moment, and it belongs to my team. Tell us something about Vikrant Rona, what made you say yes to it? It is good content, and not just visually grand. I don’t accept films because they are being made on a grand scale. At the end of the day, no matter how much you spend, you need to tell a story. That is bigger. If it is not the best story in the world, that’s okay, it should satisfy people enough to buy a ticket. Visualisation and other things are about how to tell that story. I was convinced that this is the way I wanted to tell this story. When the director narrated it to me, it was a small story, we made it big. It’s beautiful content.What was that point in your career when you realised you had made it big? I’m not being modest, but I don’t believe in stardom, I just believe in saleability. That’s the valuation every actor has. We are not valued by the number of fans we have, but the collections we get at the box office. We all have a fan following, what makes you what you are is the revenue your film gets. That’s the positioning I am talking about. So far, I am still being able to do certain things, have people investing in them, have writers wake up in the morning and write for me. That is a blessing which I am still enjoying.Not many people know that you still have the same make-up man today, with whom you worked on your first day on set… He was a temporary back then when he started. I didn’t have a make-up person for years, I hadn’t probably grown to a position where I could say I want a personal make up man! The day I saw he’s not having too much work, in the later years, I called him and asked if he would like to stay with me. I had this emotion too that this person had put the first ever make up on me. He’s a very good guy, a gentleman to have around.High points have been aplenty, but have there been any low points too so far? My lowest phases have been my highest. They are the only learning points for me, I never learnt anything from my successes. I have never learnt anything from my good moments. The lowest phase makes you stay with it for a longer time, whether you like it or not. In the beginning, we all think time has been unkind, people have been... that too, all these thoughts come, but after some time, you start feeling it was right. You realise you didn’t do something right, and learn from that. My career’s lowest phases have been the most beautiful. I don’t think I would have been able to be here without them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/kichcha-sudeep-i-don-t-believe-in-stardom-i-just-believe-in-saleability-101613131106680.html

The reduction is largely being blamed on the pandemic-induced lockdown and shuttering of the tourism industry including the party hotspots for most of the last year.Despite the ban on foreign tourist arrivals on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the percentage of foreigners who have been arrested or booked in narcotics-related cases has continued to remain around 20 per cent of the total number of people arrested.Also read: 'Suffocated' =Trinamool's Dinesh Trivedi announces resignation from Rajya SabhaThirty-six of the 172 people arrested in 2020 were foreigners held in possession of banned substances.Goa, which was witnessing between 50 and 60 narcotics-related cases, witnessed a sudden jump in 2017 when the number of cases touched 168 and increased further to 222 in 2018 and stayed at 219 in 2019.The police, however, claim that despite the fall in the number of drug cases, the value of the narcotics seized across 2020 was higher than the previous years.According to Goa Police records, the police had seized narcotics drugs worth ₹6.7 crore in 2020 as compared to 2019 when the total seizures amounted to ₹5.5 crore.According to police records, two significant raids - one on a cannabis plantation at Keri in Pernem in North Goa in mid-October 2020 in which drugs worth around ₹1.10 crore were seized, and another one in Morjim at a beach village in North Goa in March before the lockdown in which drugs worth ₹1.65 crore were seized - have tilted the scales helping the police seize drugs of higher value as compared to the previous years.The police also busted an ‘underground’ rave party that was held immediately after the lockdown began to be lifted when such parties were still not allowed. Drugs worth ₹9-lakh, including cocaine, MDMA besides marijuana, were seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-effect-goa-sees-33-fewer-narcotics-cases-in-2020-lowest-since-2016-101613130238314.html

12-02-2021||Chandigarh||9 days before her wedding, Ludhiana man kills daughter, wife||A 65-year-old factory worker attacked his wife and daughter with a hammer when they were asleep at Sherpur Kalan village in Ludhiana district on Friday morning, nine days before his daughter’s wedding. Police said his 60-year-old wife died on the spot, while his 30-year-old daughter succumbed to injuries at a local hospital in the afternoon. After committing the crime around 6am, the accused locked the house and fled before calling up his nephew at 7.45am. He told him that he was going to end his life by jumping into the Sidhwan canal near Doraha. He said the nephew could go and check what he had done at his house and even told him where he had hidden the house keys. The reason behind his taking the extreme step is yet to be ascertained. The police recovered the hammer from the house and found his scooter near the canal. Search launched for accused A search is on for the accused and the services of divers have been requisitioned. His nephew said: “I tried to convince my uncle to change his mind and return but he was adamant. I informed the villagers and we opened the gate in the presence of the police. We were shocked to find the mother dead and the daughter unconscious in their rooms.” Inspector Pramod Kumar, the station house officer Moti Nagar police station, said that the daughter was rushed to hospital, where she died. He said the wife was attacked first after which the accused hit the daughter with the hammer. Additional deputy commissioner of police Rupinder Kaur Saran said the reason behind the crime is being investigated. The wedding was fixed on February 21 and the family had sent a formal invite to the groom’s family in Rupnagar on Thursday. The bride was a postgraduate and had done well in her IELTS exam. She was to take the prelims exam of the Punjab Public Service Commission on Saturday. The accused used to work as a mason before he got a job in a forging mill in Ludhiana’s Focal Point. Similar crime involving realtor in November Ludhiana had witnessed a similar crime on November 24, 2020, when a 60-year-old realtor murdered his 58-year-old wife, 35-year-old son, 32-year-old daughter-in-law and 12-year-old grandson with an axe and knife before fleeing in his car only to set it ablaze 4km from his house. A suicide note recovered from the house said he had taken the extreme step as his daughter-in-law used to threaten to implicate him in a fake dowry case. The realtor said in the note that the family members of his daughter-in-law had not returned his money and were trying to extort more from him by threatening him with false charges. On the same day, he committed suicide by jumping before a train in Jagraon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/9-days-before-her-wedding-ludhiana-man-kills-daughter-wife-101613128646724.html
12-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka home minister gives police a new target: Crack the dark web||Following a year-long crackdown on drug rackets in Bengaluru, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai has asked the Karnataka police to focus on a new target – the dark web. Bommai said the dark web is the new source of cybercrimes, drugs, and illegal arms. He added there is a need for investing more resources into fighting cybercrimes.The new directions were given during the annual meeting of senior police officers in Bengaluru on Friday. Also Read | K’taka’s anti-cow slaughter law hits supplies, industry worth ₹500 cr affectedChief minister BS Yediyurappa, who chaired the meeting, said that the government would give all support to equip the force to fight cybercrime, which has emerged as “the biggest challenge for the state police.”Officials, who were part of the review, quoted Bommai saying the police have cracked some cases but they were only the tip of the iceberg. He is learnt to have said that the force needs to be alert to the possibility of illegal weapons also being procured through the darknet, something that is happening in other global metropolitan cities.A police officer said that there have been several cases, where police have caught peddlers who procured drugs from abroad using the dark web.Police have arrested 25-year-old Srikrishna, who had allegedly hacked into three bitcoin exchanges, multiple online poker apps, and one government e-procurement website. Bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were recovered from him, which he had either stolen using data theft or through online extortion.Investigators said that Srikrishna would encrypt data and demand payment from owners for sites to be unlocked by attacking the sites online. He was caught after police arrested some drug dealers to whom he had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. Astonished by the technical Srikrishna’s skills, Bengaluru police had decided to create new standard operating procedures for tackling cybercrimes, people aware of the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-home-minister-gives-police-a-new-target-crack-the-dark-web-101613128526655.html

We hope the President will heed the voice of the people," said Yadav, who is known to be a doting son to the RJD boss.Prasad, who is serving sentences in a number of fodder scam cases in Jharkhand, carved out of Bihar, is at present in Delhi undergoing treatment for multiple ailments.In his late 70s, the leader, who had also served as the railway minister in the UPA-1 government, is a diabetic and suffers from a heart condition and kidney problems.He has been granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in some of the cases but he needs to secure the same in a few others in order to be freed from custody.When asked about the campaign, RJD state spokesman Chitaranjan Gagan said, "It is, of course, a personal initiative of Tej Pratap Yadav but the party does back it since the matter involves our undisputed leader."The move, however, met with strong disapproval from BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi, the former deputy chief minister of Bihar who has been the foremost bte noire of the proverbial "first family" of the RJD.In a couple of tweets, he pointed out that Prasad was convicted after a "prolonged legal battle" and "legal wizards like Ram Jethmalani could neither save him from punishment nor help him get bail".In an indirect reference to Tej Pratap Yadav having been overshadowed by his younger brother Tejashwi, Modi added "the sidelined prince of RJD is now trying to create mistrust in the judiciary by the gimmickry of sending two lakh postcards to the President".Modi also referred to the RJD's dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls of 2019, when it drew a blank, and Prasad's attempts to topple the NDA government after the recent assembly elections, in which the party won the maximum number of seats but the coalition helmed by it fell short of getting majority.An official of the postal department said postcards found to be in order will be dispatched."This episode is amusing and puzzling. But the postal department will have to do its job. Postcards found to be in order will be dispatched. Others will go back to the senders," said a department official requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tej-pratap-yadav-bombards-president-with-postcards-seeking-lalu-s-release-101613128173263.html

Last rites will be performed for the unidentified bodies after preserving their DNA," he added.Meanwhile, the government has started the distribution of ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lives due to the glacial burst in Chamoli.The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel are distributing rations and essential items in Suki, Lata and Bhalgaun villages that were cut off due to a flash flood in Dhauli Ganga.A glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli District of Uttarakhand on Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/lake-formed-near-raini-village-in-joshimath-being-monitored-uttarakhand-cm-101613127207626.html

He added that Yatnal may be given 15 days to respond. The show-cause notice comes after weeks of Yatnal’s attacks against Yediyurappa.Also Read | K’taka’s anti-cow slaughter law hits supplies, industry worth ₹500 cr affectedYatnal had made several statements indicative of a change in leadership in the state. But the silence by the party’s central leadership on his comments raised doubts about the BJP taking any action against Yatnal, which in turn further fuelled speculation that the high command had indeed isolated Yediyurappa. “Our Prime Minister’s dreams are development, end of dynasty politics, corruption-free government. I will request our national president that only one person from a household should be given power. It cannot be that there is an MP, MLC, MLA, board heads and even people in-charge of party affairs from only one family,” a disgruntled Yatnal had said on January 21, after he was not given a place in the Cabinet after its expansion. He has also, on multiple occasions, claimed that 77-year-old Yediyurappa would be replaced. Yatnal is also an active participant in the ongoing Panchamsali Lingayat padayatra or march by one of the most dominant and politically influential communities. The Panchamsali, the largest sect within the dominant Lingayat community, have demanded that their existing reservation category be changed from 3B to 2A. Despite assurances from Yediyurappa to review and study the socio-economic conditions of the community, the campaign continues. The 465km march from Kudalasangama will culminate in Bengaluru with a rally scheduled o February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-bjp-finally-pulls-up-yatnal-for-his-tirade-against-cm-yediyurappa-101613127086397.html

12-02-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays redetermined relief to Punjab minister Sodhi’s family||The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the disbursement of redetermined compensation to the family of Punjab minister Gurmeet Singh Rana Sodhi in the land acquisition pertaining to 2012.The division bench of justices Augustine George Masih and Meenakshi I Mehta issued notice of motion to the Sodhi family and fixed the next hearing on May 19. On February 2, the Punjab public works department (PWD) had filed a letter patents appeal (LPA), challenging the single bench order in the contempt petition filed by the minister’s brother Guru Hardeep Singh in 2018 for the implementation of the order of the Ferozepur additional district and sessions court to give redetermined compensation to the family under the new land acquisition law. The February 9 HC order reads, “The disbursal of the amount to respondent Guru Hardeep Singh and others shall remain stayed till further orders.” During the LPA hearing on February 9, the state counsel for the PWD in HC said in compliance with the February 2 order, the redetermined amount was deposited with the Ferozepur additional district judge a day before. The counsel submitted that the review application, alleging fraud played on the court, was filed on November 27, 2020, but the same has not come up for hearing in the Supreme Court. “In the light of the fraud, the disbursement of the amount, in pursuance of the order passed by the single judge bench, be kept in abeyance,” the counsel demanded. On February 2, principal secretary (PWD) Vikas Pratap submitted in the HC during the LPA hearing that he would be depositing the amount as re-determined by the collector within a week.While hearing the contempt petition on December 17, the bench of justice Nirmaljit Kaur directed the state to deposit the re-determined compensation with the concerned court in a week and it be disbursed to the petitioner provided he furnished security of the “like amount”. On January 12, the bench of justice Harinder Singh Sidhu again directed the state that the respondent (state) shall be bound to deposit the amount before the next date of hearing (February 18). On December 29, the PWD had filed a recovery suit against minister Sodhi, alias Guru Gurmeet Singh and his brother Guru Hardeep Singh and nephews, Prabhjot Singh and Jasdeep Singh in the Guruharsahai court for pocketing double compensation against a piece of land acquired by the state government for a road project.

However, heavy boulders and muck are making their job difficult, said officials. The rescue workers have so far recovered 36 bodies, of whom 10 have been identified. They are yet to find 168 persons of the total 204 who went missing after Sunday’s disaster. State director general of police Ashok Kumar said, “The rescue workers are putting in all efforts to clear the muck from the tunnel but are unable to make any progress because there is heavy muck inside. We have cleared about 100m of the tunnel.” Also Read | Uttarakhand glacier burst: No headway in rescue work at Tapovan tunnel“The rescue workers on Thursday tried to get into the tunnel by drilling inside but to no avail,” said Kumar. On Thursday, the rescue operation had to be stopped for about half-an-hour after the water level in the Dhauliganga river rose by about one-and-a-half feet. It was, however, resumed after it receded. The officials said that the water level likely rose due to depositing of sediments upstream blocking the waterflow. “A team of rescue workers and experts went to check it on Thursday but couldn’t get a clear picture. They will go again on Friday for a recce to know what has happened,” said Kumar. Earlier on Thursday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat approved the plan of rehabilitating about 50 families from villages around disaster-prone areas in four hill districts, including Tehri Garhwal, Chamoli, Uttarakashi and Bageshwar. He also sanctioned ₹15 lakh for the installation of earthquake detecting sensors for the operation of earthquake warning system with the help of IIT Roorkee.

12-02-2021||Bhopal||24 persons including kids forced into bonded labour and tortured in MP, rescued||MP police arrested a muscleman on Thursday from Guna district, 214 km north of capital Bhopal, for allegedly keeping and assaulting several bonded labourers and torturing them by pouring hot oil on their hands, said police. Six kids were also among those rescued from his illegal confinement.The shocking incident came to light after 11 members of the Sehariya tribe escaped from the muscleman’s captivity in Raghogarh area of the district on Tuesday. Their complaint led to the rescue of 13 more people including six kids, who were kept in illegal confinement by the accused and his associates.The main accused Roman Kanjar, a resident of Raghogarh was arrested under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for pouring hot oil on the hands of labourers, said Madan Mohan Malviya, inspector Raghogarh police station.A separate FIR was registered against Roman Kanjar, Nathua Kanjar, Surendra Kanjar and Jitendra Kanjar under the relevant Sections of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act after 24 bonded labourers tilling the farm owned by the accused were rescued.Bonded Labour Liberation Front’s Guna district convener Narendra Bhadoriya said 11 men from the Sehariya tribe were kept as bonded labourers by the accused since their parents had borrowed sums between ₹20,000 to ₹50,000 from him several years ago.“In return, the accused kept them and their whole families as bonded labourers. The kids used to work as herders while the parents and young people used to work as farm labourers. They were not allowed to go anywhere without permission,” said Bhadoriya.“A few days ago, some of the people tried to flee but Roman Kanjar came to know about their plan and poured hot oil on their hands as a punishment. On Tuesday, they succeeded in fleeing from their confinement,” Bhadoriya added.Also Read: 23 cases filed under MP's new anti-conversion law in JanuaryGuna collector Kumar Purshottam on Thursday ordered an inquiry in the matter and also released certificates to the rescued labourers for their rehabilitation.“Now, we have sent all of them to their homes and also started their rehabilitation plan,” said the collector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/24-persons-including-kids-forced-into-bonded-labour-and-tortured-in-mp-rescued-101613112041469.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Study says tap water access in Delhi linked to dengue infection risk||Tap water access in densely populated parts of Delhi is a strong predictor of the risk of contracting dengue, says a study that may lead to new strategies to control transmission of the deadly virus in urban areas.The dengue virus is among a growing number of mosquito-borne pathogens across the world that have adapted to spread in cities, the scientists, including Vikram Kumar from the National Institute of Malaria Research in Delhi, noted.They said close to 3.5 billion people across the world are at risk of dengue viral infection which is spreading increasingly with growing rates of urbanisation.In the current study, published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, the scientists analysed social and environmental risk factors for contracting the virus in Delhi.They measured dengue antibodies in 2,107 individuals and mosquito larval prevalence in 18 areas within the city as well as socio-economic factors across neighbourhoods.Based on the analysis, the scientists said 7.6 per cent of the surveyed individuals were positive for dengue virus antibodies, indicating a recent or current infection.The study found that colonies with very poor access to tap water, with less than 61 per cent of houses having access, were associated with a higher risk of exposure to the virus.According to the research, these were the only type of areas to register dengue cases between epidemics.However, despite relatively low mosquito densities, they said wealthy colonies had a higher risk of recent infection than intermediary colonies.The scientists believe this may likely reflect the import of dengue virus by commuters coming into the high income areas during the day.Citing the limitations of the research, the scientists said the classifications in the study based on wealth indicators are subjective to an extent.However, they said these do offer at least some quantitative indication of socio-economic status.According to the scientists, the use of larval mosquito indices as a measure mosquito density was also a limitation since "they have been shown to have limited predictive value for dengue incidence."But the researchers said improved access to tap water could still lead to a reduction in dengue, not only for those directly affected but for the general population.They believe targeted intervention through mosquito control in winter in the socially disadvantaged areas could offer a rational strategy for optimising control efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/study-says-tap-water-access-in-delhi-linked-to-dengue-infection-risk-101613109515367.html

The woman wanted to use the statement in her claim of maintenance from husband.The woman has been booked for cheating and forgery.The Mumbai sessions court, earlier this week, rejected her anticipatory bail application, observing that her custodial interrogation was required to reach to the root of the matter to know as to on whose instance forged documents were prepared.Also Read | Mumbai Police nab accused wanted in 2016 murder case from SuratThe Khar resident has been fighting a matrimonial case against her husband since 2012. The family court has allowed her plea for maintenance for their children but rejected the plea for herself. She has hence approached Bombay high court for maintenance.To substantiate her claim, the woman had attached statements of the bank accounts of her husband, his parents and their company, to show the husband’s income.The prosecution alleged that when the complainant, the husband, enquired as how she obtained the statement of bank accounts, he realised that it was obtained by a local police officer by issuing notice to the bank under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The section relates to issuance of summons to produce a document or other things for the purpose of police investigation.The complainant claimed that the cop issued a notice citing a case registered with Agripada police station for cheating against the husband. The husband sought all the relevant documents from the police station through Right to Information.He soon came to know that the notice was forged and fabricated and created just to obtain his account statements. The husband hence lodged a case of cheating and forgery against the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-woman-booked-for-fraudulently-obtaining-husband-s-bank-statements-101613103685799.html
12-02-2021||Patna||JD (U) likely to stake claim to Bihar Legislative Council’s chairman post||The Janata Dal United is likely to push for its candidate for the post of permanent chairman of Bihar Legislative Council during the upcoming budget session, citing its numerical strength in the Upper House, said a party leader aware of the developments.There are a few candidates in the reckoning for the top post with senior JD (U) MLC Ghulam Gaus being one of the front runners. JD (U) MLC Sanjeev Kumar Singh is another probable candidate for the post, said one NDA leader, who didn’t wish to be named.“The JD (U) could play the minority card for Gaus’ appointment as the chairman. He belongs to the Pasmanda (backward classes) community and has a long political experience. But the picture will only be clear during the upcoming budget session,” said a former MLC, pleading anonymity.While NDA partners have started discussion on the issue, the JD (U) is likely to stake claim for the post reasoning that the Assembly Speaker’s post went to the BJP, said the NDA leader quoted above.The Upper House currently has 59 members against the total strength of 75. The JD (U) has 23, the BJP 19 and the LJP, HAM(S), VIP have one member each. Among the Opposition, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has six members while the Communist Party of India (CPI) has 2 members. There are two independents members as well. As many as 12 MLC seats nominated by the governor are lying vacant apart from four seats that have fallen vacant recently.The Council is presently being run by acting chairman Awadesh Narayan Singh, who was appointed in June, 2020 post retirement of acting chairman Haroon Rashid.By precedence, the election to the post is always held when the House is in session.Meanwhile, Gaus, who was elected MLC in June from the Legislative Assembly quota, said he was not aware if his name was in the reckoning. “I have no idea about it,” he said. Gaus, a professor, has had a long political career, having served as MLC as well as the leader of the opposition in the Upper House as an RJD member before resigning from the party in 2014.Also Read: ‘A courtesy call’: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on meeting with PM ModiMeanwhile, there is uncertainty whether the main Opposition party in the Council, RJD, will get the Leader of the Opposition status as the party is still short of two MLCs required to get the status as per norms.Former chief minister Rabri Devi, a sitting MLC, lost the status in June 2020 after five Grand Alliance MLCs switched to the JD (U).“The RJD does not have the prerequisite number for claiming the status of LoP.

Coming to events like these has made us hopeful that there’s a better tomorrow!”Kailash, a performer from the Bhil tribe of Jhabua, is another artiste whose joy knows no bounds when he sees visitors shaking a leg with his troupe. He says, “Hum dus log Madhya Pradesh se aaye hain yahan Bhagoriya dance karne. It’s a dance where both girls and boys perform, and it’s this tradition that establishes links to find prospective partners for life. The dance involves heavy footwork, and we are happy that we can showcase our culture and traditions to the people of Delhi.” A look beyond these dancers, and the place gives a panoramic view of the numerous tribal artefacts and cuisines narrating tales from different tribal traditions. The festival is effort to ensure inclusivity of tribal communities into the mainstream and is providing them access to wider markets and bigger opportunities. Organisers inform that this fest is the first big event for many tribal artisans. “These tribals had been waiting for almost a year for such an opportunity, and Delhi has responded with immense gusto,” says Pravir Krishna, managing director, TRIFED, adding, “The event has had more than three lakh visitors so far, which is a stupendous response! Every stall put up by artisans is doing really well; each artisan here has made a sale of ₹5- ₹10 lakhs, which has made up for their losses and also placed them comfortably for the near future. And we are happy that we are out of the Covid phobia since it’s been proved that such events can be organised keeping in mind all safety concerns. Now we are feeling enthusiastic about organising more such festivals for the tribal communities in other states, in the coming months.”Catch It LiveWhat: Aadi MahotsavWhere: Dilli Haat, INAOn till: February 15 Timing: 11am to 9pmNearest Metro Station: INA on Yellow and Pink Lines Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tribal-fest-in-delhi-dances-crafts-a-hit-among-visitors-101613075084581.html

Among the many civic issues facing Jagraon, which has 23 wards and an annual budget allocation of ₹16 crore, residents say the most pressing issues are that of water accumulation, bad roads and open garbage dumps. Surinder Singh, a shopkeeper in Kamal Chowk area, said, “Just an hour of rain is enough to get the entire town inundated. During such days, shopkeepers are forced to shut their shops as no customer is able to reach the market due to waterlogging.”Sandeep, the owner of Malhotra telecom on Jagraon-Raikot road, raised the issue of poor quality of road construction. He said the construction of the main road leading to Raikot, has been lying incomplete for the past several years and furthermore, the potholes on the route often lead to accidents. In Rani Jhansi Chowk area, the residents, especially shopkeepers, were irked by an open garbage dump. They say that besides being unhygienic, the dump attracts a lot of stray animals to area, adding to their woes. Shopkeepers of the area, Pankaj Sharma, Sunil Kumar and Raj Verma said that they, along with others, have been raising the issue for the last one year, but their complaints have fallen on deaf ears.“The garbage is lifted in the afternoon and during that time, the foul smell spreads throughout the area. Movement of traffic is also disrupted when garbage is lifted. It also draws a lot of stray cattle to the area. We had also moved court on the issue and the court had ordered a stay in the matter, but the garbage dump has still not been removed,” said Sunil Kumar. Despite several attempts to reach him, the municipal council’s executive officer Sanjay Bansal was not available.Former council president (previous tenure) Charanjit Kaur (Congress) said she had taken several steps to improve the road infrastructure and drainage system in the town. “During my tenure as president, for around two years and three months, I had taken up projects worth crores for improving the road infrastructure and drainage system. Steps were also taken to improve solid waste management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jagraon-residents-want-representatives-to-find-solutions-to-civic-issues-in-town-101613073501724.html

Police said the victim’s mother was aware that her son was behind the assault but had lied that the assault took place during school hours to protect her son. She knew that the matter would reach the police once she took her daughter to the hospital for treatment, so she herself filed a complaint with the police. On Thursday, when the police were investigating the involvement of the 13-year-old in the crime, residents, of the area where the family lives, blocked the road adjoining National Highway-44 for more than three hours. The protesters alleged that the police were trying to implicate the teenager to shield the school. Police, however, managed to pacify them and convinced them to lift the blockade. Mother had left the kids in the room to do homeworkAssistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Gurbinder Singh said that on Wednesday, the boy, who is a Class-8 student in the same school, had returned home on his own while the girl, who studies in LKG, was picked up by the mother. After bringing her home, the girl’s mother changed her clothes and asked her brother to help the seven-year-old with her homework. Leaving the kids to study, the mother had left the room to finish some household chores. It was then that the boy is said to have sexually assaulted the seven-year-old. In pain, the girl asked her mother to take her to the toilet. It was there that the mother found blood oozing out of the girl’s private parts and came to know about the assault. Police said the woman had reportedly slapped the boy on finding out what he had done but later concocted a lie to save the son.The crime was reported around 4pm, almost two hours after the woman had picked her daughter up from the school. The ACP said that soon after receiving the complaint, police questioned the school principal and teachers. The police even scanned the footage of closed-circuit television cameras in the school but found nothing. Furthermore, the school had no male teachers or other staff members.How police found out about boy’s involvementThe ACP revealed that during treatment, the girl had said “Bhai maara” (brother hit me) following which, police started questioning the 13-year-old boy and his mother. Police said the boy then confessed that he had assaulted his sister after viewing some pornographic content. The case against the teenager has been registered under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at the Salem Tabri police station.Road blocked for three hoursMeanwhile commuters had a tough time as area residents laid siege to the road adjoining National Highway-44 from 9am to 12pm on Thursday. Refusing to believe the police version of events, the protesters said that the cops had forced the teenager to confess after threatening him. They accused the victim’s school authorities of sheltering the “real culprits”. Parminder Singh, a resident of the area, said, “We want justice for the LKG student and the release of her brother. The police must investigate the matter thoroughly so that the real culprit can be punished.” Lok Insaaf Party leader Randhir Singh Sibia, who turned up at the spot, said, “I have met the parents and the police have been requested to investigate the matter thoroughly.”Meanwhile, as the protesters refused to lift the blockade for at least three hours, police was forced to divert the traffic. Sunil, a commuter on the route, said, “I was stuck in the traffic jam for over an hour. I had to navigate through some internal roads to reach my destination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-day-after-sexual-assault-on-girl-with-down-s-syndrome-police-arrest-her-teen-brother-101613073500542.html

With the increase in centres, however, and a subsequent increase in number of targeted beneficiaries, the vaccine coverage dropped to 62.4%, from 80.6% on Wednesday.District administrations are now focussing on vaccinating as many health care workers as possible before the February 20 deadline, when the data for the first category of the beneficiaries will be frozen.“We are urging people to get the shots as soon as possible to avoid missing out on vaccination. Now, there are so many people who are coming to us requesting that their names be added to the CoWIN portal but the list was frozen a couple of weeks back and we cannot do anything,” said a senior official from the South district, which saw the most people (1,810) getting the vaccine on Thursday.So far, Delhi has vaccinated 162,575 health care and front line workers since the programme began on January 16.The healthcare workers who were the first to receive the vaccine will start getting their second vaccine shot Saturday onwards, according to senior officials from Delhi’s health department. Both the vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – need two doses around 28 days apart to be effective in preventing the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/15k-get-covid-19-vaccine-jabs-in-delhi-on-thursday-101613072815952.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Discover the beauty in silence||The temple is immersed in utmost quietude, so much so that you feel that if you concentrate enough, you might hear Devi Durga breathe. Attired in an orange fabric, her idol faces the door.Hidden in a narrow alley of Old Delhi’s Galli Choori Wallan, Hara Mandir has the hushed remoteness of rarely frequented pilgrimage sites, like those found in the snowy reaches of the Himalayas. You rarely see visitors here. Its exquisite beauty remains largely untouched. Its name derives from the wall outside, painted green, or hara. Inside, the most striking feature is of the chessboard floor. The walls are sculpted at various places with taaks, or arched niches, a disappearing element of architecture. Hefty brass bells hang from the roof.The temple is very small, and yet extensive—like a piece of paper folded many times, each fold consisting of a self-contained world. The main shrine, devoted to Gauri Shankar, is atop a platform. A corridor runs around it for parikrama, or circumambulation. A taak in the corridor has been turned into a tiny shrine with a statue of Shirdi’s Sai Baba, decorated with marigolds. A 2018 wall calendar printed by Ashish Radio (“deals in speaker parts, mega phones, dj professional equipments”) shows Lord Ram with consort Sita. The corridor’s door consists of painted panes arranged in a tilted row. One of the panes is missing, like a leaf fallen from a tree branch.The alcove on the other side of the temple is devoted to Lord Shiva.And now a young CA student appears. Abhishek lives on the temple’s first floor — “which is our home.” He is the son of the shrine’s priest, Pandit Dev Kumar Dixit Chitrakootwale. “Pitaji has gone to Karol Bagh to preside over a prayer ceremony.” He shows a foundation stone on the wall detailing the origins of the temple—it was built in the 19th century by Lala Bhagwan Das and his son Parneshwarji Das. A part of the adjacent wall is lined with the portraits of a series of turbaned men descending from the temple’s founders.The accountancy student tiptoes into a small chamber to show a hidden kuan (well), which lies unused, under a lid, the access to it blocked. Returning to the chessboard floor, he stands by the temple’s main door, confirming that it is also the way to the family home upstairs. “The mandir is for the public, though very few people come.”The temple opens daily at 7 am with the morning arti, and closes at 8.30 pm. If the grill is locked, just give a shout and somebody will come down to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-discover-the-beauty-in-silence-101613072498283.html

They will also be given the option to attend the ceremony with their parents when the Covid situation improves. The decision was taken during PEC’s senate meeting on Wednesday.PEC had conducted a survey of graduating students last year to find out if they wanted to have the ceremony physically or virtually. Most students had opted for a physical convocation.Discussion on UG curriculumThe senate members also held a discussion on the flexibility of the curriculum for second, third and fourth year students of undergraduate courses. PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi, said, “Course distribution was done during the meeting. However, courses will be specified during the next senate meeting.”The PEC senate in its meeting in December has already approved a revised structure and syllabi for first-year UG students from the 2020-21 academic session. MTech programme with specialisation in data science proposedThe proposal to start a master’s programme with specialisation in data science was also tabled. However, it has not been approved yet.According to the proposal, the programme may have multiple entry and exit options, in adherence to the National Education Policy (NEP-2020). The institute is also planning to have a centre for data science. “We have suggested that a plan regarding the course is formulated,” Sanghi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/annual-convocation-pec-to-conduct-another-survey-of-graduating-students-101613071579593.html

12-02-2021||Delhi||Covid tales: Finding, sustaining house help is dream come true!||‘How many members?’, ‘How many rooms?’, ‘How much rest time she’ll get’, ‘Can we get a corona test done?’ are some of the questions one encounters when hiring a full time house help these days. In Covid-19 times, the challenge is not limited to finding a trained house help, but to sustain one and alongside afford the surged commissions of agencies or individuals who help procure house helps. Here’s what some denizens and agency owners have to say.‘Most maids are in their home town’Praveen, who runs a maid agency in Delhi, says, “Kaafi problems hain abhi kyunki most maids are in their hometowns. So, there’s a scarcity of maids. We’re taking a commission of ₹40,000 per year, and have to pay the on-ground agents too. Salary bar hain maids ke, ₹10,000 to ₹12,000. Khaana add karke 15,000 tak chala jaata hai per month ka. Woh pehle paise gaon mein dete hai. Unko leke aane ka kharcha nikalna, woh bhi mehenga pad jaata hai. Ek do maid ka covid test bhi karwake diye.” ₹25k commission is normalShyam, from a Delhi-based agency that provides maids, says: “There are different rates for dusting, cleaning and cooking. For a four-bedroom house, the salary of a house help is ₹15,000. For such deals, the commission we take is about ₹25,000. Yeh toh normal rate hai aur itna hi chal raha hai. It all depends on the maid. If she agrees to work in ₹12,000 or ₹14,000, then only we send her. Unko bhi aise ghar jaana hai jahan hygiene accha ho.” Another service provider, citing anonymity, says, “We provide semi-trained maids for ₹10,000, fully-trained for ₹14,000-15,000, and commission ₹25,000 for 11 months. Hum toh corona test bhi karwa ke dete hai.” ‘Our full-time help just disappeared’Suman Mehta, a Gurugrammer, whose full-time house help went absconding recently, says, it’s difficult to sustain one these days, and that you have to be “lucky” to get a good one. “We had a bad experience with a full-time help. She was a first-timer who didn’t want to work hard. Halaki humne clear kiya tha kya-kya kaam hai. Kisi ne usko behka diya. She just disappeared and didn’t tell anyone, not even her father. We were quite in shock. We pampered her so much, ordered clothes for her, too. Jo agents ya middlemen hote hain woh dono ko kharab karte hai. You do get help easily, be it a cook or one for laundry, but you have to be lucky to get a good one,” she adds.TV and rest break are pre-decidedA Delhi-based homemaker, on the condition of anonymity, says: “Our maid used to dictate ki TV dekhne ka time bhi achhe se chahiye, din mein rest ke liye minimum two hours chahiye. Kaam bhi yeh dekh ke lete hain according to members. We didn’t have a house help for two weeks as our old help decided to go to her village out of the blue. And every agent we called, was asking us exorbitant prices as his commission in lieu of arranging a house help, ranging from ₹30,000 to ₹40,000.”‘Zamana bada kharab hai’Delhi-based homemaker Himani Dhingra, says, “We have a joint family living in a duplex house. Do din us maid ne bahut acha kaam kiya. But then she stole our dresses, clothes of our kids, sandals. We still don’t know what all is missing from the house. Only jewellery and cash was left. Zamana bada kharab hai. After seeing the CCTV recording, we saw that she accumulated all the stuff in a men’s coat cover. Usko tokri ki tarah sar pe le gayi. We’re just thankful that hamare bacho ko nahin leke gayi. She stole other maid’s mobile and clothes also.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-tales-finding-sustaining-house-help-is-dream-come-true-101613071343554.html

The hospital has been directed to form a panel of three senior doctors to look into the allegations. CCTV footage of the emergency ward has been secured for scrutiny to find any lapse. “The preliminary inquiry rules out any negligence on the part of the doctors. The patient was being attended to, as required. However, an inquiry has been marked by the director of health services and I will form a three-member panel for it,” said Dr VK Nagpal, medical superintendent, GMSH-16. A science student from Sector 56, the patient was undergoing treatment for tuberculoma. He was admitted at the hospital after he developed a rash due to anti-tuberculosis drugs. On Thursday morning, he suffered a seizure, which was treated as per protocol at 11.30am. However, the patient became unresponsive after some time. CPR was carried out as per guidelines, but the patient couldn’t be revived and was declared dead, a health official said.The patient’s family complained that despite several pleas to the senior doctors to attend to him, as he was in severe pain, he was being looked after by only junior doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kin-allege-negligence-in-man-s-death-at-chandigarh-s-gmsh-16-inquiry-marked-101613070979393.html

Bishnoi, lodged in a Rajasthan jail, had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court citing apprehensions over being killed in a fake encounter during transit to Chandigarh and Haryana for interrogation in various criminal cases, most of them involving use of arms. He had pleaded that he be allowed to appear in court through videoconferencing or be handcuffed during transit. On this, the high court in December last year had issued directions to the Chandigarh Police to bring him to the city “in handcuffs and under the watch of 20 policemen”, with videography of the entire transit. The court had also directed that the transit be supervised by UT deputy inspector general (DIG) Omvir Singh Bishnoi, and the escorting team be led by a deputy superintendent of police with two inspectors and 17 policemen. While denying Bishnoi’s videoconferencing plea, the court had observed that the police could not be deprived of their right to interrogate an accused and that physical interrogation was necessary in cases where he had played a background role. However, not wishing to travel out of Rajasthan, Bishnoi moved the apex court against the HC order. SC has now issued a notice to the UT Police for March 22, while staying “operation and implementation” of the HC order till then. “Bishnoi is wanted in a number of cases in Chandigarh and has to be brought to the city for interrogation. The legal team will be filing a reply to the SC notice,” said senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal. Elaborate security arrangements Giving precise movement instructions, high court had said the convoy will have a pilot vehicle ahead of the prison van ferrying Bishnoi and the escort vehicle. The DSP travelling in the last vehicle will be in-charge of the transit. Bishnoi will travel in a bulletproof or armoured vehicle, duly escorted by trained commandos, armed with sophisticated arms and ammunition, the court had directed. In case of default, officials concerned will be held personally liable and responsible, it had warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-stays-gangster-lawrence-bishnoi-s-transit-from-rajasthan-to-chandigarh-101613070859474.html

The accused, Harjot Singh, 34, a resident of Phase-3A, Mohali, has been arrested and ₹8.48 lakh, part of the booty, have been recovered from him.A B-Pharmacy graduate, Harjot used an air pistol – a toy gun used to practice marksmanship with metal pellets – to execute the robbery after taking cues from movies, said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh.“He had a marketing job. But, lost it during the lockdown, making survival difficult for his family of four, comprising his wife and two children,” he added. As he is addicted to cough syrup, he singlehandedly planned and executed the robbery to fund his addiction and fulfil his desires, the police official said.Gone in two minutes Covering his face with a handkerchief, Harjot entered the branch around noon on February 8, pretending to be a customer seeking information about his bank account. He shoved the four employees present on the premises and then pulled out his air pistol, pointing it at peon Amarjit Singh, who was sitting at the cash counter. He told him to hand over the cash bag, while threatening to shoot all of them and walked out with ₹8.65 lakh within two minutes. Human intelligence helped crack caseIn the wake of non-functional CCTV cameras at the bank, police were initially left at a loss. “But, human intelligence network helped us nab the accused,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South). The bank’s CCTV cameras were not operational since February 4. Questioning the bank employees helped the police gauge that the robber was familiar with the area. Relying on human intelligence by means of interpersonal contact with sources, police zeroed in on Harjot, who was a regular visitor to the Sector-61 market and well-aware of the area. Thereon, police scanned CCTV footage from cameras installed at various crossroads near the market and spotted Harjot parking his car at a distance and walking to the bank at the same time when the robbery was executed. With his arrest, police also seized the air pistol and his white Maruti Suzuki Swift, bearing a Mohali registration number.Knew about bank’s poor securityHarjot was produced before a court on Thursday and remanded to two-day police custody. During his interrogation, he revealed that he targeted the bank as he was aware that it did not have a security guard.He had so far spent ₹17,000 of the booty on drugs as well as partying with friends.The father of two is facing a case under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act, registered on the complaint of branch manager Anuradha Awasty. If proven, the charge entails rigorous imprisonment for up to 10 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pharma-grad-who-lost-job-during-lockdown-robbed-chandigarh-bank-101613070741587.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Class 9 and 11 examinations will be conducted in offline mode in CBSE schools||All schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct in-person annual examinations for classes 9 and 11, as per a direction issued by the board on Thursday, as schools across the country begin to reopen in phases, after months shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The board has also advised schools to start the next academic session by April 1 this year.“For classes 9 and 11, schools should take steps to identify and remedy learning gaps and thereafter conduct examinations by strictly following Covid-19 protocols as per examination by-laws,” read the notification issued by CBSE controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj.To be sure, the board has not specified if the new academic session will be held in person, or remotely, and said schools can start the session following Covid-19 protocols in place in the respective states and Union territories.Schools across the country were closed for several months since March last year as part of restrictions put in place to curb the coronavirus disease crisis. Several states started reopening schools in a phases from November 2020, while Delhi allowed schools to call back students of classes 10 and 12 from January 18, and those in classes 9 and 11 from February 5 for practicals and remedial classes.“We request parents to understand that only offline examinations in classes 9 and 11 will prepare students for the board classes next year and for competitive exams,” the notification added.The CBSE has directed all its affiliated schools to gear up to welcome students for face-to-face classes. “Schools have (re)opened in a majority of the states and with the improvement of the Covid-19 situation, it is expected that schools will (re) open in other states/UTs as well. This will help students to attend schools to complete their practicals to prepare for the final exams... Teachers should focus on each student and access the learning gap,” the CBSE notification read.The board has also asked the schools to attempt to begin the 2021-2022 academic session from April 1, as is the norm.A senior official in the Delhi government education department said the Directorate of Education (DoE) has already issued a date sheet for mid-term exams for classes 9 and 11 that will be conducted between March 20 and April 15 in offline mode. However, the official warned that it may be unfeasible to begin the next session from April 1.“Our mid-term exams themselves will continue till mid-April and then we will have to conduct final exams. How is it possible to start the new session by April 1?” the official said.The CBSE’s directive was received well by several principals.Meenakshi Khushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan, said, “In Class 11, we have 272 students, and parents of over 250 students have already consented to send their children to school for in-person exams. Similarly, most parents of students in Class 9 are ready to send their wards for the exam. We are taking all precautions. We will keep staggered timing for entry and exit of students. There will be a limited number of students in each room and the campus will be sanitized properly before and after exams. We are also ready to provide a separate room to students for taking exams in case their parents are really scared about their safety.” The school will conduct the annual examination in March.RP Singh, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Surajmal Vihar, said, “The offline examination will build confidence among students and prepare them for board classes. The schools are already taking all Covid-19 related precautions, and students of classes 9 and 11 have also started coming to schools now. Conducting in-person exams for these students will not be a problem.”Family members of some students, however, said they were concerned about the CBSE’s direction. The sister of a class 11 student at a private school in south Delhi said, “There is still a lot of apprehension among parents about the safety of their children and the family members. We live with grandparents, both aged above 90, and really concerned about their safety. Why can’t schools conduct exams online like they did last year?”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said that in March last year, only a few exams were pending when the lockdown was announced to contain the Covid-19 infection. The situation was very different at that time.

The confusion The city’s past is replete with many examples of change in authorities handling land use, causing not only delays and confusion in planning and execution of infrastructure projects, but also inconvenience to citizens, who are forced to first identify the right authority for their issues, which may range from drainage problems to building permissions. A few examples: In 2017, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) prepared a separate development plan (DP) for three land parcels measuring 114 hectares. These included land parcels in Oshiwara District Centre, A block in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), and Kurla. The land parcels were handed over to the BMC from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) late in 2016, after the corporation repeated the exercise of looking at the existing land-use and released the DP 2034. In 2018, the state carved out 966 hectares in south Mumbai, stretching from Colaba to Wadala. The Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) was made the special planning authority (SPA) and the BMC’s role was minimised in these areas. The MbPT released a blueprint for these 966 hectares with no mention of the DP. The same year, the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government granted the status of a planning authority to the state-run Maharashtra Housing Development Authority (Mhada) for 14,904 cessed properties, despite the BMC’s objections. Before MbPT and Mhada were granted the status of planning authorities, the BMC had already stated that 9% of the city’s 476 sqkm area is now under SPAs. Mahesh Vijapurkar, a journalist, said, “No other Indian city has so many state-run agencies, except Delhi, which has multiple municipalities. Planning in urban cities is not just about providing facilities, it is about land-use and equitable benefits to citizens. A city’s municipality has the best understanding of its footprint. But to be the lone planner, it has to learn to be an efficient executor of plans.” Political game The issue of multiple agencies is related to the city’s status as India’s commercial capital. As the city grew, both state and Centre felt the need to govern it better and plan its development. During the late Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure as the prime minister, there was a proposal to create a separate department for Mumbai in the state government, be led by a minister. However, state Congress leaders were not keen. Several industry leaders were also of the opinion that Mumbai should be made a union territory. However, it was strongly countered by the Shiv Sena. The Samyukta Maharashtra movement had forced the Centre to change its plan to include Mumbai in Gujarat or keep it as a union territory. In 1975, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) was formed to expand Mumbai in the adjoining areas and develop the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The MMRDA gained prominence after 1999 as the Congress-NCP government started assigning key infrastructure projects. With the Shiv Sena ruling the BMC and Congress-NCP the state, the local government did not want any interference. The MMRDA Act, therefore, allowed the state to control projects outside the BMC’s jurisdiction, much to the annoyance of the Sena. “The Sena was averse to projects being transferred to other agencies. When Manohar Joshi was the chief minister, Sena also tried to increase the mayor’s powers, but the mayor till date remains a ceremonial post,” said Hemant Desai, a political observer. Today, the MMRDA is executing most premium projects. Besides a 337-km Metro network in and around Mumbai, it is also building the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) connecting Sewri and Nhava Sheva. The agency is also looked at as the go-to agency for new mobility and urban planning initiatives. Besides, the MMRDA is also an SPA for BKC, Wadala, Oshiwara, and Backbay reclamation. MMRDA, in its presentation to Thackeray in 2019, had estimated the development potential of BKC alone at ₹580 billion. Another agency that has risen to prominence is the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). Formed in 1996, the agency started with a bang under then public works department minister Nitin Gadkari. Its projects included the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, much-touted 50 flyovers in Mumbai and the Worli-Bandra sea link. Through the years, MSRDC has remained with the Sena, even when it was an ally with the BJP in the state. The agency, which is now constructing the most ambitious Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, is executing works worth ₹1,,860 billion. The state also formed the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and Mhada to improve housing infrastructure. However, the agencies failed to live up to the expectations. Dr Sanhita Joshi, assistant professor, department of civics and politics, University of Mumbai, said, “These agencies [MMRDA and MSRDC] were probably created to secure more political control over governance. They stand in the way of decentralisation of powers, functions, and functionaries to the local self-governing bodies as per the 74th constitutional amendment act of 1991.” Why a single agency? The Sena has been ruling the BMC for more than 25 years. The rise of other agencies over the years has resulted in downsizing the BMC and reducing the Sena’s clout. If the BMC is now made a single planning authority, it can take control of all development activities just ahead of the 2022 elections. “The Sena knows the BMC will remain its power centre, but it may or may not return to power in the state after five years. So, it is strengthening the BMC while it has the power,” Desai said. Political observer Surendra Jondhale said, “Apart from administrative control, if all development activities come under one authority, it means more funds, which is definitely an advantage for the ruling party.” Administratively, urban experts are also keen on Mumbai being handled by a single authority. Milind Mhaske, project co-ordinator at Praja, which works with city corporators to enhance governance, said, “When there are multiple heads involved and when the work is not done, the agencies start the blame-game.” However, there are also doubts on the BMC’s potential. A former municipal commissioner said, “It is theoretically right. But the BMC has not displayed the capacity or potential over the years, particularly during the monsoon. If urban local bodies like the BMC have to become more powerful, effective, and efficient, all external control must go. A single planning authority will be one more step closer in the direction to realise a constitutional dream.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-as-single-planning-body-why-multiple-agencies-don-t-work-in-mumbai-101613068820915.html
12-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government doesn’t allow governor Koshyari to use state plane||The unease between Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government deepened with the ruling Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) –Congress coalition denying permission to Koshyari to use the state’s airplane to travel to Dehradun on Thursday. The Raj Bhavan secretariat and the state government sought to blame each other for the incident. Following the controversy, opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led government, saying the incident has maligned Maharashtra’s image, while Sena said the state was merely following rules laid down by the home ministry.According to Raj Bhavan, Koshyari had reached the international airport and even boarded the state’s airplane, but he was told the aircraft would not take off as the chief minister’s office (CMO) had not approved the travel, so consequently, permission for flying was not sought from the flying authority. The governor then took a commercial flight to Dehradun in Uttarakhand.Also Read | SC stays contempt proceedings against Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh KoshyariAccording to Raj Bhavan, Koshyari was expected to attend 122th IAS induction program at the Lal Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, on Friday and he was supposed to fly in a government aircraft on Thursday morning to Dehradun and had planned to reach Mussoorie by road“The Governor reached the CSIM Airport at 1000 hrs and boarded the government plane. However the Hon’ble Governor was informed that the permission for the use of government aircraft had not been received. As directed by the Hon’ble Governor, tickets for Dehradun were booked on a commercial aircraft leaving Mumbai at 1215 hrs immediately and accordingly, he left for Dehradun,” said the governor’s secretariat in a release issued here.The CMO, however, blamed the secretariat for the entire episode.“The secretariat should have ensured that they had permission to use the aircraft before the governor’s departure from his official residence. The state government is not at fault and the officials at the governor house responsible for negligence will have to face the action following the directives issued by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in this regard,” stated the CMO statement.“The chief minister has taken serious cognisance of the episode and has directed the administration to fix the responsibility on the officials concerned at Raj Bhavan,”the CMO said, indicating that action would be taken against the officials for not informing the governor about the permission updates.The request from the Governor House was pending for approval till Wednesday night. The Governor’s office was also informed about the status of the request, officials said.As per the procedure, CMO approves all requests for using government aircraft and informs the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which gives further clearances, the officials said.In its clarification, CMO said, “The state government received a request from the Governor House for using the aircraft. As per the accepted practice, permission is sought for the use of aircraft and after getting approval it can be used. On Wednesday, the Governor House was informed that the CMO was yet to clear the request. The secretariat is expected to finalise travel plans and bring the governor to the airport based on the permissions for using the aircraft, but it didn’t happen. The governor could not travel to the desired destination in the government aircraft because the concerned officials at Raj Bhavan didn’t take any confirmation.”“In fact, Raj Bhavan officials are expected to take all precautions for a person appointed at an important position such as governor, but that didn’t happen and he (Koshyari) had to face this. Taking serious note of the incident, the chief minister has directed to fix responsibility of the concerned officials,” CMO said.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said he didn’t have any information. “I don’t know anything about this. CMO and the state aviation department deal with the issue.’Following the controversy, Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party slammed the Thackeray government, saying that the incident has maligned Maharashtra’s image.Former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis slammed the MVA government over the incident. “The Governor was not given the permission to use and he had to deboard the aircraft. We have never seen such an egoistic government in Maharashtra ever. It is completely wrong on part of Uddhav Thackeray (CM) to make an ego issue out of everything. It is not someone’s personal property but of the state,” Fadnavis said in his response.“I don’t think denying the use of an aircraft will affect the Governor in any way but it has certainly maligned the image of the state,” he stressed.State protocol minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is also Yuva Sena chief, youth wing of Shiv Sena, didn’t respond to calls and text messages.Shiv Sena leader and chief spokesperson said dismissed the charges of the opposition that the Sena-led state government acted with vendetta and disrespect against Koshyari. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Raut said the state was merely following the rules laid down by the Home ministry for use of government machinery for private or personal use.“Maharashtra government or the chief minister has not and will not do anything to disreSpect the governor. I spoke to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about it. There are rules and regulations set by the Home Ministry if the Governor wants to use the state machinery for his personal or private engagements. If the government had broken these rules then the government would have been blamed. The Maharashtra government has merely followed these rules... Nobody can use government machinery for their personal and private use, not even the chief minister,” Raut said.In an indirect attack on the Governor over the approval of 12 nominated members of legislative council (MLCs), Raut said that not clearing the recommendation of the Cabinet is an “insult of the Constitution and democracy”. “The biggest insult of the Constitution and democracy is not approving the names of 12 Governor-appointed members despite the State Cabinet giving its recommendation. The opposition party and BJP must speak on this issue,” he said. He also attacked the governor stating that Koshyari is a BJP leader and the Raj Bhavan was used for party activities than state affairs. “What has the BJP got to do with this issue? If they are feeling so bad [about it] they should have given him a plane; they have several commercial planes. Koshyari saheb is a BJP leader. Of late in Raj Bhavan party activities are going on than the affairs of the State,” he said.Raut refuted allegations that the state government acted in a disrespectful manner. He said, “Instead, the state has upheld the Constitution and the rules. Whenever the governor needed airplane or helicopter for official use, the government has duly provided him that. Koshyari saheb is also the Goa governor, too, where there is a BJP government. He should use their machinery and put some burden on that government as well. There is no question of acting with vendetta. The government has only followed the ruled.”Responding to Fadnavis’s allegation that the MVA government is egoistic, Raut said, “How has following rules become a question of ego? If the manner in which the Centre has behaved in the matter of the three laws is following the rules, then how can governor not getting the plane become an ego tussle? Should we not follow the rules.” He added, “Who said that the commercial airplanes are unsafe [during Covid]. If that is the case, then looking at his age, he should not step out of Raj Bhavan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-doesn-t-allow-governor-koshyari-to-use-state-plane-101613068639866.html
12-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: UG medical, dental final-year exams to start from March 8||HT Correspondent The Maharashtra University for Health Sciences (MUHS) on Thursday postponed final-year undergraduate medical and dental winter exams until March. Last month, the authorities had postponed the exams from January to February and now, the exams will commence from March 8.“Exams for all final year MBBS and BDS (old and new syllabus), Bachelor in Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS), Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery (BUMS), basic Bachelor in Science (BSc) in Nursing, will now commence from March 8,” stated the circular released on Thursday. A new schedule has also been uploaded on MUHS website.With no reason shared by the authorities on the postponement, students are getting anxious by the day about the constant delay. “All undergraduate exams other than final year exams were conducted across December and January and even the post graduate course exams have started. Only the final-year UG exams are being postponed with no specific reason,” said one of the students.Several students have also raised objection to the decision of the authorities to conduct exams offline. However, after the first and second year exams were conducted offline in December, institutes are sure the MUHS will continue all exams offline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraug-medical-dental-final-year-exams-to-start-from-march-8-101613068580784.html
12-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra likely to get 3rd batch of Covid vaccine on Monday||Maharashtra is likely to get a third consignment of 1.03 million doses of the Covishield vaccine (manufactured by Serum Institute of India) on Monday, meant for the remaining part of the first and second phases of the nationwide mass inoculation programme against Covid-19.The state government had earlier received around 1.8 million doses in two instalments for the drive that started from January 16. Now, according to the state health department, more than a million healthcare workers (HCWs) and 550,000 frontline workers (FLWs) have registered on the centralised app—CoWIN for vaccination. The state government will therefore require around 3 million doses as the inoculation comprises two shots given 28 days apart. “It is expected that SII will start their nation-wide disbursement of 11 million doses of Covishield on Monday. So, we will most likely receive the third consignment of 1.03 million doses on Monday,” said a senior officer from the state health department. Until Wednesday, the state had vaccinated 503,002 HCWs and 372,223 FLWs. However, the overall turnout of the state is 45%, which is below the national turnout rate of 55%. The state government is planning to start the second shot of Covishield from February 14 for beneficiaries who took the first shot on January 16.According to experts, the first dose of the vaccine helps to recognise the virus and ramp up the immune system that helps the body to fight the disease. The second dose is called the booster shot, which helps in further boosting up the immune system in the system. Hence, the administration of both is necessary.“When the vaccine enters our body, it produces protein, which triggers the immune cells to produce antibodies. This protects us from the infection,” said Dr Om Srivastava, a city-epidemiologist who insisted people on taking both the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-likely-to-get-3rd-batch-of-covid-vaccine-on-monday-101613068460114.html
12-02-2021||Other||Maharashtra: Class 10 students want 50% marks from internal tests||As schools in the city continue to teach online for the past 10 months, a majority of the students are stressed about the upcoming Class 10 state board exams, a recent survey has indicated. According to the survey, 83% students in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai want internal evaluations to form 50% of the weightage of the total board exams scores. The survey was conducted by Jaywant Kulkarni, a teacher from Gandhi Bal Mandir High School in Kurla, with the help of Google Forms. Over a thousand students from across 110 schools responded to the survey, with a majority of them from Mumbai, followed by Thane and Navi Mumbai. The findings of the survey showed that over 60% of students reported they had only managed to study up to 50% of the syllabus for the board exams this year. Such students said online learning was not enough for them to gain confidence to write board exams. Around 65% of respondents said they were worried about not being able to complete their papers in time, as they had lost writing practice. For instance, Monica Sakhre, a Class 10 student from Samta High School, Andheri, said there is a lot of anxiety among students in her class regarding the boards. “We haven’t written papers in the school like students do every year. Our prelims are also being held online which is not the same thing as offline exams. Many students had migrated to their hometowns and lost on a lot of learning. We hope the state considers our woes,” she added. The Class 10 exams will be held between April 29 and May 31. While the exams are held in March, they have been postponed this year owing to the pandemic and the lockdown. Despite this, however, nearly half of the students surveyed said they still did not get enough time to prepare. As per the responses, nearly 80% of schools are yet to finish their syllabus. Most students were worried about clearing geometry and science 1 exams. Kulkarni said there is a lot of anxiety among students about the exams this year, especially in Mumbai, as schools are still shut. “Online learning is not enough for these students and because physical schools are shut, they are not able to get personalised attention that is usually provided in schools. While students are extremely worried, there is no change in the paper pattern or the difficulty level of board exams which is making them even more concerned,” he added. Supporting the findings, a civic school principal said children from low-income households were at a bigger loss due to school closures. “Many families are already facing financial burden and can’t afford coaching classes. Students are completely dependent on schools. While teachers are trying their best, it is challenging to reach out to children online. We hope that schools are allowed to reopen soon,” said the principal. he state education department recently started a free counselling programme for students, 80% students surveyed said they did not know about the initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-class-10-students-want-50-marks-from-internal-tests-101613068399732.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||AAP criticises Centre for giving land at throwaway price for Delhi BJP office||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central government for sanctioning over 2 acres of land at Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Marg in Central Delhi at just ₹2 crore to Delhi BJP to build its office.Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the allocated land was not meant for building any political party office, but to build a school.“In 2014, when the BJP government was formed in the Centre, they made many big promises such as giving jobs to more than one crore youths and giving farmers 1.5 times more price for their produce. But, the only group of people who benefitted from all schemes of the Central government has been the BJP,” he said.On Wednesday, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) changed the land use of the said plot at DDU Marg from “nursery” to “public and semi-public”, allowing the Delhi unit of the BJP to legally apply for the land for its office. At present, the Delhi BJP office operates from a bungalow at Pandit Pant Marg.DDA vice-chairperson Anurag Jain on Wednesday had said that the decision was taken in the authority meeting of DDA. “After listening to all the objections received and addressing all concerns, the land use has been changed from nursery to public and semi-public. It will now be sent to the Central government for notification,” said Jain.The AAP criticised the Central government for changing the land-use of the plot under which now constructing a school, as previously planned, will not be possible.“On behalf of the AAP, I want to ask the BJP how can they get 10,000 gaz (two acres) land in this posh area in just ₹2 crore? Is it not true that this land was sanctioned to build a school,” Bhardwaj said.He further stated that when AAP went to the Central government asking for a plot to build its party headquarters, the Centre claimed it had no land available.“In the last Delhi assembly election, the BJP got just eight seats out of 70 and the AAP received 62 out of 70 seats. For the party, which is ruling Delhi, the BJP-ruled Central government claims to have no land for them to build a party office. They asked us to pay crores of rupees as rent for this office which we have today and the BJP government had also tried to evict us from here repeatedly,” Bhardwaj said.The Delhi BJP countered the claims by saying it has proper documents to show that it was allotted 809 square metres of land at DDU Marg for its office.“It is a government policy is that all political parties should be allotted land in Delhi and accordingly, the Delhi BJP had applied for land for its office in 2001. The party then moved the Delhi high court for getting this piece of land. Thereafter, it was on May 12, 2010, that land was allotted to us. There is nothing illegal in this,” said Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal.He said the AAP was “wrongly describing” it as a 10,000 square yard plot, whereas in reality, it is of 809 square metres.“The cost of the land was deposited in 2001 for the same at the prevailing rates at that time and the AAP is showing it as if the payment has been made in today’s time, which is a total lie. On the contrary, it is the AAP which has constructed its office on government land,” Chahal said.Neither the AAP has the land allotted for its current office, nor has it deposited any amount in this regard, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-criticises-centre-for-giving-land-at-throwaway-price-for-delhi-bjp-office-101613067381485.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Will share details of protester’s death on R-Day with kin: Police||The Delhi Police on Thursday told the Delhi high court that they have nothing to hide in the death of a 25-year-old farmer during the tractor rally on Republic Day. Police reiterated that farmer Navreet Singh had died of injuries sustained after his tractor overturned during the parade and said they were ready to share the CCTV footage of the incident.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel for the Delhi government (criminal cases), informed justice Yogesh Khanna that the police have no hesitancy in sharing the evidence and case documents with Navreet Singh’s grandfather, who had approached the high court seeking a court-monitored probe into the death of his grandson.“We have no hesitancy in sharing the documents and CCTV clips related to the case. We will preserve them and give them whenever they are required,” Mehra told the court, while terming Singh’s death as “unfortunate”. The police also told the court that they have registered a general FIR in the case.Navreet’s grandfather Hardeep Singh, through his counsel Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, alleged that his grandson was shot by the police during the tractor parade as a result of which his tractor overturned and rammed the barricades.The petition also said the Delhi Police had falsely declared that Singh had died due to the accidental overturning of the tractor even though they did not fairly investigate the cause of death.Arguing for the grandfather, advocate Grover told the court that the way Delhi Police has conducted themselves in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.She said the Andhra School Society, outside which the tractor had overturned, had several cameras and the police had barged into the school (Republic Day being a holiday), and taken away the DVR of all the CCTV cameras. She said the police had then selectively released a piece of the footage -- one that offers only a long shot of the incident and hence is not very clear.Grover argued that the police had abandoned all procedures -- such as carrying out inquest proceedings, conducting a post-mortem examination and lodging an FIR -- as required under the law into Singh’s death, even if it was a case of accidental death.She contended that the victim’s grandfather took the body back to their native place in Uttar Pradesh where the post-mortem examination was carried out.Grover told the court that according to a UK-based pathologist, who saw the video of the incident and also perused the post-mortem report, the injuries on the victim were consistent with at least one or two gunshot wounds.The plea had said that several medical/forensic experts who have reviewed the description of injuries in the post-mortem report have independently made statements opining that the injuries are consistent with firearm /gunshot wounds, and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning.The high court has issued notices to the Delhi government, the Delhi Police and the SHO of Bilaspur (Uttar Pradesh) police station (where the autopsy was conducted) and will further hear the matter on February 26.On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers who had reached ITO from the Ghazipur border and clashed with police. Many of them also reached the Red Fort from where another bout of violence was reported. Several protesters and personnel were injured in the violence that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-share-footage-evidence-of-tractor-rally-death-with-navreet-s-grandfather-police-tell-hc-101613067380443.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||HC asks SC committee to look into plea for shifting Metro corridor underground||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked a committee of the Supreme Court to consider a representation for changing Phase IV of Metro expansion project from overground to underground to prevent cutting of over 11,000 trees.The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) was set up by the Supreme Court to look into environmental issues arising out of the Phase IV of the Metro construction.Justice Prathiba M Singh declined to entertain a petition by Dr P C Prasad and advocate Aditya N Prasad who had contended that felling over 11,000 trees for the project would have an adverse effect on the ambient air quality of the national capital where pollution is at “critical” levels. The court said that the matter was in the domain of the Supreme Court and CEC and therefore, the petitioners — a doctor and a lawyer — have to first approach the committee.The court declined to hear the matter after the lawyer for Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said it had filed an application in the Apex court regarding the objections towards its expansion and the top court on February 2 had directed the CEC to look into it and file a report within four weeks.The DMRC lawyer said that the CEC has fixed a meeting on Thursday at 3.00 pm and the petitioners can join the same. In view of the submission made by DMRC, the court said it will not entertain the petition at this stage but directed CEC to consider the representation of the petitioners.The petition had claimed that the Phase-IV expansion of the Metro, which involves three corridors -- Delhi Aero city to Tughlakabad, RK Ashram to Janakpuri West and Maujpur to Mukundpur -- was being constructed on “deemed forest land” for which no forest clearance has been obtained.The plea had also claimed that cutting trees in such huge numbers “will cause irreparable damage and harm to the environment as well as health of the residents of New Delhi”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-apex-court-committee-to-look-into-plea-for-shifting-phase-iv-metro-corridor-underground-101613067378742.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||HC declines to interfere with East Kidwai Nagar revamp project||The Delhi high court on Thursday declined to interfere with the East Kidwai Nagar Redevelopment project, saying it was in tune with the Master of Delhi (MPD) 2021 even as the court assigned specific tasks to several agencies involved in order to address concerns raised by the residents of South Extension-II who petitioned the court in 2014.The high court observed that while decentralisation of offices was the need of the hour, it cannot be said that there was total prohibition on relocation of central PSU offices within Delhi at present. “One can only say that the government must work towards the fulfilment of this goal that has been set in the MPD,” Justice Navin Chawla said.The East Kidwai Nagar project is one of the massive residential redevelopment plans around the Ring Road. The complex, spreading over 86 acres, aims to construct more than 6,000 residential and commercial plots. As per the central government’s plan, eight areas are being developed as group housing societies —East Kidwai Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Kasturba Nagar, Thyagaraja Nagar, Srinivaspuri and Mohammadpur where more than 25,000 flats for government employees are being made in these neighbourhoods.The court on Thursday directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), which is carrying out the project, to not hand over the possession of the commercial space at East Kidwai Nagar until compensatory transplantation is carried out and the 10% excess earmarking of commercial space adjoining the Darya Khan Tomb is not compounded.The court said mere grant of sanction by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for construction, cannot give the right to the NBCC to encroach upon a protected monument area where no construction could be done within 100 metres according to the norms of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).“…The project has been considered by various Authorities like the state Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, National Monuments Authority, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Unified Traffic & Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre, New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Urban Arts Commission, etc. In absence of any specific challenge to any of such permissions, this court cannot sit as an appellate body over such authorities to reassess the permissions so granted,” the court said.Advocate Manali Singhal, who represented the petitioners, said the project violated traffic, pollution and environment norms. She said the project does not provide for adequate infrastructure in form of roads, open spaces, water supply, green belt, etc and alleged violation of various conditions imposed by the authorities while granting permissions for the project.The court said that it has to be ensured that for lack of parking space in the colony, vehicles are not parked outside on the main or the arterial roads. It directed the authorities, including Delhi Police to ensure “strict policing and zero tolerance” to avoid congestion.“Once the order is read and understood, the court orders will be implemented as directed,” the Delhi traffic police said.The authorities had told the court that they had already planted 14,575 trees till October 2019 as compensatory plantation out the total 15,455 approved. A senior forest department official said the orders of the court will be followed and a report of its implementation will also be prepared.The court also rejected the challenge to the project on the ground of lack of social infrastructure. The plea said that even the area earmarked for social infrastructure is being used for commercial purposes. This, however, has been refuted by NBCC that out of the total permissible area of 56221.70 sqm, actual constructed area for social infrastructure is 32,111 sqm with additional construction of 2,000 sqm.It also said that there is no shopping mall being constructed in the complex. It said that it is only a local shopping centre which will be used only for purposes of shops that are required for the colony.The court said that in view of the Centre’s submission, the contention is unmerited.The judge also said that while there is no doubt that the project of this proportion does put tremendous pressure on the existing infrastructure, it has to be considered from the point of view of the Master and the Zonal Development Plans.“The impact of the project on the infrastructure is also to be considered by the Authorities charged with the function of granting sanction to such a project and to keep a check on compliance with the various conditions imposed by them in such sanction.In the present case, the various respondents have given details of the permissions granted by them to the project. They have also taken a stand that there is no violation of the conditions imposed by them. In the petition there was no specific challenge to any of the permissions/sanctions so granted. In such a scenario, vague pleas of violation of any conditions imposed cannot hold any water,” the court said.NBCC did not immediately offer a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-declines-to-interfere-with-east-kidwai-nagar-revamp-project-says-it-is-in-tune-with-mpd2021-101613067379256.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Winter over, this February could be among the warmest: IMD||The temperature in the national capital hit the 30 degree Celsius mark in February at its earliest point in 15 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, as the winter comes to a close in Delhi, with temperatures forecast to rise for most of the month. Data maintained by the weather department shows that the maximum temperature last crossed 30°C in the first half of February in 2006.According to IMD data the maximum temperature recorded on Wednesday at the Safdarjung weather station, considered to be the official marker of the city, was 30.4°C, seven above the season’s normal.To be sure, experts at the weather office said the early spike in temperature was neither “unusual” nor necessarily indicative of an abnormally warm month, or summer.On Thursday, the maximum temperature dipped again and reached 26.1°C, three above the season’s normal, while the minimum was 9.6°C. Scientists, however, said this fall in temperature would be temporary and predicted that the mercury will rise again. In fact, between February 13 and February 21, the maximum temperature is expected to scale above the 30°C-mark again.February 2006 also holds the record for the highest maximum temperature for the month, when the mercury in the Capital touched 34.1°C on February 26, nearly 11 degrees above normal.IMD records show that the mean maximum temperature for February is 23.9°C, and the mean minimum is 10.4°C.IMD scientists said that while this February has seen a rising trend in the temperatures earlier than previous years, Wednesday’s spike in mercury was caused by the impact of a western disturbance, which also led to a change in wind direction.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said there were clear skies over Delhi on Wednesday, and winds were blowing from the south-west.“Winds from this direction are generally warmer, which impacted the temperature,” Srivastava said.“Though touching 30°C is not unusual for February, temperatures have not been rising this early in the month. For the remaining part of the month too, we do not foresee any drastic fall in temperatures or any sign of cold wave or cold days being recorded,” another senior IMD scientist said.The scientist also clarified that early recordings of high temperatures was not indicative of the month being headed as the warmest in the last few years.“The exact picture of whether this could feature in the list warmest February months, will have to be seen once we take the MMTs (mean maximum/minimum temperatures),” he said.Meanwhile, pollution levels also deteriorated on Thursday. Recordings by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show that the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi was 330, in the ‘very poor’ zone.On Wednesday, the AQI had improved to the ‘poor’ range, clocking 291 in the AQI scale. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), forecast said that the AQI levels are expected to remain in the ‘very poor’ zone in the coming days. An improvement is only seen after February 15, according to Safar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/earliest-30-c-temperature-in-february-in-15-years-101613067318718.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Coolers, fans, shade: Protesters at borders prepare a summer plan||Tarpaulin tents at the Capital’s borders will soon be replaced with mosquito nets, fans and coolers will replace the braziers and fireplaces, while water coolers will outnumber water tankers as farmers protesting against the three new farm laws at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri began to chalk out plans for the summer, as concerns began to emerge among union leaders that the heat may force crowds away. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department had on Wednesday said winter was on its way out as temperatures in the Capital begin their steady rise.Mannu Tyagi, a member of the Bhartiya Kisan Union who has been camping at Ghazipur, said coolers and fans have already been ordered. “We expect them to arrive by the end of this month. Other items we may need for the summer are also being purchased. All arrangements will be made to minimise the discomfort to protesters, so that the agitation continues without any hurdle,” Tyagi said.Farmers unions at Ghazipur have also placed orders for water coolers, mosquito nets, plastic sheets and summer tents, protesters aware of the matter said.On Thursday, announcements were made from the stage at the Ghazipur border, assuring protesters that steps are being taken to prepare the protest site for summer. “All of us need to keep the movement going. Don’t worry about the weather —the Kisan Ekta Morcha is all set to make arrangements for summers. We faced problems in winters, but came together overcame it,” the speaker said.Mahender Pal Singh, 44, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, who came to Ghazipur border after January 26, said they are planning to remove the tarpaulin covering their tent. “These sheets can be replaced with mosquito nets and we will sleep under the sky. During the day, desert coolers and fans will keep us cool. We are planning to go home and return with pedestal fans and coolers. We will also bring our summer clothes,” Singh said.Rajbir Singh, a farmer from Baghpat said a shade will be erected to protect protesters from the sun. “Water coolers and ice will be so that everyone gets cold water. Drinks will be served to keep the agitators hydrated. More water will also have to be arranged,” he said.The organisers said they are also in touch with gurdwara committees to arrange for the amenities needed to keep the movement going during the summers.Farmers at Singhu border also said if the government does not repeal the farmers, they will make arrangements for summers from March.Daniel Moosa, an independent farmer from Patiala, Punjab, said if they need to continue the protest longer they are planning to set up shades. “We cannot have a sit-in protest under the sun. We will need shades. We are also planning to bring in more get generators to run the fans and coolers uninterrupted, in case the government disconnects the power supply. Our farmer leaders keep holding meetings. They are also planning to install solar panels to save cost of running generators,” said Moosa, who has been camping at Singhu border November 26 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10000-coolers-5-000-fans-water-coolers-and-sunshades-to-keep-the-agitators-cool-101613067260877.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Budget to go big on health, transport and infra||The Delhi Budget this year will focus on health, basic infrastructure and transport, senior officials who are drafting the document said, adding government is likely to announce free Covid-19 vaccines for all and a cloud-based patient information management system.They said government may hold the budget session of the Delhi assembly between March 12 and 20 which will the first after the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last budget (2020-21), which came soon after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swept to power in the February 8 assembly elections last year, the government allocated ₹7,704 crore for the health sector, nearly 3% more than the previous fiscal. Health may get the highest allocation this year, the officials said.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“Among the big-ticket healthcare projects to be announced this year will be the cloud-based health information management system (HIMS). The chief minister has issued directions to roll out the project by August this year. It will start with Delhi government hospitals and then expanded to dispensaries and mohalla clinics. Upgrading a couple of hospitals with increased bed capacity is also on the cards,” said a senior health department official on condition of anonymity.The HIMS project envisages digital health cards for patients, which will be essentially a QR code-based system that will keep a record of clinical details such as health checks, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations for each patient. The system is also supposed to include a mobile phone application as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, fix consultations and other assistance.In its past budgets, the AAP government has consistently allocated the maximum share of its resources for education, followed by health. This year, the health sector is likely to get an increased allocation. Last year, the government allocated ₹15,815 crore for education, an increase of 1.3% from the previous year.The first case of Covid-19 in Delhi was detected on March 2, 2020, after which the city saw three waves of infections. The third and the worst wave peaked on November 11, when around 8,500 cases of the viral infection were recorded on a single day, according to the Delhi government.“In last year’s budget, the government allocated ₹50 crore in the Covid-19 management fund. This is likely to continue this year and will be increased in all likelihood as the focus shifts to vaccination. The Delhi government is working on making Covid vaccine free for the general public. The Central government has made it free only for healthcare workers and frontline workers,” said a second health official.Dr Suneela Garg, advisor to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and a member of Delhi’s Covid vaccination plan said a lot of work still needs to be done in terms strengthening health infrastructure in Delhi.With elections in the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations scheduled next year, senior AAP leaders said the government is also finding additional ways to optimise resources so as to ease the financial crisis faced by the three civic bodies. The bypolls to five municipal wards will be held on February 28, and the AAP is eyeing these seats to increase its stake in the city’s municipal affairs, a senior AAP member said.Between January 5 and 25, the government issued orders to all departments asking them to tighten their expenses by prioritising projects under their jurisdiction.Transport sector may also get a higher outlay this year as the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) will start bringing in its new 1,000 low-floor buses and the first lot of the electric buses will also be brought in.“DTC’s order for buses alone accounts for ₹893 crore with an additional annual maintenance cost of ₹300 crore in the first year since rolling out of these buses. The revised estimate for the transport sector in 2020-21 was about ₹5,000 crore, this is likely to touch ₹7,000 crore in the Delhi Budget 2021-22,” said a senior transport official.The unfinished projects which are likely to witness investments in the upcoming budget include the plan on redesigning of 540 km of road stretches, the slum rehabilitation project, expanding the water supply network and developing a business park at Rani Khera in northwest Delhi.“The government has hired consultants for all these projects and they will be rolled out in phases soon. There are no plans to launch new big projects and welfare schemes this year but the government plans to continue investing in the existing ones – especially subsidies on power bills, water and bus commute for women – and allocating money for some of the unfinished ones,” said a senior government official.The official said, “The government plans to launch the first phase of the slum rehabilitation project with 41,400 EWS houses by October 2022. For the 150-acre business park at Rani Khera, the government has been asked to launch the first phase by May 2023. The deadlines were given by the CM in review meetings chaired by him earlier this month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-budget-to-go-big-on-health-transport-and-infra-101613067260331.html
12-02-2021||Delhi||SDMC budget doubles LAD funds from ₹50 lakh to ₹1cr||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in its final budget presentation on Thursday doubled the councillors’ funds for Local Area Development (LAD), from ₹50 lakh per councillor per year to ₹1 crore per councillor per year.Besides that, the SDMC made a provision to provide ₹10,000 to councillors per ward to celebrate national days such as Independence Day and Republic Day. The civic body has also decided to hike funds to celebrate festivals such as Ramlila, Krishnalila and Chhath Puja from ₹50 Lakh to ₹1 crore.It also scrapped the provision of increasing the property tax and reduction in concessions, which were proposed by the SDMC additional commissioner in the budget presentation for the financial year 2021-22 in December.Reacting to the budget, senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and the party’s municipal affairs in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the budget is nothing but a “money-making exercise for councillors”.Presenting the final budget for the financial year 2021-22, leader of the SDMC house Narendra Chawla said that the civic body has decided to double the LAD funds from ₹50 Lakh to ₹1 crore for each ward and also made a provision to create a new head of account for the allocation of ₹50 Lakh for the deputy chairperson of each zone.“This should not be seen as money being given to the councillors -- it is for the development of wards. It will be reserved for citizen-centric works as they were impacted by the Covid-19 last year. We will make arrangements to generate additional funds for the purpose. We will bring more people under our tax net to bridge the (revenue) gap,” Chawla said.He added that to generate more revenue, the civic body will rely on completing its ongoing remunerative projects and lease out its commercial and other properties. “We will make provisions for holding night markets to earn more revenue. We will also rent out empty spaces in our office buildings and also allow advertisements on toilet blocks and dhalaos (garbage collection centres). All these efforts will generate more revenue,” Chawla said.In the budget, the civic body has decided not to levy extra taxes from residents. “We know that due to coronavirus pandemic, people are already troubled, and we don’t want to put an extra burden on their pockets in terms of a tax hike. So, we have decided to scrap recommendations to increase property tax. We have also decided not to implement recommendations of the municipal valuation committee-3 (MVC-3), which proposes to double the tax amount on rented commercial properties and banquet halls, among others. These are all people-centric decisions,” Chawla said.The civic body also decided to impose a fine of ₹50,000 on those found dumping building material along the roadside.He said the move will help in reducing pollution, especially dust pollution.The SDMC also announced the restarting of Atal Aahar Yojana, a scheme through which people will be provided food at ₹15 per meal. This scheme was first launched in 2017 and was stopped when the pandemic struck last year.Under the scheme, people will get a full plate of food (thali) for ₹15. “Initially, the scheme will restart with five inbuilt kitchen mobile vans in each zone and, later, two such vans will be made available in each ward of the SDMC,” an SDMC official, in the know of the matter, said.The civic body also decided to allow the keeping of an animal (either cow or buffalo) within the periphery of houses in rural and urban villages, without paying animal tax.Besides, the civic body also decided to allocate ₹25 lakh to each ward to improve the condition of roads with a width ranging between 30 feet and 60 feet.The SDMC will provide ₹500 to municipal schoolchildren and children of safai sainiks and gardeners to purchase tracksuits. The municipality also decided to launch a scheme to provide houses to kins of corona warriors who died on duty during the pandemic.AAP’s Durgesh Pathak said, “At a time when the municipalities are going through an acute financial crisis and employees are not being paid salaries, the SDMC has decided to increase councillor funds. The Delhi government has given them ₹1,095 crore for payment of salaries, which the MCDs are distributing among its councillors. MCDs have become a den of corruption. Instead of increasing councillor funds, the SDMC should think about its employees and the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-budget-doubles-lad-funds-from-50-lakh-to-1cr-hikes-funds-per-ward-for-festivals-to-1cr-101613067259794.html

On Thursday, Jamia students affiliated to AISA condemned the move and said the university had been “under attack from the Narendra Modi-led BJP government.”A senior university official, requesting anonymity, said, “We have just extended an invitation to the PM and no date for the convocation has been decided as yet.”But, AISA in a statement on Thursday said, “The Jamia administration has shown its authoritarian and anti-student tendencies once again by inviting Narendra Modi through virtual mode as the chief guest of the centenary convocation. Students of the varsity are shocked and displeased over the Prime Minister being invited to Jamia Millia Islamia as his ideas cross the line into hate speech and communalism.”The student activists also raised the arrest of Jamia students for their alleged role in the Delhi riots and demanded an intervention by the administration in the matter. “We demand that Jamia administration uninvite PM Modi. We demand that Modi-led regime unconditionally release arrested Jamia students along with all political prisoners…Failure to comply with our demands would only cement our argument that Jamia administration is anti-student and pro-fascist and force our hand to call for a boycott of the centenary convocation if Narendra Modi is the chief guest,” AISA statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/modi-invited-to-jamia-s-centenary-convocation-aisa-students-threaten-to-boycott-event-101613067258602.html
12-02-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana enacts law on Hindi, but fails to implement it||With much fanfare, the Haryana assembly had passed an amendment Bill in March last year to make Hindi mandatory in all civil and criminal courts, revenue courts, rent tribunals and any other court or tribunal constituted by the state government.The Haryana Official Language (Amendment) Bill was assented to by the governor on March 31 last year and a notification was published on May 11 by the state’s law and legislative secretary. However, the amended provision is yet to come in force. Strangely, the state government made an omission by not issuing a notification for the amended provision of the law to commence.The commencement clause of the amended law says that it shall come in force on such date as the state government may by notification in the official gazette, appoint.The self-defeating “omission” has put Hindi proficient candidates appearing for the Haryana Civil Services (judicial branch) exams at a disadvantage as they will not be able to write their exams in Hindi language.The last date for applying for 229 vacancies of HCS (judicial branch) is February 15. Candidates proficient in Hindi and appearing for the exams said they had hoped to benefit from amended law as the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) would have allowed them to write their exams in Hindi.“But in the absence of a notification to commence the amended law, the candidates won’t get the opportunity to write their exams bilingually - in English and Hindi,” said an official.Another official said the languages department has referred the matter to advocate general (AG) Baldev Raj Mahajan.The AG, who is now examining the “omission”, had himself told a bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court in June last year that though legislation (Haryana Official Language Amendment Act, 2020) has been enacted, it has been clearly laid down that it shall come into force on such date, as the state government may, by notification in the official gazette, appoint.Mahajan told the HC that no such notification has yet been issued and proper procedure would be followed in the eventuality notification under Section 1(2) of the Amended Act is to be issued. The advocate general was defending the state government during the hearing of a petition filed by practicing advocates, challenging the amended Official Languages Act making the use of Hindi mandatory in court work.The HC, subsequently on June 29, disposed off the petition terming it as a premature but granted liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh one in case commencement notification is issued. The petitioner had earlier filed a similar petition in the Supreme Court that was dismissed as withdrawn June 8 last after the petitioner sought permission to withdraw it and liberty to approach HC.Why the amendment?*The purpose of justice in a democracy is that the plaintiff should get justice quickly in his own language and should not remain speechless during the proceedings.*The state government received a demand letter signed by 78 MLAs, advocate general and hundreds of advocates to authorise the use of Hindi in courts.*Hindi being the predominantly spoken language in Haryana, use of the same for the purposes of working in courts has become a matter of practical necessity.(According to the statement of objects and reasons of the amendment Bill)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-enacts-law-fails-to-put-it-in-operation-101613064197735.html

This will increase the footfall by 10 to 15 per cent.”“Also, as Valentine’s Day is around the corner, it will help to increase footfall. It will take almost a month to normalise the business,” he said.Arun Shinde, a restaurant owner on Paud Road had earlier stressed on the necessity of extending the timings. “If customers come after 10.45pm, we cannot take them in due to restrictions of timings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/restaurants-bars-can-remain-open-till-1am-in-pune-101613063659043.html

12-02-2021||Pune||“I escaped tree falling on me by fraction of a second”||Pune: A fraction of a second late and I would have been trapped under a huge tree that fell on a street last night in Karvenagar. I still feel stunned when I think of how narrowly I escaped from a mishap that could have been deadly,” said Hindustan Times photographer Pratham Gokhale.Sharing the incident, Gokhale said, “I was out of my house to buy vegetables on my two-wheeler on Wednesday evening. Around 9.45 pm, I stopped my two-wheeler in front of the vegetable vendor near Warje ward office. As soon as I parked the vehicle and walked a step towards the vendor, I heard a sound similar to a thunderstorm and, within a fraction of a second, a huge tree fell in my direction and landed just 2 inches behind me. Fortunately, I escaped the fall and was just left with dust and leaves all over my body.“If I would have taken one extra second to cross the street to go to the vegetable vendor, or if I would have been standing 2 inches behind where I was when the tree fell, I would have got trapped under the fallen tree.“There was neither a sign of wind nor it was raining, yet the tree got uprooted. The incident raises question about the regular audit of dangerous trees as Pune has reported deaths and injuries caused by being trapped under fallen trees and branches in the past.“I was fortunate enough to escape unhurt, but I wonder if there are any more such trees across the city which require attention and maintenance. Authorities should carry out regular inspection of trees to rule out the possibility of such incidents from happening.”Meanwhile, Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We prune branches of trees that could fall and cause personal injury or property damage after regular inspection. We ensure that necessary NOCs (no objection certificate) are issued only after due diligence”With inputs by Nadeem Inamdar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/i-escaped-tree-falling-on-me-by-fraction-of-a-second-101613060717070.html

Parents have to reschedule their office timings and other professional responsibilities to meet the school timings as absence from classes on school campuses is impacting the attendance of students. “Since the school resumed offline classes from last week, I could adjust my office timings to drop my son, who is in Class 6, to school and later pick him up from the campus. However, later on it became difficult for us as his school starts at 12.30 pm and my husband and I both have to reach our workplace by 10 am. As the authorities have not yet allowed autorickshaws to resume ferrying kids, our “kaka” cannot drop or pick up our son from school as he used to do all these years,” said Sangeeta Mantri. Many working parents who depend on private transport vehicles for pick and drop of their school-going kids have demanded the authorities to restart autorickshaw, school van and bus services immediately for transportation of children. “We have asked the union transport ministry, state transport department and local RTO office to give some relief to school van and bus transporters who have suffered financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, there need to be some guidelines to start the service, as there are already many rules and regulations for school buses regarding safety measures, bus attendant and with driver. As the number of students attending schools is limited now, the ferrying charges will be high and beyond the reach of some parents. Hence, the government should immediately interfere in the issue and give us a solution,” said Kiran Desai, executive president, Pune bus owners’ association. Bappu Bhave, president, Pune Vidyarthi Vahtuk Sanghatana said, “We are ready to restart our services as auto drivers also want to transport school children. We are yet to get any clear guidelines from the state government and even schools are not allowing us to restart the service. Our auto drivers daily get calls from parents to restart the transportation service, but we are helpless as we cannot take a decision without the approval from the transport department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-in-pune-struggle-to-transport-children-to-schools-as-pvt-transporters-await-govt-s-nod-101613058856667.html
