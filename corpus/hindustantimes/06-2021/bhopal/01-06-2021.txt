The pen drive/CD could be important evidence in the investigation of the case. The pen drive can help the SIT in revealing some new facts. So we expect you to remain present at your bungalow in Shyamla Hills in Bhopal at 12.30pm on June 2 to register the statement and hand over the pen drive to SIT.”However, the police officer refused to comment on the contents of this notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mphoneytrap-case-sit-asks-kamal-nath-to-hand-over-pen-drive-he-claims-to-have-101622433107349.html
