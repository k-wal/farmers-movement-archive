With the help of local police, Shaikh was arrested. They have recovered stolen booty worth ₹55.33 lakh from him,” said Palav.According to police, the victim, Mariyam Shaikh, 47, lives in Matunga Labour Camp, which falls under the jurisdiction of Shahu Nagar police station. As she wanted to start a business in Dharavi, she recently sold her shop in Kalyan for ₹52 lakh and kept the cash at home. Shaikh was convincing her to come to her native place in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, but she did not agree, said a police officer.Shaikh, in his statement, claimed he got fed up of his wife’s refusal to settle at his native place and fled with ₹52 lakh and gold ornaments worth ₹4 lakh to his native place without informing her. The incident occurred on June 11 when she went to attend a marriage in Dharavi, added Palav.When the complainant returned, she found cash and gold ornaments were missing and tried to contact her husband but his number was switched off. She then approached the police and registered a case for breach of trust against her husband. “We questioned several people who were known to Shaikh and found his new SIM card number. His location was traced in the native place from where he was arrested,” said Palav.He was produced in the court and remanded in police custody till June 21 for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-steals-cash-ornaments-worth-57-lakh-from-wife-held-101624125689892.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||MMRDA to extend length of Sewri jetty for MTHL work||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has allowed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to augment existing infrastructure at Sewri jetty, to aid in the ongoing construction of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link from Sewri to Nhava-Sheva in Navi Mumbai. The matter is now awaiting approval of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) before the proposed expansion works can start.As per a proposal submitted by the MMRDA to the regulatory authority, the existing ‘kerosene wharf’ at Sewri is proposed to be widened to help transport the orthotropic steel decks (OSD) that will make up the MTHL bridge sections. The existing jetty will be extended by 230 metres at its mouth, and a temporary jetty will also be established on piles toward its left, to create space for a self-propelled modular transporter - a large, industrial vehicle that is used to transport objects too heavy for trucks.The MCZMA had earlier considered the proposal in February this year but decided at the time to seek a report on the matter from the forest department’s mangrove cell. In a subsequent report (dated March 25), the mangrove cell clarified that the area is not a reserved forest. As such, the MMRDA does not require clearance under the Forest Conservation Act (1980). However, the mangrove cell noted that “the proposed site falls within 50ms of notified mangrove forest” and that the “presence of true mangrove trees of avicennia officinalis is observed within the alignment.”“The project proponent (MMRDA)... assured that mangroves will not be affected due to proposed construction activities,” the MCMZA observed during its latest meeting on June 10, the minutes of which have been reviewed by Hindustan Times. The MCZMA has recommended the expansion works for CRZ clearance with the imposed condition that the MMRDA seek out the Bombay high court’s permission before proceeding, with the area.As per earlier directives of the HC, no construction work can take place on or within 50 metres of mangroves forests without its explicit permission. An engineer with the MMRDA who is involved with the project, but declined to be quoted, clarified that the authority will aim to file a writ petition before the HC before the next meeting of the SEIAA.The Sewri jetty is owned by the Mumbai Port Trust and is part of a larger 27-hectare land parcel that was handed over to the MMRDA in 2016. About 12 hectares of land will be taken over by the sea link, while about 15 hectares around Sewri jetty is already being utilised as a casting yard, for the manufacture of concrete structures like bridge sections, beams and girders that will be used to assemble the MTHL bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-to-extend-length-of-sewri-jetty-for-mthl-work-101624125629801.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Wadhwan port: NGT seeks CPCB report, halts work||The National Green Tribunal (NGT), Pune has ordered the Central Board Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to form a panel to look into the work status of the ₹65,000-crore Wadhwan port project in Dahanu and suspend the work till the panel submits the report to NGT.The NGT bench comprising justices Adarsh Kumar Goel, Sudhir Agarwal, M Sathyanarayan, Brijesh Seth and member Dr Nagin Nanda, on June 15, directed for the formation a five-member panel of environmental experts, following the Supreme Court guidelines in the 1996 Bittu Sehgal case. The tribunal directed the committee to visit the Wadhwan port site and study its impact on the environment. The order will hamper the Central government’s efforts to develop an international standard port at Dahanu.CPCB had last year issued guidelines to create a revised industrial pollution category. Accordingly, the Central government’s department of environment and forests, by order dated June 8, 2020, excluded ports, jetties and dredging from red category to non-industries category. According to CPCB list, ports fall into the red category, making it a major legal hurdle to build a growth port in the area.Wadhwan Bandar Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti, National Fishworkers Forum and other fishermen’s bodies noticed these changes and were apprehensive that it was done with the objective of creating Wadhwan port, and accordingly petitioned to NGT.Vishwanath Gharat, manager at Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) which is involved in the Wadhwan port project, refused to comment and directed HT’s queries to JNPT chairman Sanjay Sethi, who did not respond to repeated queries.Meanwhile, Aniket Patil, member of the anti-Wadhwan port project, said the panel should include local Palghar-based environmentalists or marine experts who understand the topography of Wadhwan. He added that they will send a petition to NGT in this regard.In 1991, the Central government had declared Dahanu taluka as environmentally sensitive, by Dahanu Taluka Environmental Protection Committee (DTEPA) formed by the SC, stopping construction of any new industry in the area. In 1997, Australian firm P&O had tried to build an international port at Wadhwan, but DTEPA had ruled that Wadhwan port would prove to be harmful to the environment of Dahanu taluka, following which the company withdrew its bid. Narayan Patil, convenor of Wadhwan Bandar Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti, said the government found Wadhwan port suitable due to topographical condition even though the Central government is yet to give its nod. “The government wants to send all polluting ships like coal, oil-leaking and other ships to Dahanu. We will be the victims of pollution,” said Patil, adding, “Our livelihood like fishing and dye making is already lost due to pollution at high seas, and now this is a new threat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wadhwan-port-ngt-seeks-cpcb-report-halts-work-101624125569745.html

"For the past one week, the Covid-19 positivity rate is less than five per cent in 16 districts, between five per cent and 10 per cent in 13 districts and above 10 per cent in Mysuru district. We have taken certain decisions on easing restrictions, based on the advice of the Technical Advisory Committee on COovid-19 and after discussions with my cabinet colleagues," Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa told reporters. The 16 districts with less than five per cent positivity rate are Belagavi, Mandya, Koppal, Chikkaballapura, Tumakuru, Kolar,Bengaluru Urban (including BBMP limits), Gadag, Raichur, Bagalkote, Kalaburagi, Haveri, Ramanagar, Yadgir and Bidar, Yediyurappa said. In these districts, all shops will remain open till 5 pm. Hotels, clubs and restaurants without air conditioners will be allowed to operate with 50 per cent occupancy. Outdoor shooting, bus and metro rail services with 50 per cent occupancy and outdoor sports without spectators will be allowed, he said. The Chief Minister added that the government offices will be permitted to operate with 50 per cent occupancy. Lodges, resorts and gymnasiums without ACs have also been given the nod to run their business with 50 per cent occupancy. The restrictions as ordered on June 11 will continue in 13 districts with positivity rate between five per cent to 10 per cent. Karnataka Chief Secretary P Ravikumar, in a Government Order, said all production units, industrial establishments and industries are permitted to function with 50 per cent staff, strictly adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour. However, establishments engaged in garment manufacturing are permitted to function with 30 per cent staff strength. The order said all shops without any distinction between essential and nonessential goods/services will be allowed to function outside containment zones from 6 AM to 5 PM. "However, air-conditioned shops, air-conditioned shopping complexes, malls, will not be permitted to operate. Home delivery of all items shall be encouraged 24x7 to minimise movement of individuals outside their homes. Operations shall be subject to adhering to National Directives for Covid-19 management," the order read. Parks will remain open from 5 AM to 10 AM, taxis and auto rickshaws will ply with a maximum of two passengers, and government offices can function with 50 per cent staff.

The June 11 order said the restrictions will be eased from 6 AM to 2 PM, where the sale of essential commodities and delivery through e-commerce companies will continue. The stringent restrictions in Mysuru will continue, the Chief Minister added. However, state-wide night curfew from 7 PM to 5 AM every day would continue and weekend curfew from 7 PM on Friday to 5 PM on Monday will remain in effect till July 5. The Chief Minister made it clear that easing the curbs should not be taken to mean that there has been a drastic reduction in infections. "Easing restrictions should not be perceived as Covid-19 infections have reduced drastically. The relaxation has been given because people are in distress, business activities have stopped, and livelihoods have become difficult," Yediyurappa said. He urged people to ensure this relaxation was a success by wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene. Meanwhile, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited said it would operate trains from 7 AM to 11 AM and 3 PM to 6 PM at an interval of every five minutes. There would be no serviceds on Saturdays and Sundays due to weekend curfew, it said. The Covid-19 restrictions were imposed from April 27 when the daily infections breached the 50,000 mark. When the cases did not come down, the government imposed a lockdown from May 10, allowing sale of essential goods from 6 AM to 10 AM. It eased restrictions on June 11, allowing shops selling essential commodities from 6 AM to 2 PM after the number of cases started declining. Due to the restrictions, daily infections have come down to 5,815, though active cases stood at 1,30,872 as of date, according to the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/curbs-in-karnataka-to-be-further-eased-in-19-dists-from-monday-101624125040399.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sends JNPT-Balavali multi-modal corridor project for CRZ clearance||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has recommended Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation’s (MSRDC) proposal for a 18-km multimodal corridor, from Chirner village in Uran to Balavali on National Highway (NH)-17, for coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance to the Union environment ministry. This is as per the minutes of the regulatory authority’s 155th meeting held on June 10 which also reflected that the project will involve uprooting 681 mangrove trees.A multimodal corridor is a single corridor designed to facilitate easy movement of multiple modes of transport, from private cars to public mass transit systems and even non-motorised transport, along with the flow of utilities such as gas, power and sewage. The proposal by MCZMA is planned as a connection between Mumbai trans harbour link (MTHL), Mumbai-Pune Expressway, NH-66 connecting Panvel to Kanyakumari and NH4B connecting Mumbai to Goa.The entire project will span across 220.39 hectares including forests, mangroves and agricultural land, and will pass 2.3 km east of Karnala Bird Sanctuary. As per an earlier alignment, the work would have required felling of 19.95 hectares of mangroves close to Patalganga river and Karanja creek in Raigad. While the alignment has been redrawn at MCZMA’s instruction, still at least 16 hectares of mangroves in Pen, Uran and Panvel talukas of Raigad will be affected by the project, with the majority of trees (241) falling in Uran’s Vindhane. The corridor will also pass through two CRZ-governed water bodies at Uran and Panvel.MCZMA has recommended the corridor for clearance to the Union environment ministry, whose expert appraisal committee is yet to give nod the project. While the project has been exempted from obtaining environment clearance (EC), MCZMA has imposed conditions on its assent which include compensatory afforestation in consultation with the mangrove cell and seeking for forest clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. MSRDC will also have to seek the Bombay high court’s (HC) permission in the matter.On September 17, 2018, the HC had said, “No development permission whatsoever shall be issued by any authority in Maharashtra in respect of any area under mangroves. Regardless of ownership of the land having mangroves and the area of the land, all constructions taking place within 50 metres on all sides of mangroves shall be forthwith stopped.” Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forests (mangrove cell), who led a site inspection to determine the project’s impact on mangroves, could not be reached for comment on Saturday despite attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sends-jnpt-balavali-multi-modal-corridor-project-for-crz-clearance-101624125509877.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Karnataka to install RTDAS to monitor water dispersal system||In a major relief to Maharashtra, the Karnataka government is all set to set up Real-Time Data Acquisition System (RTDAS) at its Almatti and Narayanpur dams to monitor the water dispersion system and prevent floods in western Maharashtra, like the one that had happened in 2019.Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil after a meeting with Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa at Bengaluru described the talks as positive. “The talks were very positive. Maharashtra already has a real-time data acquisition system. Once Karnataka installs it at Almatti and Narayanpur dams, then it will help to control the flow of water,” said Patil. “We will be able to jointly dynamically control the water flow. It will help to gauge how much water to disperse and the water levels to be maintained,” he added.The RTDAS installed seven years back provides precipitation real-time data which helps to gauge and control the water levels and plan better water release mechanism to prevent floods during the monsoon.In 2019, the backwater of the Almatti dam caused flooding in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, causing large scale devastation with 60 persons losing their lives. The dam did not release water at the right time, leading to the accumulation of water in its backwaters and the Krishna river that flooded parts of Kolhapur and other districts in western Maharashtra.The situation can be gauged from the fact that National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and other agencies were tasked with the rescue operation. The flood also damaged agriculture and allied activities substantially.Maharashtra had alleged that it was Karnataka that was responsible for the floods due to its failure to release the water. The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had to face large scale criticism for his failure to tackle the situation as it was reported that Yediyurappa was not acceding to his requests to release the water. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had to intervene and talk to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was only after that Karnataka started releasing water giving some relief to Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/karnataka-to-install-rtdas-to-monitor-water-dispersal-system-101624125330558.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Not an opportune time to talk about going solo: Maharashtra Congress||While Maharashtra and Mumbai Congress has been talking about going solo in the forthcoming local bodies and Assembly polls, the state in charge and All India Congress Committee (AICC), HK Patil, on Saturday took a cautious stand saying that the decision about the alliance will be taken by the party leadership. He said that this is not the opportune time to talk about going solo and the decision will be taken ahead of the elections.Various leaders of the state Congress including Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole have been publicly saying that the party would go solo in future elections and would aim to form the government in the state on its own. This has irked its ruling alliance partners, Shiv Sena and NCP with both parties saying that they would forge an alliance in coming elections and Congress can chart its independent path if it wants. Patil’s remarks on Saturday come as a snub to the party’s state leaders.“Party workers and leaders, out of their high morale and confidence, have been demanding permission to go solo in local bodies elections. The decision over it will be taken appropriate time. As far as the Assembly polls are concerned, this is not the opportune time as the elections are still three years away. It will be premature or too early to speak about it now. This government will complete its five-year term. We can discuss it and whether to go solo or have an alliance in 2023 or 2024 ahead of the elections. Currently, there is no such reference or proposal, and hence there is no need to discuss it,” he said.Patil said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government was doing well and the issues raised by Congress before chief minister Udhav Thackeray are expected to be resolved in the next few days.Party celebrated the 50th birthday of its leader Rahul Gandhi at their party headquarters in Dadar in Mumbai, on Saturday in the presence of Patil and senior leaders including former chief ministers Sushilkumar Shinde, Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, Mumbai chief Ashok Jagtap and others.Mumbai Congress chief Ashok Jagtap once demanded with the party high command to allow them to fight the forthcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation election alone. He said that the BJP, which was not even ready to take cognisance of Congress, have not set eyes on our movements. “I would request Soniaji and Rahulji to allow us to fight us alone, we will surely show the world Kisne Kitna Hai Dum,” he said.On the occasion of the 50th birthday of former party president Rahul Gandhi, senior Maharashtra leaders from the party said that many turncoats had left the parties to join BJP are desperate to come back to the fold. The former chief minister and public works department minister Ashok Chavan said that Congress should expedite the process of inducting the leaders who want to come back. “There are many senior leaders who had joined the BJP willingly or unwillingly for various reasons want to join back Congress. Some of them had joined BJP thinking that the party will come back to the party in the state. They are now been repenting there and want to come back and re-join Congress,” he said.Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said that the Gharvapsi has begun and the leaders who had left Congress to join the ruling party have now realised that they may have got the power, but the honour has been lost. He said that the Maharashtra Congress has resolved to become the single-largest party and come to the power under its chief minister.Patole said that senior party leaders have been chalking out the plan for the induction of the leaders from other parties. He said that the party will emerge as the single largest party in 2024-Assembly polls.Former minister Sunil Deshmukh and former MLA Dilip Bansode joined Congress on Saturday. Deshmukh, who had quit Congress in 2009 to join BJP after he was denied the candidature, said that he had joined BJP but was never happy there.HK Patil held series of meetings with state and Mumbai leaders and discusses various issues including issues related to the reservation to Marathas and OBC, the election of the speaker of legislative Assembly, forthcoming elections to local bodies among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-an-opportune-time-to-talk-about-going-solo-congress-101624125269790.html

19-06-2021||Mumbai||Right to choose partner rests exclusively with individual: Bombay HC||The right to choose life partner rests exclusively with the individual, and neither the state nor society can interfere with it, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Tuesday while deciding a habeas corpus petition. “Intimacies of marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether or not to marry and on whom to marry, lie outside the control of the state,” said the division bench of justice VK Jadhav and justice Shrikant Kulkarni. The petition was filed by Junned Khan, a teacher from Parbhani for a direction to Aurangabad police to bring back his daughter, Khaleda, who had eloped with her boyfriend against his wishes.Khan contended that his daughter was kidnapped from Aurangabad in October 2019, when she was minor, and an offence was registered by Chawani police station. He added that one Furkan Khan from Pusad in Yavatmal district was her kidnapper and complained that despite pointing out this fact to police, they did not take any action to trace his daughter. He had, therefore, moved HC seeking a direction to the police to trace and produce his daughter before the court.While the petition was pending, police traced Furkan at Hyderabad and on June 10 produced Khaleda before HC bench headed by justice Ravindra Ghuge. Khaleda informed the bench that she had left her relative’s place at Aurangabad on her own volition and went to Furkan.She further informed the HC that Furkan had sent a marriage proposal for her, but her parents rejected it though she wanted to marry him. She was allegedly beaten when she insisted on marrying Furkan, and eventually left her parents’ house. She said she had given birth to a baby boy in September 2020.HC had then sent Khaleda and her son to a women’s hostel.On Tuesday, when the matter came up for hearing again, Junned’s counsel urged HC to invoke parens patriae jurisdiction and pass appropriate orders in the interest of the girl, claiming that she was still a “vulnerable adult”.HC, however, rejected the plea saying it was not a case for exercising the jurisdiction. The court said while the petitioner might have acted in good faith to protect the interest of his daughter, his intentions cannot be given effect to at the cost of his daughter’s fundamental right to choose her life partner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/right-to-choose-partner-rests-exclusively-with-individual-bombay-hc-101624125030508.html

They have sought discharge for him claiming no prima facie case have been made out against him for framing charge by the prosecution. Kerkar was arrested in November for his role in financial irregularities and money laundering linked to the Yes Bank.According to Enforcement Directorate (ED), its preliminary probe has revealed that Cox and Kings Group had defaulted ₹3,642-crore loans taken from Yes Bank. The loans were driven by Rana Kapoor, co-founder, and former managing director and CEO of Yes Bank, after bypassing the norms, the ED had alleged.The central agency had claimed that the loan amount was diverted to other companies in connivance with the travel company’s chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain.The agency has also alleged that the balance sheet of the company was also manipulated to avail more loans from two more banks. Kerkar has so far claimed his innocence and stated that he has lodged a complaint against Khandelwal, Jain and others.However, ED has claimed that the complaint was lodged with an ulterior motive to camouflage his role in the case. Investigations have pointed out that Kerkar was the mastermind behind siphoning off the proceeds of crime and hence an additional Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) was registered on November 23, last year against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cox-kings-promoter-files-discharge-plea-in-money-laundering-case-101624125029734.html

According to police, Dr Rakesh Gupta, GIMS director, had filed a complaint with the cyber cell in February which investigated the matter and then directed the Kasna police station to register a case on Thursday. Gupta said that in February some staff of GIMS received unscrupulous emails. “The suspects impersonated themselves as GIMS’s director and demanded money from the staff using two fake IDs – director4891@gmail.com, and director2090@gmail.com. Two staffers were cheated by the suspects as they transferred ₹20,000 each to the suspects’ bank account without realising the fraud,” he said. Later, some other staff called the director to discuss if he had sent the email. “This was the time we realised the fraud and filed a complaint with police,” Gupta said.

19-06-2021||Noida||Loni thrashing incident: Local politician arrested by Ghaziabad crime branch||Ghaziabad: The crime branch of Ghaziabad police on Saturday arrested Ummed Pehalwan Idrisi, a local politician, from Delhi. Police said he was on the run ever since they registered a suo motu FIR against him for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups following an incident wherein a 72-year-old Muslim man was thrashed and his beard was chopped off on June 5 in Ghaziabad’s Loni. Pehalwan will be produced before a Ghaziabad court on Monday, police said, adding that he is attached to the local wing of a political party..Pehalwan, along with the victim Abdul Samad, who is from Anupshahr in Bulandshahr district, had allegedly held a Facebook live session on June 7 in which he allegedly made comments which the police said were communal. The victim, during the session, alleged that he was forced to chant slogans of “Jai Siya Ram” by the suspects, who beat him up and cut off his beard. However, both these points were not mentioned in his FIR lodged on June 7 at the Loni Border police station.A video of the incident also went viral on social media in which Samad was purportedly seen getting thrashed by some men and his beard chopped off by them.However, police investigation has so far revealed that there was no communal angle to the case as the suspects and the victim were allegedly known to each other and the dispute was personal. They said Samad allegedly gave the suspects amulets for luck but the ornament did not bring any to the suspects, due to which the suspects were allegedly angry with him.The police registered an FIR against Pehalwan on June 16 at Loni Border police station while he conducted a second Facebook live session at Anupshahr along with Samad, members of his family and locals.“Ever since then, he has been on the run. Our teams nabbed him from near LNJP Hospital in Delhi. We have brought him to Ghaziabad and he will be produced before the court Monday. During questioning, we will try to find out the reason behind his speeches and also if he acted at the behest of someone. We will also try to investigate if he delivered speeches on the narrative told to him by the victim or the victim made comments on his insistence,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle officer of Loni.Pehalwan faces an FIR under Indian Penal Code sections 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), 295a (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes), as well as provisions of the IT Act.“It is only after his speeches that the issue was diverted on communal lines, but this was not the case, as revealed during investigation. It has come to light that the victim went to the house of the prime suspect (Pravesh Gujjar) along with another suspect (Saddam alias Bauna) on a two-wheeler. Calls were exchanged between them. However, the victim claimed in his complaint that the suspects were unidentified and forcibly took him in an auto,” said an officer attached to the case investigation, requesting anonymity. The police said that during questioning, they will also try to find out people who gave shelter to Pehalwan and will also take legal action against them. “I just helped the victim as he is old and he, along with several people, came to me seeking my help. I just narrated in the first live session what was told to me by the victim. I have come to know that an FIR has been filed against me,” Pehalwan had told HT on the night of June 16. Two FIRs have been registered in the case. In the FIR lodged by the victim, as many eight suspects were arrested till Friday on different dates, all of whom got bail. Two of the suspects, however – Pravesh Gujjar and Himanshu Kumar – would stay in custody for now, the police had said Friday. While Gujjar will stay in remand till he is granted bail in another case of extortion, Himashu will be released on bail after his documentation is complete, HT had reported Friday.Besides Pravesh and Hmanshu, the other arrested suspects in Samad’s case were identified as Adil Khan, Kallu Gujjar, Saddam alias Pauwa, Mohammad Intezar, Anas, Babu and Shavez.The police on Saturday added that they arrested one more suspect, Umesh alias Polly, who was wanted in connection with the incident in which a different FIR was filed on June 7. “One more suspect is being traced and he will also be arrested soon. With these two arrests, we have arrested ten persons so far in connection with the thrashing incident while Pehalwan was the only suspect named in the other FIR. He is also arrested,” the circle officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/loni-thrashing-incident-local-politician-arrested-by-ghaziabad-crime-branch-101624123649746.html

He said this during a virtual training session on saffron cultivation in non-traditional areas of Himachal. More than 15 agriculture officers from Chamba, Kinnaur, Mandi, Kullu, Kangra and Shimla participated in the session.Why saffron cultivation will be lucrative The IHBT director said saffron is currently grown in Pampore and Kishtwar regions of Jammu and Kashmir and annual saffron production in India stands around 6-7 tonnes. This, he said, is insufficient as the annual demand in the country stands somewhere around 100 tonnes. Hence, the spice is sold at a high rate of ₹2.5-3 lakh a kilo in the market. To meet the domestic demand, most of the saffron is being imported from Iran, he said. Dr Kumar said the IHBT is working on a project with the state agriculture department to promote saffron cultivation in Himachal. “Growing saffron in the state will make a big impact on the state’s economy, cut short its imports, and be a step towards accomplishing the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he said. Dr Rakesh Kumar, senior principal scientist-cum-principal investigator, said Bharmour, Tissa in Chamba, Sangla valley in Kinnaur, Nirmand in Kullu, Bara Banghal area in Kangra districts of Himachal have a suitable climate for saffron production and it will give farmers higher returns than the traditional crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/palampurbased-ihbt-aiming-to-promote-saffron-production-in-hp-101624123532837.html

19-06-2021||Noida||Monsoon still far but expect rain today in Noida, Ghaziabad, says IMD||Noida: The weather department has predicted further delay in the arrival of the south-west monsoon in Noida and its adjoining regions, even though most of western Uttar Pradesh is now under monsoon cover. However, light rain is expected over the region on Sunday.The weatherman also said that the delay in monsoon over the region may lead to dry weather and rise in mercury over the next two days, however, the National Capital Region may see patchy rains and heavy winds.“The south-west monsoon that was held up between east and west UP has slightly advanced and now covers about 85% of western UP, including cities like Meerut and Aligarh. But it’s getting delayed in advancing further to cover areas of Noida, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Agra and the region between Meerut and Delhi. We cannot predict when it may advance and reach this region. The area will only get patchy rain or drizzle on Sunday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). The weather department had earlier predicted the arrival of monsoon in the NCR by June 15. Normally, the monsoon arrives by the last week of June in NCR.“The mercury is likely to soar and reach 39°C in the city from Monday onwards. The region is currently seeing strong easterly winds up to 20 kilometre per hour (kmph) but the weather may become dry after next one or two days,” he added.On Saturday, the IMD recorded a maximum and minimum temperature for Noida at 35°C and 25.9°C against 35.1°C and 25.5°C on Friday. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 35.1°C and 25.3°C, respectively.Meanwhile, strong easterly winds and patchy rains improved the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad further.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 55 against 66 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 58 against 62 a day earlier. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 85 against 96 a day earlier. An AQI level from zero to 50 is considered ‘good’, between 50 and 100 is considered ‘satisfactory’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality will remain in the ‘satisfactory’ levels.“Rainfall and aerosol washout are expected to improve the air quality.

19-06-2021||Noida||Decline in Covid cases leads to shortfall in testing||Ghaziabad: Amid the sharp decline in Covid-19 cases in the past three weeks, the district has fallen short of its testing target by almost 26% this month so far. District health department officials said that the decline in testing numbers is due to lesser footfall at the testing centres and fewer new cases. According to official figures, the health department had conducted 154,886 tests in April, which is 95.6% of the month’s target of 162,000. Similarly, it conducted 205,112 (97%) tests in May against the target of 211,400. However, in the first 18 days of June, only 108,868 people (74.2%) have tested, while the target for the period was 146700 tests. The overall target for June is 244,500 tests.“The testing numbers have reduced as the footfall has decreased at our centres and also due to the fact that new cases have considerably declined. In April and May, we were testing 25-30 contacts per positive case. But this month, the cases have declined which has led to fewer contacts being traced and tested. At present, we do not have any shortage of testing kits,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The district since May 16 is assigned a target of conducting 2,900 tests per day through RT-PCR method and 5,250 daily tests with the help of rapid antigen kits. Before that, the daily target was 1,700 RT-PCR and 3,700 rapid antigen tests, the officials said. In the second wave of the pandemic in Ghaziabad, the cases started to spike during mid of April and the sample positivity rate stood at 2.8% on April 15. The rate peaked to 19.3% on May 6 and thereafter started to show a declining trend. The sample positivity on June 18 was 0.33%, as per the official figures.Notably, the district recorded 12,859 positive cases in April and 14,132 in May, but the number drastically reduced to just 337 in first 18 days of June, as per the state’s health bulletin. The reduced footfall is also witnessed at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. “During April and May, there were a number of people coming in with respiratory issues, fever, and indications of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). We used to get such cases tested and admitted those who tested positive. Now, the footfall of such people has considerably reduced,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the hospital. The staff at the Ramlila Ground testing centre at Ghanta Ghar said that people were not coming out to get tested. “In May, when cases were rising, there were long queues. We used to conduct 500-600 tests per day then. Now, we hardly conduct 50 tests in a day. It is expected that cases of ILI/SARI will emerge during the monsoon season. So, the footfall may increase,” said Narsingh Kumar, a lab technician at the testing centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/decline-in-covid-cases-leads-to-shortfall-in-testing-101624123409670.html

19-06-2021||Noida||Six new community health centres to come up in Noida||NOIDA: To strengthen the health infrastructure in Gautam Budh Nagar ahead of an anticipated third wave of Covid-19, the district administration has proposed to set up six community health centres (CHCs) in urban areas of the district. The proposal of the district health committee will soon be sent to the state government for approval, officials said. The GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, who is also the ex-officio chairman of the district health committee, said that the committee has taken a serious note of an acute paucity of government health centres in the urban areas of the district. The committee, in its meeting held on Friday, unanimously decided to open six CHCs in the district, he said. “In the urban area, we’ve only one CHC in Bisrakh that was constructed when GB Nagar was a part of Ghaziabad district. Since then, Bisrakh has become a block and GB Nagar a district, but that area could not see any improvement in the health infrastructure. We’ll soon send our requisition for six new CHCs to the state government. I hope that the district will have new CHCs soon,” he said. At present, the district has six CHCs at Bisrakh, Dadri, Badalpur, Kasna Dadha, Jewar and Bhangel. “Besides the six CHCs, the district also has 21 primary health centres (PHCs). With the construction of six new CHCs, the GB Nagar residents will not need to travel far from their places. Once we get a nod from the government, we’ll decide about the locations of the new CHCs. But while deciding the venues, we’ll certainly keep in mind that the CHCs must be located at proportional distance from all the areas,” the DM said. Echoing similar views, Dr Deepak Ohri, district chief medical officer (CMO), said that the health department will soon start a survey of different areas for acquisition of land, on which the new CHCs will be constructed. “Doubling the number of existing CHCs will really be very helpful in providing health-care facilities to the residents, especially those who can’t afford the costly treatment in the private hospitals,” he said.

Officials said that they will soon take the proposal to the civic corporation’s board and will send a proposal to the state government for a final nod. A team of officials from the health department and the municipal corporation visited Makanpur along with Sahibabad member of legislative assembly Sunil Sharma on Saturday. “The land is about 5,500-5,800 sqm and can be used for the construction of a multi-storey building for the combined hospital. Since it belongs to the land management committee (LMC), it can be offered free-of-cost for the hospital. The other piece of land – of the Uttar Pradesh Avas Vikas at Vasundhara – is costing about ₹140 crore. So, the land at Makanpur would be more viable for the hospital,” said Sunil Sharma, Sahibabad MLA. “The prospect of the second hospital is also being looked into as a major part of the trans-Hindon area comprises population belonging to the lower economic strata. Hence, for their benefit, we are also searching for land at Karhera (near the Hindon air base) where another, similar hospital can be constructed for them. We identified land there, but it is in private ownership in chunks. We have asked officials to talk to farmers to give up their land for the purpose and they can be allotted land elsewhere,” Sharma added.The trans-Hindon areas comprise localities such as Indirapuram, Kaushambi, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Prahlad Garhi, Jhandapur, Sahibabad, Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Shalimar Garden, among others.Residents have been demanding the construction of a government hospital in trans-Hindon for almost a decade, as the nearest medical facilities – the MMG District Hospital and the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital – are about eight-10kms from trans-Hindon localities. According to the district health department, they were offered two land chunks – one measuring about 5,000 sqm in Vausndhara’s Sector 3, where a residential building for healthcare staff was proposed, while the other is about 7,500 sqm in Sector 6 where the main building of the hospital was proposed for 100 beds.They added that the estimated cost was about ₹140-150 crore, and it was not agreed upon by the state health department.“We have taken a look at the land available in Makanpur and it is suitable for the construction of the main hospital building. We plan to come up with a combined hospital of 100 beds in the trans-Hindon area. Since the land will be available free-of-cost, it is likely that state officials will give a nod soon,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. The land at Makanpur, however, is being transferred, not bought from the civic agency.“Once the proposal gets cleared, we will send a detailed proposal to state officials. Upon approval, the land will be handed over to the health department for construction by way of resumption (transfer). It will not involve any cost as such. So, we have in-principal agreed to give the land for the construction of the hospital,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-agency-agrees-to-offer-free-land-for-govt-hospital-in-trans-hindon-area-101624123049692.html

This will not just cater to patients in ICU and PICU, but will also ensure continuous oxygen supply to 120 beds at JSH,” the DC said.Besides, work was started on a 10,000 litre per hour capacity Oxygen plant at JSH and 600 litre per minute pressure swing absorption (PSA) Oxygen plant at MGMMCH, the DC informed the health minister. “This will provide oxygen supply to not just 200 beds at MGMMCH, but also to an additional 250 beds. Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL) and Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) have also started equipping rural hospitals with oxygen pipelines and manifolds. As many as 15 beds in each of the community health centres (CHCs) will be connected with piped oxygen supply. By first week of August, we will have 350 ICU beds ready, while the health minister has sanctioned funds for another 100 ICU beds,” Kumar said.Meanwhile, Tata Steel chief (corporate social responsibility) Saurav Roy said the steel giant will set up Oxygen plants in rural hospitals of Jharkhand and Odisha, particularly in East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts under Kolhan division.“Tara Steel will set up these plants jointly with the state government under National Health Mission. Rural hospitals are being identified for the purpose. Plants will be set up first in those rural hospitals where sending oxygen was the most difficult during the second wave,” Roy said.Tata Steel Foundation also handed over 100 oxygen cylinders to the DC on Friday. The foundation has already given 3,000 cylinders to the state government. City boy and NRI Saket Gadia, former student of Rajendra Vidyalaya and IIT-Mumbai, also sent 24 Oxygen concentrators from California.

In last 20 days, at least 15 people died at the state’s biggest tertiary hospital Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) due to thrombosis (clotting of blood in circulatory system), officials said on Saturday According to hospital officials, these Covid-19 patients died not long after they were discharged. Besides, the state has so far reported 26 deaths due to Mucormycosis, as per the state health department’s bulletin.Doctors at RIMS reported that around 40-50 patients daily visit the post-Covid out patient department (OPD). It has been noticed that around 20% of these patients are in serious condition, they said, adding that private hospitals too refer some critical patients.According to RIMS critical care head Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, nearly 45-50 post-Covid-19 patients are currently admitted at the hospital, and majority of them are suffering from respiratory problems.“In post-Covid, moderate to severe category patients are at greater risk of thrombosis because they need more oxygen. We noticed that some patients suffer from hypercoagulation triggered by coronavirus. It has been seen that some recovered patients are now returning with complaints of pain in chest, stomach and limbs, mainly due to blood clotting,” Dr Bhattacharya said.He added, “Due to blood clotting, functioning of patient’s lungs compromised which ultimately affects the oxygen supply in the body. The inadequate supply of oxygen impair the functioning of vital organs leading to death in some cases.”He said, “Such patients are administered supportive therapy. Blood thinner medicines help in recovery.”According to Dr Bhattacharya, around 15 critical patients died in last 20 days due to post Covid-19 complications.Besides, Mucormycosis cases are separately dealt with at the hospital’s ENT department.According to the state health department’s bulletin, Jharkhand has so far reported 133 cases of mucormycosis--80 confirmed and 53 suspected cases. The state has registered 26 deaths from it thus far, while a total of 50 patients have been discharged.The state on Saturday did not discover any new patient of Mucormycosis. The disease has made its presence in 18 out of 24 districts in the state, with the maximum 46 cases concentrated in state capital Ranchi alone. It is closely followed by East Singhbhum district, with its headquarters in Jamshedpur, which reported a total of 21 cases. The two districts together make up over 50% of the state’s total cases.The rare life-threatening disease Mucormycosis, that is popping up across the state as a post Covid-19 complication, has posed multiple challenges for health mandarins.“This rare disease is occurring in some post Covid patients due to poor immunity, uncontrolled diabetes and most importantly for undergoing steroid therapy during treatment of coronavirus infection. The biggest challenge is the early detection and timely treatment for this mucormycosis infection. Delay in treatment would prove fatal. As soon as patient complains of pain in any of these areas including face, nose, eye, he/she should get a CT scan or MRI done,” said Dr Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/postcovid-complication-15-die-of-blood-clotting-in-20-days-at-rims-101624120830198.html

Talking to journalists at his residence in Patna, the minister also took a dig at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. “He shares a lot of wisdom on Twitter on Covid-19, but he should explain if he has taken the vaccine or not. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured vaccination against Covid-19 moves at a good pace. Indian scientists have made India self-reliant in this field, as the country is not dependent on foreign-made vaccines anymore,” he said. Prasad said that Serum Institute of India was producing six crore doses a month, which has now gone up to 11 crore. “Similarly, Bharat Biotech’s production of Covaxin will also reach 7.50 crore per month in July and 10 crore from October, which is a big leap from just 1.7 crore doses at present. More companies have been roped in for production,” he said. The minister said that from June 21, further fillip would be given to vaccination drive to carry it forward in mission mode. “Sputnik-V also got approval in April and with seven companies producing it, it will also contribute to the vaccine kitty. By December, the country will have around 200 crore doses, while we need 180 crore doses to vaccinate all the people above 18 years of age. We have already vaccinated around 27 crore people,” he said. Prasad said India planned its vaccination in phases, prioritizing it keeping in mind the vulnerability factor. “First priority was doctors, healthcare staff and frontline workers. Then it was for people above 60 years, when Narendra Modi took vaccine to satisfy the Opposition, which was always asking why he was not taking it. Then it was for people above 45 years and now it is for those above 18 years,” he added. Maintaining that vaccination in India was moving at a faster rate compared to developed countries like the USA, England, Germany and Canada (with a combined population of barely 52-53 crore), the minister said the PM announced free vaccination to people across the country after the states wanted Centre to take control after first building a narrative for decentralization. “Despite rapid pace of infection spread during the second wave, India was able to control the situation fast due to war-scale efforts. Railways and Indian Air Force joined the efforts to deal with oxygen shortage. Now the focus is on vaccination and the PM wants that it carried out in mission mode. He is monitoring on a daily basis,” he said. On vaccination of children, the minister said it should be best left to the experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/india-will-vaccinate-all-above-18-by-dec-prasad-101624120350797.html

Sunila Devi, wife of Ravindra Mahto, was administered shots of the two vaccines in a space of 5 minutes at the Utkramit Vidyalaya, a rural camp in Beldarichak village of Punpun block under Patna district on June 16. The camp, allegedly hosted in a room, had two session sites in it, one for the 18-45 years age group and another for those above 45 years of age. Hosting two-session sites in a room is against the vaccination norms to avoid mixing, said officials. “My grandmother first stood in the queue meant for her age group and was administered Covaxin. After taking the jab, the auxiliary nursing midwife (ANM) asked her to sit on a chair. After some time, another ANM, giving shots to the 18-45 years age group, under some confusion, administered her Covishield, in a space of 5 minutes of taking Covaxin. My grandmother did not know that the two shots of vaccine should not be taken the same day,” said Akash Kumar, the 18-year-old grandson of the woman. He said his grandmother was running a high fever till yesterday but was feeling weak on Saturday. Akash also claimed that the two queues for vaccinating the 18-45 years age group and those above 45 years of age were held in one room. “The doctors are enquiring only over the phone. We got medicines for the high fever my grandmother had till yesterday, but she’s feeling weak today,” he added. “We have issued show-cause notices to our officials and expect their response on Monday. We will definitely take action against the guilty because we had specifically instructed officials not to have two different vaccines at one session site to avoid mixing of vaccines,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Dr Sanjay Kumar, medical officer-in-charge of the Punpun primary health centre (PHC), responsible for the camp, has been asked to explain under what circumstances the woman was given the two jabs, said Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, Patna’s civil surgeon. “The certificate generated through the CoWIN portal shows that only Covaxin has been administered to the woman. She, however, claims that two separate vaccines were administered to her within a few minutes. We are inquiring into the incident. I have issued show-cause notices to the two ANMs deputed at the camp and sought a response from them,” said Dr Kumar. The woman is doing fine right now. She is under the observation of a medical team, said the State Health Society, Bihar, in its tweet on Saturday evening. “Actions have been initiated against the responsible officials and the civil surgeon has been instructed to ensure that such things should not happen in future,” the tweet said. “We have asked the officials to explain how this happened, especially when all jabs have to be authenticated on the CoWIN portal on the basis of one’s Aadhaar,” said Patna’s civil surgeon. “In response to my show-cause notice to the medical officer of Punpun PHC, he has asked the two nurses deployed at the camp to explain the circumstances leading to the administration of the two vaccines to the woman,” she added. “We are keeping a close watch on the woman, who is at her residence. She had developed a fever, but is doing fine now. She has not complained of any other difficulty so far. I personally spoke to her over phone yesterday,” Dr Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/woman-given-two-shots-of-vaccine-within-minutes-in-bihar-101624120349485.html

As per the daily bulletin issued, Adhwara recorded 70 mm rain, Barh 60mm, Daudnagar 50mm, Bhagalpur, Sasaram and Hisua 40 mm each. Patna received 9.8 mm rain between 8.30 am to 5.30pm while Gaya recorded 19mm, Nawada 46.5mm and Jamui 21.5mm.

Abhishek Kashyap, a resident of Patliputra Colony, said, “ Half dug roads have added to waterlogging woes. As drainage construction work is incomplete in my locality, construction materials are lying on road. There are many such spots in the colony risky for commuting.”Weatherman Zeeshan Ansari attributed the early arrival of monsoon in the state to surplus rain. He said, “Monsoon arrived south Bihar on June 12 associated with a cyclonic system that triggered intense rain in the first phase. The state received 37mm rain between June 1 to June 11. However, the state received 169 mm rain between June 12 to June 19. Overall, Bihar recorded 149% surplus rain this month so far.” As per the MeT centre forecast, widespread to fairly widespread rain is likely over the state till June 21.

19-06-2021||Patna||Bihar set to extend women’s quota to promotions and postings||The Bihar government has ordered to give adequate representation to women, on the lines of 35% quota in government jobs for them, in promotions and postings in various offices as well, sources familiar with the matter said.“The participation of 35% women should be ensured in postings at the regional level,” sources said, quoting from the letter they said was issued by the general administration department (GAD) late Friday evening.Sources in the police headquarters confirmed to have received the directive, though there was no official release from the government.The latest directive is in line with the Nitish Kumar government’s thrust on women empowerment and could mean more female subdivisional magistrates (SDM), block development officers (BDO), circle officers (CO) and station house officers (SHO).After he came to power in 2005, Kumar has taken a slew of initiatives for women empowerment, which began with a scheme to provide cycles for girls to improve their enrolment in secondary and higher secondary schools. The result was quite encouraging. For the first time in Bihar, more girls were enrolled than boys in class 9 last year, almost a five-fold increase since 2007-08, bringing gender parity in school education. Later, his government made education free for all girls up to the post-graduation level. Now, the government has also given 35% quota to women in the engineering and medical colleges and the upcoming sports university, a first in the country.The government’s emphasis on women empowerment is evident in the fact that Bihar has 11 lakh Jeevika groups in the state, the highest number of women’s self-help groups in the country.Kumar took it further with 50% quota for women in panchayats and teaching jobs and later 35% quota in government jobs for them. Now, the government wants to use this strong workforce in the decision-making process.“All this also reflected improved performance on social indices for women in the recent Niti Ayog’s ranking of states despite Bihar’s bottom ranking. This is what will help the state improve its overall ranking also,” said Prof Vijay Kumar of BRA Bihar University.Bihar’s revenue and land reforms minister Ram Surat Kumar said his department would consider reservation for women in the next transfer/posting of circle officers. According to a report published by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), as on January 1, 2020, women accounted for 25.3% of the police strength in Bihar. Of the total 91,862 police members in the state, 23,245 are women, the highest among all states. This is double the national average of 10.3% (up from 8.9% in 2019) and a significant improvement from 2015, when women accounted for just 3.3% of the force in Bihar.However, the number of women in officer-grade posts is just 32 among 1,220 police inspectors, 920 in 10,039 sub-inspectors and 185 in 6,675 assistant sub-inspectors.

19-06-2021||Pune||MSEDCL ordered to pay ₹35,000 to techie for extorting excess bills||The Pune district consumer redressal forum on Friday directed the MSEDCL, Pune authorities to pay ₹35,000 to a techie for extorting excess bills. The power utility has also been directed to refund the excess bill amount paid. A consumer complaint was filed under section 12 of consumer protection act, 1986, by Sumit Jolly an individual consumer alleging deficiency in service rendered to the complainant by the service provider. Jolly, a Haryana-based resident, who lived in Mundhwa, had moved the consumer forum in 2017 complaining that the MSEDCL neither rectified the bills nor refund any excess payment. The MSEDCL had cut the electricity connection to his flat nine times forcing him to pay the exorbitant bills. According to the complaint, Jolly’s 2BHK rented flat in a housing society has a three-phase connection. There is a single CFL in each room, four ceiling fans, one refrigerator, and one oven in the kitchen, one flat TV of 45” in the bedroom, one washing machine of 6.5 kgs andone geyser in the bathroom, 1.5-ton AC in the master bedroom. The complainant is residing with his wife and one child. He and his wife work as software engineers. They leave the flat at 8.30 am and come back at 8.30 pm. The complainant paid the electricity bills continuously from February 2011 till March 2012, thereafter for the month of April 2012 to September 2012; he did not receive the bills. Meanwhile, in October 2012, he received a bill of ₹49,060. According to the forum, until march 2012, there was a variation in the amount of bills such as in the month February 2012 the bill was ₹350 (62 units), in March 2012 the bill was ₹2,954.82 including ₹2,600 arrears. The complainant also produced record receipts of ₹35,000 dated November 6, 2012, ₹10,000 dated January 10, 2013, ₹10,000 dated October 24, 2013, ₹10,950 dated March 28, 2014 issued by MSEDCL. The bills issued in April, May, June, July, August, September of 2012 were issued exorbitantly without clarification of calculation and it amounts to deficiency in service. Even after receiving notice from the forum, MSEDCL did not file its version. The order stated that not only the opposite parties received notices of this commission, but opposite parties did not appear before this commission, hence this commission passed ex-parte order against opposite parties on July 24, 2018. Opposite parties received notices of interim order. Upon receipt of notice of interim order, Anand Katkar, additional executive engineer remains present before the commission, on Oct 16, 2018, on behalf of opposite parties, but opposite parties neither filed any say to interim application of complainants nor filed application for setting aside ex-parte order against them. The opposite parties also did not file revision petition before the state commission for setting aside ex-parte order against them even after having them the knowledge of expert order against them. From this conduct of opposite parties, adverse inference can be drawn that there is deficiency in service on the part of opposite parties and we have to rely on contentions raised in evidence affidavit of the complainant, the order stated. The forum president Umesh Jawalikar, members Sangeeta Deshmukh and Kshitija Kulkarni directed MSEDCL to scrutinize the meter, bills, electricity supply/flow in the flat, the usage and accordingly the rectification/alteration be made regarding electricity supply, electricity meter and bills. The order further states after rectification /alteration in regard to electricity supply/ electricity meter in the said flat, MSEDCL shall award average bills comparing bills issued in the month of Dec 10, 2012 to Dec 2, 2013 excluding exorbitant bills dated May 5, 2013 and Aug 2, 2013. If the complainant had made excess payment in regard to average bills, MSEDCL must refund the excess amount to the complainant. The forum then directed MSEDCL to pay ₹35,000 towards physical and economical agony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msedcl-ordered-to-pay-rs-35-000-to-techie-for-extorting-excess-bills-101624117829373.html
19-06-2021||Pune||NGT forms committee to ascertain status of compliance in Hinjewadi project||The NGT has constituted a committee to ascertain the status of compliance and the remedial action for the possible violation of environmental clearances for the construction project. The tribunal on June 7 passed an order to constitute a five-member expert committee to ascertain the status of compliance and the remedial action required for the possible violation of Environmental clearances by the company in developing high-rise residential project in Hinjewadi. The NGT bench headed by Justice AK Goel was hearing a plea by flat owners and represented through advocate Ashish Sonawane and advocate Ayodhya Patki of Nyaya Niti Strategic Legal Consultancy LLP. The tribunal in its order, referred to the allegations made in the application related to the non-compliance of the environmental norms as per the environmental clearance, consent to establish and operate granted for the residential project. The five-member expert committee constituted by the tribunal includes: the SEIAA, Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Central Pollution Control Board, the IIT Mumbai and the nominee of Ministry of Mines, Government of India. The CPCB and the state PCB will function as nodal agencies for coordination and compliance. The factual report is expected to be furnished to the Tribunal within three months along with recommended remedial action. The order stated ‘grievance in this application is against violation of environmental norms by the respondents. The order further stated that the applicants that the Environmental Clearance (EC) for the project was granted on November 26, 2012, consent to establish was granted on November 4, 2015 and consent to operate was granted on July 8, 2016. The same was renewed in 2018. No fresh consent to operate has been taken after expiry of the earlier one. Occupancy and completion certificates have been taken for the projects, after developing three towers and selling the apartments of the five towers proposed. Common amenity space - club house has not been constructed. The STP is not functional, green cover has not been established and plantation has not been done. Solar water heaters have not been installed and the rain water harvesting system has also not been provided. Thus, many conditions of EC have been violated. The applicant has come to know that there is underground live water - stream beneath the basement of the project. Ground water is extracted from the said stream by using an electric motor. This is adding to the flooding, the order stated. From the above averments, it prima facie appears that the project has not been duly evaluated before grant of EC, particularly the existence of underwater stream. Also, there are non-compliances in providing STP and other systems in terms of the EC conditions which are not being monitored. In these circumstances, we find it necessary to ascertain the status of compliance and the remedial action required. For this purpose, we constitute a five-member expert committee comprising the SEIAA, Maharashtra, the Maharashtra State PCB, the CPCB, the IIT Mumbai and nominees of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India. The CPCB and the state PCB will function as nodal agency for coordination and compliance. The expert committee may meet within one month to take stock of the situation and thereafter, conduct proceedings online except for site visit. The committee will be free to take the assistance of any other expert/organization and interact with the stakeholders, the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ngt-forms-committee-to-ascertain-status-of-compliance-in-hinjewadi-project-101624117409397.html

PMRDA demanded that PMC should share some cost of this flyover, though it is getting erected along with the metro line in between Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar. Meanwhile, opposition parties and some representatives from ruling BJP opposed to share the burden of multilevel flyover and asked to take the permission of general body for design and project cost. PMRDA metropolitan commissioner Suhas Divase and project officer Vivek Khardwadkar gave the proposed flyover’s presentation to mayor Muralidhar Mohol, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole, opposition leader Deepali Dhumal and Aba Bagul. As the previous flyover was erroneously built, PMC and PMRDA gave a nod to demolish it and erect a new multi-level flyover along with the third metro line. While giving permission to demolish the flyover at this junction, it was decided that PMRDA would seek approval from the PMC for design and planning. Kharwadkar said, “We submitted the design to the PMC on Friday. Now, the PMC will discuss it along with the elected members and give approval for the flyover project.” Shirole said, “The design is compressive which is prepared by IIT and Tata Company who is erecting the metro line. Many components are considered in it. The total project cost is around ₹450 crore. It was discussed in the meeting that the PMRDA would bear the flyover cost and PMC would bear the underground passes cost but the final decision would be taken by the PMC’s general body.” Mohol said, “The PMRDA had given various proposals including some land acquisition for entry and exit points of metro station and flyover project. PMC would take a call on it.” Bagul said, “Earlier while demolishing the flyovers, it was decided that PMRDA would bear the cost. Now they are demanding money for a flyover which is wrong. PMRDA was asking for the party leader’s permission but we opposed it. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is the general body of the PMC. We asked the mayor and commissioner that before giving any assurance, the project should get discussed in the general body meeting.” Sources from PMC said that the length of the flyover has been increased towards Baner, Aundh and Pashan. The two-way traffic would be allowed on Baner road and one way would be allowed on Aundh eoad. On one side, vehicles will use a flyover and on the other side they would need to use an underpass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmrda-submits-university-chowk-flyover-design-to-pmc-101624117289419.html

Though some contractors opposed the appointment of a single contractor, the court gave a decision in favour of PMC to appoint a single contractor for pan city. There are many complaints over the pay and parking in the city. Many times, the contractors are charging more for citizens despite the civic body fixing the rates for each vehicle category. Even some parking facilities are getting misused. Many contractors have not paid dues in time to the civic body. Many a times there are fights between citizens and contractors over parking vehicles at the parking spots. Considering these challenges, the civic body in a first decided to float a single tender and appoint a single pan-city contractor. PMC additional city engineer Srinivas Bonala said, “We have floated the tender for 30 pay and parking facilities for the first time. We brought many changes in the tender. The contractor needs to install CCTV cameras in all parking facilities for the safety of citizens and vehicles, there should be uniform rates for parking, It is expected that PMC should get real time information for the parked vehicles in the facility.” Bonala said, “We even expected that either PMC or the contractor would develop the app for the parking facility. Once the real time entries would start, the citizens would be able to get information online whether parking is available in a particular parking site. It would help them to plan travel in advance.” Another PMC official said on anonymity, “There is opposition from some contractors for floating the single tender for all 30 main parking facilities. Even some of them approached the civil court but the court had given a decision in favour of the PMC.” Another officer from PMC said on anonymity, “Though this is a good proposal, it came in between Covid -19 pandemic. We are a little worried that whether the professional contractors would give respond to this proposal immediately or not but this proposal is good for citizens and the PMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-plans-to-appoint-single-contractor-for-pay-and-park-facilities-across-city-101624117229432.html

19-06-2021||Pune||Plastic surgeon in custody after hospital records 87 deaths||A doctor from Sangli was remanded to the custody of the local police in a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder that was registered against him based on the complaint lodged by the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation (SMKC) after the hospital single-handedly recorded 87 deaths in 43 days. Identified as Dr Mahesh Bhimsen Jadhav, the arrested man is a plastic surgeon and is the owner of Apexcare hospital, which is a Covid-19 dedicated hospital, according to officials of SKMC health department. A local court in Sangli has remanded him to seven days in police custody. The hospital had over 200 admissions between April 14 and May 27, and 87 of these admissions have died in that period, according to local officials including the police, district collector office, and SKMC. “When his anticipatory bail was rejected, we started looking for him in order to arrest him. We received information that he was on Pune highway, and we alerted the check-posts which were already in place for Covid-19 restrictions. As it turned out, his vehicle had been stopped at a check-post on the highway and fined for a violation under the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA). We found him in Kasegaon and arrested him there,” said Dixit Gedam, commissioner of Sangli police. “Initially, a case under Section 188 and others of Indian Penal Code and Sections of National Disaster Management Act was registered but after looking at the number of deaths, section for culpable homicide not amounting to murder was also invoked against him,” said Nitin Kapadnis, commissioner, SKMC. Upon investigation the police found that there were specialists like MD anaesthesia, MD medicine, MD lungs who were appointed to the hospital, but the treatment was being done by students of homeopathy who were instructed to provide opinion virtually and not in person, according to the police. The hospital was found to be underequipped to handle the kind of case load that they were accepting. A police submission to the court during the custody remand hearing of the doctor states that the hospital had one malfunctioning ventilator and 10 bipap machines. “A lot of patients started complaint that they did not have equipment even though the patients were told before admission that ventilators are available. There were complaints about inflated bills without explanation. The municipal corporation has sent him multiple notices and I had personally visited the hospital twice. But the complaints kept coming in even after all the warnings. The hospital was served with a notice for permit cancellation, and the permit was eventually cancelled,” said Kapadnis. “The main reason behind the hospital landing on our radar is that the administration refused to send all their bills for audit, as the hospital was required to. Then it was seen that final year students and homeopathy students were working there,” said Dr Sunil Ambole, head of SKMC health department. The police have recorded statements from the doctors working there, nursing staff, and at least 10 relatives of patients who have died, according to investigating office Police inspector Shashikant Chavan. A case under Sections 304, 420, 406, 425, 427, 465, 470, 471, 201, 380, 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 51(b) of the National Disaster Management Act has been registered at Mahatma Gandhi police station in Miraj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/plastic-surgeon-in-custody-after-hospital-records-87-deaths-101624116809343.html

Ambika disclosed his decision through a letter. Ambika Chaudhary joined the BSP just before the assembly election in 2017. Chaudhary sent his resignation to BSP chief Mayawati on June 19. Explaining the reason for quitting the BSP, he wrote, “After joining the BSP in 2017, I served the party as a dedicated worker. Whenever the party gave me any responsibility, I fulfilled it with full dedication.” “After Lok Sabha Election 2019, no responsibility, small or big, was assigned to me in any meeting of the party. Due to this I find myself neglected in the party. On June 19, my son Anand was declared the candidate for the post of district panchayat president by the SP. In such a situation, before any question arises on my loyalty, I have already sent my resignation to BSP national president Bahan Kumari Mayawati,” Ambika wrote. It is believed that Ambika Chaudhary will now join the SP. Ambika worked very closely with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav when the latter was chief minister. He also had been minister in the SP government.

This, at a time, when lakhs of young Punjabis are searching for jobs,” said Chugh, adding that Amarinder had failed to keep his election manifesto promise of providing jobs to each family in the state. “Instead, he is making sure that family members of each Congress MLA get a job, which is highly condemnable and immoral,” he added. “If the Congress government is really sincere towards helping militancy-affected families, then Amarinder should have given jobs to 34,000-odd families that lost their kith and kin in the blood-soaked years of militancy,” he claimed, adding, “The CM has no feeling or sentiment for those families which suffered during militancy. His only concern is to grant favours to Congress MLAs so that his seat as the CM remains secure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bid-to-save-cm-seat-immoral-chugh-on-jobs-to-sons-of-mlas-101624115430172.html

The MLA has said the Rae Bareli police officials were reluctant registering FIR against him. The MLA confirmed that he had written the letter to the additional chief secretary (ACS), Home, on Saturday in connection with the harassment of one Kunwar Mohit Singh of Rae Bareli. He said he had asked the officials concerned to take cognizance of the victim’s complaint and register a criminal case against sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Singh for creating fake evidence after registering a fake criminal case against him. Sharing details, the complainant Kunwar Mohit Singh said the local officials of Rae Bareli district were reluctant in registering FIR against the sub-inspector even after he was found guilty in departmental enquiry conducted by an additional SP rank officer. He said the sub-inspector was recently transferred to Bareilly zone citing the same reason. He said the sub-inspector was a repeated offender as he was also a key accused in fake encounter of four youths in Badohi in which cops had claimed to gun down mafioso Dhananjay Singh on October 17, 1998 before he joined politics. He said the sub-inspector was even charge-sheeted in the matter and the case was pending in court. The complainant said the sub-inspector had registered the fake case of criminal breach of trust and fraud against him in December 2016 at the behest of a land mafia who wanted to grab his parental property. He said the sub-inspector had been harassing him for the past six years and helped the land mafia to get register several cases against him but every time he was given a clean chit on the basis of evidence. Rae Bareli superintendent of police (SP) Shlok Kumar said the sub-inspector had been relieved from Rae Bareli after he was transferred to Bareilly on June 4 on the same complaint of harassing the complainant by creating fake evidence against him in a case of criminal breach of trust and fraud. The SP said he was not aware whether or not the complainant had given any written complaint to register FIR against the sub-inspector. Another Rae Bareli police official confirmed receiving the complaint to register FIR against the sub-inspector and said senior officials had sought legal opinion in the matter. He said the senior officials were initially reluctant in registering an FIR against the sub-inspector citing his act as negligence and not a criminal offence. The sub-inspector could not be contacted despite multiple efforts. Sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Singh, however, denied all allegations and said that his investigation was based entirely on land revenue records made available to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-mla-writes-to-home-dept-for-fir-against-indicted-subinspector-101624115249357.html
19-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP may also challenge poll results in some seats, says Bengal’s Dilip Ghosh||KOLKATA: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may file election petitions to challenge election results of seats lost by its candidates by a wafer-thin margin, the party’s state president Dilip Ghosh said on Saturday, days after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and four Trinamool Congress leaders filed similar petitions in the Calcutta high court.“Our legal cell is exploring all options and where the petition could be filed. We are also planning to file Election Petitions. We have identified the seats. Our lawyers are taking preparations,” said Dilip Ghosh.Mamata Banerjee, who lost the fiercely fought battle in Nandigram to the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari in May, had announced her decision to file the petition minutes after the Election Commission rejected her request for a recount after declaring her defeat.Also Read: Judge hearing Nandigram poll verdict plea close to BJP: TMCShe filed her petition on Thursday. The following day, four more Trinamool Congress candidates filed their petitions against the results declared in Balarampur, Goghat, Moyna and Bongaon Dakshin constituencies, four of the 77 seats that had gone to the BJP.Ghosh first hinted at the BJP’s plan to challenge the election results on Friday when he underlined that the option exercised by the Trinamool Congress was open to the BJP also.“The chief minister lost from Nandigram. When counting was going on TMC agents were present and after every round they signed the results. But even after that the TMC moved court. They have the right. We would all have to abide by the court orders. In the same way we can also move court. There are certain seats which the BJP lost by a narrow margin. Let the court decide,” Ghosh told reporters on Friday.Bengal minister and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim said the BJP was afraid that if elections were held again on the seats lost by the Trinamool candidates, their tally in the assembly would dip.“They had set a target of 200 seats and suffered a humiliating defeat (with 77 seats). There are apprehensions that they (BJP) may lose by a bigger margin (if elections are again held in those seats),” said Firhad Hakim.To be sure, the BJP’s performance, irrespective of its ambitious target of 200 seats, won just three seats and a 10.2% vote share in the previous 2016 assembly elections. In the 2021 elections, the BJP ended up with a 38% vote share, just 10 percentage points less than the Trinamool’s 48%.The BJP has, after the election results, kept up the pressure on the Mamata Banerjee government over the law and order situation in the state, particularly over violence that the opposition party insists was directed at its cadre.The alleged deterioration of the law and order in Bengal is a point that has been repeatedly articulated by Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar as well. On Saturday, Dhankhar, who is in Delhi, fired another round at the state government.“We cannot compromise with democracy, Constitution and rule-of-law. I am sure everyone will listen to my voice and rise to the occasion to try and wipe the tears of those families and people who had to leave their houses, whose near and dear ones have been killed, injured, whose houses have been subjected to arson and loot. We cannot live in a democracy if people, in order to live in their own house and run their own small business, have to pay an extortion fee,” Dhankhar said in Delhi.Dhankhar, who has been in Delhi since Wednesday, has met Union home minister Amit Shah at least twice apart from meetings with President Ram Nath Kovind, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and other Union ministers.The Trinamool Congress, which has accused the governor of promoting the BJP’s agenda, called Dhankhar’s attack “wild allegations to malign the state”. “The BJP is not being able to digest the humiliating defeat in the assembly elections and has now resorted to some dirty tricks and conspiracy. The governor is a part of it. It is a mystery whether the governor is running from door-to-door in Delhi to save his own chair or to hatch the next step of the conspiracy,” said TMC spokesperson and Bengal general secretary Kunal Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-may-also-challenge-poll-results-in-some-seats-says-bengal-s-dilip-ghosh-101624114109992.html

The department has given verbal direction to sarpanches to clear these bills after firms moved the Punjab and Haryana high court.Sarpanches, however, claim that department had carried out work in at least 65 villages under the MGNREGA, when its officials were administrators of villages from August 2018 to December 2018. Therefore, money should be paid from this head. The Centre funds all expenses under the MGNREGA.Sarpanches add that there were no panchayats in existence when the work was done, as the state government had appointed administrators after panchayats completed their term in August 2018. Moga deputy commissioner has asked rural department officials to scrutinise record after material procured for works did not figure in MGNREGA record.Amardeep Singh, husband of Tota Singh Wala village’s sarpanch, said, “The panchayat cannot pay ₹13 lakh. We did not sanction the work, then why should we pay to the firms?” Darshan Singh, sarpanch of Umeriana village, said, “Work was done under MGNREGA, but the administrator used ₹8 lakh from our panchayat funds. We met the block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) a few days ago. He verbally told us to pay the firm.” Harminder Singh, husband of Janer village’s sarpanch, said, “We have cleared the bills. The BDPO concerned told us that bills of material procurement had got tangled in red tape in Delhi. We were told that paying to firms from panchayat funds was the only option.” Resham Singh, husband of Amiwala village sarpanch, said, “We have made payments to firms that the BDPO asked us to.” Moga additional deputy commissioner (development) Subash Chander, said, “Work was carried out in villages and they have to clear the bill. How can we release payment when there is no record of work done under MGNREGA?“The administrators also worked on behalf of villages. We will clear bills, only if they give us proof that the work was done under MGNREGA,” the ADC added.Seema Jain, additional chief secretary of the department, did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/moga-panchayats-told-to-foot-bill-for-work-done-under-centre-s-mgnrega-101624112190124.html

19-06-2021||Lucknow||Like father, like offspring||Stepping into father’s shoes and making it big is what every youngster dream of! In today’s world of diverse fields and businesses children are following their own passion but there some who are taking up their father’s profession and making a name too. We spoke to a few like them, hailing from Lucknow. ENT specialist Dr Rohit Bhatia’s daughter Saumya and son Karan followed their parent’s medical profession. “Our main conversation since childhood was about patients and case discussion as my mother is also a doc. I was clear that I have to do something around medical dentistry, so I did my masters in oral surgery from London. My brother followed his footstep and also became an ENT surgeon,” says Dr Saumya. She was given a free choice but carried forward with medical line. “I share the same passion, reading habit and punctuality but by brother inherits more qualities of our father while I am a mix of both. He is very quick, crazy about work, stubborn like him besides being master in his field.” IT professional Matrika Gupta gave up her job to contribute to her father’s legacy. She came down from London to digitise their traditional business which dates back to 1805. “It was my dad’s vision and when I saw my IT expertise can benefit our business of Ram Asrey Sweets then I stepped in full-time and added modern nuances and digitally upgraded it. My younger sister Shambhavi is contributing as professional bakery chef while youngest sister Itishree pitches in IT and sales,” shares Matrika. She is proud that her parents never pressurised them and now the three daughters and youngest son Raghuvansh are proudly carrying the legacy forward. Principal St Teresa’s Day School, Peter Fanthome Jr feels for him every day is Father’s Day for him as his father Peter Fanthome Sr, former MLA, retired principal and school’s chairman, till date guides him in professional matters and in day-to-day life as well. “I have learnt everything from him. He stood by me as a friend, philosopher and guide. I follow all his parenting methods for my kids too. I can’t ever fit in his shoes because the way he has dedicated his life towards teaching and social causes, it will be impossible for me to match him.” Adding to that he says, “My father has always maintained a fine balance between professional and personal life even when he joined politics and lived a successful tenure. That’s what I need to learn from him still.”Renowned kathak exponent of Lucknow gharana, Manisha Mishra says, “It’s difficult to carry forward the legacy of my father, renowned tabla maestro Pt Ravinath Mishra, but still we three siblings have tried to imbibe all from the musical legend, who commendably brought forward his father’s legacy. We are trying our best to achieve even a bit of what he has, but we know his passion for music is without equal.” Her sister Manjusha is a classical singer while brother runs a performing arts institute in Bengaluru.The father-daughter duo practice together almost every day and now her son is trying his best to learn his grandfather’s craft. “It’s always a dream come true when we all children share stage with him and perform for all,” she adds. Pt Ravinath feels it’s his duty to pass on his craft to generations to come. “Not just my kids but all my students are my extended version and will lead on from whatever I have taught them,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/like-father-like-offspring-101624109323230.html
19-06-2021||Delhi||Just a call away! DU’s tele counselling helplines ring for students||After the second wave of Covid-19 brought the Capital to its knees, the Delhi University authorities realised how hard it was for the youngsters battling grief due to loss of their close ones, as well as encountering anxiety and uncertainties about their future. This spiralled the idea of introducing tele-counselling, for which teams at various levels have been set up to help the students handle doubts regarding future course of action, examination, Covid trauma, and even admission queries.While providing mental support to the students during these difficult times, five colleges — namely University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) and South Campus (UDSC), Gargi College, Maitreyi College, Miranda House and Janki Devi Memorial College — have been roped in to provide support via 28 helpline numbers, along with the Department of Clinical Psychology at Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences (IHBAS), in Delhi. “The helpline numbers (such as 9821067319, 9625242713, 8800185949) of multiple faculty members are given for different days and times, in different colleges. The responsibility to address varied student concerns has been divided among us; some are dealing with Covid-19 issues that students may have, while others are addressing examination concerns, result anxiety and more. Students are calling up to ask about whether there will be another round of exams for those who are unable to clear this semester. We are all trying our best to provide all the support that they need in troubled times like these,” says Rachna Jain, a faculty member at Maitreyi College.College professors who have volunteered to help the students say they are inundated with calls of students who are burdened with grief amid the pandemic. I’ve had my students call me to discuss family issues, relationship concerns and if they are stressed amid ongoing exams,” explains Indu Soni, a faculty at Janki Devi Memorial College. She adds: “We try to provide some relief to them since many students have lost their loved ones. If we feel the student needs additional support, we help connect them to the college counsellor as well as provide resources for any other need that they may have.”And the calls aren’t restricted to students of the colleges involved. The tele-counselling initiative is providing help to students across the university. Dr Meghna B Thakur, a faculty member at Bombay University, who has been asked to provide counselling by Miranda House, says, “I had given a few talks at the college, and was requested to help students as well as non-teaching staff at the university. I agreed to it because this is the bare minimum I can do to support youngsters who are witnessing unprecedented circumstances, which is testing them emotionally. Whether in Mumbai or Delhi, students are students, and many have been calling to express their concerns and voice their thoughts. Some are anxious about their results and future prospects.” She expresses concern, adding, “Such initiatives are the need of the hour across India because youngsters need all the emotional and psychological support they can get.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/just-a-call-away-du-s-tele-counselling-helplines-ring-for-students-101624109318969.html
19-06-2021||Pune||Take warning of Covid-19 third wave seriously: Maharashtra deputy CM to people||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday asked people not to lower their guard against Covid-19 in view of the possible third wave of the pandemic, and warned them against visiting tourist attractions in the present scenario just because restrictions have been eased.He said people need to take the warning about the third wave seriously.Pawar was talking to reporters here after holding a meeting with officials to review the coronavirus situation in Pune district.He also said that if people continue to go out of the district for tourism purposes, the administration will have no other option but to impose a 15-day quarantine regime on such people after their return home. Pune city is under level-II of the state government’s unlock plan. The coronavirus numbers are coming down, but as a preemptive measure, it has been decided that all the shops under the non-essential category, malls, hotels, and restaurants will remain closed on weekends, Pawar said. "This system will continue for the next Saturday and Sunday. After that, if the situation improves further, a decision regarding (lifting) the weekend restrictions will be taken after a review," he said. The deputy CM said that during the meeting, police officials and public representatives expressed concern over people heading to Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala and other tourist places in large numbers over the weekends."I don't understand why people are doing this. There is a need to take Covid-19 infection seriously. A lot of people have started going to tourist places out of the state; some go for trekking. If this continues, there will be no option but to quarantine people going out of the district for 15 days. We may have to issue such orders," he warned.On the possible third wave of the pandemic, Pawar said that it is around the corner in America, England and Africa. Despite a large-scale vaccination in America and England, the danger of the third wave still looms large there, he added.“Therefore, we need to take the (warning of) third wave very seriously as people’s health is of paramount importance," he added. Pawar also said that students who want to fly abroad, should get both the doses made by a single vaccine maker."Many countries are preferring vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO). While Covishield has been approved by the WHO, Covaxin is yet to get its nod. Many students, who have already got a Covaxin dose, are inquiring where they should get the second dose of a different vaccine- Covishield, as it is approved by WHO and because many countries prefer that. Our answer is no, as it is not been advised by the experts," he said. Pawar claimed that Bahirwadi in Purandar tehsil of Pune district has become the first village in the country to complete 100 per cent vaccination.He also talked about a survey conducted by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) on the Covid-19 deaths that occurred during the second wave. "As per the report, out of total deaths in the second wave that took place in four major hospitals of Pimpri Chichwad, 53 per cent deceased were below age 60, while 20 per cent were in the age group of 21 to 45,” he said. He advised the Pune Municipal Corporation to conduct a similar survey in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/take-warning-of-covid-19-third-wave-seriously-maharashtra-deputy-cm-to-people-101624107447834.html

According to the information given by MSRDC, 695.1099 hectares of land is to be acquired for the western part of the ring road and the measurement of 351.3024 hectares has been completed so far in 21 villages of a total of 37 affected villages in four tehsils. Also, the land acquisition for the Eastern part has begun. Officials have started to conduct the meetings in the affected villages.“We are positive to complete the land acquisition process in record time. The grievances of the locals are being addressed. Land measurement is an important part of the land acquisition process,” said Sandeep Patil sub-divisional engineer Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC)Private land from 37 villages belonging to four tehsils is to be acquired for the western part of the ring road and private land from 46 villages in five tehsils is to be acquired for the eastern part of the ring road. However, the land acquisition process has been facing hurdles due to resistance from the locals in some villages. Earlier, officials had completed the land measurement process for the western part in Ranje village (tehsil Bhor) in police protection owing to the opposition from the farmers. Objections have emerged from the farmers belonging to Khed tehsil who are losing their land in the Pune-Nashik railway project and for the ring road as well.“This problem has occurred with the farmers who own a small piece of land but their objections are being considered and appropriate compensation will be offered to them. We have also spoken to the Maharali officials. There will be compatible underpasses. So, locals will not face any problems. Currently, we have started conducting meetings with the locals in the eastern part and soon the land measurement process will begin,” said Patil.The Pune ring road is a proposed circular outer road for the Pune Metropolitan Region. Earlier this week, on being asked about the resistance from locals for the ring road project, Ajit Pawar deputy chief minister and guardian minister of Pune had said that dialogue is the key in resolving such conflicts. He had also emphasized the necessity of the ring road project. “I personally believe that the Ring road is necessary for PMC, PCMC, and the district’s population. If we consider the traffic in Pune city and suburbs, then the Ring road is planned by thinking for the next 50 years,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/despite-resistance-land-measurement-of-51-areas-for-western-ring-road-completed-101624107388977.html

19-06-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Tech as the broker in this direct sales op||Sujit Jain is a 43-year-old “compulsive entrepreneur”, who began riding the crest of the IT wave in the late 1990s, by opening a “small computer training institute in Pune.”That small institute as today grown into a direct-selling machine that claims numbers and growth that would not put a “buy-out” or IPO too far away.“Netsurf has always functioned as a debt-free, self-funded company and is not looking for PE funding on an immediate basis. We will offer the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) once Netsurf achieves a turnover of ₹2000 crore. I believe that it will help us to take a giant leap and take the direct selling business to another scale,” says founder Sujit Jain.The numbers (see graphic) speak growth. The business strategy on the other hand takes the direct selling model and leverages technology to offer rural sellers direct access to the urban landscape, and vice-versa.Netsurf Network was incepted in 2001, which hardly makes it a startup in the true sense of the word, however, the continuous evolving nature of the Netsurf business and the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, have meant that the startup hustle has never really stopped for Jain.Today, Netsurf Network direct sells herbal and organic products, personal care, cosmetics, home care, and its primary base from where it grew into the behemoth Jain claims it is today, agricultural goods. In the beginning…After completing his higher education from Symbiosis Institute of Management Studies in 2000, Jain was neither interested in on-campus placements like his peers, nor going into the family business heritage of jewellery, construction and legal advocacy. He aspired to open a small computer training institute in Pune. Setting off on his entrepreneurial journey, he developed a product that allowed a person with basic knowledge of computers to develop their own website. There was a key missing ingredient in Jain’s grand plans: funds. Realising this, Jain implemented the strategy of direct selling, by informing people about the software. It didn’t take long for Jain to connect with 80 direct sellers. By 2002, the number of direct sellers increased to 40,000 with the company achieving a 500-fold growth. This was the beginning of Netsurf Communications.Says Jain, “I was short on funds, but high on dreams and this was when our family friend, Sanjay Malpani, joined me and we, together, paved the way. In 2003, we acquired Ajay Bio-Tech, which was into manufacturing and research of organic farming products. Netsurf started distributing those products under the brand name Biofit, through their direct selling network. While the business operations kicked off from Pune, the network of direct sellers gradually spread across the rural regions of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh.”The Biofit USP is that of chemical-free farming, something Jain claims farmers were not aware of at the time.“Through our direct selling model, we made them aware of organic farming. The current Biofit range of products spans 11 agricultural products. Today, one million farmers are using Biofit products,” claims Jain.What does Biofit offer? The claim is “greater yield” and “a cut in expenditure on farming”. “Biofit contributes 60 per cent of the current Netsurf turnover,” says Jain.Fly high, and diversify In 2004, the household segment beckoned. Netsurf launched its health and wellness category, with “Naturamore”. Today the range consists of 10 nutraceuticals in the form of powders and capsules. The company established Netsurf Research Labs in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh. “Ninety percent of Netsurf products are manufactured by us and the composition is also developed by our R&D specialists. We also have a manufacturing unit in Pune and the sourcing of the materials is done from across India,” Jain explains. Herbs and More: Started with six Ayurvedic products; today, range consists of 30 productsRang De: Cosmetics line launched in 2019 While all of the success Netsurf has managed may well be because of the quality of its product line, it’s the direct selling business model that really enabled the sustainability.Like Netsurf’s training and support system for its direct sellers, established in 2007, by which time, the number of direct sellers in its network had reached the half a million mark. Netsurf also launched a personal care range under “Herbs and More”, to increase the participation of women in the business. In 2014, Netsurf launched its home care range, Clean & More, with two products. Jain drops all the right words while pushing his Clean & More line, “plant extracts”, “enzymes”, and “probiotics”. In 2014, Netsurf Communications made its first investment in F&B brand Woohoo. Jain is also an investor in Mylab Discovery Solutions, the company which developed India’s first indigenous testing kit for Covid-19. He now plans to acquire a fintech startup. However, it was not until 2015 that the company crossed the ₹100 crore turnover mark.All the healthcare products are approved by FSSAI. The personal care products are approved by the FDA. Organic farming products are approved by Ecocert. “Over and above the certifications, we regularly conduct the clinical trials, safety studies and field trials for our health care, personal care and organic farming products,” says Jain.All the products are formulated in-house and only 10% products are manufactured at the third party currently. A QC team is employed at the 3rd party manufacturing units.Covid-19 – turning crisis into opportunitySays Jain, “Our direct selling business helped generate employment opportunities even in the rural interiors, where the maximum population (and unemployment) resides. It provided a solution to socio-economic issues like migration of workers in the shadow of unemployment, large scale-layoffs, the new normal of work-from-home and the insecurity around jobs. Our business allowed people to earn supplementary income at minimum investment and risks, by spending a few flexible hours every week. Moreover, they could earn additional incentives working from home, and thereby, seek personal growth.”The tech-knowNetsurf developed its own captive e-commerce portal for direct sellers (e-tailers) who have opted for an online retail model of the business plan. It’s a completely screen-to-screen model indigenised by the tech team of Netsurf, wherein direct sellers merely need to send their customised e-commerce link to the prospective consumers. It is a convenient model as it involves no capital blockage, and shipment and logistics is handled by the company. Direct sellers get their retail profits directly credited to their account. Jain explains, “We also have a comprehensive mobile app which enables direct sellers to retail Netsurf products in their social circle. Netsurf Mobile app is loaded with content for sellers allowing promotion on Netsurf products on respective social media handles. Our direct sellers are adapting to the tech-based changes, especially the 20 to 35 age group.”The Netsurf app currently is at 0.65 million downloads and accounts for 45% of the business generated.Business expansion and future plansNetsurf has five captive manufacturing facilities located in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh, with a total staff strength of 500. These facilities undertake the manufacturing of Netsurf’s products. Raw material is sourced from various states of India, and a few are imported.Jain said, “Organic fish farming practices. It will be sub-categorised under Biofit and will be called Biofit Aqua, an exclusive range of products that provides quality nutrition to fishes, shrimps, prawns, and crabs. These products do not contain any chemicals, pesticides, antibiotic, or hormones. It also ensures optimum quality and purity of water without damaging the environment. Organic fish farming practices ensure that we produce healthy, disease-free natural fish food. It also helps safeguard the environment from the adverse impact of harmful conventional Fish Farming methods.”What vendors sayUsha Bhanushali from Maharashtra said, “I come from a traditional MLM business background and started my journey as a consumer of Netsurf’s products initially in 2014. I became successful within a span of 4 years and was blessed with the title of a ‘self-styled entrepreneur’ at Netsurf Network. I have mentored over 30,000 Asmita’s (female) direct sellers which today form an integral part of my network. I believe that the reward and recognition systems along with additional income avenues at Netsurf played an important role in me reaching greater heights of success at Netsurf Network.”Amway, Herbalife, and Modicare are some of Netsurf’s main competitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-tech-as-the-broker-in-this-direct-sales-op-101624100249465.html

19-06-2021||Patna||Bihar govt obliged to fight ‘infodemic’, provide accurate death figures: High Court||The Bihar government is obliged to fight the “infodemic”, the Patna high court has said while pulling it up for its reluctance to put in the public domain the number of Covid-19 related deaths over the last year in the state.The court underlined transparency is the hallmark of good governance. “...the resistance is uncalled for, as such action is neither protected by any law nor in consonance with settled principles of good governance,” the court said in an order uploaded on Friday. It asked the government to correct its “myopic approach” and added it needs a reminder that “to cover with the veil of secrecy, the common routine business, is not in the interest of the public”. The court added such secrecy can seldom be legitimately desired.Bihar revised its Covid-19 toll from the second wave this month by adding 3,951 deaths. This marked an increase of 72.8%. The government attributed the increase in fatalities to earlier unaccounted ones at private hospitals, homes and due to post-disease complications. It undertook a 20-day exercise to audit Covid-19 deaths after the high court flagged irregularities in death figures in Buxar district on May 17. After verification, the state’s Covid-19 cumulative toll jumped to 9,375 on June 8, as against 5,424 reported a day earlier.The court flagged inconsistency in death figures in Buxar district after affidavits filed by the state’s chief secretary and Patna divisional commissioner differed. The judges asked the government to verify facts from all sources before placing them in court. The court heard the case after at least 80 bodies were discovered floating in the Ganga in Buxar.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar, in the order uploaded on Friday, cited the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, and also the Right to Information Act, 2005. It added the people have the right to “almost unequivocal terms of their access to information”.“It is needless to say that private information of deceased individuals will still be protected under the Right to Privacy read into Article 21 of the Constitution but has to be balanced with ‘General public awareness’ and information dissemination,” the court said.The court said the right to information is a fundamental right as recognised by the Supreme Court. It added the Bihar government is under obligation to provide information on the number of deaths for whatever reason during the pandemic.The court said the annual reports that are to be uploaded on the internet have not been since 2018. It added this should be carried out within the next two months.The court said the state is obligated to provide accurate information, fight the “infodemic” and heal the systemic neglect. “The Government of Bihar shall take all necessary action for sensitizing the general public, especially in the rural areas, of their Constitutional and Statutory right of uploading and obtaining information on the digital portal,” it said.The court said the chief secretary, the additional chief secretary, or development commissioner shall forthwith convene a meeting of all concerned and ensure compliance to the order.The bench said the number of deaths the government reported during the second wave of Covid-19 were incorrect. It cited the government’s affidavit dated June 10 and added it put the toll from the pandemic in the state at 9,375 and not 5424.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-obliged-to-fight-infodemic-provide-accurate-death-figures-high-court-101624097249126.html

He, along with the education minister, has been the members of the selection committee. Once the scheduled of the meeting is finalised, members will sit together to review the applications,” Rajkumar, social welfare director and member secretary of the selection committee, said. The social welfare department, which invited entries for these posts, has received around 200 applications for vacant positions. The selection committee which has been created by the department will soon be holding a meeting for the scrutiny and screening of the entries.The state women commission has been without a chairperson and the panel of members since November 2020. The three-year term of the chairperson and members lasted till October 31, 2020.Once there will be a consensus over the names, the tentative list of candidates will be forwarded to the government for approval, Rajkumar added.The official said that posts in the women commission would have been filled much earlier “but the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown delayed things,” he said.Meena Tiwari, the All India Progressive Women’s Association general secretary, said for the last seven months the state women commission has been without the chairperson and panel members. “Imagine the situation of women who have been the victims of physical or mental violence. How helpless they must be feeling in this situation,” she said.Not less than 20,000 cases must be pending here as the state commission, which earlier used to receive cases related to women through the post only, started receiving applications online also just before the expiry of the last panel of members, she added. “Not surprisingly, even those women who could have registered the case at the commission office must have tried registering cases online,” she said. Members were also receiving cases on WhatsApp, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/200-apply-for-vacant-posts-at-state-women-commission-in-bihar-101624095148902.html

Civil surgeons in all the districts were asked to report fresh confirmed and suspected cases of mucormycosis to the IDSP."We are keeping a vigil on the situation and all hospitals have been asked to report any case on an urgent basis. We have asked for providing proper treatment to such patients," a health official said.Ranchi has reported the highest number of cases at 46, of which 29 are confirmed and 17 are suspected, while eight patients have died.Of the 21 cases reported in East Singhbhum, 18 have been confirmed while five patients have died, Shukla said.Other districts that reported a high number of mucormycosis cases are Hazaribag (10), Garhwa (eight), Ramgarh (seven) and Giridih and Palamu (six each).Most of the patients are being treated at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi, and Tata Memorial Hospital and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital in Jamshedpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-on-high-alert-as-mucormycosis-cases-rise-101624093456070.html

As per our knowledge, it is the heaviest baby ever born in Assam to date. The average weight of newborns in Assam is around 2.5 kilograms. There were newborns weighing around 4 kilograms in past but 5.2 kilograms for a newborn is a unique case. We have discussed with our senior officials and they also agreed with us,” said Dr Hanif Md. Afsar Alam Laskar of Satindra Mohan Dev Civil Hospital. A team of senior doctors at the government hospital performed the caesarean section procedure on Tuesday afternoon. This is the second child of Jaya Das and Badal Das, their first child weighed around 3.8 kilograms during birth. Doctors at Satindra Mohan Dev Civil Hospital, Silchar of Cachar district, claim that the baby was the heaviest child ever born in Assam. Dr Hanif Md. Afsar Alam Laskar, assisted by nurse Roselyn, Manjarul and anaesthetist Dr Rajat Deb, performed the caesarean operation on Jaya Das at Silchar civil hospital. Dr Laskar said the family delayed the process fearing Covid-19 infection. “In most of the cases, babies arrive between 38th and 42nd week of pregnancy. When babies don’t arrive by week 42, they are considered post-term or delayed delivery. In this case, the mother’s admission to the hospital was delayed. Her delivery date was due on May 29 but she wasn’t admitted at that time because her family was hesitant to go to hospitals amid the pandemic. Thankfully we managed to save the mother and the newborn.”Badal Das, father of the newborn said, “This is our second child, the first one weighed around 4 kilograms. But that was a different time, today covid infected patients are being treated in every hospital. I was a bit hesitant about taking my pregnant wife to a government hospital but finally, we had to take the decision to take her to the hospital. Thankfully, doctors have saved my wife and the child.”Initially, the family was advised to go to Silchar Medical College and Hospital but they decided against it because of many Covid-19 patients in the hospital. Hospital authorities have requested everyone to reach out to them on time even if the pregnant mother is Covid-19 positive. There were several cases when the mother was Covid-19 infected but the doctors did not hesitate in performing the cesarean operation for the delivery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-baby-weighs-5-2-kgs-at-birth-doctors-call-it-state-record-101624092448874.html
19-06-2021||Bhopal||MP lawyer, jailed for sending ‘indecent’ birthday message to judge, gets bail||A lawyer, who was in jail for the last four months for sending an "indecent" birthday message to a woman judge, has been granted bail by the Madhya Pradesh High Court. If he is found to approach the judge directly or indirectly or tries to stalk her, the bail order shall stand cancelled, the Indore bench of the court said.Justice Subodh Abhyankar passed the order during a virtual hearing of Yadav’s second bail application. On April 27, the high court dismissed his first bail application.The lawyer - Vijay Singh Yadav - allegedly downloaded a photo of the judge from her Facebook account and used it to make a greeting card which he then sent to her on her official email address on January 29. He was arrested on February 9.Ratlam Police booked the lawyer under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forging documents) and others of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides relevant sections of the IT act on a complaint lodged by a district court official, according to news agency PTI."The application filed by the applicant (lawyer) is allowed, subject to the condition that if it is found that the applicant in any manner directly or indirectly tried to approach the concerned judge (the victim) and tries to stalk her in any manner, this order shall stand cancelled without further reference to the court and the police shall be entitled to arrest the applicant in the present case,” the high court said, according to news agency PTI on Saturday.Meanwhile, Yadav's counsel KK Gupta said that since his client does not have a criminal background, is a lawyer, has undertaken that he would never try to approach the concerned judge and would not practice in her court in the future and has tendered an unconditional apology, his bail application should not be rejected. State's counsel Kushagra Jain opposed Yadav's bail plea in view of his "conduct”. However, after hearing the applicant and the respondent, the court allowed Yadav’s bail application on a personal bond of ₹50,000.“Having considered the rival submissions, on perusal of the case diary including the message sent by the applicant, this court is of the considered opinion that since the charge sheet has already been filed and the applicant in jail since February 9, 2021, he has also tendered unconditional apology and the final conclusion of the trial is likely to take sufficient long time due to fresh spread of Covid-19, in the considered opinion of this court, the applicant's application deserves to be allowed,” the court said, according to PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-lawyer-jailed-for-sending-indecent-birthday-message-to-judge-gets-bail-101624087195282.html

From the figures, it is clear that the Odisha government has tried to suppress the Covid death numbers to protect its image,” Congress leader and activist Nishikanta Mishra said in his petition.Mishra, in his PIL before the HC, prayed for a special audit of the number of deaths in the state due to Covid-19 infections. He cited news reports and claimed that deaths were being underreported in official statistics.Of the 3,508 deaths recorded in Odisha till now, a little more than 1,870 were reported in the first wave till the end of December last year. In the second wave, which started in mid-April, there were over 1,600 deaths in just 2 months making it more severe than the first wave.Mishra, in his petition, said that anecdotal evidence suggested underreporting of Covid-19 related deaths. Though officially the death toll stood at 133 in April, enquiries with various Covid hospitals and district authorities suggested many more people died due to the Covid-19 infection in the state.Also read: ‘Ensure Covid-19 norms, don’t grow complacent’ - Centre to states as cases dropMishra said he visited the Satichoura crematorium in Cuttack on April 25 and found that the workers there were too busy in cremation. Citing an article published in The Hindustan Times on May 6 about the real picture of Covid-19 deaths in the state, Mishra said at least 44 bodies were cremated on a single day there while as per the government report only 3 patients died in Cuttack that day.Mishra said in western Odisha district of Nuapada, the test positively rate in April was consistently around 35% (which means one out of every three persons tested positive for the infection), the official death toll was just 4. But districts said 82 deaths were reported from the Covid hospitals. He also cited the case of Nayagarh chief district medical officer reporting 97 deaths in the second wave while the state government said only 14 people died.“In my petition, I have highlighted that despite all tall claims made by the state government, so far only 1.3 crore people have been tested for Covid-19, which is quite less. The situation is worse in rural pockets of the state where Covid testing is almost negligible,” he said.Last week, Congress in Odisha had accused the ruling-BJD of hiding data about Covid-19 deaths and demanded making the ‘actual data’ public. Congress leader Sudarsan Das said information obtained through RTI showed that around 1,288 bodies were cremated at the Satya Nagar crematorium of Bhubaneswar in September 2020, while the government report said only 342 bodies were cremated.“During this Covid pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of fatalities due to Coronavirus but the government is hiding the fact. The state government is denying the deaths due to Covid-19 infection,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-activist-moves-hc-seeking-special-audit-of-covid-19-deaths-101624087711940.html

19-06-2021||Delhi||DU teachers and aspirants raise concerns over CUCET||With the possibility of a common entrance exam for admissions to undergraduate courses at Delhi University (DU) this year, teachers and aspirants have raised concerns over the new format, saying it will disadvantage students from the marginalised and rural backgrounds and those opting for a stream change.Last year, the Union education ministry constituted a committee to look into modalities for the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admissions to all undergraduate (UG) courses at central universities in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. While the committee has submitted its report and the ministry is yet to come out with a final decision on whether it would be implemented this year or not, DU teachers have expressed concerns over the matter.Former DU executive council member Rajesh Jha said that introducing a new mode of entrance test without giving aspirants time to familiarise themselves with the syllabus or the paper pattern may disadvantage those students who don’t have uninterrupted access to learning material.“Cancellation of board exams has given way to demands for CUCET so that some form of an exam is conducted for admissions to UG courses in DU. But we should not implement anything without proper consultation with the university’s academic council and other statutory bodies. There have been several research reports documenting centralised tests such as CUCET have favoured people from affluent backgrounds who have access to better study material and we need an inclusive admission policy,” he said.Several aspirants have been writing to teachers and officials at DU requesting them to look into the matter and form an inclusive admission policy. On Thursday, a group of Class 12 students from across the country also wrote to DU’s acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi on the matter.“The proposed format in the existing CUCET exams contains a subject-specific exam. On the other hand, universities like DU have courses that are open for students who have not studied the subject [in Class 12] before allowing changing of streams. There were no restrictions in choosing the subjects for graduation. But if one aspires to pursue a subject which s/he didn’t learn in class 11 and 12, then such group of students will face problems in competing in the entrance exams where there is a subject-specific test,” the students wrote in the letter.Tisha Mondal, a Class 12 student from a private school in Bengaluru who is a part of the group, said, “We don’t have issues with CUCET as it is a great alternative for merit-based admissions. But it had to be announced earlier. It is already mid-June and it is likely that the exams will be conducted in July or August. We don’t even have the time to collect resources, practice mock papers, and it is more difficult for those who are changing their streams for their undergraduate exam. Online coaching classes have already started for CUCET and those with high-internet access already have an edge over others.”Another Class 12 student. Tanisha Pathak, who is from Haldwani in Uttarakhand, said, “We still have no idea as to how in case of an integrated exam DU is going to address this issue. If DU adopts the same eligibility criteria as the other Central Universities, then it would simply restrict students from joining these courses. Moreover, conducting CUCET will contradict the NEP, which freely allows students to switch streams.”Vishal Shrivas, a resident of Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh, said his younger brother wanted to apply for Delhi University this year but the possibility of CUCET has left him worried.“Students in our district are used to appearing for offline papers. They are not used to online tests conducted in computer centres, which is the likely format for CUCET. ...with the pandemic, offline learning options are few and resource gathering will also be scarce. Students with little to no internet access will suffer,” he said.Joshi said the CUCET committee has taken all these considerations into account while preparing the report. “There has been no final decision on the entrance exams yet and whenever that happens, these concerns will be taken into account. There is no need for unfounded fear and aspirants will be provided reasonable time and syllabus for the test. It is premature to worry about this right now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-teachers-and-aspirants-raise-concerns-over-cucet-101624086148836.html

Papanna, a resident of Ammatti Karmadu village, severed his right leg near the ankle and was rushed by his family to a government hospital in Madikeri in a critical condition, Prajavani reported on Saturday.Prajavani said Papanna, an addict, went under severe depression for not being able to fulfill his urge for liquor. He was also facing financial difficulty as he wasn't getting work as a percussionist. He used to play in weddings and religious ceremonies.According to the newspaper, neighbours said he used to quarrel with his mother and other family members when they did not give him money to buy alcohol. Nanjappa, a neighbour, said that he spent most of his earnings on liquor.As a result of the lockdown, religious and wedding ceremonies in the Kodagu district are not being allowed, affecting percussionists' livelihood in the last two months. Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa announced a Covid relief package worth ₹1250 crore in May, aimed at helping people whose livelihood and income was severely affected by the pandemic.The relief was meant for people in the low-income bracket, comprising floriculturists, artisans, labourers, artists, domestic help, taxi, auto-rickshaw drivers, domestic workers and other categories of workers. The funds were channelised through the deputy commissioners of the districts under the social welfare account head. Artists and art troupes were provided a one-time compensation of ₹3,000 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-man-cuts-off-leg-for-not-getting-alcohol-in-critical-condition-101624083022537.html

Apart from the servitors, police personnel and temple officials involved in the Ratha Jatra arrangements will also be tested. The focus will be on the servitors who will pull the three chariots in view of the Covid-19 restrictions,” said Dr Kumar.Kumar, who headed a meeting in this regard, said the testing will be done in four stages - before Snana Yatra, before Gundicha Yatra, before Bahuda Yatra and finally, 15 days after Niladri Bije. The Ratha Jatra is scheduled for July 11.Considered as part and parcel of the social, religious and cultural ethos of the people of Odisha, the Ratha Jatra is one of the main festivals of Odisha that commemorates the annual journey of Lord Jagannath and his siblings from the 12th century Jagannath temple to their aunt’s abode in Gundicha temple, 2.5 kilometres away in Puri town.During the Ratha Jatra, a million devotees come to Puri town believing that they would attain salvation by touching the ropes attached to the 3 chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra. After staying in Gundicha temple for 9 days, the three deities come back to Jagannath Temple on the 10th day in a return journey called “Bahuda Yatra”.The SJTA chief administrator said a nodal officer will be appointed by the SJTA, Puri district administration and the CDMO office for close coordination on a day-to-day basis. An adequate number of masks would be distributed among the servitors during Snana Jatra and Ratha Jatra. To promote hand hygiene like last year, sanitisers would be distributed amongst families of servitors. Meetings will be held with members of various Nijogs to sensitize the servitors on do’s and don’ts to be followed during the conduct of the rituals.Earlier this month, the state government said that the Ratha Jatra will be held on July 11 without the presence of devotees as per the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court last year. After refusing to allow it, the apex court, last year, permitted the Rath Yatra to happen on the condition that there is no public attendance and all entry points into Puri will remain closed. The state government said each chariot would not be pulled by more than 500 persons and social distancing should be maintained as far as possible.However, the state government’s decision to stop Ratha Jatras in other towns of Odisha amid the pandemic has been opposed by political parties and local people.The Kendrapara district unit of BJP on Friday requested the Odisha government and the Centre to take necessary steps to allow the conduct of the upcoming Rath Yatra at Baladevjew temple in Kendrapara town. A team of the Kendrapara BJP staged a protest in front of the office of the district collector and before the temple seeking fulfilment of their demands. The party workers and leaders also demonstrated in front of the offices of all the Tehsildars.The Kendrapara district unit of BJP on Friday requested the Odisha government and the Centre to take necessary steps to allow the conduct of the upcoming Rath Yatra dedicated to the Siddha Baladevjew in Kendrapara. The national vice president of the BJP, Baijayant Panda, also demanded that the government should take all necessary steps as there are a lot of similarities in the rituals, religious practices between the shrine of Siddha Baladevjew and Puri Jagannath temple.On Thursday, people in Baripada town demanded permission to conduct Ratha Jatra at Haribaldev Jew temple in Baripada, also known as Dwitiya Sreekhetra, the second most important shrine of Lord Jagannath after Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-to-conduct-rt-pcr-tests-on-servitors-four-times-ahead-of-rath-jatra-101624080568743.html
19-06-2021||Other||Assam govt to provide incentive, waive off options for microfinance loans||The Assam government on Friday decided to provide ‘incentive’ as well as ‘waive off’ options to over 2 million women across the state who had taken loans from microfinance companies, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.“For those who have been repaying their loans regularly, the government would pay them a certain amount as an incentive, which they can use to repay their loans or use for other purposes,” said Sarma.The CM said that the move is aimed at keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party’s poll promise of waiving off microfinance loans. He said the government has formed three categories of borrowers. The first is those who have been repaying their loans regularly, the second who haven’t paid interest and instalments in the past two, three months following assurances of waiver by the government, and third of those who have not been repaying their loans for a long time and don’t have the ability to do so. “For the second category, we will repay their overdue instalments and also provide them with incentive. The third category would be those who can’t repay or don’t want to avail the incentives. We will waive off their entire loan amounts. But there would be certain conditions for this category as waivers will be only for those who are poor and needy,” he added. Sarma said that while the total amount of microfinance loans was ₹12,500 crore, it has now come down to ₹8,250 crore after discussions with microfinance companies in the past weeks. “The decrease is due to some Reserve Bank of India (RBI) norms not followed by these microfinance companies like loans exceeding ₹1.25 lakh for one borrower and more than three loans provided to one borrower by different companies,” he said. “The companies have assured that they will address those anomalies at their end. Anyone who has taken loans worth more than ₹1.25 lakh won’t have to repay the excess amount and those who have taken more than three loans don’t have to repay the fourth and the subsequent loans,” he added. Soon after taking charge in May, Sarma constituted a committee on waiving off microfinance loans. The report submitted by the committee listed many conditions on the waiver, including the exclusion of borrowers with an annual income of over ₹1 lakh and those owning four-wheelers.The committee’s report had led to protests by several women groups across the state that accused the government of reneging on its poll promise and demanded that loans of all borrowers should be waived off without any conditions. On Friday, Sarma informed that the government’s move would benefit around 2.2 million women borrowers. He said details on the incentives and waiver will be taken by the cabinet in the next two weeks. The CM said that The Assam Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Moneylending) Act, 2020, which seeks to regulate microfinance institutions, passed by the previous government, has been endorsed by the Governor. “In his election speeches, Himanta Biswa Sarma promised to waive off microfinance loans of all women borrowers. But within a month of coming to power on that promise, the government has taken a U-turn on it,” said Assam Congress president Ripun Bora. “The conditions imposed by the government on waiver of loans are such that most borrowers would be left out. Now, women across the state are coming out spontaneously in protest against these conditions,” he added. Those with more children won’t get benefits “In the coming years, the government won’t provide benefits of government schemes and loan waivers to those who have more children as per the provisions of the state population policy. However, those from SC, ST and tea-tribe communities would be exempted from this condition,” Sarma said. “Gradually, population norms will apply on schemes. Initially, it would be for those who have more than 5 or 6 children, but that would be brought down every year and finally, only those who have two children will be able to benefit from government schemes,” he added. The Population and Women Empower Policy of Assam, 2017 disallows those having more than two children from contesting panchayat and civic body polls and also provides incentives and disincentives to those people who have more than two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-govt-to-provide-incentive-waive-off-options-for-microfinance-loans-101624076908543.html

19-06-2021||Delhi||As inflation spirals, Delhi government hikes dearness allowance||The Delhi government on Friday increased the dearness allowance for workers in scheduled employment, a move that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said will help workers and labourers cope with spiralling inflation.The new rates will be effective from April 1 this year, which means all such workers will get arrears.After the increase in dearness allowance, the revised monthly wages for unskilled labourers has been increased from ₹15,492 to ₹15,908. For semi-skilled labourers, from ₹17,069 to ₹17,537, and for skilled labourers, from ₹18,797 to ₹19,291.For clerical and supervisory staff, the minimum wage has been enhanced from ₹17,069 to ₹ 17,537 per month for non-matriculates, from ₹18,797 to ₹19,291 for workers who are matriculates but not graduates, and from ₹20,430 to ₹20,976 for graduates and above.“These steps have been taken in the interest of the poor and working class, who have suffered disproportionately due to the current pandemic. This shall also benefit those in clerical and supervisory jobs,” Sisodia said.He said people in the unorganised sector employed on minimum wages should not be deprived of dearness allowance.Retail inflation in the country rose to 6.3% in May from 4.23% in April, propelled by an increase in both food and core inflation.This is the second time the Delhi government has increased dearness allowance for workers during the pandemic.In December last year, Sisodia issued a similar order and the revised wages (the existing rate as on date) were applied retrospectively from October 1, 2020.On Friday, the deputy chief minister said, “Although we have had to cut down on expenditure, this decision has been taken keeping in mind the interests of our working class. Every section of the society has been adversely affected due to the pandemic. Adding to the woes of the masses is the soaring prices of daily essentials such as oil and pulses. I hope that this increase in wages will provide some relief to our labour brethren.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-inflation-spirals-delhi-government-hikes-dearness-allowance-101624059672984.html

In such a situation, the government should think of a solution,” said a resident from the village who did not wish to be named.At a press meet in Delhi on Friday, activists and lawyers backed the demand.Nirmal Gorana, the general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha that works with the residents said, “The situation in the village is tense after the suicide (referring to a 70-year-old man who died on Wednesday, following which residents pelted stones at the police). There are many other people who are talking about taking similar steps. The Supreme Court’s order should be followed but the administration must think of a rehabilitation plan on humanitarian grounds.”Human rights activist and the residents’ lawyer in the apex court, Colin Gonsalves, said, “If Khori village has encroached on forest land, then the same applies to the hotels and farmhouses situated next to the village. Displacement during a global pandemic is not justified with such blatant inequality.”The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Haryana government, for a second time, to clear all encroachments on Aravalli land in Faridabad by July 19. It refused residents’ request to not demolish homes.A senior Faridabad district official said, “The Supreme Court’s orders will be strictly followed but we are looking into the demands of the residents and steps will be taken accordingly.”On Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also told the district administration to find a rehabilitation option.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/resettle-us-on-humanitarian-grounds-khori-gaon-residents-appeal-to-authorities-101624059142469.html

While displaying “Save the saviours” placards, the doctors demanded implementation of the Central Hospital and Healthcare Professionals Protection Act along with Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) sections.However, health services across hospitals were not disrupted during the protest. “We have sent a written request to the Prime Minister to implement this law. Private health sector, specially small and medium health establishments, is providing 75% services to the citizens and they are more subjected to violence and attacks. Besides physical assaults, doctors are increasingly coming under mental and psychological assaults by patients and their relatives,” said Dr Virender Kappal, state president, IMA Chandigarh.Dr RS Sethi, former national vice-president, IMA, said, “Mostly due to financial burden, patients and their families attack the doctors. Young doctors are now showing reluctance in undertaking emergencies because of fear of violence. We urge people to go for family insurance to avoid extra expenses, which ultimately lead to assaults.”Around 1,300 senior and junior resident doctors of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) wore black badges and ribbons to show their support to the healthcare workers. “We stand with the doctors of our country. Medical professionals, who are saving lives during the pandemic, must be saved from the assaults,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, member of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD), PGIMER.Meanwhile, not many doctors at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, were seen wearing black badges to observe protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-doctors-observe-black-day-to-protest-assaults-on-medics-101624052487472.html

The 22-year-old bowler might not have been included in the Shikhar Dhawan-led Indian team for Sri Lanka tour starting July 13 but he has made it to the net bowlers’ list, along with Ishan Porel, Sandeep Warrier, Sai Kishore and Simarjeet Singh for the ODI and T20 series. And the best part about this selection according to him would be to be around coach Rahul Dravid and chewing his brain.Dravid, who has been mentoring young cricketers in the recent years, has also played a significant role in fine-tuning Singh’s bowling while he played for India U-19 team and also attended camps at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. Looking forward to regrouping with Dravid after the U-19 World Cup in 2018 in New Zealand, this is what Singh said, “Dravid sir had been exceptional when I played for India U-19 team way back in 2017 and 2018. The way he inspired and backed the cricketers showed his class and expertise. So many cricketers of that batch are now either in the Indian team or knocking at the door of Indian team. I am so excited to be bowling with Dravid sir in attendance during the net sessions. I am going to ask him many questions and also take his valuable feedback.” Both Porel and Singh were part of India’s victorious U-19 World Cup campaign in 2018 under captain Prithvi Shaw and coach Dravid.Singh, who made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut for Punjab Kings in 2019, had successful 2020 and 2021 stints for his franchise making a long-lasting impression with his bowling, especially in the death-overs. Singh has been rewarded for picking 19 wickets in 17 IPL matches at an average and strike rate of 25.11 and 16.79 respectively. He showed his bowling prowess in IPL 14, taking the responsibility of bowling at crucial junctures and providing breakthroughs. Singh starred in the thrilling win over Rajasthan Royals in their season opener, bowling the final over of the game and dismissing in-form Sanju Samson.“When one is bowling to the likes of Chris Gayle and KL Rahul in the nets and has a coach like Anil Kumble, one is going to improve and get better with each game. Then there was Mohammed Shami for inputs from the other bowling end. Also, the time I got to work on my fitness in the lockdown last season helped me perform well in both 2020 and 2021 IPLs. I am going to use all my experience of being around senior cricketers like Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar,” felt Singh, who is Punjab’s strike-bowler along with Siddharth Kaul. “I want to continue bowling well for Punjab Kings when IPL shifts to UAE in September and be consistent. IPL is a huge platform to learn from the best in the business and showcase talent,” added Singh. The Chandigarh-based bowler earned accolades from all corners during IPL 14, including praise from former India left-arm quick bowler Irfan Pathan and his captain KL Rahul.“Arshdeep has improved tremendously in the last three years. The experience he gained during IPLs helped him become more confident about himself. He is turning out to be a thinking bowler and is constantly working on improving. He knows he can be in the Indian team if he performs consistently for Punjab Kings in IPL and Punjab in domestic cricket,” shared his coach Rai, who is also a former Ranji Trophy player from Himachal Pradesh. India will play three ODIs and three T20s in Sri Lanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/picked-in-india-s-net-bowlers-squad-chandigarh-lad-arshdeep-is-raring-to-go-101624052367103.html

19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Petrol rate shoots up to ₹99.04 per litre in Mohali||With continuous price hikes by the government, petrol cost in Mohali rose to ₹99.04 per litre, the highest ever and within sight of crossing the ₹100 mark soon. Diesel also reached the all-time high of ₹90.62 per litre. Prices in Chandigarh and Panchkula are also hitting new highs every week.In Panchkula, petrol costs ₹94.48 per litre and diesel ₹88.09 per litre. Both are slightly cheaper in Chandigarh, at ₹93.22 and ₹87.34, respectively.President of Mohali Petroleum Dealers Association, Ashwinder Mongia said, “Fuel consumption in Punjab is mostly by farmers and transporters, so the rise in diesel prices will directly affect their livelihood. Even earlier people would prefer to go to Chandigarh and Panchkula for fuel refills, but further increase in the price margin is taking away more business from Mohali.” “With global rates of oil increasing, the price in the domestic market is also fluctuating. This is a temporary increase due to the policies of other countries. Further, once the Covid situation improves global fuel prices will come down and domestic markets are also likely to see some relief,” said Arjan Singh, president of the Chandigarh Petroleum Dealers Association.The prices of vegetables and other commodities may also get affected with the spike in fuel rates. “Some inflation in household goods can be expected. Prices of fruits and vegetables being brought from other states will also increase if the trend continues,” said BL Sharma, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-rate-shoots-up-to-99-04-per-litre-in-mohali-101624051946990.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Parida’s legacy as Chandigarh adviser a mixed bag of hits and misses||As UT adviser Manoj Parida gets transferred to Delhi, his two-and-a-half-year stint in Chandigarh will be remembered for its hits and misses in the city’s struggle against Covid-19.Parida had joined as adviser in December 2018 and little was known at the time about him except that as the chief secretary, Puducherry, he had gotten into a public spat with former lieutenant governor of Puducherry and former inspector general of Chandigarh Police Kiran Bedi.A little over a year into his tenure as UT adviser, Covid hit. As the pandemic unfolded, Parida’s detractors squarely put the blame on him for the administration’s many flip flops, which they alleged created confusion and uncertainty among residents.Questions were raised over the administration’s performance in home delivery of essential commodities. UT couldn’t even spend half the central government allotted for Covid management. However, the administration’s management of the Bapu Dham Colony containment zone—the Covid epicentre last year—elicited some appreciation in a report by the World Health Organisation.During the pandemic, particularly the first wave, a trigger-happy Parida on Twitter attracted both bouquet and brickbats even from those not living in the city. His daily interactions with Twitterati became a platform for information, feedback for administration and also entertainment for some owing to his quirky responses.Bringing in NGOS for Covid managementDuring the second wave, when the city was severely struggling with beds for Covid patients, Parida’s idea of inviting NGOs for establishing mini Covid centres clicked, bringing major relief to the beleaguered city. UT’s oxygen management also got a pat on the back from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Poor coordination with Punjab and Haryana on covid management, and public spat with PGIMER also marked his tenure during the pandemic. Till the second wave subsided, availability of ICU beds remained problematic.Parida’s colleagues, who are senior IAS officers, termed him a quick decision maker. “He never hesitated to take tough decisions during the pandemic. He also gave freedom to his officers to make decisions and backed them,” said a secretary-rank IAS officer, who worked with Parida during his deputation in the city.Uneasy relationship with BJPHis not-so-friendly relationship with the ruling political dispensation continued in Chandigarh too. “He was not accessible to the party leaders and at times didn’t even respond to their calls,” claimed a senior BJP leader, who didn’t want to be named.The BJP leaders also blamed him for the water tariff hike controversy. “We consented to a marginal tariff hike, but didn’t expect it to be done during the peak of the pandemic. He played a key role in that,” said the leader.A senior IAS officer, who also worked with Parida, gave a counterview: “He was clear from the start that water tariff hike rollback was a political decision and didn’t interfere.”Many insiders within the administration also observed an undercurrent of unease between Parida and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, particularly, during the second Covid wave. But unlike Puducherry, the alleged tension never came out in the public here.Of rankings and achievementsParida leaves behind many unresolved issues like poor solid waste management, which kicked the City Beautiful out of the top 10 cleanest cities in the country. In the ease of doing business rankings, too, the city was stuck at the bottom. In the Sustainable Development Goal 2021 ranking, though, the city topped among the UTs during his tenure.The Tribune flyover issue remained unresolved and no progress was made on urgent public transport issues like mass road transport system and the outer ring road. The administration was also pulled up by the Punjab and Haryana high court for the “rushed” move of power privatisation. Parida said, “Controlling the pandemic was a big challenge, which I am happy that I overcame. It was an unprecedented situation, and nobody knew what to expect. Most of the smart city work had not started but took off during my tenure. We also bought 150 long-route buses for CTU. Recruitments were done. Police started an e-beat system. The financial situation of MC has improved.”Parida, who will return to Delhi after two and a half years, takes over as the chairman of the National Authority of Chemical Weapons Convention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paridas-legacy-as-chandigarh-adviser-a-mixed-bag-of-hits-and-misses-101624051706974.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh needs to involve Mohali, Panchkula to preserve heritage||From its creation to preserving its unique nature, Chandigarh, a landlocked city, is heavily dependent on its periphery, which now encompasses two fast expanding cities of Mohali and Panchkula.Last week, the Haryana government unveiled the Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority (PMDA). Punjab already has the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). But for the whole of the tricity, with Chandigarh at its centre—capital of both the states—there is neither an institutional mechanism for plan coordination nor a comprehensive development plan.The city, originally designed for half a million people, has a population of more than a million now, and caters to an additional million population of both Mohali and Panchkula regions.The Covid-19 pandemic acutely highlighted the interdependence of the tricity region and a need for coordinated action among the three cities.Regional plan neededThe Chandigarh Master Plan (CMP) 2031 expects a symbiotic relationship with the regional urban areas. A sensitive and coordinated development is required to safeguard the region’s natural and man-made heritage, emphasises the CMP.Environmental protection in the tricity, designated agriculture zones, preservation of heritage, integrated transportation plan of the region, decentralisation of the bulk material markets, augmentation of affordable housing, physical and social infrastructure in respective towns, effective solid waste management and disaster management for the tricity require a regional plan.Advocating for coordinated regional planning, former UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “There should be a common tricity development authority. It should have representatives from UT, Punjab, Haryana and the Union government. Secretary, urban development, can be its chairman.”A regional planning board on the lines of National Capital Region Planning Board is needed for the Chandigarh metropolitan area too, said Sumit Kaur, former UT chief architect. Plan on paper onlyIn 1975, the Chandigarh Urban Complex (CUC) was created by the ministry of urban development, incorporating Chandigarh and CUC boundary in lieu of the 8 km radius around the city.In 1984, the Chandigarh Interstate Capital Region (CISCR) was created by the Central Town and Country Planning Organisation comprising the CUC and the 16-km radius periphery control area (outside CUC) along with portions beyond the 16-km radius in Punjab and Haryana. This total area measured 2,431 square kilometres.Consequent to it, an Inter-State Chandigarh Regional Plan 2001 was prepared, which covered a 50-sq km radius. In 2016, the ministry recommended creation of an Inter-State Chandigarh Regional Plan 2051, and institutions like a tricity planning development authority.R Srinivas, town and country planner, the ministry of housing and urban affairs, said, “Urban planning is a state subject. The Union government had earlier taken initiatives for creation of an inter-state regional plan, but the two principal states, Haryana and Punjab, haven’t actively supported it. So, these have remained on paper only.”Sumit Kaur, former UT chief architect, said: “Preparation of interstate regional plan is needed to dissipate rather than concentrate development around Chandigarh. We should create more Chandigarhs and not create another Delhi here. There has to be legal backing for the plan.”The plan should be legally binding on all the constituents so that its sanctity can be maintained, added Kaur.WHAT A REGIONAL PLAN WOULD DO||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-needs-to-involve-mohali-panchkula-to-preserve-heritage-101624051649259.html

Previously, these were allowed to only deliver food. All shops were allowed to open from 10am to 6pm.Shopping malls, gyms, clubs and spas were also permitted to resume operations, and museums and libraries were thrown open to public. Further on June 16, all shops were allowed to remain open from 10am to 7pm and restaurants’ timings were extended till 10pm.Steep decline in casesAt the peak of the second wave in May, the city was registering more than 800 new cases per day, hitting the all-time high of 895 on May 9. After five weeks of curbs, the cases fell below the 100 mark on June 4 and are now down to less than 50 for the past four days.The business community, which had been demanding Sunday relaxations, welcomed the administration’s decision. Charanjiv Singh, president, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “Lifting of lockdown on Sundays is a step in the right direction. CBM is now hopeful of regular shopping hours in the coming week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-cancels-sunday-lockdown-101624051347977.html

They were demanding that the PU authorities consider the lockdown a zero period and give all research scholars hostel accommodation. They also demanded that girls hostel four mess and canteen be reopened as the number of Covid cases in the city are going down. The scholars have been organising various protests since the beginning of June.SFS president Sandeep, who was also part of the protest, said, “Earlier, we were protesting outside the V-C’s office, with over 100 research scholars. Later, we marched towards the his residence where police had set up barricades. They thrashed us there and arrested many protesters and took them to the Sector 11 police station. Around 50 research scholars were detained.”Police officers from the Sector 11 police station privy to the matter, said, “The students were arrested while they were planning to enter the V-C’s house. Around 45 students were detained for a couple of hours before they were released. No case was registered.” Officials also denied allegations of any lathi charge by them.The varsity said in a statement, “PU authorities had advised the protesting students to have a dialogue with the officials, but instead, some of them got into a scuffle with the security and police officers and tried to break the barriers. One police officer was also injured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cops-detain-45-students-following-scuffle-amid-protest-at-panjab-university-101624051107845.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Flying Sikh together with his sweetheart again||“Meet my sweetheart wife, who is my heartbeat,” India’s legendary sprinter Milkha Singh had said while introducing Nirmal Kaur to his mentor Dr Arthur W Howard, former coach of the Indian athletics team, at the Chandigarh Golf Club in 2007. Such was Milkha’s admiration and love for Nirmal. Chandigarh will miss the evergreen couple that lost the battle to Covid-19 in a span of a week.ALSO READ: Milkha Singh (1929-2021): The giant who could flyBeing the only athlete to win gold in the 400m race in the Asian as well the Commonwealth Games in 1958, Milkha had been part of Chandigarh’s folklore since he settled in the City Beautiful in the early 1960s. The Indian track-and-field athlete, who became the first Indian man to reach the final of an Olympic athletics event when he was placed fourth in the 400m race at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, has inspired a whole generation of sportspersons with his stories of success, gumption, glory, dedication and discipline. His dedication towards a fit and healthy lifestyle post his retirement was phenomenal. In many ways, his death is the end of an era. Recalling the days when they started playing golf together at the Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC) greens in 1977, former CGC president and friend RS Mann, says, “I first met Milkha in 1973 and we bonded instantly. He was the director of sports in the Punjab ministry of education back then. A few years later, our interest in golf grew and we started playing together. He had so many stories to tell about the Partition, Rome Olympics and his stint in the army. Jeev grew in front of me and went on to become an international golf icon. Milkha and his wife always encouraged their son’s passion for golf and as a result Jeev turned out to be a star and has in turn inspired numerous children to take up golf.” ALSO READ: ‘India, Punjab poorer today’: Capt Amarinder Singh condoles Milkha Singh’s deathGolf aficionado“Milkha was always very competitive, be it on the athletics field, golf greens or at the table playing cards. He frequently travelled to Jammu and Kashmir, and Delhi for golf tournaments and had even played against former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah!” says Mann. “I would always be amazed to see Milkha’s charm and jovial attitude whenever he was playing golf with dignitaries, or senior politicians. His presence at the CGC, especially after the release of the movie Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, attracted many eyeballs. For 55 years, he always had one beer at lunch and two glasses of whiskey at night,” adds Mann. A through-and-through philanthrope Milkha was always also ready to extend a helping hand to the needy and set up the Milkha Singh Charitable Trust in 2003. In 1999, the Singh family adopted Manjit, the seven-year-old son of Havaldar Bikram Singh, who was killed in action during the Kargil war in the Battle of Tiger Hill. Ravinder Chaudhary, general secretary of the Chandigarh-based Athletic Federation of India, said, “Milkha jeewas a real hero. We would often invite him over for local athletic championships and he would always oblige. He would always encourage young athletes and keep asking me about needy athletes, and later help them. A great soul, he will always be remembered for his magnanimous nature.”  A woman cricketer, Mamta Kothiyal, who lived near Milkha’s house in Sector 8 until a few years ago, recalls how the legendary athlete helped her with funds ahead of a tournament. The local celebrity “I reached out to Milkha sir and Nirmal ma’am when I needed funds. They were so kind and gave me their blessings too! When Bhaag Milkha Bhaag became a hit, fans would come to see his house and would wait around to catch a glimpse of him,” she said. Former Indian test cricketer and actor Yograj Singh says he learnt a lot about Milkha’s life and achievements when he played the role of young Milkha’s coach Ranbir Singh in the biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Yograj says he spoke to his coach Ranbir, who was based in Canada, several times over the phone during his research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flying-sikh-together-with-his-sweetheart-again-101624051047589.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Bonanza for govt staffers as Punjab cabinet okays over 2-fold salary hike||The Punjab government on Friday decided to implement a majority of the recommendations of its sixth pay commission with effect from January 1, 2016, a move that will benefit over five lakh serving and retired employees. A decision in this regard was taken in cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. According to a government spokesperson, the minimum pay for state government employees will increase from ₹6,950 to ₹18,000 per month. The arrears will be paid in two equal instalments in October 2021 and in January 2022. The disbursal of salaries and pensions under the new structure will begin from July 1. Chaired by former IAS officer Jai Singh Gill, the commission was appointed by the previous state government on February 24, 2016. It submitted its report on April 30, 2021. The state government’s decision has come months before Punjab goes to the assembly polls next year. The implementation will entail 2.59 times increase in salaries and pensions over the previous pay commission recommendations, with an annual increment rate of 3%, resulting in pay scales of all existing employees continuing to be higher than in neighbouring Haryana. The minimum pension will go up from ₹3,500 to ₹9,000 per month, and the minimum family pension would increase to ₹9,000 per month under the revised structure. Divorcees or widows will be eligible for family pension. The decision will put an additional burden of ₹8,637 crore on the exchequer with prospective additional net annual burden expected to be nearly ₹4,700 crore, the spokesperson added. The expected amount of arrears from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021 is nearly ₹13,800 crore. The government has also accepted restoration of the commutation of pension to 40 % with effect from July 1, 2021. Death-cum-retirement gratuity (DCRG) has been enhanced from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh and the existing rates of ex-gratia have been doubled. Both the DCRG and ex-gratia have been extended to employees covered under the New Pension Scheme. House rent allowance and other benefits have been rationalised under the new structure. Special allowance to chowkidars and drivers has been doubled. A higher education allowance, in the form of a lump sum incentive to all employees who attain higher educational qualification during the course of employment and in the field directly relevant to an employee’s job, is being introduced by the government. New employees will, however, be paid as per the central government pay scales, which now apply to all new recruits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bonanza-for-govt-staffers-as-punjab-cabinet-okays-over-2-fold-salary-hike-101624050987100.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Remove some advisers, officials to repair govt’s image: MP Bajwa to Capt||Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Friday said chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh should remove some key advisers and officials to repair the image of the state government, denying any meeting with the CM amid the ongoing rift in the Punjab Congress. Bajwa, who has been critical of the CM’s style of functioning, said he needed to get rid of officers who were hurdles in smooth working of the government. “If these people cannot work properly, they should go on leave or quit their positions. All retired officers given important positions should be replaced with party men. The CM needs to address such irritants, including unfulfilled promises,” he said at a press conference in Chandigarh. The Rajya Sabha member said he did not have any meeting, secret or otherwise, with Amarinder as was being claimed. “He is the CM of our party. We are part of a family. If he wants to come to meet me, he will be most welcome,” he said, adding, “I have no personal enmity with him but there is a difference of opinion over the government’s functioning. I have not changed my views.” Bajwa’s denial came amid a strong buzz in Congress circles and some media reports that he and Amarinder met in Chandigarh recently and have buried the hatchet to reach an understanding as the former wants to come back to state politics. A senior party leader claimed that Bajwa was keen on contesting from the Batala assembly seat in the assembly elections next year. ‘No colonel can become general overnight’ About former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu eyeing the state unit president’s post, Bajwa said he, high command and party workers want Sidhu to get an important role but it takes time to reach top positions. “There are party loyalists who have spent 40-45 years, besides taksali (traditional) Congressmen…loyalty, seniority and capability are important. No colonel can become a general overnight. The decision has been left to the party leadership,” he said. The Rajya Sabha MP also said that when Sidhu was entering the Congress (in 2017), some senior Punjab leaders were creating hurdles. “I intervened at that time that he (Sidhu) and Pargat Singh will be assets for the party. Sidhu is a good speaker and has a good image,” he added. Bajwa also said he had told the three-member Kharge committee and the party high command that he is not in contention for the chief minister’s post or that of the state unit president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/remove-some-advisers-officials-to-repair-govt-s-image-mp-bajwa-to-capt-101624049969556.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Patti shootout: Interpol issues RCN against Canada-based fugitive gangster||The Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) has issued a red-corner notice (RCN) against fugitive gangster Lakhbir Singh, alias Landa, who is wanted in the Patti shootout in which a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) worker and his associate were shot dead in broad daylight on May 27. Lakhbir, a native of Harike town who faces 11 criminal cases, including three of attempt to murder, had fled to Canada in 2017. Two car-borne men had opened fire at Amandeep Singh, alias Aman Fauji, the Akali worker with a criminal past, and his aide Prabhjit Singh when they were returning after paying obeisance at a tomb in Patti. Their friend Samsher Singh, alias Shera, had received a bullet injury in his stomach. Lakhbir’s name emerged in the shootout case after the Tarn Taran police arrested truck union leader Malkit Singh, alias Laddu, an associate of Patti Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill, for conspiring the killings. The police had said Lakhbir demanded ₹20 lakh ransom from a Patti-based person. Fauji, an acquaintance of the person from whom the ransom was sought, had refused to pay the money, they claimed. Nursing a grudge, Landa hired history sheeter Preet Sekhon for executing Fauji and his aides, they added. Lakhbir is facing cases under the Arms Act and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in Tarn Taran, Moga, Ferozepur and Chandigarh. “We had written to the Union government for pressing the Interpol to issue an RCN against Lakhbir, who is also involved in running drug smuggling racket in India from Canada. The Interpol on Friday issued the notice. Our teams are working to bring him back to Punjab soon,” said Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale. The police have also identified one Happy Makhu, a gangster based abroad, in the Patti shootout case, who allegedly provided shelter to shooter Preet Sekhon after the latter executed the crime. “Happy is presently living in Greece. He is facing at least seven criminal cases in Punjab. We have also begun the process to extradite Happy,” said a senior police official. Sekhon had claimed responsibility for the Patti killings on his purported Facebook page. He was also accused of shooting a bouncer dead in Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patti-shootout-interpol-issues-rcn-against-canada-based-fugitive-gangster-101624049968698.html

Laboratories will also be set up,” she added. It was also decided to file a lawsuit against SS Kohli Associates, the chartered accountant (CA) firm handling SGPC accounts till last year, for “causing a great loss to the gurdwara body”. “We will start the process to get its licence cancelled. Also, SGPC employees in responsible positions holding the same post for more than 2 years will be transferred for better functioning,” Kaur said. “We will write to the ministry of home affairs again so that 35 gurdwaras listed under Section 87 can be maintained directly by the SGPC,” she said. Kaur informed that hotel management training will be provided to the staff deputed at the serais (inns) of the Golden Temple and other gurdwaras.

The restoration work will be carried out by PSGPC and ETPB jointly.” Nalwa was the commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Fauj, the army of the Sikh Empire. He is known for his role in the conquests of Kasur, Sialkot, Attock, Multan, Kashmir, Peshawar and Jamrud. The fortified haveli was built by him in the 1800s and overlooks the holy Hindu ponds believed to be Shiva’s tears. The haveli is built at the place which is a prominent Hindu shrine, with a typical military design, including kill holes.Notably, a jatha of Hindu pilgrims visits the Hindu shrine twice a year as per the India-Pakistan bilateral pact. With cooperation of US Sikh body Ranjit Nagara, historic Sikh shrine Gurdwara Choa Sahib is under restoration. Built in 1834 under the command of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the gurdwara was lying closed since the Partition. Located on the northern edge of Rohtas Fort — a UNESCO world heritage site — near Jhelum, it fell prey to neglect. The gurdwara commemorates the site where Guru Nanak is believed to have created a water spring during one of his (udasi) journeys. However, the PSGPC and ETPB are silent over Gurdwara Nanaksar Sahib associated with Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak and situated in Chakk Fateh Bhinder village in Daska tehsil of Sialkot district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/plans-afoot-to-restore-sikh-general-hari-singh-nalwa-s-haveli-in-pakistan-101624049908920.html

19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers protest: High court forms panel to resolve deadlock||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday constituted a committee on the plea of an Adani group subsidiary seeking removal of blockade by farmers protesting against three farm laws outside its Ferozepur warehouse.The high court bench of Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul acted on the plea of Adani Wilmar Limited that had approached the court on April 27.The committee comprises principal secretary, home, Punjab; additional director general of police, law and order, Punjab; Ferozepur deputy commissioner and Ferozepur senior superintendent of police to resolve the deadlock, said lawyer Abhinav Sood.The court acknowledged the efforts made by the Punjab government, but added that all parties will have to think out of the box and act expeditiously to prevent further loss/wastage of about 8,000 MT of foodgrains stored at the facility, which the court said “a country like India can ill afford.”The firm has sought free movement of foodgrains to and from its facility at Ferozepur. Meanwhile, in another development, a coordinate bench of Justice AG Masih gave Punjab a week’s time to respond to a plea against blockade by farmers at another subsidiary’s warehouse at Ludhiana. This plea has been filed by Adani Logistics against the farm protesters holding up its stocks. The bench, while fixing the hearing for June 28, observed that the matter is getting delayed, which is resulting in loss of revenue, both to the firm as well as the public exchequer. It gave last opportunity to the government to file its reply within one week asserting that no further time would be granted.The firm had approached the court in March saying that the farmers have been sitting on a dharna in front of its inland container depot in Ludhiana, thus rendering it non-operational since January 1. While its competitors are doing business as usual, the petitioner’s facilities are locked up for months, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-protest-high-court-forms-panel-to-resolve-deadlock-101624049906860.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers barge into Bathinda admn complex against land acquisition||Scores of villagers led by farmer unions barged in the conference hall of the Bathinda deputy commissioner’s office on Friday to lodge their protest against the upcoming process of land acquisition for national highways. Officials of the district administration and Punjab Pollution Control Board had called the Friday’s meeting with villagers to discuss the environmental impact of the proposed strengthening of the Amritsar-Jamnagar and Ludhiana-Jamnagar highways. Bathinda tehsildar Sukhbir Brar said the meeting was postponed after the villagers obstructed the proceedings. Union leaders said the Punjab government intends to acquire land for central government projects by offering a meagre amount to landowners.As the first meeting was underway at district administrative complex, a large number of protesting villagers gathered outside the secretariat. A heavy deployment of police personnel could not bar the farmers from entering the secretariat.Farmers alleged that the district administration had called only selected persons to expedite acquisition whereas the genuine landowners were not allowed to join the meeting. Leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Dakaunda) Buta Singh Tungwali blamed the administration for using “tactics to suppress the voice of aggrieved farmers”. Another leader Malkeet Singh said the government wanted to acquire land at the rate of ₹30 lakh per acre whereas the market rate of the land was between ₹70 and ₹80 lakh. “We will oppose any move to acquire lands. Farmers demand due compensation in lieu of their land which is their only source of living. The government should invite farm leaders for discussion before proceeding for acquisition,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-barge-into-bathinda-admn-complex-against-land-acquisition-101624049846820.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown-hit Ludhiana hosiery industry looks at revival with easing of restrictions||Reeling under losses for the second consecutive year, Ludhiana’s hosiery and textile industry comprising nearly 14,000 small and medium units is now hoping for revival with easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Punjab and other parts of the country. The pandemic-induced lockdown over the last one-and-a-half month spelt losses for the sector as there was no demand from distributors and fresh orders were hardly placed. The manufactures say there are strong chances of a recovery as shops have been allowed extended timings. “The summer cycle for the hosiery industry starts in February-end and goes on till September. Already three months have elapsed and we are facing up to 20-30% losses. We are now hopeful that the remaining three months will be good,” said Sudershan Jain, president, Knitwear and Apparel Manufacturers Association of Ludhiana. As the majority of apparel manufacturing units in Ludhiana fall in the unorganised sector that relies on cash and credit, smaller players were impacted most by the lockdowns. This, coupled with the shortage of labour in the last month as migrants in large numbers went to their native places dealt a severe blow to the industry. However, the majority of the workers have now returned to the city, said Jain. “Our main distribution market in Delhi was closed and reopened only this week on odd-even basis. With this market closed for over a month, there were no buyers from other parts of the country to whom we catered to. Nearly 90% of our stock has piled up,” said Tarun Jain Bawa, president, Bahadur Ke Textiles and Knitwear Association. Ajay Nayyar, owner of Silver Arc Mall in the city, said as timings were extended till 8pm, the number of customers thronging the garment stores will increase. “More than 80% visiting the malls now want to buy something. In pre-Covid times, this percentage was less as many indulged in window shopping. We appeal to the government to allow us to open on Sundays as well,” he said. Amit Thapar, vice chairman of the Punjab chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and president of Ganga Acrowools, said the sector suffered losses to the tune of 30% due to the lockdown. “But now we are on the path of recovery,” he added. Even as overall sales were down, there was a consistent demand for casual wear as most people stayed home. “We sold pajamas in large volumes during the lockdown,” said Vinod Thapar, chairman, Knitwear Club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdownhit-ludhiana-hosiery-industry-looks-at-revival-with-easing-of-restrictions-101624049728680.html
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Police bust fake remdesivir manufacturing racket||Rupnagar police on Friday busted a multi-crore interstate fake remdesivir manufacturing racket with the arrest of six persons, including the kingpin who also used to sell the replicas of the life-saving anti-viral drug used to treat critical Covid patients on the black market. The police have recovered designs and packaging material used for making these vials besides ₹2 crore and four cars bearing registration numbers of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Chandigarh from the possession of accused. Those arrested are Mohammad Shahwar of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Arshad Khan of UP’s Baghpat, Mohammad Arshad of Saharanpur, Pradeep Saroha of Haryana’s Kurukshetra, Shah Nazar and Shah Alam, both from Mohali.

Following the recovery of vials in Bhakra canal last month, the SIT constituted to investigate the case traced the marketing address written on the recovered vials to Nautwins Pharmaceuticals in Maloya, whose owner was quizzed. He led the police to the unravel the entire conspiracy and identify the accused, the DGP added. The owner also disclosed that various police teams from Delhi, Panipat, and Ambala had also raided the premises to know the whereabouts of the accused. Samples sent to Kolkata for forensic examInvestigations are on to ascertain their area of operations in other states and samples from recovered vials have been sent to the Kolkata central drugs laboratory for forensic examination, the DGP said. After nominating the name of Shahwar and his aide Shah Nazar, who was the main supplier of these fake injections, the Rupnagar police conducted raids at Kala Amb, the main office and house of Shahwar, to get further leads. In the meantime, Shahwar visited Goa, Bengaluru, UP, Delhi and various other locations to evade arrest, Gupta said. An SIT headed by SP (headquarters) Ankur Gupta was formed after 3,000 vials, including 621 of remdesivir and 1,456 of cefoperazone, were recovered from Bhakra canal on May 6. An FIR was registered under relevant provisions of the IPC, the Trademark Act, the Essential Commodities Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act, and the Drugs and Cosmetic Act at Chamkaur Sahib police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-police-bust-fake-remdesivir-manufacturing-racket-101624049726964.html

19-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A Sufi shrine made of daylight||Daylight’s so common—it is everywhere. One ends up taking it for granted. And in Delhi’s dreadful summer, daylight can be downright hostile.But there’s one place in the city where this ubiquitous element can be experienced as art. Here, the light scatters into an array of designs and moods.Come anytime in the day to Hazrat Chirag Delhi, the Sufi shrine in the south Delhi village of that name. This is a sprawling courtyard, dotted with domed chambers, scores of graves and a handful of gigantic trees. All of these individually are as calm as self-contained refuges, but what unites them harmoniously is the way they engage with daylight.This afternoon, the light is streaming in through the lattice screen inside the small chamber of Hazrat Khwaja Kamaluddin Allama, one of the saints buried in the compound. It falls on the facing wall into many little bricks of light. In the middle of the wall stands a golden-yellow column, painted with red flowers and green leaves. This man-made attempt to beauty lends something ethereal to the nature’s daylight patterns, which in comparison, look more intricate, more effortless and much lighter. They actually seem to replace the concrete of the wall with some intangible airy-seeming substance. One wonders at the possibility of the chamber being lifted upwards by this incredible feeling of lightness, and flying forward like the scores of aeroplanes crisscrossing the sky above the dargah’s dome every 5 minutes.This is merely one wondrous spot in the shrine. The daylight is embroidering its patterns in so many other places—in each it weaves something distinct, powerfully poetic. Like in the dozens of graves littered across the floor, littered with dry leaves and rose petals. The daylight succeeds in pirouetting its way around them and over them, turning the wrinkled ground into a tapestry of shades and shines.As one walks about purposelessly—the compound mostly remains empty—the impression is of wading through some luminous fourth dimension, linked to this world and yet not of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-sufi-shrine-made-of-daylight-101624048659594.html

In his complaint, Kala said burglars had stolen ₹4 lakh and 150g of jewellery from his house, besides other valuables. The burglars had also stolen the cash in the pockets of Kala and his son. However, their licenced weapon was not taken as the thieves could not find it. There are no closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the house but the footage from cameras in the neighbourhood showed some persons scaling the wall to enter and exit the house from an adjoining vacant plot. Cops said it was a well-planned operation as they knew the number of family members in the household and their rooms. Kala lives with his wife, son and daughter-in-law in the house. They have employed a domestic help as well. Police are looking into the possible role of the domestic help.Division number 8 station house officer Rajinderpal Singh said a case had been registered under Sections 457 (house-trespass) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons. The incident brought major embarrassment to the police as the house is merely 50 metres away from the office of the Ludhiana police commissioner and cops are under tremendous pressure to solve it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/burglary-in-minister-ashu-s-cousin-s-house-police-round-up-suspects-101624048526898.html

Further, assault cases should be heard in fast-track courts.The members stated that an Act is applicable in Punjab since 2007, under which violence against health workers and damage to property is a non-bailable offence, but that is also not being implemented in letter and spirit.Secretary of IMA Ludhiana, Dr Ashish Ohri, said that the protest will continue and be intensified in a phased manner across the country till the central law is passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ima-ludhiana-demands-central-law-to-protect-doctors-against-violence-101624048167421.html

19-06-2021||Chandigarh||BJP slams Ludhiana MC officials for serving ‘absurd’ illegal-construction notices||Slamming civic body officials for serving thousands of ‘absurd’ illegal-construction notices on the basis of new power connections availed by home owners, the local unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party submitted a memorandum with the municipal town planner at the Zone D office on Friday. The BJP leaders, led by party state vice-president Praveen Bansal and former councillor Inder Aggarwal, alleged that around 16,000 notices had been served across the district, without verifying whether any actual illegal construction had taken place. “Notices are also being served to those who have gotten a sub-meter installed at their house or have gotten their power load extended,” they said. Criticising mayor Balkar Sandhu, Bansal said the civic body’s single-minded attempts to fill their coffers was causing harassment to the common man, who was forced to make multiple visits to the MC office to get the confusion straightened out. “This is also encouraging corruption as some municipal corporation officials are promising to settle the matter in exchange of a bribe,” he alleged. “The notices are being served on the assumption that if a person has applied for new power connection, he must have carried out some reconstruction. This will not fly. We will also take up the matter with the mayor once he returns from Chennai. If need be, our party will raise an agitation,” Bansal said. A local, Jatinder Kumar, who had accompanied Bansal, said, “Earlier, we used to live in a joint family. After we separated our households, my brother got a separate electricity meter installed in his portion of the house. Subsequently, the civic body served us a notice saying that we had made changes in the building as well, which is untrue.” An MC official, requesting anonymity, said additional commissioner Rishipal Singh had initiated an inquiry into illegal construction in the district by comparing the approved building plans with the power connections availed by residents over the last few years. During the inquiry, 16,000 extra connections were found, following which the building branch was directed to serve notices to building owners. Municipal town planner Surinder Bindra said, “The notices were served on the directions of higher authorities so as to keep a tab on illegal construction. Since we have been apprised of the issues being faced by residents, I will take up the matter with the higher officials and further action will be taken as per their directions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-slams-ludhiana-mc-officials-for-serving-absurd-illegal-construction-notices-101624047927143.html

Due process should be followed and preference should be given to those with relevant experience in such hirings, the cabinet decided. However, the cabinet, after careful consideration, noted that employees provided by the service providers/ contractors through outsourcing arrangement cannot be regularised or hired by the government even through direct contract. It observed that such employees cannot be taken on the pay rolls of the government, in view of the existing law as laid down by the apex court and other rules. “The government will sympathetically look into the demands of another 15,000 safai karamcharis and sewermen who are working with the contractors as we have full sympathy with them,” said the minister. SC scholarship: 40% dues in 3 instalments this fiscalThe cabinet also gave its nod to clearing 40% of the ₹200 crore arrears owed to private educational institutes against the post-matric scholarship scheme for scheduled caste students for the 2017-20 period. The state government had already made the announcement last week, after which the Joint Association of Colleges decided to issue roll numbers to nearly two lakh SC students in the state.While approving the report submitted by the group of ministers (GoM) constituted for the purpose, the cabinet decided that the government will give these arrears to the private institutions in three equal quarterly instalments during the 2021-22 financial year. It also decided that the CM will take up the issue of the balance 60% pending arrears with the Prime Minister. The scheme is being implemented through central assistance, but no funds have been released against the demand for the years 2017-18 to 2019-20, said an official spokesperson. Keeping in view the hardships faced by SC students, the GoM was constituted on January 14 to examine and resolve this issue. It comprised finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, social justice, empowerment and minorities minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot; higher education minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi.The GoM had also recommended that private educational institutions would not retain the roll numbers, certificates and degrees of SC students, would make no claims nor approach court against the Punjab government for claiming pending fees for the session 2017-18 to 2019-2020, and will withdraw cases pending in court in this matter. Further, it said in its report that if 60% amount is not received from the Government of India, then the educational institutions could not claim it from the Punjab government.

The doctors claimed that despite paying the highest fee in the country, they are being paid the lowest monthly stipend as compared to medical colleges in other states.“Postgraduate doctors are paying nearly ₹2 lakh annually to government colleges,” the Resident Doctors Association said in the letter, adding that while junior residents receive a monthly stipend of ₹49,000, senior residents get ₹55,000. In comparison, the association claimed, the annual fee for junior doctors at the PGIMER, Chandigarh, and other institutes in Delhi and Haryana is between ₹10,000 and ₹60,000, while they get monthly stipend of ₹80,000-1 lakh.The doctors said they are the ones managing the Covid wards and handling the major workload in government colleges during the pandemic. “We are cooperating with the college and hospital administrations at every step, and in return, we except government to waive our annual fee besides bringing parity in monthly stipend,” said association general secretary Dr Prabsimran Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabresident-doctors-demand-fee-waiver-hike-in-stipend-101624044446481.html

19-06-2021||Other||BSEH faces criticism over Class 10 results||The Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) is facing criticism from various stakeholders after at least 15% (46,950) of around 3.13 lakh Class 10 students scored a perfect 500/500 in the evaluation of this year’s board results, “making a mockery of the education system”.In 2020, Rishita, a student of Tagore Senior Secondary School in Hisar’s Narnaund had topped the Class 10 exams with a perfect 500/500 score. She was the only student among 3.37 lakh students who appeared in the exams to score 100%. The pass percentage in Class 10 results was at 64.59%.In 2019, four students - Himanshu from Jhajjar, Isha from Kaithal, Sanju from Panipat, and Shalini from Jind – had topped the BSEH exam by scoring 497 out of 500. The pass percentage was recorded at 57.39%. Total 3.85 lakh students from the state had participated in the exam.Board chairman Jagbir Singh said at least 15% (46,950 students) of around 3.13 lakh Class 10 students have secured 100% score in this year’s results.“We are yet to compile the figures of students who had secured 100% but at least 15% have achieved this figure mark,” he added.Last week, BSEH had declared class results for 3.13 lakh regular students while 11,278 appeared for compartment exam.The board achieved a 100% pass percentage against last year’s 64.59%. All students cleared the exam but nobody was declared topper for the first time in 51 years, since the board’s inception in 1970.‘INJUSTICE WITH INTELLIGENT STUDENTS’Former state education minister and Jhajjar MLA Geeta Bhukkal, of Congress, slammed the Haryana government and the state board for the Class 10 results.“In previous years, only one to two students had bagged 100% but this year tens of thousands students have scored a perfect 500/500. I don’t know on what parameters the state board has evaluated the Class 10 board results. It is difficult to get 100 marks in a single subject and the board officials had distributed 100% to many students like sweets,” she said.“The education minister had announced to distribute tablets to students last year but the government had failed to deliver on its promise. If this was done, the board exams could have been conducted through online mode. This year, the education minister has announced to give scholarships to 500 students. How will he select the 500 students among tens of thousands of students who have secured 100% for the scholarship?” she added.“From Class 1 to 8, we cannot fail any student under Right to Education and Class 10 results were a litmus test for students. But the Haryana board has pushed the students in Class 11 by giving them higher percentage without conducting test. The board and government are playing with the future of students,” she said.Naveen Soni, a government teacher in Hisar, said the state board has done injustice in Class 10 board results.“To secure 100 marks in any subject, a student has to take multiple revisions, besides solving previous years’ question papers. And the board has given 100% score to many students. This will reduce the morale of those who have passed the exam in 2020 and earlier,” he said.“Such results will bring incompetent students into competition. Few years ago, there was a value of a student who used to get 90% or more. But now, everyone is getting more than 95%, which is a mockery of our education system,” he added.Reacting to the criticism faced by the board over Class 10 results, board chairman Jagbir Singh said the evaluation was done after taking approval from the state government.“A panel of two vice-chancellors, a registrar and a few intellectuals had decided on evaluation of Class 10 results. We had announced the results on the basis of assessment sent by schools,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bseh-faces-criticism-over-class-10-results-101624043246511.html
19-06-2021||Other||Pilot study in Mumbai Metropolitan Region demonstrates viability of low-cost air quality sensors||A pilot project conducted across various locations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has demonstrated the viability of low-cost sensor devices (LCSD) in collecting actionable data on air pollution. Experts have proposed that these LCSDs may be used to expand currently deficient monitoring systems in Mumbai and beyond at a fraction of the cost of regulatory-grade continuous ambient air quality monitoring systems (CAAQMS). The study was conducted in partnership between Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur and the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB), using a fleet of low-cost devices produced by four indigenous companies: Respirer Living Sciences, Airveda Technologies, Personal Air Quality Systems (PAQS) and Oizom Instruments. While a low-cost monitor can be purchased for about ₹60,000, a regulatory grade device can cost above ₹20 lakh each. “This is a prohibitively expensive cost, as a result of which our existing framework of CAAQMS is a bit patchy. But we can’t spend all our money on measurement. We also have to invest in mitigation. CAAQMs only give a broad picture of air pollution, while low-cost devices can be used for a more hyper-local picture. But first we needed this study to make sure that the information they provide is reliable,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB. Data for the study, ‘Technical Assessment of Low-Cost Sensor based PM2.5 and PM10 Monitoring Network in Maharashtra’ was gathered between November 2020 and May 2021, when 40 such low-cost monitoring sensors were installed alongside or co-located with MPCB’s 15 existing CAAQMS in Colaba, Worli, Sion, Bandra, Vile Parle, Kurla, international airport, Powai, Kandivli, Mulund, Borivli, Vasai, Mahape, Nerul and Kalyan. The low-cost monitors, restricted to capturing data on particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10), were solar powered and connected to the Internet for real-time data transmission. The monitors were allowed to operate for seven-months, and the data acquired from them was compared with that of the nearby CAAQMS. The findings reveal that sensors from three start-ups saw a percentage error (measured with respect to true value measured by CAAQMS) of less than 25% for uncalibrated values. After calibration, the error was reduced to less than 15% for three types of sensors and 20% for the fourth type. A range of machine-learning techniques were also used to develop the base calibration model, which experts said can be continuously improved over time to reduce the rate of error produced by low-cost devices. “It has been a matter of debate whether cheaper tools can be used to complement regulatory-grade devices in India, as has already been done in cities such as Beijing, London and across the US. Our study shows that this is possible, but only when the correct calibration model is applied. Of the 40 low-cost devices we used, more than half showed an acceptable error rate. To be sure, this data is not a substitute for regulatory-grade devices, but can be used by citizens and authorities to take mitigative action with reasonable confidence of accuracy,” said Dr SN Tripathi from the Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering at IIT-K, who led the study. The experiment also provides insights into the granular nature of air pollution across Mumbai. The average pollution load calculated by the sensor-based network for PM 2.5 concentration across each location in MMR varied largely month by month. For instance, at Vile Parle it was 80 ug/m3 in November, which dipped to 26 ug/m3 in May. Some coastal locations like Colaba too recorded high pollution levels with a PM 2.5 concentration of 56 ug/m3 in December. The monthly mean was the highest at 124 ug/m3 at Kalyan in the month of January. Commenting on these findings, Dr VM Motghare, joint director (air quality) at MPCB said, “We [Maharashtra] have the highest number of non-attainment cities and macro planning is needed to monitor the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme. So, the data from these low-cost sensors will really help us in identifying the hotspots in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pilot-study-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-demonstrates-viability-of-low-cost-air-quality-sensors-101624043125833.html

The state is also planning to have a gigafactory in Maharashtra for manufacturing batteries and increasing the number of charging stations to provide a boost to EVs over the next few years.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting on Friday to review the status of the implementation of the policy, which was rolled out in 2018. A committee headed by additional chief secretary of transport department Ashish Kumar Singh has prepared a revised draft of the policy by updating and fine-tuning it with the Central policies and the decision issued thereafter. The state is also planning incentives and subsidies to the industries and manufacturers of the vehicles and auxiliary businesses such as manufacturers of batteries, chargers, spare parts, among others.Thackeray has directed the transport department to present the revised policy before the state cabinet for its approval at the earliest. “The policy should focus on steps to be taken for its effective implementation in rural and urban areas by setting up robust infrastructure for the charging stations. The policy should also tap the subsidies to be given to suppliers and manufacturers, besides the foreign investment. It should also look at the measures that need to be taken to encourage EVs in public transport and their maximum use in the government sector,” he said.Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has directed the administration to push for steps to promote charging stations at housing societies.Maharashtra was one of the first states to unveil its EV Policy in February 2018. However, it could not be implemented effectively due to the subsequent changes made by various Central government departments. “There are many changes made by various Central government departments after our policy was rolled out. Maharashtra, being a leader in the manufacturing and sales of the vehicles, was supposed to witness a boost to environment-friendly vehicles, but the delay in framing the integrated scheme of incentives resulted in a lukewarm response from the industry. We aim the share of EVs in the new vehicle registration by 2025 to increase by 5, 10 and 20% for four, two and three-wheelers, respectively. We are also aiming to set up at least one Gigafactory for manufacturing advanced batteries. Manufacturing giants such as Tesla are expected to invest in the state, for which incentives are being rolled out,” said an official from the transport department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-plans-to-rework-electric-vehicles-policy-101624043005819.html
19-06-2021||Other||Flamingos face shrinking wetlands||Until not too long ago, the landscape around Uran, a fishing village in Navi Mumbai, was considered a bird-watching hotspot. During winter, large congregations of flamingos and other migratory birds could be seen along a 30km-long patchwork of wetlands at Uran’s Panje and Funde villages, south of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.Two years ago, flamingo numbers began to explode at a group of small water bodies located at the northern edge of this stretch – namely the TSC-NRI wetland complex near Palm Beach road in Belapur. This includes the Talawe wetland, which has yielded some of the most striking visuals of flamingos in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in recent times – forsaking Uran’s wetlands.“[Last year] people thought that there was a direct link between the Covid-19 lockdown and the explosion of flamingo numbers at TSC-NRI. People seemed to think that the birds were perhaps undisturbed for the first time due to the reduction in human activity,” said Adesh Shivkar, a veteran birder who has been tracking avian biodiversity in MMR for over 20 years.But the lockdown isn’t really why the flamingos seem to have shifted base.The network of wetlands in Navi Mumbai serve largely as the roosting grounds for flamingos and other waders, who fly over from their feeding grounds in Thane Creek during high tide. Local residents and environmental experts said that Uran’s wetlands have been systemically reclaimed and dried out, as dumping of mud and construction debris into water bodies and mangrove swamps has been a regular occurrence in the area for about a decade.In an interim report submitted to the state forest department last year, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) noted, “Panje was one of the larger wetlands (which) used to support a huge population of migratory birds. Now, as Panje is disturbed due to inconstant water flow, it can be assumed that the avifauna that was coming to Panje might have started using the other suitable sites.”The interim report is part of a decade-long bird-monitoring study that the BNHS was commissioned to do in 2017 after construction began on the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) bridge to connect Sewri and Uran. Part of the mandate of the study is to create a conservation blueprint for the Thane Creek over which this bridge will come up, which will ensure that the habitats of flamingos thrive. Environmentalists say that such a study should have already happened – in the absence of it, we still don’t know how habitats are affected by pollutants or construction. For instance, the flamingo numbers in Sewri and Nhava are reportedly still high though construction of the MTHL is underway in those areas.At least four major wetlands -- Panje, Belpada, Bhendkhal and Dastan Phata -- have been completely dried out, either through dumping of mud or through willful stoppage of intertidal waters by authorities. The City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), for example, had halted the flow of water to Panje by shutting off the sluice gates in its flood control barrier. These were later opened after a High Court order, but there are still four tidal inlets to the wetland which remain blocked (in violation of recent instructions to Cidco by the National Green Tribunal).The Cidco spokesperson did not respond to calls and messages on questions about inlets.At Panje, the largest of these water bodies (covering an area of at least 120 hectares),barely a dozen flamingos roosted in a small pool of accumulated rainwater at the start of the month. “This is a far cry from the situation a few years ago. Had you visited, say, in 2008 or even as late as 2015, you would have seen thousands of them,” said Dilip Koli, a resident of Uran, who is associated with the Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti, a local fishworkers unions.“There was a point when we could throw our nets here and catch fish. Now there is not even enough water for the birds,” Koli said.Reports have documented the loss of Uran’s wetlands too. A 2019 BNHS report titled ‘Coastal Wetlands and Waterbirds of Navi Mumbai’ for example, noted that the water spread of Belpada wetland reduced from 147.98 hectares (ha) in 1973 to just 53 ha in 2018. Simultaneously, the area of human settlements around the water body increased tenfold during the same time period, from 128 ha to 1,280 ha.A similar trend was observed at the nearby Bhendkal wetland, where the water spread reduced from 173 ha in 1973 to 89 ha in 2018. Human habitation in the vicinity of this water body also increased during this period, from 106 ha to 833 ha. Experts emphasized that this is in clear violation of Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) guidelines, which prohibit construction over wetlands.“The coastal inlets which ensure perennial flow of water to these wetlands have been completely buried, or blocked,” Koli said, saying this also worsened unseasonal flooding in Uran, particularly over the past two years. The ecological importance of these wetlands, particularly with respect to migratory birds, has been acknowledged by the state government. More than five years have passed since the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) approved the declaration over 1,600 acres of wetlands in Mumbai, Raigad and Thane districts as bird sanctuaries, with the express intent of protecting flamingos and other migratory shorebirds. These included the wetlands of Panje-Funde and TSC-NRI, as well as Sewi-Mahul on the city’s eastern waterfront.The decision was formally announced on December 4, 2015, by the office of the then CM, Devendra Fadnavis, and came on the back of a suggestion by the BNHS earlier that year, in response to the MTHL project. To mitigate possible adverse impact, the BNHS had emphasized on the need to protect so called “satellite wetlands” around Thane Creek, including the TSC-NRI wetland in Navi Mumbai (Thane), and Panje-Funde in Uran (Raigad).“There is a need to give protected status to the wetlands of southern Mumbai... especially, the Uran mudflats, and the NRI-TSC wetlands, Panje-Funde wetlands,” the BNHS had noted at the time, in a report to the MMRDA. But despite the state government’s initial willingness to bring these areas under protection of the Wildlife Act (1972), the SBWL’s 2015 proposal never saw the light of day. The Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary, declared in 2015, has been criticized for not including some of the most prime flamingo habitats within its 1,690 hectares delineation.Last June, the Maharashtra forest department approved and published an official document showing six ecologically sensitive areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as wetlands, as part of a 10-year management plan for the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary (TCFS). Six sites – Bhandup (11 ha) in Mumbai, Panje (124 ha), Belpada (30 ha), Bhendkhal (8 ha) in Uran, Training Ship Chanakya (13 ha) and NRI Complex (19 ha) in Navi Mumbai – were designated officially as wetlands.Then, in July 2020, forest department wrote to the Cidco and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) -- who own the land on which this network of wetlands is located -- seeking their comments on declaring these six water bodies as Conservation Reserves under the Indian Wildlife Act, which would deter any further development around them.Cidco and JNPT have both since rejected this proposal. In a response to the forest department, CIDCO wrote that these sites “are developable land parcels” which “do not qualify to be declared as wetlands.” Cidco is also currently fighting a Bombay High Court order which restricts it from developing the TSC-NRI wetlands into an 80 hectare golf course and residential complex.“In light of the MTHL project, the importance of these satellite wetlands cannot be emphasized enough. The bridge across Thane Creek itself may not pose a threat to the future of these birds, but the destruction of these satellite wetlands certainly does,” said Mrugank Prabhu, a researcher at BNHS currently working on a long-term study on flamingoes and other migratory birds in Thane Creek and Navi Mumbai. “Recently, a greater sand-plover tagged three years ago by the BNHS was found at Panje, after the overflow of tidal water during the Super Moon period in April. This demonstrates the fact that migratory birds show a high degree of site fidelity tendency, which is their preference for returning to the old places that they are used to. There has been a definite noticeable pattern in the bird flights that we have been noticing over the past couple of years – no flamingos in Uran, and lots of them in Talawe wetlands and DPS Lake. This is worrisome,” said BN Kumar, an environmentalist with the Navi Mumbai-based NatConnect Foundation, who has been documenting the destruction of Uran’s wetlands for nearly a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flamingos-face-shrinking-wetlands-101624042825859.html

If we opt for large-scale easing of restrictions at present, and come to a situation where caseload increases rapidly, we will find it difficult to control.”Kakani said the BMC’s decision to remain on level three of restrictions is based on its population density, mobility on regular days, and recommendations of the task force. “When the BMC will opt to change its status from level three, we will have to consider a lot of factors, including caseload in adjoining districts, and internal medical management,” Kakani said. “If adjoining districts have a lot of cases during this time, we have to be very careful. We are in constant talks with the task force,” he added.Currently, Mumbai has 10,934 oxygen beds, of which 1,949 are occupied. However, of the 2,635 ICU beds, 1,170 are vacant; of the 1,455 ventilator beds, 504 are vacant. Kakani said, “The ICU and ventilator bed vacancy is not concerning at present, because of daily caseload. However, if we open up and cases increase rapidly, we can’t take a chance.”Mumbai on Friday recorded 758 Covid cases and 19 deaths. The active cases in the city are now 18,764.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-eligible-for-level-one-call-on-easing-curbs-is-likely-next-week-101624041865850.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to start vaccination drive for 30- 45 age group on Saturday||The Maharashtra government has decided to start the vaccination drive for beneficiaries between 30 to 45 years of age group from Saturday. The drive will be conducted at the government-run centres, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced on Friday. The state has also allowed walk-ins for those in this age group.The ongoing drive for 45 years and age group will also be continued along with it.“The Centre has allowed the state to determine priority for the citizens between 18 to 45 years of age for vaccination. Following this, the state health department has decided to give priority to the beneficiaries in the 30 to 45 years of age group,” Tope said on Friday.“The citizens are also allowed to register on the spot, along with the existing system of online registration for taking vaccine jabs,” he added.The necessary training required to make changes in the Co-WIN app for the staff involved in the vaccination drive was also completed on Friday. “The registration of the beneficiaries is mandatory on the Co-WIN application. The app, however, has sections only for two groups — 45 years and above and 18-45 age group. Making any changes in the required training to the concerned staff has been completed today,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, Directorate Of Health Services.The state government had started its drive for beneficiaries between the 18-45 age group on May 1 after it was allowed by the Centre. However, it was suspended owing to the non-availability of vaccine doses on May 12.“Since then, we have covered most of the people eligible for the second dose. After having sufficient stock, we have decided to start the drive for the beneficiaries from the 30-45 age group,” she added.Meanwhile, BMC on Friday said 10 vaccination centres in the city will start vaccination for 30 to 44 years age group starting Saturday, only on an appointment basis.The 10 centres where vaccination will take place include Priyadarshini Park in Walkeshwar, BMC Murli Deora Eye Hospital in Kamathipura, Acworth Leprosy centre in Wadala, Seth Ayurvedic Centre in Sion, Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, MW Desai Centre, Malad, Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule Hospital in Borivli, Jolly Gymkhana in Ghatkopar, Deonar Maternity Home in Govandi and VD Savarkar Centre in Mulund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-start-vaccination-drive-for-30-45-age-group-on-saturday-101624041745820.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||40% vaccination in Mumbai done at private hospitals, shows data||Over three months after private hospitals were permitted to conduct Covid vaccination, nearly 40% of the total vaccination in the city is done by private hospitals, according to the data of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).On Friday, the city also crossed the one million mark for the 18-44 age group as a total of 1,013,875 citizens in the age group have been vaccinated. Of the total 961,081 were vaccinated in private hospitals.The city has administered 4.6 million vaccine doses as of Thursday, of which, 1.7 million vaccine doses have been administered at private hospitals.The city has a total of 375 active vaccination centres, of which 89 are private. According to BMC officials, with every passing day, vaccination conducted by private hospitals is increasing as they have better stock as compared to public vaccination centres.For example, on June 17, a total of 70,115 vaccine doses were administered in the city, of which 56,019 were administered at private hospitals. The imbalance is considering - private hospitals have more stock than that of the corporation and also because vaccination for 18 years to 44 years is shut in the corporation since the second week of May 2021.The BMC is vaccinating citizens between 18 to 44 years only in case of students going abroad, citizens going abroad for jobs or those participating in Tokyo Olympics. However, vaccination at private hospitals is open for all.Until June 17, a total of 973,568 citizens between the age group of 18 to 44 have been vaccinated, followed by 3,018 lactating mothers, 1,348,009 citizens between the age group of 45 to 59 and 1,318,898 and remaining healthcare, frontline workers.A total of 4,326,427 citizens have been vaccinated, of which, 3,470,200 have taken their first dose and the remaining have taken their second dose. In the city, 4,015,818 have been administered with Covishield, 309,702 have taken Covaxin and the remaining 907 have taken Sputnik.The Covid vaccination started on January 16 in the city, with healthcare workers followed by frontline workers.Starting March, senior citizens were added, following those above 45 years of age. From May 1, those between the age group of 18 to 44 were also allowed to get vaccinated. However, with the increase in citizens eligible for vaccination, the supply went down resulting in fewer citizens getting the jab in May 2021.The BMC got 265,000 vaccine doses in January, 571,000 vaccine doses were received in February, 810,950 vaccine doses in March, 947,500 vaccines doses in April and 523,440 vaccine doses in May, due to which vaccination got slowed down in the city.The BMC has estimated vaccination of 9 million citizens eligible for vaccination in 18-44 years of age group. On Friday, total 61,710 citizens were vaccinated. Overall, 4,38,8137 citizens have been vaccinated in the city. 22,321 have taken both doses in 18-44 age group, according to BMC data.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician said, “We need to focus on vaccinating more citizens between the age group of 18 to 44. Of the total figure, around 22% is the ratio of vaccination in the 18 to 44 years age group. Considering the factor of economy and third wave, vaccinating more youngsters will help to ease the burden on health infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/40-vaccination-in-mumbai-done-at-private-hospitals-shows-data-101624041685796.html

19-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges reopen; no clarity on teachers’ attendance yet||Colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) re-opened virtually for the 2021-22 academic year this week, but confusion still looms over several issues. The latest has been a tussle between teachers and the management as several colleges have directed their staff to be physically present in college starting next week. However, the demand has not gone down well with the teachers.“All colleges know that travel restrictions are still in place, and teachers are still not allowed to travel by train. How do they expect us to reach the institute? Why are we expected to pay for auto or cab from our pockets?” asked a disgruntled teacher of a college in central Mumbai.MU-affiliated colleges started the new academic year from June 14 this year, and the varsity in a circular reiterated that the first semester will be conducted online only. This circular, however, has not clarified anything else including the academic calendar or the status of teacher attendance in colleges. With no clarity in place, colleges are left to figure out the regulations on their own.“We didn’t hear from the university so we directly contacted the university officials and were told that even the MU staff has to follow 50% attendance, so we decided to implement something similar. Each teacher will come to work twice a week, only if they can travel to and from home comfortably,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle.Some complaints have also been received by teacher groups, who have forwarded such queries to the university. “While there is no clarity on the status of teacher attendance, one thing which has been clarified by the university is that the new semester will be conducted solely in online mode. So there is no need for colleges to indulge in such risky moves, especially since trains are still inaccessible to teachers,” said Madhu Paranjape, general secretary, Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU). She added that some of the complaints have already been forwarded to the varsity and if no action comes from the MU officials, they will take up the matter with district authorities.A spokesperson for the university said that even though there’s been no circular on these lines, colleges need not insist on teacher attendance if the teachers are facing problems. “We haven’t received any complaints yet, but will look into this matter,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-colleges-reopen-no-clarity-on-teachers-attendance-yet-101624041385883.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Kandivli Covid vax drive: Mumbai civic body unsure over authenticity of certificates||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is still conducting its internal investigation into the vaccination drive at Hiranandani Heritage, Kandivli, is now confused over the reconciliation of issued vaccination certificates to residents. The civic body is yet not sure if the certificates are genuine. An employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri— Rajesh Pandey, who is now terminated, conducted an immunisation drive at Hiranandani Heritage on May 30. He claimed that the drive was being done in association with the hospital. The R-North ward has submitted the report of their investigation to Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner on Friday late night. Later, after seven-eight days when the beneficiaries started receiving vaccination certificates from other hospitals and vaccination centres, they became suspicious and raised alarms. As per residents, they have got vaccination certificates from Nanavati Max Super Speciality, Lifeline Hospitals and civic-run Nesco jumbo centre, Goregaon. However, later, all these three vaccination centres refused their involvement in the immunisation drive.Now, residents are questioning the authenticity of the vaccination certificates issued by the accused. Of the 390 beneficiaries, almost 260 have received the certificates. All the issued certificates are getting reflected on the centralised Co-WIN portal with the names of three respective vaccination centres. But as per civic officials, technically, this is counted as “incorrect” uploading of details as the hospitals mentioned weren’t involved in the Covid-19 vaccination.When asked if the civic body would reconcile the data uploaded on the Co-WIN by their accusers, Dr Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC said, “Firstly, we aren’t sure if the issued certificates are authentic. We are still cross-verifying. Until we get it, we can’t decide on reconciliation because we don’t know from where the vials were procured.”A preliminary police investigation has revealed that the accused have conducted similar vaccination drives in several other spots in the city including a production house and a college. If their modus operandi has been similar, then the civic body believes that there would be more incorrect data synced with the Co-WIN portal with the name of other hospitals that weren’t even involved with the drives.“The vials used in the drive have no connection with our centre. We have cross-checked all records. Being a civic-run centre, we don’t supply vials outside for such drives,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco jumbo centre.“We don’t know if the accused got the login details of the centre. There is a possibility that they hacked into it. We have to wait for the reports,” Andrade added. The Kandivli police station is also waiting for the civic body’s report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kandivli-covid-vax-drive-mumbai-civic-body-unsure-over-authenticity-of-certificates-101624041265828.html
19-06-2021||Bhopal||IAS officer whose leaked chats set off a row gets threat call, seeks protection||BHOPAL: A 35-year-old Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer in Madhya Pradesh, who recently vented his frustration at his repeated transfers before getting a show-cause notice from the government for recording his phone conversation with a senior colleague a fortnight earlier, has complained that he has received a threat call on the Signal app.“The caller asked me to go on a leave for six months and stay away from the media. He threatened me with dire consequences,” said Lokesh Kumar Jangid, a 2014-batch IAS officer.Jangid has sent a formal complaint to the police and sought protection.Madhya Pradesh director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri said deputy inspector general Bhopal Irshad Wali was investigating the matter and will submit a report. “Further action will be taken on the basis of findings of the report,” he said.The IAS officer, who has been transferred eight times in less than six years of service, was last month shifted out of western MP’s Barwani district within 41 days of being posted as the district’s additional collector and posted to the Rajya Siksha Kendra.Jangid is alleged to have taped his phone conversation with Deepti Gaud Mukherjee, principal secretary of MP’s general administration department when she called him to inform him about his transfer on May 31. The IAS officer is reported to have shared the conversation with some friends.It was, however, Jangid’s post on a group of MP IAS officers on the mobile app Signal - someone took screenshots and circulated them on social media - that turned the spotlight on him. In his post, the IAS officer had expressed his frustration at his repeated transfers, called the Civil Services Board, a panel of top bureaucrats mandated to approve all transfers to ensure stability of tenure, a joke.Jangid also launched a broadside at his colleagues.“Those who mint money from all kinds of Mafia, get transferred from the field to field (one field posting to another) and those with impeccable integrity get thrown to the secretariat on transfer,” he said in the post.“Of Course who’s who in the bureaucracy are mere Nero’s guests these days. The same thing happened in Shahdol when I was SDM. I told the collector that he’s a weak collector, which he bloody was. And I was removed on that ground as he has a relationship with a politician,” said Jangid in the post that has gone viralICP Keshari, president of MP’s IAS association, reprimanded him and told him to delete the post. “You lost basic decency- not only accusing your colleagues but also the family. Please delete all your posts soon. That’s my sincere advice and desist from such things in future.” Jangid refused and was removed from the group.On Wednesday, when the screenshots went viral, the state government issued him notice for recording his phone conversation with principal secretary Deepti Gaud Mukherjee.By Friday, the controversy over Jangid’s post turned political.The Congress attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party government for transferring Jangid. Congress MLA Bala Baccchan alleged that the IAS officer was eased out because he had exposed “financial irregularities in purchase of oxygen concentrator and stopped the payment of a company.”BJP leader and cabinet minister Vishwas Sarang, however, said: “Jangid’s behaviour is inappropriate with his seniors and whatever he posted and later circulated on social media is against the civil services rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/ias-officer-whose-leaked-chats-set-off-a-row-gets-threat-call-seeks-protection-101624041146291.html
19-06-2021||Lucknow||Direct BJP-SP contest likely in district panchayat chairpersons’ polls in Uttar Pradesh||A direct contest is likely between the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) for a majority of the zila (district) panchayat chairpersons’ posts, going by the scenario in most of the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh. The election is scheduled on July 3.The Samajwadi Party that upset the BJP’s applecart in the three-tier panchayat elections held in April by bagging 779 zila panchayat wards has mobilized its resources in a bid to capture a majority of the zila panchayat chief’s posts.The BJP that won 579 wards is out to counter the SP strategy by winning the maximum number of chairpersons’ posts. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) that won 361 panchayat wards and the Congress that bagged 76 wards are also working out their strategies to make their presence felt by allying with like-minded parties or winning the support of independent ward members.The 3,050 district panchayat ward members will play a decisive role in the election for the 75 zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts. Among them, 1,272 are independents or members of smaller parties.The State Election Commission, in a notification on June 15, announced that the election will be held on July 3. The chairperson will be elected by the system of proportional representation by single transferable vote, making each vote crucial. The BJP, SP and the BSP have started working for extra votes and are lobbying with the members of other parties or independents.The Samajwadi Party appears to have the upper hand in its strongholds of Mainpuri, Etah, Firozabad, Kasganj, Etawah, Kannauj, Auraiya, Rampur and Fatehpur. In eastern and central UP, it is in a comfortable position in Ballia, Mirzapur, Kanpur, Lucknow, Siddharthnagar, Jaunpur, Lakhimpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Bijnor, Unnao, Bahraich, Ayodhya and Pratapgarh districts with more ward members in its ranks than the rival BJP.The support of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), the Mahan Dal as well as the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (PSP) (Lohia) led by Shivpal Yadav paved the way for victory of SP members in a large number of wards. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also opened the doors for rebel SP leaders belonging to the OBC (Other Backward Class) community in the Kurmi-dominated Lakhimpur, Barabanki, Gonda and Mirzapur districts.Senior SP leaders, as well as 49 party MLAs, have fanned out to the various districts, holding meetings with the district units to finalise the candidates and rope in the independents, said an SP leader.The BJP appears to be in a comfortable position in Badaun, Gorakhpur, Mathura, Agra, Hardoi, Jhansi, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Moradabad, Shahjahanpur, Sambhal, Bhadohi, Saharanpur and Basti districts.Realising that the support of smaller parties will be important in winning the zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts, the BJP has reached out to its alliance partners Apna Dal (Sonelal) and the Nishad party. The BJP leaders are also understood to have held talks with Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) led by Om Prakash Rajbhar.UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal and state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh are holding meetings in various districts to collect feedback from the party office bearers, as well as discussing the poll strategy.The BSP won several ward seats in Azamgarh, Saharanpur, Meerut, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Jalaun, Chitrakoot, Banda and Pratapgarh districts. The independent ward members will play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the candidates fielded by the political parties.That the political parties are leaving no stone unturned to upstage the rivals could be gauged from the fact that BJP has made an independent, Shyam Sunder Verma aka Sadhu Verma, the candidate for the chairman’s post in Ambedkar Nagar district. In Baghpat, it has decided to field rebel SP candidate Baabli Devi. In Jaunpur, the BJP leaders held talks with Srikala, the wife of former MP Dhananjay Singh. In Hathras, the BJP has fielded Seema Upadhyay, wife of rebel BSP MLA Ramveer Upadhyay.In Sitapur, the BJP got a shot in the arm when 12 independent members joined it. The Nishad party ward members announced their support to the BJP in Sultanpur district.In Sant Kabir Nagar district, the SP has fielded independent candidate Baliram Yadav for the chairperson’s post. In Aligarh, the SP earlier announced it was fielding Archana Yadav but later decided to back RLD candidate Rajkumari.In Saharanpur, the BSP has joined hands with the Congress and the BKU (Bhartiya Kisan Union) to work for the victory of its candidate Shimla Devi. In Pratapgarh district, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik led by Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya, holds the key to the victory of the BJP or SP candidates.Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary alleged the BJP was misusing the state government machinery to win the support of independents.BJP leader and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh refuted the SP’s allegation. He said the BJP would win a majority of the zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/direct-bjp-sp-contest-likely-in-district-panchayat-chairpersons-polls-in-uttar-pradesh-101624041086733.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B researchers develop a low-cost way of extracting hydrogen from water||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have developed energy and cost-efficient method of extracting hydrogen from water. This is likely to significantly bring down the cost and time of producing hydrogen gas, which is widely used as a clean fuel as it releases water upon combustion.Conventionally, hydrogen is extracted from water by inserting two electrodes across the water and passing a current through it. Since this is a time-consuming process, chemical elements such as metals are used as catalysts to speed up the process. Metals such as platinum, rhodium, and iridium are used as catalysts for electrolysis but are very expensive.While compounds of cobalt are also well-known catalysts, researchers from the department of chemistry at IIT-B have developed a way of making this catalyst more energy efficient. Their study was published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering on June 2.“We have developed florets of nanostructured hard carbon (used as electrodes in electrolysis). These florets, arranged like a marigold flower, can act as a suitable support for attaching the catalyst. While compounds of Cobalt as a catalyst are well-known, the interface between the catalyst and carbon was developed by us,” said Chandramouli Subramaniam, associate professor, department of chemistry.To speed up the electrolysis, the researchers did not rely on the electric field alone but also introduced magnetic fields. They found that if they introduced a small fridge magnet near their setup, the reaction speed increased about three times.“We found that the electrolysis consumed 19% less energy in a stipulated time when there was a magnetic and electric field in comparison to the electric field alone,” said Jayeeta Saha, lead author and doctoral student at IIT-B.“This is because the catalyst we have designed can sustain the magnetisation for prolonged periods, the key being the development of a synergistic carbon-metal oxide interface. A one-time exposure of the magnetic field is enough to achieve the high speed of hydrogen production for over 45 minutes,” said Saha. Based on the standard market cost of cobalt which is used as a raw material in this study, the catalyst costs at least 800 times lower than platinum.While hydrogen is known as a clean fuel that can reduce emissions from vehicles, in India it is used as a fuel in large steel and cement plants. “There are two major problems in using hydrogen as a fuel in mobility at the moment: the electrolysis is expensive and storage is a concern. We want such innovations to happen in India so the industry can adopt clean technologies soon,” said Pawan Mulukutla, director, electric mobility and head of the hydrogen project at World Resources Institute, India.“We can directly adopt the modified setup in existing electrolysers without any change in design or mode of operation of the electrolysers,” says another author of the study Ranadeb Ball, a former IIT-B student and a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.“The intermittent use of an external magnetic field provides a new direction for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Other catalysts can also be explored for this purpose,” said Subramaniam. The team is now looking forward to industrial partners implementing their findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-researchers-develop-a-low-cost-way-of-extracting-hydrogen-from-water-101624041026599.html

19-06-2021||Delhi||After HC warning, markets in Delhi say onus also on shoppers to be responsible||Within two weeks of the easing of lockdown restrictions and reopening of markets, Covid-appropriate behaviour has gone for a toss in several areas, as crowds throng public spaces in the national capital.Taking cognisance of images of crowded marketplaces in the city, the Delhi high court on Friday called for stricter restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It warned that this may “hasten” the expected third wave, adding, “Gold help us if all that happens!”Traders’ associations said that though they have adopted different measures to control crowding and ensure social distancing, more cooperation was needed from shoppers, especially youngsters, who are “often spotted without masks”.Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, said that the market appointed 28 volunteers on Friday for additional monitoring and enforcement of protocols. “We have also created physical distancing markers outside all shops and are also providing masks to visitors if they don’t have one... We are aware that if the crowd increases, there is a possibility that the market might be sealed. This is against our interests at a time when we are barely making a living,” said Randhawa.Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that roadside encroachments were also making social distancing hard. “All encroachments need to be removed so that there is adequate space for movement... Many hawkers and rickshaw drivers are lax when it comes to masking. The authorities are not doing anything about it. Market associations are not enforcing agencies and can only do so much,” said Bhargava. He also said that it was crucial for the Metro to open all gates since serpentine queues were being witnessed outside.Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders’ association, called for stricter government monitoring. “Recently, we asked a woman to enter the shop after wearing the mask but she hit the owner instead. The government has to come down heavily on such people... We can’t do much,” said Mehra.Mall authorities contended that their facilities were safer. Vineet Parashar, head of operations, V3S mall and V3S East Center Mall, East Delhi, said, “So far, our mall has not seen a lot of footfall. People are yet to return but we are making periodic announcements. In addition to that, if anyone is found to be negligent, our staff will remind them.”An official from a South Delhi-based mall, who did not wish to be named, said that both staff and visitors need to adhere to Covid protocols.“If there is an issue or a customer is unruly, our security steps in but since reopening, most people are abiding by rules,” said the spokesperson.Sucheta Sharma, who visited DLF Promenade in Vasant Kunj this week, said that she wanted a breather after months of staying cooped in. “So far, the crowd doesn’t seem a lot and SOPs are also being followed,” she said.A 70-year-old woman, who came to mall along with family, said that she was a sceptical about going out.“There was a little fear but we are wearing masks and following the other norms,” said the woman, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hc-warning-markets-in-delhi-say-onus-also-shoppers-to-be-responsible-101624040485697.html
19-06-2021||Mumbai||Drivable destinations a hit among travellers||As the impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have weakened in Maharashtra and the country at large, travellers seem to be heading to driveable places either for the weekend, workation or staycations. With decrease in the number of cases in a few states like Maharashtra, governments have started to ease restrictions, resulting in people feeling positive towards stepping out of their homes.To add to the decrease in Covid-19 cases in the current month, the arrival of monsoons has added to the number of Mumbaiites travelling again.Destinations that are easy to drive to or a quick flight away are trending with families, solo travellers, small personal groups, couples and millennials. Micro trips are seen to be a rising travel trend, especially with Gen Z and millennials who see it as the best medium to escape their hectic work-from-home schedules.The Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL), of which Taj Hotels is a subsidiary, said they are seeing green shoots of travel begin to resume. “There has been an increase in demand for vacations at destinations located within driving distances from key cities and staycations within the cities. In and around Maharashtra, IHCL hotels and resorts in destinations such as Nashik have witnessed a substantial increase in occupancies, as have those in Rajasthan, Rishikesh, Theog and Corbett,” IHCL spokesperson said. She added, “IHCL’s ama Stays & Trails bungalows in Madh Island, Lonavala and Khadakvasla and also South Goa, which are at drivable distance from Mumbai and Maharashtra, have seen consecutive bookings. City hotels in Mumbai as well as those in Delhi have seen many takers for staycations especially over weekends.”According to Booking.Com, travellers are looking at alternative accommodation such as resorts and villas, getaways with more privacy and seclusion from the crowd.Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager - South Asia at Booking.com, said, “With the vaccine rollout well underway coupled with lockdown restrictions slowly being lifted across the country, we are noticing pent-up travel demand resurfacing, particularly for domestic destinations. Travellers are looking at shorter booking windows and closer-to-home drivable destinations to reconnect with others and themselves. Based on our recent data, some of the most searched destinations for the month of June in and around Mumbai include Lonavala, Pune, Ahmedabad, Nashik and Vadodara.” Five-star properties and other luxury suites enjoy maximum confidence due to pre-existing traveller trust in these brands as well as the transparency with which they display their sanitisation practices, assuring high standards of hygiene and safety.According to Vikas Chandak, SVP and head – strategic businesses, financial products, partnerships and alliances in InterMiles, as the second wave of Covid-19 peaked in Mumbai, May saw a lull in bookings. However, post unlocking, there has been a 151% increase in flight bookings for June, as compared to May. “We have also seen a tremendous 247% month-on-month increase for domestic hotel bookings via our platform, InterBook,” he said.“This is notably evident as over 90% bookings from April 2021 to June 2021 are for five-star properties in Mumbai, Pune, Lonavala and Nashik. Five-star properties like Trident (Nariman Point), JW Marriott (Juhu), Oxford Golf Resort (Pune) as well as 3+ star properties like The Source at Sula (Nashik) and Hotel Ritz (Pune) witnessed over 600% surge in bookings on InterBook in June 2021,” he added.However, InterMiles clarified that close to 60% accommodation reservations continue to remain instantaneous, with majority of travellers opting for same-day bookings or short lead time bookings.Within a week since restrictions began to ease, MakeMyTrip said that they have seen a jump of nearly 200% in hotel bookings for June. The portal said they are expecting week-on-week recovery to pick pace further as cases continue to drop further. “Booking patterns on MakeMyTrip indicate that confidence is building back in travel with cancellations being limited to only 10% of overall bookings being made on the platform for June. We are also seeing people book weekend getaways and staycations with many booking hotels for a minimum of two to three nights. Pricing for breakfast only packages continues to remain more or less the same as rates in January and February this year,” said Vipul Prakash, chief operating officer, MakeMyTrip. It is also observed that villas are now being perceived as a premium experience, given the privacy and exclusivity on offer. Villa stays have been a popular trend worldwide and is now a fast emerging trend in India.“Staying indoors for many months has created a strong pent up urge for travel, and people are eager to connect and travel once again. With restrictions beginning to ease in Maharashtra, we are seeing a rise in search for stays in destinations that are a short drive away such as Karjat, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar, Alibag. Unique accommodation formats, such as villas and farmhouses that have an assortment of outdoor amenities or are laden with luxury features, remain highly sought after,” said Simran Kodesia, communications head, Airbnb, India and South East Asia.Travellers are opting for non-standard, eclectic accommodation such as colonial bungalows, plantation villas, heritage properties and palaces for non-standard/unique experiences like additional dining experiences, unique sightseeing, private transport and travel insurance. “Properties in Alibag, Lonavala, Goa, Mahabaleshwar, and Nashik are receiving enquiries and bookings. There has been an increase of over 300% for enquiries, which have been from key metros and tier-2 and tier-3 markets,” said Daniel D’souza, president and country head, Leisure, SOTC Travel. In order to attract travellers, SOTC has come up with ‘Holiday First and Pay Later’ offer for select states. To better understand consumer behaviours and travel needs, SOTC surveyed over 4,000 customers in June 2021 and found that 18% travellers are ready to travel immediately post unlock; 21% in next three months; 30% within six months; 31% in 2022. The survey also highlighted that travellers prefer flexible travel policies and health and safety are top priorities. It further found that around 81% respondents are seeking refundable/zero cancellation products.“We are seeing a surge of over 400% for villa accommodation in June vs May 2020, primarily for Maharashtra,” said Rajeev Kale, president and country head – holidays, MICE, visa, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd.“Our data in June highlights significant and growing demand for our Maharashtra villa staycations and workations from large/extended families and groups of young working professionals and friends, with source markets extending across Mumbai, Pune and tier-2 cities like Nagpur, Indore, Surat/Baroda and primarily for Alibag, Lonavala and Panchgani properties. With prices ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹30,000 per night for three- or four-bedroom villas, properties with swimming pool and garden/open areas are in high demand. A majority of the queries start with requirements for a weekend, but stays are being extended with growing interest for 10-15 days and more,” Kale added.However, there are some inhibitions due to inter-state travel restrictions, especially in states like Maharashtra where all passengers travelling by air are required to produce a negative RT-PCR report. Zubin Saxena, managing director and vice president operations, Radisson Hotel Group, South Asia, said, “Weekend occupancies in leisure destinations like Karjat and Alibag are beginning to show recovery compared to last month. We are also seeing enquiries for weddings and corporate bookings in destinations like Alibag and Ahmedabad. However, owing to fluid situations in government norms, guests are exercising caution in confirming these bookings. These are still early trends and a more definitive picture will emerge over the next few weeks. We remain hopeful that business will pick up as more states ease restrictions and pent up demand strengthens.”The Machan, an eco resort near Lonavala, has been a go-to place for weekend getaways and it is completely packed for the month. “At The Machan, we are socially distant by design, with only 29 Machans on a 25-acre property. Our goal has always been to provide our guests a getaway from city life that is steeped in nature affording them a chance to - Disconnect to Connect. With a keen focus on the health and safety of our staff and our guests we have found that travellers from Mumbai, Pune and beyond have honoured us by making us one of the most sought after travel destinations in India. On account of being cooped up in our homes during these rolling lockdowns, we find that the need to escape our city confines is greater than it has ever been. This is clearly reflected in our bookings funnels as the Month of June was completely full before we even entered the month,” said Sanat Hooja, partner, Machan Resorts.Raj Rabadia, a Vile Parle resident who had booked a villa in Lonavala, said, “The pandemic has forced us to be glued to our homes since long. As soon as I learn that the state is seeing lesser Covid cases now, I decided to spend a weekend with my friends and booked a villa to have some time out from our work-from-home lives.” Indraneel Sadadekar, an Andheri resident who decided to visit Amby Valley during weekdays, said, “I decided to stay in a villa for two weekdays with my family to spend some quality time and celebrate an occasion. We did not consider any other property than a villa for safety reasons. Travelling to a place near Mumbai and getting to breathe in some fresh air was much needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drivable-destinations-a-hit-among-travellers-101624039825794.html

Traffic police advised commuters to use Delhi Metro and other public transport modes to avoid congestion.Vikram Singh, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), central zone, on Friday said that vehicles will not be allowed on the main Chandni Chowk road -- Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque -- from 9am to 9pm on all days, starting Saturday.“Only emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, fire tenders, hearse vans, and any other vehicle carrying pregnant women and patients, will be excused from the restrictions,” Singh said.The restrictions, however, will not apply on HC Sen Marg to Jubilee Cinema cut (opposite Gandhi Maidan parking); Rai Kedarnath Marg towards main Chandni Chowk Road to Rai Kedar Nath Marg T-Point (Town Hall entry road); Kachha Bagh Road, including Chandni Chowk metro station and Ramjas Senior Secondary School no-3, to main Chandni Chowk Road; Shanti Desai Marg towards main Chandni Chowk Road to Shanti Desai Marg T-Point (Town Hall exit road); and on the road leading to Bagh Diwar Park up to main Chandni Chowk Road (behind Dangal Maidan parking).Other roads where free movement of traffic will be allowed are Netaji Subhash Marg, Jama Masjid Road up to Chawri Bazar Road crossing, Chawri Bazar Road up to Hauz Qazi Chowk, Lal Kuan Road to Katra Bariyan Road T-point, and Katra Bariyan Road up to Fatehpuri Mosque T-Point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-traffic-police-notify-plan-to-block-vehicles-in-chandni-chowk-101624039707607.html
19-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Waqf board inks deal to repair Masjid Mubarak Begum, restore it to its former glory||The nearly 200-year-old Masjid Mubarak Begum’s central dome, which was damaged due to heavy rain last year, will be restored to its former glory with the help of an international heritage site preservation fund, officials of the Delhi Waqf board (DWB) said.Mehfooz Mohammad, section officer, DWB, said the board has already inked an agreement with World Monument Fund (WMF) -- a non-profit organisation that provides direct financial and technical support for preservation of heritage sites across the globe -- on the directions of the Waqf board CEO Tanvir Ahmed, and work on repairing one of the mosque’s three domes that collapsed due to heavy rain in July last year “will begin soon”. WMF officials said the work should be completed in “four-five months”.Waqf board officials said WMF approached the board with an offer to help in August last year. “We are hopeful that the mosque will be restored to its former glory. Work will be carried out on the central dome as well as some others areas damaged by the dome collapse,” said Mohammad, adding that the board had signed the agreement with Christopher Jeannopoulos, chief financial and administrative officer, WMF.Amita Baig, executive director, WMF India, said, “We are going to restore the broken dome and fix other portions inside. While we hope to complete the project in four to five months, there might be delays due to the pandemic.”Commissioned in 1822Masjid Mubarak Begum was commissioned in 1822 by Mubarak Begum, the wife of David Ochterlony, the first British Resident to the Mughal court after the British conquest of Delhi, said author and historian Swapna Liddle. Located in Old Delhi’s Hauz Qazi Chowk, the mosque is built using sandstone and painted in terracotta colour.Liddle said that conservation experts should take appropriate measures for the mosque’s repair and maintenance while factoring in its historical importance.“Mubarak Begum commissioned the construction of the mosque, and lived in a haveli next to it. She was well-respected and exercised much influence. People who wanted to approach Ochterlony would go through her. She was popularly called ‘Generalee Begum’ as Ochterlony was known as General Ochterlony,” said Liddle.She added that Begum remained active for a long time, and was a frequent visitor at the courts of Bahadur Shah Zafar and Akbar Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-waqf-board-inks-deal-to-repair-masjid-mubarak-begum-restore-it-to-its-former-glory-101624039706998.html
19-06-2021||Delhi||Showers in store for Capital over weekend, predicts Met||The national capital is expected to receive light to moderate rainfall and thunder during the weekend as it awaits the arrival of the monsoon, the India Meteorological Department said on Friday.“Pre-monsoon showers are likely over the weekend, with rain and thunder likely to cover the entire city. Light rains will start from Saturday, and will intensify by Sunday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. He added that residents will have to wait a little longer for the official arrival of monsoon.On Friday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 36.6°C, three degrees below what is considered normal for this time of year. The minimum temperature here was 25.1°C, three degrees below normal.At the Palam observatory, the maximum temperature was 35.2°C, five degrees below normal, and the minimum temperature was 24.6°C, three degrees below normal.IMD forecasts about the monsoon have been consistently wrong this season.Last week, IMD announced that monsoon was expected to advance in the entire northwest India and hit Delhi by June 15. However, Met officials later retracted the forecast and said that the onset of monsoon had slowed down and is likely to take at least another week before it covers the Capital.On Thursday, IMD predicted that the monsoon will reach Delhi in five days.Some parts of Delhi and NCR received a brief spell of rain on Thursday, which also led to a slight drop in temperatures.The rain and the increased wind speeds on Thursday also led to an improvement in air quality on Friday.The Central Pollution Control Board recordings show that on Friday, Delhi’s overall air quality index was 81, in the satisfactory category. This was an improvement from Thursday’s 108 — moderate on the AQI scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imdpredicts-light-to-moderate-rain-in-delhi-over-the-weekend-101624039645730.html
19-06-2021||Delhi||Private CBSE students say new plan puts them at a disadvantage||Class 12 students enrolled in the CBSE’s private, or patrachar, programme and those scheduled to appear in compartment tests for a second time opposed the board’s decisions to conduct exams for them, even as it announced an alternate assessment policy for regular students on Thursday. Several students in the private programme on Friday said the decision throws their futures into uncertainty, and demanded alternative assessment criterion.Shashwat Anand, 18, a private CBSE Class 12 candidate, said, “How can we predict when the situation will become conducive [for exams]? If the board has cancelled exams for regular students, why do we not get the same treatment? Most universities will start admissions as soon as Class 12 results are declared. What will we do then?”Students in the private programme are those not enrolled in any school, but registered with the CBSE for the Class 10 and 12 board exams. Last year, around 30,000 such students were registered for the Class 12 CBSE exams. Apart from students who need to appear for a second compartment test, also excluded from CBSE’s new Class 12 assessment formula are those who filled the improvement forms in order to appear for the test again. Last year, 29,000 students appeared in the Class 12 exams to improve their scores.Every year, students enrolled in the programme take exams with regular students and their results are announced together.Child rights activist and advocate Anubha Shrivastava Sahai, who earlier filed a petition demanding that all board exams be cancelled due to the pandemic, on Friday tweeted that she along with other lawyers would move an intervention petition on behalf of private and compartment students in the Supreme Court.The approved mechanism for CBSE includes a 30:30:40 formula, which takes into account a student’s performance in the last three examinations (the 12th pre-board, the 11th finals, and the 10th board) to settle at a score for the theory component of the examination.However, CBSE, in its notification, said, “For private, partrachar and 2nd chance compartment candidates, etc., the examination will be conducted by the Board as and when the conditions become conducive.”Several students on Friday tweeted with the #CancelCBSEprivateexam hashtag. “We too are CBSE students like those enrolled in schools. It should not waste our year,” said Prateek Raghav, another private Class 12 candidate.Shashank Singh, 19, who completed Class 12 last year but applied to appear in the improvement exams this year, on Friday submitted an appeal in CBSE’s Preet Vihar headquarters. “Since CBSE will declare the results of regular students before they do for private students, universities will admit those who have their results in hand... Please provide equal opportunities to private students to take admissions,” he said in the letter.CBSE’s controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj said the board will try to find a solution. “We are working on this issue and will come out with a policy favourable for these students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/private-cbse-students-say-new-plan-puts-them-at-a-disadvantage-101624039585713.html
19-06-2021||Pune||Rise in demand for spike protein antibody tests among vaccine beneficiaries||The spike protein antibody test has gained a lot of buzz among vaccine beneficiaries. After inoculation, many beneficiaries are undergoing the test to detect the presence of proteins created by the immune system to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A private lab in Pune has observed a 25% surge in people opting for the antibody test in June as compared to April and May.According to medical experts, there are spike proteins in coronavirus that attach to the human cell and then the Covid infects the humans. There has been a lot of interest among people regarding the spike protein antibody test as soon as the vaccination drive was started for everyone.Dr Sanjay Ingle, zonal technical head (west) and consultant pathologist, Apollo Diagnostics, said, “This test targets antibodies that are directed against the spike proteins which allow the coronavirus to penetrate the human body and prevent one from contracting the virus. Majority of the vaccines which are available now, create an antibody response against the spike protein. People taking the test are keen to know how their bodies are reacting to the vaccine when it comes to the development of antibodies. This test helps understand the level of immunity obtained by vaccination. The spike protein antibodies tend to develop after two weeks of the second dose of vaccination. It is advisable to get this test done after 28 days of the second dose of vaccine.”The lab conducted about 160 antibodies tests in two months in which all the samples tested positive for antibodies.Dr Ingle said, “Once the spike protein is detected means the body has produced antibodies against the spike protein which is the infectious component of coronavirus. If you have a high number of antibodies after you are fully vaccinated then your chances of covid infection will be less. More and more people should go for it to know the immune status post-vaccination and assess their health. After a vaccine is administered, it is essential to know the antibody level in order to evaluate any change after complete vaccination.”“Many people are going for spike protein antibody tests, before and after inoculation, to check the level of antibodies formed in the body to fight Covid-19. But, people must opt for this test only after consulting a doctor. Do it when the doctor recommends you,” said Dr Sanjay Nagarkar, general physician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rise-in-demand-for-spike-protein-antibody-tests-among-vaccine-beneficiaries-in-pune-101624035085417.html

The court refused to pass “any order at this stage.”The bench observed, “Having gone through the entire petition, we are of the view that the petitioner has not done much research work in respect of rites and customs, which are prevalent among various communities living along the bank of river Ganga.”“Therefore, we are not inclined at this stage to cause any indulgence instead to allow the petitioner to withdraw the petition with a liberty to file fresh petition after inquiry and research in respect of the practice of last rites in various communities that are residing along the bank of Ganga. With a liberty above, the petition stands disposed of as withdrawn”, added the bench.The Bench comprising chief justice Sanjay Yadav and justice Prakash Padia disposed of the petition filed by one Pranvesh.The petitioner’s plea was that during the second wave of Covid-19, there were many who succumbed to the disease, but were not cremated properly and the state government must be directed to perform the cremation according to religious rites and dispose of the bodies buried near Ganga at different ghats in Prayagraj as early as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-allows-withdrawal-of-pil-seeking-disposal-of-bodies-buried-near-ganga-101624034545441.html

19-06-2021||Lucknow||UP farmer’s son cleared JEE Main, but chose to serve the Army||The passing-out parade of the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun was held on June 12. It was a big moment for Anuj Dhariwal, 21, of Bharwara village of Sambhal district in UP, who has now been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Indian Army.“After the passing-out parade, I went home to share the joyous moment with my parents. Normally, parents are invited for the ceremony, but this didn’t happen this time due to the pandemic,” said Lieutenant Anuj Dhariwal, an alumnus of VidyaGyan (Bulandshahr). He looks forward to serve the country and motivate other village youth like him to join the forces.“I wanted to prove a point to all youngsters of this village that lack of resources cannot be a hurdle if you’re determined to achieve something in life,” said Anuj, whose father Mahendra Singh is a farmer with a meagre income of ₹1 lakh.While growing up, Anuj looked up to one of his maternal uncles who served in the Indian army. Given his family’s limited resources, Anuj’s goal seemed like a distant dream till he secured admission at Shiv Nadar Foundation’s VidyaGyan in 2010 (in Class 6). In 2017, after Class 12 he got into the NDA, Pune, where he stayed for three years and then went to the IMA, Dehradun.“In Class 12, we were exposed to multiple career options. I was preparing for JEE. I also had a chance to have a special interaction with Col (Retd) Gopal Karunakaran from the Shiv Nadar Foundation. It was an inspiring experience and he spoke to us about the positive aspects of working with the armed forces. Subsequently, I took the NDA test, which I cleared along with the SSB, and the rest is history,” said Anuj.On the misconceptions about the armed forces, Anuj said, “Students assume that one wouldn’t have to study as much as one did while preparing for the IITs. But NDA is no cakewalk, it’s a lot of physical and mental training and as difficult as preparing for the IITs.”Anuj’s rural background helped him during training sessions. “I am from a rural background and it helped. We used to play a lot in villages earlier and I used to help my father with farming, which allowed me to stay physically fit and also have the mental strength to overcome tough tasks. As I was physically fit, I didn’t face any struggle in the physical trainings at the academy,” he added.“Through his seven years at school, Anuj was nurtured and supported by his teachers to pursue his dream,” said Bishwajit Banerjee, principal of VidyaGyan, Bulandshahr.He scored 93.6% in Class 12 exams and cleared the JEE Main in 2017. However, Anuj chose to go for the National Defence Academy (NDA) and was successful when he cleared the written as well as the Service Selection Board interview.Anuj is not the only student from VidyaGyan to qualify the NDA. Seven others are currently at the academy undergoing the rigorous training programme.VidyaGyan is a residential co-ed school that offers free world-class education to rural, underprivileged meritorious students from families with an annual income of less than ₹1 lakh. They conduct entrance test to tap poor meritorious students who are about to clear Class 5. At VidyaGyan, the school starts from Class 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-farmer-s-son-cleared-jee-main-but-chose-to-serve-the-army-101624029866785.html
