18-06-2021||Mumbai||Kandivli Covid vax scam: Five camp organisers arrested||Kandivli police on Friday arrested five persons in connection with the vaccination scam at Hiranandani Heritage housing society whose members alleged that the vaccination camp organisers had given 390 members of their society Covishield shots from bottles with broken seals.The five men are identified as Mahendra Kuldip Singh, 39; Sanjay Gupta, 34; Chandan Singh, 32; Nitin Mode, 32; and Karim Ali, 21. Police officers said the accused have confessed to having organised such camps in nine other societies before holding a camp at Hiranandani Heritage.Dilip Sawant, deputy commissioner of police (zone 11), said they are now investigating to find out the names of the societies. According to police, Mahendra Singh and his associates had no authorisation from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) or any other authority to set up vaccination camps or administer vaccines. During investigation, the police also found out there was no medical officer present at the camps held by the group.After the residents filed a written complaint, the police recorded statements of society members and representatives of the hospitals whose certificates were given to the members.“We found that Sanjay Gupta and Chandan Singh, both of whom work for private hospitals, used to procure the vaccines while Karim Ali used to procure the certificates,” said an officer from Kandivli police station. The police are now finding out the sources from where and how the vaccine doses and certificates given to the beneficiaries were procured, and whether the Covishield bottles were usable, since their seals were already open.Police officers said residents were charged ₹1,260 per jab and none of the beneficiaries had any side effects. The housing society paid Singh a total of ₹4.56 lakh.Police said Singh had approached Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association (HHRWS), a managing body representing three buildings in the residential complex at Kandivli (West), and offered to set up a vaccination camp aided by Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri.On May 30, 390 members were inoculated but they were not registered on the Co-WIN portal. After seven-eight days, the residents started getting messages about their vaccination certificates from two private hospitals — Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline hospitals, and the civic-run Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon, which does not even hold vaccination in societies.The five men have been booked under sections 268 (public nuisance), 270 (doing any act known to spread infection or disease dangerous to life), 274 (admiration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 419 (impersonation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467, 468, 470 (forging document) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 43 and 66(e) of the Information Technology Act.All the five were presented before Borivli magistrate court and remanded in police custody till June 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kandivli-covid-vax-scam-five-camp-organisers-arrested-101624040965796.html

18-06-2021||Delhi||‘Baba ka dhaba’ owner lands in hospital after overdose, family says he was ‘under pressure’||Kanta Prasad, the owner of Baba ka Dhaba, a nondescript roadside eatery in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, was admitted to Safdarjung hospital on Thursday after overdosing on alcohol and sleeping pills, even as the police tried to ascertain if the incident was an accident, or if the 81-year-old tried to take his life. Prasad’s family members said the octogenarian was depressed and “under pressure”.Officials at Safdarjung hospital said Prasad was stable but critical, and was put on a ventilator.The police said his family found Prasad unconscious at the dhaba, and took him to a nearby private hospital, which referred him to Safdarjung hospital. Prasad and his dhaba shot to fame overnight in October last year after a city YouTuber, Gaurav Wasan, shared a video showing Prasad in tears, telling him how he struggled to make ends meet as business dried up. The viral video led to thousands of people making a beeline to the couple’s eatery for food, selfies and donating money.He later opened a new restaurant, which was shut in February due to a shortage of business.The octogenarian also filed a cheating case against Wasan after accusing him of allegedly siphoning off donations, a charge that the YouTuber refuted. Last week, the two posed for photographs at his dhaba and claimed they were on good terms. Prasad’s son Karan, however, alleged that his father was depressed because some people, including a few YouTubers, were “pressuring him to withdraw the cheating case and reach a compromise with Wasan.”“My father was being constantly asked to withdraw the case and patch up with Wasan. It was the main reason behind my father’s depression. He was not telling us anything about it, but we could see he was under pressure,” said Karan, without specifying whom he was speaking about.When contacted, Wasan refused to comment. “Doctors asked us to take my father to a bigger hospital as his condition was serious. We brought him to Safdarjung hospital. My father consumed alcohol and an overdose of sleeping pills in an attempt to kill himself,” added Karan.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the facility informed the police of Prasad’s hospitalisation around 11.15pm on Thursday. The police then collected the MLC (medico-legal case), which pinned his unconsciousness on the intake of alcohol and sleeping pills as the cause of unconsciousness, he said.“Karan’s statement was recorded,” added DCP Thakur.Speaking to reporters, Prasad’s wife, Badaami Devi, said. “I am clueless about what happened to him. I was at the dhaba. He fainted and we took him to the hospital around 4 pm (on Thursday). No one has told us anything about his condition,” she said.An official from Safdarjung hospital, who asked not to be named, said, “He is on ventilator after an overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol. He is critical but stable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-lands-in-hospital-after-overdose-family-says-he-was-under-pressure-101624040425913.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||55 years on, Shiv Sena looks to grow beyond its traditional strongholds||For the Shiv Sena, which completes 55 years today, a large chunk of its journey has been in the opposition or without administrative power. However, in the past 19 months, the party is on a climb on the back of the chief minister’s seat and his performance — primarily the handling of Covid-19. The party has found an opportunity in the pandemic to expand itself from traditional stronghold of Mumbai, Thane and Konkan region to a pan-Maharashtra reach. The Sena is looking to bank on party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s handling of Covid-19 crisis as the chief minister (CM) as its major card in the upcoming electoral battles.Founded on June 19, 1966 by Bal Thackeray, the Shiv Sena emerged from a movement for preferential treatment for Maharashtrians over migrants in Mumbai when it comes to job opportunities. Over the next few decades, it became a substantial political entity in the state politics. It tasted power at the state-level twice before getting the CM’s chair following a major political realignment in 2019. Since then, the party’s fortunes have changed, as senior Sena leaders put it.The Covid-19 outbreak has provided an unexpected opportunity to the Sena and Thackeray, who was criticised and questioned about his ability to lead the government as he lacked any administrative experience. With a soft demeanour, unlike his father Bal Thackeray, he has made a mark with his direct communication with the citizens.A reluctant entrant into politics and an accidental CM was looked at as a “non-entity” in the party, a senior Sena functionary said. “He was considered a non-entity by many people within the Sena and outside during Balasaheb’s era and even shortly after he passed away. But the manner in which he has changed, steered the party through tough decisions, and he went from being non-entity to a legitimate leader. Even our allies have been pleasantly surprised by his way of functioning,” the functionary said requesting anonymity.The Sena now intends to capitalise on the “popularity” of Thackeray as CM in its upcoming political outings. “Uddhavji has different style of functioning. He has a great connect with people, including Shiv Sainiks. He has utilised this knack during this pandemic… Naturally, this will become our major card electorally. He is now connected to the people of Maharashtra through his addresses to the state,” said Arvind Sawant, Sena deputy leader and party’s chief spokesperson.Senior Sena leader and minister Subhash Desai said a new chapter of the party’s growth has commenced. “We are growing leaps and bounds now. People have the confidence now that this party can deliver. A new chapter of our growth story has started. The popularity of Uddhavji as CM is such that not just the Sena but other parties [in the alliance] also benefit. Currently, there is no leader is as popular as Uddhavji,” Desai said.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said Thackeray has steered the party from an existential crisis after Thackeray senior’s demise into a major political force. “Thackeray managed to bring his party out of existential crisis after Bal Thakeray’s death. He took some key decisions for political survival in 2014 and 2019 when it snapped ties with the BJP. He has shown good leadership so far in handling of the pandemic. He has remained honest and transparent with the people,” Jondhale said.Over the past one year, the Sena has faced bitter campaigns against the party in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, as a member of the Thackeray family was indirectly linked to the case. The party also faced embarrassment after allegations of crime against a woman emerged against one it its cabinet ministers, Sanjay Rathod, who was asked to resign. Desai, who has seen the party since its inception, said the party has seen major changes with a Thackeray becoming the chief minister. The Sena that started off from nativist politics has now grown into the governance role. “The major change now is that we are a ruling party since the past two years. We are growing in the role of ruling party. It is not that we did not have power earlier. The first yuti sarkar [with BJP in 1995] was 25 years back. The feeling among Shiv Sainiks with the previous [Fadnavis] government was that it was not ‘our’ government, we did not feel any ownership with that government. Now with Uddhav saheb as the CM it has changed,” said Desai. However, the Sena is yet to face a major electoral challenge which is expected to come in the form of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, in February next year, where it will face its former ally, BJP. Jondhale said BMC polls will be a major challenge for the Sena. Another political analyst Hemant Desai added, “The Sena will have to pick votes on Uddhav Thackeray’s popularity. He has dealt with the pandemic and other issues well.”Jondhale said the Sena has chalked an “independent road” for itself after cutting off ties with the BJP. Now with talks of a new political alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party, the Sena is expected to grow, he said. Hemant Desai added, “There is a common thread for both parties — Sena and NCP, both are regional. Maharashtra has not seen a regional party government so far. One national party has always remained in the alliance with a regional party. There is a chance for the Sena to grow in MVA and if the Congress moves out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/55-years-on-shiv-sena-looks-to-grow-beyond-its-traditional-strongholds-101624039765712.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Route Mumbai-Hyderabad bullet train through Marathwada, demands Ashok Chavan||Public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan has demanded that the state should suggest connectivity of the proposed high-speed rail corridor between Mumbai and Hyderabad through Marathwada region. Chavan made the demand through a letter to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, saying the state should ask the Centre to take the route from Aurangabad, Jalna and Nanded up to Hyderabad. Currently, the proposed high-speed rail corridor is passing through Raigad, Pune and Solapur districts of the state. However, the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) has already started the LiDar survey of the proposed route to prepare the final alignment as detailed project report (DPR) for the corridor.In the letter, which Chavan handed over to CM, the minister outlined the need and convenience the project would bring to the region, which is considered backward. “NHSRCL is working to setup a bullet train corridor between Mumbai and Hyderabad via Pune and Solapur. But Marathwada is not getting its due, as per this plan. For the Mumbai-Hyderabad bullet train, a route through Aurangabad-Jalna-Nanded is also available. Therefore, the state must immediately send a proposal to the Centre to alter the route,” the letter said.The minister further said the department will start land acquisition for the proposed extension of the Jalna-Nanded connector to the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway. “For this highway project, land is being acquired. It is possible to extend the Mumbai-Nagpur bullet train project to Jalna-Nanded. The same route can be extended from Nanded to Hyderabad,” he suggested.Meanwhile, in a meeting, Thackeray directed officials to expedite work on Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway. Phase one of the 701-km expressway between Nagpur and Shirdi, which was expected to be commissioned on May 1, this year, is 72% completed. The CM also directed officials to ensure facilities for motorists including petrol pumps are set up on the 701-km which is named after Sena founder Bal Thackeray.The CM also took stock of the proposed coastal highway being undertaking by PWD to connect Mumbai and Konkan regions, and Versova-Bandra Sea Link in Mumbai, which is undertaken by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). Stating that the Coastal highway project is crucial for connectivity and tourism development in Konkan, Thackeray said the highway should be a four-lane road and the planning should be in a manner that the least amount of land acquisition would be required for the project. He also added that priority should be given to flyover works on the existing highway.He also reviewed the progress of the projects undertaken by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), including Metro rail projects and Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL). According to a statement from the CM’s office, around 35% to 40% of the work on the 21.8-km MTHL project has been completed so far, and the link connecting is expected to be commissioned by September 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/route-mumbai-hyderabad-bullet-train-through-marathwada-demands-ashok-chavan-101624039705664.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No entrance test for junior college, colleges, says Uday Samant||State minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant on Friday clarified that no entrance exams will be conducted for admission to junior college and colleges under state universities for students who completed Class 10 and 12, respectively. Admissions will be carried out based on their board marks and not any entrance exam, Samant said in a conference in the city. “Qualifications required for those seeking direct admission to second-year engineering diploma courses earlier had to compulsorily clear subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology. Henceforth, from the 2021-22 academic year, students can clear three out of any of these subjects including computer science, business studies, electronics and information technology among others in order to directly admit such students,” said Samant.In a major relief to students from the disputed Maharashtra-Karnataka border area, Samant said the candidates will not have to produce certificate claiming they are from the “disputed” area. These students faced difficulties in obtaining the certificate from the local competent authorities in Karnataka. A government official said the move signifies that the state government cares for people in the region. From now on, these students can seek admissions in Maharashtra simply by mentioning the region, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-no-entrance-test-for-junior-college-colleges-says-uday-samant-101624039406311.html

Patil is on four-day tour of Mumbai and is meeting key leaders from Maharashtra and Mumbai.Party Mumbai unit chief Ashok Jagtap and other leaders held a meeting with Patil on Friday evening and discussed election-related plans. “He took review of Mumbai unit’s performance and achievement of the targets set in last three months. AICC has given us programme for the civic polls and review of its implementation is taken every three months. Our Mumbai leaders apprised him of the programmes undertaken since April. We also discussed the plan for BMC elections slated to be held early next year,” said a party leader.Another leader said Jagtap held three meetings with Patil over the past three days and discussed various issues with him. “We already have announced to go solo in the election and insisted on approval from the party high command. The leader was updated about the reasons behind the decision. He was also updated about the strategy being chalked out for campaign and picking right candidates for the polls,” he said.Patil met key leaders and state ministers from the state on Thursday. He also had one-on-one meeting with senior party leaders and office-bearers of the frontal organization.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole reiterated party’s stand and said he complemented the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over their plan of joining hands in the forthcoming local bodies and Assembly polls. “We have already announced to go solo in the forthcoming elections and we are firm on it. If the Sena and NCP want to fight them together, we complement them,” he said. Charan Singh Sapra, working president of Mumbai Congress, said, “We apprised Patil saheb of compliance of the target set by AICC. We also reiterated our stand of going solo in the BMC polls, to which he said the party high command will stand by the sentiments of the leaders in Mumbai. Going solo will help the party in expanding our base in Mumbai by giving fair opportunity to the workers who have been working hard for five years. Secondly, it will also help us in not carrying the baggage of anti-incumbency of the Shiv Sena which is in the power for more than 25 years.”Patole’s announcement of going independent had invited sharp reaction from its two ruling allies. The NCP had taunted Patole saying there was no harm in dreaming to become chief minister. Sena’s Sanjay Raut had said if the Congress decides to go solo, other two ruling parties will have to come together in the interest of the state.The state and city units of the Congress are celebrating party leader Rahul Gandhi’s birthday as Sankalp Divas. Former minister and party MLA Sunil Deshmukh is set to rejoin the party on Saturday in the presence of key party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-discusses-plan-to-go-solo-in-mumbai-civic-polls-101624039405707.html

Earlier, Yadav had also accused the BJP of engaging in horse-trading for the polls.He said the SP had recently complained to the state police chief in this regard, but to no avail.Polling for the election of zila panchayat chairpersons in UP will be held on July 3. ZP chiefs are elected indirectly from among the members of zila panchayats of various districts.A statement issued by the SP quoted Yadav as saying, “The BJP is upset over its defeat in the panchayat elections. Not having the numbers, the distraught BJP leadership is misusing government machinery to ensure that their party nominees win the posts of zila panchayat chairpersons.” “This is a gross misuse of power and democracy is in danger due to these repressive policies,” he added.In the UP panchayat elections held in April, the BJP won just eight out of the 40 zila panchayat seats in Ayodhya while the SP claimed that candidates it backed won 22 seats.The result was particularly poor for the BJP in the Sohawal sub-district with the party drawing a blank. The SP claimed to have won three of the four zila panchayat seats there, leaving one for an independent candidate.Yadav alleged that in Auraiya, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Etah, Hapur, Siddharthnagar, Rampur, Gorakhpur and Farrukhabad, the BJP is openly victimising elected zila panchayat members of the SP and those supported by it.He claimed that family members of panchayat members are also being harassed in different ways.Yadav warned the BJP that it will have to face “massive public outrage” if it tries to get its people elected as zila panchayat chairpersons by misusing police, administration and power of money.In another release, SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the party has suspended former zila panchayat chairman of Baghpat, Omkar Yadav, and former district unit president, Kiran Pal alias ‘Billu’, for six years for indulging in “anti-party activities.” (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-using-state-machinery-to-secure-votes-for-its-candidates-says-akhilesh-101624039165680.html

Bilari worked with stalwart farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait since the beginning of the BKU’s movement in 1987. He was among the four farmer leaders who were booked under NSA in 1997 after they carried out a 110-day movement which resulted in the death of five farmers in police firing. He formed his own organisation BKU( Asli) after the death of Mahendra Singh Tikait in 2011 and has been raising issues of farmers. Bilari is now associated with the 40-member Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the farmers movement. The veteran farmer leader said that farmers were protesting against the three contentious farm laws for over six months but the government had no time for a dialogue with them to resolve the issue. Under such circumstances it was now time to intensify the movement in Uttar Pradesh on the lines of Punjab and Haryana. “A more intensified movement in UP would mount pressure on the government as the state will go to election in the beginning of next year,” said Bilari who has conceptualized ‘ Mission 1000 villages’. Elaborating upon his mission, he said the idea was to reach out to people in 1000 villages of western UP in the coming three months and to associate villagers, especially youngsters, with the movement. “I have started visiting villages since the past one week and so far, covered over 100 villages,” claimed Bilari who has set a target of visiting at least 12 villages daily. The organization’s general secretary Surendra Singh claimed to have received overwhelming response in villages because according to him, in the past six months people had understood importance of the movement. “Legalization of minimum support price (MSP) and repeal of the three farm laws are the demands of protesting farmers and in villages, people now understand their importance. They are, therefore, extending support to the movement”, said Singh. Bilari has visited villages in Sambhal and Amroha districts along with other farmer leaders and supporters and in coming days, they will meet farmers and villagers in Bulandshahr, Hapur, Hathras, Amroha, Rampur, Badaun and Moradabad districts of western UP. The farmers’ leaders aim to associate village youths with the movement, so they get involved in activities which fascinate youngsters. During his visit to Gelua village of Sambhal district, Bilari inaugurated an inter village cricket match and in Mandli village he distributed prizes to cricketers.“Involvement in such activities helps in bringing youngsters closer to us and the movement as well”, he explained. Meanwhile, in its bid to mobilize the masses, the organisation has planned a ‘vehicle rally’ on June 21 in which more than 300 vehicles would gather at Gajraula town of Amroha district and reach Ghazipur border in Delhi after covering a distance of almost 100 kms. The organisation has also planned two big rallies in Dhanaura of Bijnor district and in Sambhal in July to give momentum to the movement. Bilari and his team believe that instead of staging dharna at toll plazas of Meerut and Moradabad regions, supporters of BKU who follow the directions of Rakesh and Naresh Tikait should make all toll plazas free. “It is beyond my understanding why they are simply staging dharna at toll plazas since May 26. They should get them made free for passengers as farmers had done in Haryana and Punjab. Only then would the government listen to farmers,” he said.

Although, there is no need to panic, caution is necessary. The current season invites all kinds of diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria and encephalitis among others. Considering the sensitivity of the area, the state government has started preparations in this regard, be it cleanliness, sanitisation, fogging or aggressive vaccination.”He also said 73,000 nigrani samitis (monitoring committees) will conduct door-to-door screening in villages to identify children with symptoms like fever, cough and provide them with medicine kits from June 26.Those found with fever or cough-like symptoms will be examined by the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), if needed.The chief minister also said the state had administered more than 2.46 crore (24.6 million) vaccine doses till now.“From June 21, the state will start administering around six lakhs doses a day, while from July the target is to give at least 10 to 12 lakh (1-1.2 million) doses every day. Vaccination will also take place in the village panchayat ghar.”He also inspected the Ballia district hospital where he interacted with patients in the post-Covid ward.In Varanasi, he instructed officials to ensure the oxygen plant at the Haathi Bazar community health centre was installed at the earliest.Yogi, who recently adopted the 30-bed CHC, provided 10 oxygen concentrators to it on Friday.

It has ordered all district magistrates to undertake this ‘time-bound’ and ‘important’ drive in both rural and urban areas of their districts between June 20 and June 30 on top priority and ensure that no open borewell holes remain in any district, officials said.The move follows UP CM Yogi Adityanath taking cognisance of the latest incident in which a four-year-old child fell into a 150-foot-deep open borewell while playing, in Dhariyai village, in Agra, on June 14, necessitating a rescue operation that lasted eight hours, they added.Additional Chief Secretary (revenue) Renuka Kumar in a missive dated June 17 and marked ‘Time-bound/Important’ sent to all DMs, has also instructed that the DMs provide date-wise information regarding open or unsafe borewells identified and made safe as part of the exercise and the count of remaining borewells that are yet to be made safe in the given format through e-mail after the conclusion of the drive.Kumar also reminded the district officials that the UP relief commissioner, through his missive dated June 6, 2019, has provided the districts a copy of the standard operating procedure prepared by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to be followed in case of an incident concerning an open borewell. The exercise will be undertaken involving lekhpals, gram pradhans and gram secretaries besides beat constables and sanitation staff as desired by the state government to identify open borewells and to plug them, a district administration official in the know of the development, said.Children falling into open borewells are not new to Uttar Pradesh. Even before the June 14 Agra incident, a number of children have fallen into borewells and many have lost their lives. A four-year-old boy had fallen into a borewell in Budhaura village of Mahoba on December 2, 2020 and could not be saved despite an 18-hour rescue operation. Likewise, a five-year-old boy had fallen into a 100-feet deep borewell at Agaryala village of Mathura while plucking fruits on April 13, 2019 and could be saved only after an eight-hour rescue operation.On April 4, 2019, another eight-year-old girl Seema had fallen into a 60-foot borewell, in Rashidpur village, in Farrukhabad district and could not be saved despite a two-day rescue exercise. In 2012 as many as 19 children had lost their lives in Uttar Pradesh by falling into borewells.In February 2010, the Supreme Court had issued guidelines directing all borewell owners to notify the DM concerned to fill up abandoned borewells. The NDRF recommends filling these holes with mud, pebbles and clay.The ProblemA borewell is a deep, narrow hole drilled into ground from which water is drawn using a pipe and pump Borewells are usually small in diameter ranging from 4.5 inches to 12 inchesIndia has over 27 million borewells with several now abandoned because they no longer supply waterWhen a borewell dries up, its cover is removed and the pipe pulled out, leaving behind a naked hole that causes accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-agra-incident-pan-up-drive-to-identify-plug-inactive-borewells-101624037306230.html
18-06-2021||Lucknow||Making solar plants more viable: UP units to get life-long power-banking facility||Solar plants in Uttar Pradesh will now get a life-long, power-banking facility, a process under which they will be able to deposit excess power in the grid and withdraw it when they need to sell it to customers.Using its exceptional powers under the section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003, the state government has directed the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) to make necessary changes in its current regulations to pave the way for the power-banking facility for solar plants during their entire life term. Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh are said to be the only two other states in the country to have made provisions for power-banking facility for an open-ended period for renewable power-generating plants.According to government officials, the move will save solar power-generating companies from financial losses they suffer on account of wastage of excess power, apart from helping new investors get the projects financed easily. “In a meeting chaired by the additional chief secretary, energy and renewable energy, on January 23, 2021, it was decided that the power-banking facility will be provided to all solar energy-generating units commissioned during the Solar Policy-2017 till they complete their life or for 25 years from the date of their commissioning, whichever earlier offer a long-term clarity and certainty to investors and financiers,” Alok Sinha, additional chief secretary, energy, wrote in a letter to UPERC on June 15.“The government, therefore, directs the UPERC, using its powers under the section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 to act in accordance with the decision taken by it under the Solar Policy-2017 in the larger public interest,” Sinha added in the letter.According to New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (NEDA) director, Bhawani Singh Khagrawat, under the existing provisions known as UPERC (Captive and Renewable Energy Generating Plants) Regulations, 2019, the power-banking facility to solar plants is available only for five years and till March 31, 2024.“This was creating a state of uncertainty about what would happen after 2024, and the investors were also finding it difficult to get their projects financed for the same reason. Now, the government directions to the UPERC will make it possible for these plants to enjoy the power-banking facility during their whole useful life,” he said.The government is learnt to have issued the directions after the UPERC expressed its unwillingness to make changes in the existing regulations which it said were valid only up to March 31, 2024. Welcoming the government decision, Alok Verma of Amplus Solar said, “The decision will bring much needed certainty in the policy and also make solar plants financially more viable in UP.” He said the power-banking facility for an open-ended period was a must because there were times when solar plants generated excess power and without the banking facility the excess power generated would get wasted, incurring losses to investors. “Banking of power is a process under which a generating plant supplies power to the grid not with the intent of selling it to either a third party or to a licensee, but with the intention of exercising its eligibility to draw back this power from the grid within the time period and against the charges as specified under the rules,” Verma explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/making-solar-plants-more-viable-up-units-to-get-life-long-power-banking-facility-101624037005563.html

The state government’s likely moves to spruce up the administration and give a message of change ahead of 2022 assembly elections are being watched with keen interest. UP Revenue Board chairman’s post is lying vacant for over one and a half months after the death of incumbent Deepak Trivedi. A 1985 batch IAS officer of the state cadre, Trivedi died on April 29, 2021 while undergoing treatment for Covid. Trivedi, who also held the position of UP IAS Association chairman, was due to retire on April 30, 2021. UP DGP HC Awasthy, a 1985 batch IPS officer of the state, is due to retire on June 30, 2021. The state government’s handling of the Covid situation during the first wave had received a lot of praise. However, it has been under attack for ‘failure’ to handle the second wave and top level changes may be considered as part of a damage-control exercise. Will the axe fall on the chief secy? This is the million-dollar question in the corridors of power. Chief secretary RK Tiwari is the senior-most IAS officer of the 1985 batch. He is known for his integrity and being upright. Tiwari has a long tenure ahead and is due to retire early in 2023. Any change on the top post may provide an opportunity for some officers of the 1986 and 1987 batches who may otherwise retire before Tiwari’s superannuation. The state government also has to take a call on appointments on other key posts. It has not made any appointment on the post of social welfare commissioner lying vacant for a long period. Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner’s (IIDC) post also does not have a full-time appointee after incumbent Alok Tandon was relieved for central deputation. Additional chief secretary, planning, Kumar Kamlesh is due to retire on June 30, 2021 while another ACS Renuka Kumar has been appointed as secretary to union government. The state government’s move to fill up these posts will result in a reshuffle. The state government continues to make appointments on various posts and it’s a continuous process, said an official spokesman. Senior officers refused to comment on the DGP’s post.

18-06-2021||Pune||BJGMC study shows measles containing vaccine may protect kids from Covid infection||Pune: A study conducted by Pune’s BJ Government Medical College (BJGMC) attached with Sassoon General Hospital on children aged below 18 years, who tested positive for Covid-19 infection, shows that those vaccinated with Measles Containing Vaccines (MCVs) had milder symptoms than those who were not. The observational study showed that MCVs which are part of India’s routine immunisation programme have an effectiveness of 87.5% against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the Covid infection.The study was conducted by the BJ medical college researchers from the Department of Community Medicine, in collaboration with paediatrician- private practitioner Dr Nilesh Gujar and was funded by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Dr Gujar, who first brought up the hypothesis, said that the study needs further clinical trials for confirmation. If proven, the study could help prevent the third wave among kids as a massive immunisation drive of children and adults alike with MCV’s vaccines, which are present in large quantities as well, could minimise severity of the Covid infection.In India, measles vaccine became part of the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) in 1985 as a single dose at nine months of age. A mass immunisation campaign was conducted in the country in 2017–2018 with the measles and rubella (MR) vaccine, targeting 410 million children aged nine months to 15 years. Since then, measles vaccine in UIP has been replaced by MR vaccine, in a two-dose schedule at 9–12 months and 16–24 months, respectively, said Dr Gujar.The study included 548 children aged between 1-17 years who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 2020 and July 31, 2020 and living within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction. The results demonstrated that MCVs had a vaccine effectiveness of 87.5% against SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was also observed that the vaccinated participants had less severe symptoms of Covid compared to the unvaccinated participants.Dr Malangori Parande, who is a researcher in BJGMC said, “Although the study is promising, it should be noted that this was a retrospective case-control study and such studies may have certain limitations. Results obtained in this study need to be confirmed further through prospective randomised controlled clinical trials before a definitive conclusion about the protection offered by MCVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection can be made.”The results of the study were recently published in the journal of Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics.Explaining why MCV vaccines could work against Covid, Dr Gujar said, “There could be two reasons as to why the MCV’s work against Covid which are, one in case of rubella vaccines, the macro domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus share 29% amino acid sequence identity, suggesting they have the same protein fold and second for measles vaccines the spike S of coronavirus and Hemagglutinin H of measles virus have a critical involvement in receptor recognition, as well as virus attachment and entity.”He said that since the ACE 2 receptor is not present in kids and the childhood vaccination could be the reason why the incidences of Covid positive cases among kids is low compared to adults.Dr Parande said that documentary proof of MCV vaccination was asked and those who were symptomatic only had fever, cold and cough and they were not vaccinated with NCV while the asymptomatic positives who were vaccinated had to be tested as their close contacts had tested positive for Covid.The enrolled participants included 274 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (216 vaccinated and 58 unvaccinated) along with 274 SARS-CoV-2 negative controls (265 vaccinated and 9 unvaccinated). Of the 274 cases, 180 (65.7%) were asymptomatic while 94 (34.3%) were symptomatic, all with mild severity. The number of participants with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. Dr Gujar said that the study if taken forward could initiate mass immunisation of adults too with MCV’s as most of the adults now have got only one shot of the vaccine whereas the Indian Paediatric Association had recommended in 2018 that three doses of MCV’s could be given for better immunity. Dr Nilesh Gujar, Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean of BJGMC, from BJGMC community Medicine department, Dr Malangori Palande, Dr Ganesh Jagdale and Dr Nandkumar Salunkhe participated in the study. Dr Sarah G Anderson from Dept of Biostatistics, Emmes Services Pvt ltd and from Serum Institute of India (SII) Abhijeet Dharmadhikari, Prasad Kulkarni and Anand Lakhkar also participated in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjgmc-study-shows-measles-containing-vaccine-may-protect-kids-from-covid-infection-101624034065478.html

Technical and administrative officials in the mining department are idiots or shrewd! Stop them and save the state from huge revenue loss,” Roy said while tagging CM Soren in a tweet on Thursday.The state mining department came out with a tender for Ajitaburu iron and manganese block on June 14, with July 13 being the last date for submission and July 14 as the tender opening date. The state mining department has estimated that this mine, spread over 46.62 hectares, has 17.538 million tonnes of iron ore and 2.318 million tonnes of manganese reserve. The lease of M/S Debuka Bhai Belji expired on March 31, 2020 after the state government cancelled mining lease of over three dozen mines. Only the mines belonging to Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) have currently been operational, while the lease of one M/S Anil Khirwal was still in effect. Jharkhand has about ₹20,000 crore revenue dues pending on 187 iron ore, manganese and coal mining companies.Roy, in another tweet, questioned the legality of the decision by the West Singhbhum district mining officer (DMO). “How did the DMO give permission to transport iron ore from a closed mine to Vishakhapatnam by rail route to M/S Global Traders and M/S Animesh Ispat,” Roy asked. Tender notice for stock auction of Thakurani and Rajabera mines leased to M/S Padma Kumar Jain has already triggered controversy over difference grading percentage of the illegally mined iron ore and fines stocked. The state government in 2017 cancelled leases of the two aforementioned mines in wake of the amended Mines and Minerals (development and regulations) Act, 2015 (MMDR Act) and a Supreme Court (SC) order in this regard. The government raised a fine of ₹334 crore on Thakurani Mine and ₹7 crore on Rajabera mine on charges of illegal mining, which is now to be realised by auctioning the stocked iron ore and fines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/saryu-roy-highlights-more-anomalies-in-auction-of-iron-ore-mines-stocks-101624034005348.html

Then what was the hurry to transfer the officer heading the department. It seems that the transfer was done to influence the ongoing investigation,” the bench observed. It added, “Remdesivir blackmarketing case can be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a thorough probe.” The bench, however, sought an explanation from the government in this regard by June 21. It said the court will take a final decision only after inspecting the government’s reply.The matter relates to suo moto cognisance taken by the high court over Covid-19 issues in the state in April last year.The recent development in the case came before the court after lawyer Rajendra Krishna filed an interlocutory application, questioning the government’s decision to transfer the ADG. He said the ADG earlier appeared before the court and assured free and fair investigation into the above case. “However, hardly few days later, Palta was transferred, raising suspicion about the fate of the above case,” he said, urging the court to quash the transfer order.Responding to this, the bench asked the advocate general (AG) as to why the government didn’t take the court’s permission before transferring the ADG. “There are several orders of the Supreme Court and the high courts that clearly say that the government must take court’s prior permission for transferring an officer connected with cases under court’s monitoring,” the bench said.The AG, however, informed the court that the ADG’s transfer was a routine matter. He was not the investigating officer of the case. The senior official, who replaced him, is equally competent and the ongoing probe into the case will not be influenced in any manner, the AG said.The court, however, observed that people infected with coronavirus didn’t get Remdesivir injection on time that led to many deaths. “The medicine was sold in black market, which is a very serious issue,” the bench said.The AG informed that he will inform the court after seeking government’s instruction. After some time, he informed that the government will set up a special investigation team (SIT) under Palta in this matter.The bench asked the government to furnish its decision in writing by filing an affidavit by Monday.The bench also enquired the CBI’s counsel if the agency will investigate the matter. The counsel said the CBI will probe the case only after the court’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/remdesivir-blackmarketing-probe-hc-pulls-up-govt-for-transferring-cid-official-101624034005980.html

Last year, despite the Covid-19 crisis, the farmers yielded record paddy. On November 7, the chief minister announced that the government will procure paddy. But within days, state finance minister and Congress chief said they won’t buy paddy as it was not dry. This exposed the government’s claims. Even for the paddy that has been procured, the government has not paid the farmers till now,” said Prakash.The party chief was addressing farmers and party workers at a protest site in a village under Ranchi’s Kanke block. The BJP leader also accused the state government of discontinuing the pro-farmer scheme of providing ₹25,000 to registered farmers every year of the previous Raghubar Das government.Reacting to the allegations, state agriculture minister said the saffron party’s leaders need to check the records of their own previous government in providing relief to farmers. “The Raghubar Das government in 2017 and 2018 procured only 53% and 56%, respectively, of the targeted 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. After we came to power, we raised the target to 60 lakh metric tonnes for paddy procurement and have exceeded our target to 102%. Most of the payment has also been done, with 50% of the amount paid within a week of procurement. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) owes the state government ₹180 crore, and the finance minister has written to the Centre to disburse the amount so that it could be paid to farmers. Despite that, the state government on Thursday released ₹98 crore from its own account for payment,” Patralekh told media persons.The minister also underlined that ₹980 crore has been provided to the bank for waiving agriculture loans as promised by the Hemant Soren government. “We have already waived farm loans of 2.46 lakh farmers. As per the updated data, 9.2 lakh farmers are eligible under the farm loan waiver scheme,” said Patralekh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bjp-protests-in-farms-over-paddy-procurement-payment-to-farmers-101624033946843.html

Four of them have been arrested and sent to jail,” said Nagar Untari subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Pramod Kesri.According to Devi’s complaint, one Anil Rawat, along with a couple of persons, on Thursday came to their house and took her husband with them. One of her husband’s friends also went with him, she said. “Then, my husband and his friend were tied to a tree. They alleged that my husband practised black magic. Hundreds of people gathered there, but nobody came to their rescue. Then, after one Vijay arrived, they beat the two with sticks and rods,” she alleged.On getting information, police reached the spot and rescued the two men. “Police took them to a community health centre in the village. However, my husband was referred to Garhwa Sadar hospital, where he died during treatment,” the bereaved wife said.Dr Abhijit Biswas, who provided the first-aid at the community health centre, said, “There were no external injuries on the body. But, it seemed Paswan suffered internal injury. So, we referred him to Garhwa Sadar hospital for better treatment.”Police said prima facie, it seemed to be a case of internal rivalry. “However, everything will be clear after investigation gets completed,” the SDPO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/two-persons-tied-to-tree-thrashed-for-sorcery-one-dead-101624033945390.html

18-06-2021||Other||A monumental tragedy in making at heritage sites in Bihar||PATNASeveral monuments in Bihar, including those designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are a picture of dereliction and negligence, which authorities blame on shortage of funds, the Covid-19 pandemic and most recently the flooding caused by heavy rain in parts of the state.While the Ashokan pillar at Lauriya in West Champaran is under water these days, the Buddhist Stupa at Kesaria in East Champaran too is water logged and thick bushes have grown all over its walls and terraces. Even at Nalanda University remains, portions of the ancient structure have been overrun with thick bushes. There are 72 Nationally Protected Monuments in Bihar, including the Ashokan pillar and Buddhist Stupa at Lauria Nandangarh in West Champaran, Buddhist Stupa at Kesaria and the Nalanda University remains. The Nalanda University, the most ancient university in the country, was declared World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2016. The Kesaria Stupa is the tallest cylindrical Buddhist Stupa in the world, built by Emperor Ashok. All these monuments and sites are managed and maintained by Patna circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). “These are prime tourism attractions in our state. Vaishali and Kesaria Stupas are in a miserable condition,” says SK Singh, vice-president of Tourism Association of Bihar. Terraces of Kesaria Stupa are covered by thick bushes while the ground around is marshy land. The approach road to the monument has big potholes, Singh said. Often the tour planners plan to promote Kesara Stupa as foreign tourists are found to be eager to go there while being on way to Lumbini, Lord Buddha’s birthplace in Nepal. “But what can be done in this situation?,” he asked. HS Naik, superintending archaeologist at ASI (Patna circle), said he was aware of the conditions but pleaded helplessness. “I have been told that water level around Ashokan pillar is almost eight feet high. It has to be stopped as it will damage the monument,” he said. The ASI is sending letter to the West Champaran administration to plan something to stop it, Naik said. He said the condition of monuments at Kesaria and Nalanda too have been affected because of Covid-19 pandemic and prolonged lockdown. “There has been shortage of man power. Many workers are on leave during the second wave of Covid,” he said. Naik said he recently visited Nalanda University remains and asked employees to take proper care of monument. “ I will soon visit Kesaria to take stock of situation,” he said. He said efforts are being taken to maintain monuments in the limited budget they have. “It has been almost halved in the last five years,” he said, adding that it had come down from ₹6 crore in 2015 to ₹3 crore in 2021. Bihar’s tourism minister Narayan Prasad said he had a plan to visit Champaran to review development plans for heritage sites on June 18, but it had to be postponed due to flood situation there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-monumental-tragedy-in-making-at-heritage-sites-in-bihar-101624033826825.html

No documents were damaged in the incident and a departmental investigation was launched, she added."Thirteen fire tenders in total were rushed to the spot where local police were also deployed and the blaze brought under control within three hours," CFO Singh told reporters, adding that he personally oversaw the relief and rescue operation.The fire caused damage to the office of the managing director and a large conference room within the NMRC premises, the senior fire-fighter said, adding that the blaze spread quickly due to the presence of a false ceiling."With false ceiling, it became difficult to ascertain the extent of the area the fire had spread into. The fire has been controlled except for some small patches on the false ceiling, which are being doused," Singh said at 4 pm.He said around 60 to 70 people were working inside the office when the fire broke out and all of them were evacuated to safety immediately and added that no one was injured.He said the fire-fighters had to break open some glass windows in the NMRC to make way for the smoke out of the premises in order to douse the fire.Asked if safety measures installed in the building functioned properly, the CFO said, "In events of a major fire, power supply in the buildings are discontinued. Here also the power supply was discontinued and we relied on our fire tenders for the operation.”The Ganga Shopping Complex in the posh Sector 29 of Noida houses several daily utility shops, commercial officers, restaurants and fast-food outlets besides the Noida Media Club.In a statement, the NMRC said the fire was triggered due to an electrical short circuit."Immediately the area got evacuated and necessary preventive actions by staff have been taken.

While Sikharna river in west Bihar is wreaking havoc in parts of the West and East Champaran, rising level of Gandak across its stretch from West Champaran to Gopalganj has compounded the miseries of those living near its embankments. The Gandak river has crossed the danger level (DL) at Dumariaghat in Gopalganj by over 1.50 metre, even as it’s approaching near DL at Chatia (East Champaran) and Rewaghat (Muzaffarpur). Dozens of villages in the two Champaran districts have been flooded by the swollen Sikharna river, which does not have any embankments in the initial 50km. Water resources department (WRD) secretary Sanjiv Hans said all embankments were safe and monitoring had been heightened to avert any mishap. “A junior engineer has been deployed every 10 km of the embankment with 10 volunteers on each kilometre to keep constant vigil,” he said. WRD officials hoped the situation would ease in days as the discharge in Gandak and other rivers originating from Nepal had been maintaining a falling trend over the past 24 hours. “The discharge in Gandak at Valmikinagar barrage has come down to 1.58 lakh cusecs on Friday morning, as compared to 4.12 lakh cusec recorded on June 16,” said Hans. The WRD secretary said that the department had already advised the people living in low-lying areas or those within the embankments of different rivers to relocate to safer places owing to heavy rains in their catchment areas. “We have also increased vigil on Ghaghra river, whose catchment in Uttar Pradesh received heavy showers in the past 24 hours. Situation is, however, under control in Siwan, where the river’s upper stream is nearly one metre down the DL,” said Hans. Residents claimed that Sikharna river, which is known by Burhi Gandak downstream, flooded over 100 villages of around two dozen blocks of Narkatiganj and Bagha by Friday afternoon. “People are moving to safer places along with essential belongings in a large numbers, after the floodwaters entered their houses,” said Ravi Mahato of Pipra village. Kosi river was reported flowing near one metre down the DL at Basua in Supaul and Kamla was 30 cm below the danger mark at Jainagar in Madhubani. Officials said flooding in northern parts of Bihar was mainly because of small streams that flow down unprotected from Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gandak-crosses-danger-mark-at-dumariaghat-vigil-hiked-on-embankments-101624033766536.html

We assessed Covid-19 situation but conducting compartment exam doesn’t seem feasible any time soon. Even if we conduct compartmental exam in next 2 or 3 months, result announcement would have possible by November or December. In such circumstances, students were likely to miss admission in colleges or senior secondary schools,” he said.BSEB passed a total of 2.8 lakh students of Class 10 and 12 last year by awarding grace marks owing to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bseb-awards-grace-marks-to-students-who-failed-in-max-two-subjects-101624033765409.html

The administration has shortlisted 20 students who will be trained by the health department officials. “These students will learn on how to convey information to the young listeners. They will always be assisted by doctors so that if they face any query where expert opinion is required, the latter could provide it on the spot,” said Rajesh Patil, civic chief PCMC. The students are selected from PCMC-run and private schools. PCMC is focusing on introducing various awareness programs ahead of the anticipated third Covid wave. “The information about the virus will be given in different forms like Power Point slides, animated slides, and small informative videos. Teachers can also join these initiatives,” added Patil. Majority of the students selected are from Class 8 and Class 9. The information on helpline will be given to children in English and Marathi languages. “Children speaking to children will be an overall different experience. Although the topic is Covid, children will enjoy such informative sessions as the details will be conveyed in a much simpler way,” said Vandana Phadnis, parent of Manas, who studies in a PCMC-run school in Thergaon. The PCMC administration has briefed students on how they will be trained regarding what questions are expected and what points are important to explain on every call. PCMC plans to keep four students for the helpline every day on a rotational basis. “We will soon announce how the helpline will be functional as the facility will be assisted by doctors and teachers,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-helpline-in-pune-for-children-by-children-101624032385347.html
18-06-2021||Pune||Screening facility for hearing loss in newborns to start in Pune||Pune: Health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said that screening of newborns for hearing ability will be launched in Pune as an experimental project. Gadchiroli and Jalna will also be a part of the project. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, said that primary healthcare centres will soon start the screening facility. “We do not have a newborn screening for checking the hearing capacity of infants. Hence, the initiative will soon be introduced at primary healthcare centres,” said Pawar. The project was conceived by Member of Parliament (MP) Supriya Sule and presented by Abhijit Raut, state organiser, Disability Rights Development Forum, Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan. Dr Arti Kinikar, head of paediatric department at Sassoon General Hospital (SGH), welcomed the decision. “We at Sassoon General Hospital started a similar programme in 2017. It has helped in timely detection of hearing disability in a lot of children and provide treatment,” said Kinikar. She said that early detection and confirmation of hearing impairment can help children get therapy early and improve their cognitive development. There was a detailed discussion on the implementation of Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) method in newborns. The test checks the sounds produced by the cochlea. The National Deafness Prevention Programme is being implemented in 16 places in the state and while expanding its scope, instructions were given to implement it across the state. At present, the number of hearing and language impaired people in the state is around 92,000, of which 51% are in rural areas and 49% in urban areas. Deafness can be prevented if the test is done at an early stage. Therefore, the programme should be planned according to the method of early diagnosis and treatment, a state official said. “The mobile unit will visit a primary health centre and screen the newborns. Hearing tests can also be done during a child’s immunisation session,” said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/screening-facility-for-hearing-loss-in-newborns-to-start-in-pune-101624031665228.html
18-06-2021||Lucknow||Lallu incompetent, remove him as UPCC chief: Congress leader||At a time when political parties are gearing up for 2022 assembly elections, the challenge before the Congress party in Uttar Pradesh is to bring its own house in order.In yet another controversy, a senior party leader has now accused Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu of allegedly being anti-upper castes.“Those from upper castes can’t work with Lallu. He is not capable of taking all sections of the society along. Under his leadership, party’s support base in the state is only narrowing,” said former UPCC secretary, Sunil Rai, while speaking to media persons at the Uttar Pradesh Press Club here on Friday.“I have sent letters to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and requested them to remove Lallu from UPCC president’s post,” said Rai.Lallu was not available for comments.Those aware of the developments in the party said, Rai had been targeting Lallu for past few months.It all started after removal of a hoarding carrying pictures of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rai from near the UPCC headquarters a few months ago.Rai claimed Lallu got the hoarding removed as it did not carry his picture and he got an FIR registered against the UPCC president narrating the whole issue.A UPCC functionary, however, said Lallu had no role in removing the hoarding.It may be the handiwork of some other rival partymen or the Lucknow Nagar Nigam that launches drives to remove hoardings from time to time, said the functionary.This is, however, not for the first time that voices have been raised against Lallu.A section of young partymen have already formed a group titled “Shoshit Congressi Savarn” and had been running a campaign on social media against Lallu, dubbing him as anti-Brahmin.A group of party’s old timers had earlier accused Lallu of neglecting those who had spent their lives for the Congress. As many of them organised separate get together to celebrate birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister late Jawahar Lal Nehru on November 14, 2019, the UPCC expelled them.Those expelled included former ministers and former MPs and legislators, mostly belonging to upper castes.The action led to a divide between the old timers and Lallu’s new team constituted to lead the party in 2022 assembly elections.Another party functionary said the Congress was already late in gearing up for the polls. “Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra though had been leading the party’s campaign against the BJP government at the centre and in the state, the party’s organizational infrastructure needed to be strengthened further. It is high time to make necessary changes and prepare party for 2022 polls,” said the functionary.“The Congress does not appear to be in a mood to strengthen itself in the state. It should resolve the grievances of partymen and undertake an exercise to control the damage already done in Uttar Pradesh,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lallu-incompetent-remove-him-as-upcc-chief-congress-leader-101624031370139.html
18-06-2021||Pune||PMC’s 30% cut in elected members’ budget draws opposition||PUNE: Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Friday said that the civic body is in poor financial condition as factors like seventh pay commission, hike in fuel and electricity charges have shot up the annual revenue expenditure by Rs1,200 crore in a year. The commissioner has introduced a 30 per cent cut in works suggested by the elected members to strengthen the financial position of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). However, the public representatives across all party lines have opposed the proposal put forward by the revenue committee. They sought clarification from the municipal commissioner over the issue at the general body meeting. Kumar said, “The municipal corporation’s revenue dropped due to the Covid pandemic. Last year in 2020-21, we generated Rs4,170 crore revenue and expect the figure to touch around Rs5,600 crore this year (2021-22). The revenue generated depends on various proposals cited to increase income. The revenue expenditure increased from Rs3,100 crore in previous year to Rs4,300 crore this year.” According to the civic chief, the total growth in revenue expenditure would be Rs1,200 crore because of rise in fuel (petrol, diesel) prices and electricity rates. “Even the implementation of the seventh pay commission to staff will also add to the expenditure part. Hence, after considering these factors, hardly Rs1,400 crore would remain for carrying out development works,” he said. “If we do not introduce cuts to the works suggested by the elected members and approve the tenders, the municipal corporation would not have money to pay the bills and it would an additional burden on the next financial year,” Kumar said. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “All elected members are unhappy with the administration’s decision to introduce cut only in elected members’ budget. We will hold a separate meeting with all party leaders and the civic administration at the mayor’s office and chalk out a plan.” One of the office-bearers on anonymity said that most of the elected members have proposed ward-level works. “Many of the proposals are unnecessary like renovating footpaths or making roads and sewage works. Same roads are dug up repeatedly and footpaths are unnecessarily getting renovated,” the official said. Meanwhile, Subhash Jagtap of NCP said, “It shows how the ruling BJP has poorly run the economy of the municipal corporation in the last four years despite getting a clear majority.” Aba Bagul (Congress) said, “It is unjustified that taxpayers’ Rs4,300 crore should be spend only on revenue work and no fund available for development works suggested by the elected members. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the administration spent money on works without informing the elected members.” BJP’s leader of the House Ganesh Bidkar said that despite the pandemic, PMC collected record property tax last year and even allowed the elected members to spend their ward development fund. “Almost Rs350 crore was spent by elected members in just last two months from ward development funds in last financial year. Pandemic is an unprecedented situation and led to financial crisis. The commissioner will place the facts before elected members,” he said. Prithviraj Sutar (Shiv Sena) said, “Without informing any committee or elected members, the administration approved the tender for sewage works in 11 villages. We do not oppose development projects, but demand transparency in budget allocation.” Mohol said, “The administration and elected members both are important. Elected members suggest works as per citizens’ demand and to develop their areas. Instead of introducing cuts, we would discuss the issue with party leaders and reach an amicable solution.”. Arvind Shinde (Congress), “It was mandatory for the administration to put all proposals before the elected members before approving it during the Covid times. In the name of pandemic, the administration behaved like a superior and approved tenders without informing the elected members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmcs-30-cut-in-elected-members-budget-draws-opposition-101624030886571.html

18-06-2021||Pune||Parents unhappy with CBSE evaluation method for class 12||Parents of class 12 students are unhappy with the evaluation method that was declared by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday. The evaluation method that CBSE declared included 40 per cent marks from class 12 whereas 30 per cent marks from class 11 and class 10 will be included for the class 12 assessment as per the board. Ruchi Uppal, parent of a class 12 student said that the decision will not be good for students who have worked hard this year. “Students who have worked hard throughout the year may be disappointed with this decision of the board. The pre-board marks should be considered. The class 10 marks are at least good but for class 11, the marks may not be great for every student,” said Uppal. Ketki Dalmiya, another parent of class 12 student said that her daughter in class 11 was not well. “She had a major surgery and was not able to attend school. In such a scenario, if class 11 marks were to be included then it may affect her score overall. My daughter wants to go abroad for her further education and these marks are very crucial to her. But due to this decision taken by the board, there is a lot of uncertainty,” said Dalmiya. She added that students who are preparing for further examinations do not pay attention to their school score in class 11. “Students are usually very relaxed in class 11. Even if the board is including only 30 marks, it will affect the overall performance of the child and overall score card,” added Dalmiya. CBSE in its notification clearly stated that in some cases students may not have applied themselves fully in class 11. “However, this will be addressed to an extent by taking into consideration the marks of class 10 along with class 11 marks,” said the notification. The notification makes it mandatory that every school should have a five-member review committee where in two members will be from external schools. Jayshree Venkatraman, principal, SNBP international school, Rahatani said that the evaluation pattern of class 12 reflects consistency in students. “The ethos of hard work and consistency is important for every student and this is reflected in the evaluation pattern for class 12 which was released,” said Venkatraman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-unhappy-with-cbse-evaluation-method-for-class-12-101624027704987.html

18-06-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: In Golden Memory||Golden Wafers. The very name evoked their mouth-watering appeal. The finest quality of fulsome, handpicked potatoes, sliced to paper-thin perfection, then deep-fried in generous dollops of butter and oil, until each wedge emerged crisp and flaxen, ready to be dusted with a sprinkling of salt and packed in paper bags, the freshness of their content secured with a single staple. How much of Mumbai’s fondest memories are predicated on this iconic snack, sold from the counter of a modest shop at Grant Road? Mumbai’s leading foodie Kunal Vijaykar remembers his first encounter with them as a child. “My mum had instructed me to go buy some packets. ‘Just go to the Neptune cinema and then follow your nose,’ she’d said.” To be sure, in the India of the Sixties, when liberalisation was not even a gleam in Dr Manmohan Singh’s eye and shopping carts laden with international fast-food brands hadn’t rolled into India, Golden Wafers, begun by the late Khodadad Irani and run by his young widow Jeroo, had been renowned for its finger-licking deliciousness. Sold at all the city’s finest venues — its cinemas and clubs — it had been a city staple from kiddie’s birthdays to elegant tea parties. “Nothing could have been more exciting than to know that those glorious wafers originated in our very own backyard!” writes Kavita Ezekiel Mendonca, daughter of late poet Nissim Ezekiel, who had been a neighbour of the Iranis in Byculla. “Jeroo aunty was fondly known to us as Golden Wafer aunty, the maker of the best chips in the world and each birthday she would present me with a 100-gram packet of those heavenly smelling wafers. It was one of the best treats of my childhood.” *********************************“My father started Golden Wafers, from a little shop at the end of a lane in Grant Road, but after he passed away, my mum, who was then only 32 and had three daughters aged between 12 and four, with me along the way, had stepped in to run it,” says celebrated actor Boman Irani, about his remarkable mother Jeroo, who passed away in her sleep earlier this month, at the ripe old age of 94, surrounded by her doting children and grandchildren. “My father’s protracted illness and early death had taken its toll and there were lots of debts in the form of hospital and commercial bills and so mum decided to carry on the business, though until then she hadn’t even known how to sign a cheque,” he says, adding, “In fact, though she was privately petrified of not being equipped to deal with things like sales tax, municipality and oil and potato dealers, she had risen to the challenge and handled things with great ferocity and fortitude.” Irani’s admiration for his mother is palpable. From recounting how as a young widow she had cleared each and every debt, no questions asked, even as she steered the business to success, all the while nurturing her young children, so that they never felt the loss of a father, he waxes eloquent. Jeroo had been passionately fond of the arts — of poets like Wordsworth, Tennyson and Ezekiel; of the music of Kishore Kumar and Shirley Temple; of filmmakers like Guru Dutt, Billy Wilder and Hitchcock. This had been matched by her relish for good food. From chicken rolls from Paradise to Parsi Dairy Farm’s Malai nu Kulfi, her zest for life had remained till the end. Above all, she had been defined by her kindness. “Kindness was in her DNA,” says Boman. “If I went to a movie, she would make sure that I took along every kid in the colony. ‘And don’t forget to get them popcorn and ice cream,’ she would say. We’d be rows of kids and she was mother to them all. She was all for children having fun. We called her the Picnic Queen. Regardless of how tired she was, when she’d return from the shop, she would say ‘who wants to go on a picnic’ and we would be up all night making sandwiches and planning games and next morning we would drive to Panvel or Juhu beach, with our basket and chaddar and ball — just like in the Sound of Music,” he says. *********************************The daughter of a well-heeled clan from Iran, convent-educated Jeroo had grown up in Pune and had come to Bombay to stay with her uncle while attending college. A chance meeting with a brilliant young orator named Khodadad had led to marriage at 18. The couple and their children had lived in an old-world colony in Byculla, known as The Retreat, a set of seven, one-storey bungalows, inhabited by a colourful bunch of Parsi, Irani, Muslim, Christian, Anglo-Indian and Jewish families. Here, Jeroo had spread her warmth and kindness with the same spirit with which she had produced her famous packets of chips. It was also the same loving attention with which she encouraged Boman, born six months after the death of his father and diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, to pursue his love for cinema. “She understood the power of cinema and my affinity for it, and she encouraged me in that direction,” he says. “She wasn’t the kind of mother who’d say, ‘Go do your homework!’ Rather she would say: ‘Learn from cinema. It teaches so much like history, art and music’,” recalls her grateful son, now one of the leading stars of Bollywood. *********************************Fittingly, the end for this much-loved matriarch had come peacefully. Boman and the rest of her family had spent her last days reading out her favourite poems and playing her favourite songs. Even in her semi-conscious state, she would mouth their words, her face lighting up at their familiar beauty. On her last night, she had requested a bowl of her favourite kulfi, and on tasting it, had made the thumbs up sign, to indicate to her family how much she enjoyed it. “She had some staple phrases. ‘Make people happy” was one of them,” says Boman, adding, “The other was ‘Sparkle, son, sparkle’. It’s what I tell people too.” He says, “I encourage them because I know if my mother hadn’t encouraged me or hadn’t had faith in my ability, I probably would not have had the confidence to become an actor. She helped me to sparkle as much as I could.” Last week Jeroo’s family gathered to offer prayers in her memory and partake in a traditional lunch, and it is no surprise that the menu, down to its last detail from the kebabs to the bake and lemon pudding, had been meticulously planned by her.After all, right till the end, Jeroo Irani had wanted whatever was being served in her name, to bring a smile and spread a golden sparkle…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-in-golden-memory-101624025066346.html

We have requested the court to protect the petitioner from any coercive measures of police and in whatever manner government wants to investigate, our client is ready and willing to cooperate.”Gupta said they are hoping for an early hearing in the matter.Also Watch | IMA holds protest seeking central law to protect doctors against violenceOn Thursday, Haridwar police lodged the FIR against Max Corporate Services, Nalwa Lab (Hisar, Haryana), and Lalchandani Lab (Delhi) in connection with alleged fake testing on the complaint of Haridwar’s chief medical officer.

18-06-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Present, but absent in the always connected digital world||One of the most deep-rooted needs of a human being, is the need to belong. It is a core need that is also an intrinsic motivation among humans, a motivation that drives many actions and decisions... and also instils the fear of being alone.I have kind of always suspected the co-relation between needing to belong and the fear of being alone, but the past five years has been an education, thanks, of course, to Facebook and Whatsapp in particular. It’s one thing to share life experiences. It’s another thing to do stuff alone, and then while you’re doing it, to be on social media exhorting others to do the same thing.Stuff like: I’m sitting down to watch this great movie on so-and-so channel - why don’t you watch the same movie? Or, I am all ready to watch the Euro 2020 match and ordered kebabs from Wah Wah restaurant, why don’t you do the same… you get the drift.It’s absolutely fabulous, this inability to do anything on one’s own, to have this need to be talking to someone, anyone, all the time. It’s as if you are running away from yourself, fearful even to be with yourself, afraid to be alonnnnnne.I like company, I like talking to people, meeting friends and strangers alike, learning new things, listening to what others are doing, spending time on social media… but, I love my own company. Being on your own, without the need to connect, takes practice if you are not “born to it”. And it’s much easier being connected to others online than being with people face-to-face (you have to pick and choose company, take the good with the bad, etc), or with yourself (too many decisions and thoughts to deal with). Online networks are fantastic because you can decide what to react to, what not to, and keep saying/sharing/communicating all you want to.The online world fulfils one need that is greater than belonging: the need to be heard. Most people listen because they await the opportunity to speak, and social media is the perfect anti-thesis of socialising - it’s a media that allows you to stay in society, even if you are anti-social at your core, and to keep expressing yourself without the burden of listening.In fact, social media is the most aggressively passive form of social interaction I have ever encountered. And it gives a complete new meaning to the phrase: “Alone in a crowd”. It’s fascinating.It also brings a whole new level of performance into classrooms and workplaces. What’s the most common behaviour I see at work and in online education? People engaged in a web session and chatting simultaneously with (many) peers on the inbuilt messaging platform. Absent, but present. Classic example: last year I was engaged for a couple of hours a week as a mentor to a group of educators and teens. I remember having lively chat discussions on business solutions and processes, while they were attending school meetings and sessions. That’s multitasking while multi-jobbing. And to their credit, the educators and students delivered great solutions to the project and am sure delivered very good work at school as well.But, the same technology environment also brings a whole new series of levels of procrastination into classrooms and workplaces. With everyone always connected and engaged, work seems to be taking twice sometimes thrice as long as it used to. The number of iterations has also increased exponentially, which in turn has made project planning and execution much less predictable and much more challenging.Am not sure how all this is going to turn out. There’s a lot of good that’s coming out of these developments, but I can also see a lot of changes in the behaviour of people due to these changed circumstances. Changes that may lead to other long-term personality changes and give rise to newer wellness and mental health challenges. The cycle of performance and gratification, for instance, is now a daily cycle. Which also means, people are going through intense emotions related to performance, judgment, acceptance, rejection, adjustment, reconciliation on a daily basis at the very least. Which means the pressure on the neural system and the physical body is tremendously higher. Of course, gratification options and cycles are also much shorter, but the emotional life of the average human seems to have become a rubber band - constantly stretching and easing.I wonder if anyone is doing a study to predict how often these rubber bands are going to snap…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-present-but-absent-in-the-always-connected-digital-world-101624012885168.html

Chand said the raid was conducted jointly with the local police on Thursday and the illegally made medicine was seized from the company’s storehouse. “The medicine is a combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol used as a painkiller,” said Chand, adding the medicine was in demand during the spike in Covid-19 cases recently. Samples sent for testingThe company was selling the medicine under the Tulip brand but did not have the approval of the authorities to make the drug. “Production has been stopped and the pharma unit has been sealed,” he said, adding that the samples were being sent for testing and if the medicine was found spurious, the management would be booked under relevant laws. He said a case for manufacturing the drug without approval will be filed in a Nurpur court. MP officials alerted HP counterpartsUnit manager Pintu Kumar said the company was closed since the lockdown last year. In August, a person identified as Dr Vinay Tripathi got operations resumed at the unit. He was paying the operation cost and the salary of the staff. Dr Tripathi was arrested in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in April for selling spurious Remdesivir injections. He was found in possession of 400 vials of Remdesivir. The Madhya Pradesh drug control authorities then alerted their Himachal Pradesh counterparts about the fake Remdesivir injection being sourced by the accused from the Kangra-based pharma unit. During investigation, it emerged that the company had applied for a licence for manufacturing Remdisivir that was rejected. However, the company started manufacturing it without approval. Units of the company are also located in Jammu and the Chintapur area of Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kangrabased-pharma-unit-shut-for-making-medicines-without-approval-101624009704667.html

We don't know how long will it take but till then we will not burden Mumbaikars by increasing the property tax," ANI quoted Pednekar saying.Also read: Are Mumbai’s flamingos in the pink of health?The development came after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) proposed a hike in property tax. The mayor rejected the proposal saying that the people are already facing financial hardships due to the Covid-induced lockdowns, according to media reports.“The proposed hike in property tax will not be implemented. Although Covid-19 cases have dipped, the situation is still not normal. People have lost jobs and the economy has been affected. Considering that, there will be no hike in property tax," The Indian Express quoted the mayor as saying.Most of the elected corporators are not in the favour of raising the property tax, they claim that the proposal for its hike has been moved by bureaucrats running the BMC, as per the reports.The BMC’s assessor and collector department tabled the proposal earlier this week, to be effective from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2025, before the Standing Committee for final approval. The property tax rate was proposed to go up to 14 per cent, the IE report claimed.Last year too, the state cabinet decided to not go for property-value assessment, leading to no revision in property tax during the financial year. A hike of around 17 per cent was expected last year.The richest civic body in India assesses the value of properties every five years to charge a property tax, which is levied on the capital value of the property and is based on the existing ready reckoner rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/no-hike-in-property-tax-in-mumbai-till-covid-situation-continues-says-mayor-101624006148523.html

At least 24 persons approached the economic offences wing (EOW) earlier this month after the man sold his house and fled with his family and the money he had been collecting since 2019, the police said.The arrested man, identified as Mool Chand, lived in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar. He was caught on Wednesday from northeast Delhi by a team of the EOW probing the cheating case filed in March this year, said additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh.Also Read | Covid protocol breach will only hasten 3rd wave: Delhi HC on violation of normsExplaining his modus operandi, the additional CP said that Chand launched a chit-fund scheme in August, 2019, to collect easy money by targeting people in his neighbourhood. Chand floated a scheme where investors were asked to purchase 20 shares, each for ₹10,000, for 20 months. They were told that the collected money would be given as loans to loan-seekers on a fixed monthly interest rate. The interest amount collected was to be distributed among the investors after the scheme matured.“Chand collected the monthly deposit in cash and maintained records of the investors and their respective shares. Some investors were given cheques as security against their investments. But when the scheme matured and the investors went to the bank to withdraw the money, the cheques bounced. As the investors started demanding their money back, Chand fled with his family,” said additional CP Singh.Police said that a case was registered after 24 investors filed separate complaints with the EOW alleging similar cheating and fraud. During the probe, the name of a local politician also emerged as a co-conspirator.

Adhikari had earlier demanded Roy's resignation under the anti-defection law, pointing out that the latter switched camps to the TMC despite winning the assembly polls from the Krishnanagar Uttar assembly constituency on a BJP ticket. In his petition to the Speaker today, Adhikari has raised the same demand and called for the disqualification of Roy's MLA post.The Bengal BJP camp had been preparing since Thursday to send the petition seeking Mukul Roy's disqualification as the Krishnanagar Uttar MLA and had consulted its lawyers for the purpose. Manoj Tigga, BJP's chief whip in the assembly, submitted the petition to Biman Banerjee on Friday.Former BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy had contested the assembly election from Krishnanagar Uttar constituency and defeated TMC candidate actor Koushani Mukherjee. However, following weeks of speculation, Mukul Roy and his son Subhranshu rejoined the TMC in Kolkata last Friday in the presence of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, a month after the party's landslide victory in the state assembly elections. Suvendu Adhikari had criticised the move and said that it calls for action under the anti-defection law.However, Trinamool Congress (TMC) senior leader Kunal Ghosh on Sunday hit back at BJP's Suvendu Adhikari for his 'anti-defection law' comment and asked him to teach the law to his father Sisir Adhikari as he was a TMC MP, who joined the BJP before the elections while he was still holding the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-leader-suvendu-adhikari-seeks-disqualification-of-tmc-s-mukul-roy-as-krishnanagar-mla-101624001081482.html
18-06-2021||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot met Priyanka Gandhi, in talks with other top brass: Ajay Maken||Sachin Pilot is a senior leader of the Congress party and there is no way that he will not be given an appointment with party leadership if he seeks an audience, said Ajay Maken, general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), to news agency ANI on Friday. His statements come amid a renewed political tussle in the Rajasthan Congress, as members loyal to Sachin Pilot accuse Congress of sidelining him within the party in favour of the state's chief minister, Ashok Gehlot."Sachin Pilot is a senior leader and an asset to the party. It is impossible that he seeks time from a party leader to meet and is not given an appointment. Priyanka-ji has spoken with him. Many leaders, including KC Venugopal, have also been speaking to him," said Ajay Maken while speaking on the matter.The Sachin Pilot faction of Rajasthan legislators has recently ramped up on the pressure on the Ashok Gehlot government, reportedly demanding a cabinet expansion as well as other political appointments. Pilot himself was in Delhi last week waiting for an audience with senior party leaders. Although he was expected to meet the party central leadership over his demands, Pilot later returned to Rajasthan after meeting AICC general secretary Ajay Maken. This, in turn, gave fuel to the talks of him being sidelined within the party.Senior Congress leader Depender Singh Shekhawat later rubbished all reports of a "bargain" for positions in the cabinet, and said that the Pilot camp is only striving to seek its lost honour and self-respect within the party."These reports of a bargain going on for a number of positions in the cabinet, boards and corporation are absolutely false. Sachin Pilot and all of us have been striving to seek honour and self-respect for the grassroots Congress workers in Rajasthan," the former Rajasthan assembly speaker said.The rumblings in the ruling party in Rajasthan have recently grown louder with calls to address the issues that the Pilot camp raised one year ago. Congress members loyal to Sachin Pilot insist that the leaders and workers in Rajasthan who gave their "sweat and blood to revive the party after it suffered its worst-ever defeat in 2013" are not getting adequate recognition and respect now that the party is in power.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/sachin-pilot-met-priyanka-gandhi-in-talks-with-other-top-brass-ajay-maken-101623998212081.html

18-06-2021||Lucknow||Students allege AKTU teachers rushing 6-month syllabus in 5 weeks||Engineering students at Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh allege that as soon as the examination schedule was announced, teachers have been trying to complete six months’ syllabus in just five weeks, giving no time for students to comprehend and grasp. Some students complained about the same by taking to microblogging website Twitter.“How can our mind capture anything at that speed. We are unable to understand a single chapter. This is not the way to complete the course ahead of the final exam of B Tech,” said a student, Apurva Verma, in a tweet tagging AKTU and vice-chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak.Another student, said, “How can AKTU take our exam covering the entire syllabus when the semester duration is reduced to just 3 months. Also, there was a 20-day holiday during online classes in May.”“First of all, students are finding it difficult to adapt to an online learning environment immediately after traditional classroom learning. Due to the sudden change, we are not able to adapt to computer-based learning. Students who have always been studying in the classroom, their minds are not able to focus on online platforms,” read Apurva’s tweet.According to a student, many of them are not equipped with a high-speed internet connection that is required for online learning. Due to this, they face problems in going live for virtual learning and other platforms that require an internet connection, they said.Students allege that even teachers face severe network problems and that’s why they reschedule classes quite often according to their convenience. “Not a single student is ready to take exams because we all faced many problems in this pandemic and many of us are under huge mental stress,” a student claimed.Mohsin Afroz, a student, said, “We need time to study. At present, in my college, almost three units are remaining in each subject. So, for six subjects, 18 units are left to be taught that must be completed in five weeks. The college is ready with extra classes but there’s little time to study. It is not fair to just complete the course as a formality. If AKTU is willing to hold exams, they must give proper time or give relaxation in the syllabus.”“AKTU may hold exams of only core subjects and must leave the elective subjects. In this way, we can get some relaxation. This semester started in April and classes remained suspended for almost one month, so we are left with only 3 months,” he added.A student of a private engineering college said, “Most students live in villages where engineering books are not available. Poor internet connectivity is another issue. The students could attend only 50% or less of online classes. The AKTU semester should be of four months but online classes started on April 12. With weekend off and 20-day closure in May due to Covid-19, we only had 25-30 days of online classes. And I don’t think 25-30 days are enough for a whole semester at this level.”A section of students said they are not wary of examinations. But what was bothering them was the online exam. “First of all, we are not worried about the exam. But I don’t think the online exam will be a great idea with just one month of classes. At least 20% of the syllabus is yet to be completed. How do they expect us to clear the exam? I am not begging for promotion. I am just asking to postpone the exam and conduct it offline in September. We need approximately four months of classes,” another student said.“The university is aware that our syllabus is incomplete but still wants to hold examinations,” another student, named Arpit, said.Another student urged the AKTU to “reduce the syllabus as colleges have not completed even half the syllabus and now they are trying to cover the remaining portion in a few weeks by increasing the number of classes. Due to this, students are facing huge pressure.”Some students also that all students of the first year should be promoted because it is difficult to cover 70 to 80% syllabus in just one month.AKTU pro-vice-chancellor Vineet Kansal said, “There are 750 colleges affiliated to the AKTU. By and large, a majority of the colleges continued their online classes except for a few days when the government ordered discontinuation following rising cases of Covid-19. There’s a possibility that some colleges may not have conducted online classes regularly. Maybe, a few students of these colleges are not happy with the examination and are opposing it. The final exams are still a month away. Students may start preparing for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/students-allege-aktu-teachers-rushing-6-month-syllabus-in-5-weeks-101623998364119.html

The high-profile case was slated to be heard virtually by Justice Kausik Chanda at 11am today. "Let the matter be listed next Thursday.

The court accepted the request, listing the matter for next Thursday, i.e. June 24.Even though the Trinamool Congress (TMC) returned to power for the third consecutive term, Mamata Banerjee lost to her former aide Suvendu Adhikari by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes.

18-06-2021||Gurugram||Customers return to Gurugram’s Banjara Market, shop owners elated||Gurugram’s famous flea market is a home to vintage, imported, second hand furniture and décor pieces. The flea market is located in sector-56 and marks a landmark for the sector. The ever bustling market saw a major downfall during the Covid-19 pandemic. The hundreds of local and nearing shoppers daily, dropped down to zero, for a long stretch of 2-3 months.As the pandemic restrictions eased a little bit in the past week, the market saw the light of excited shoppers flowing in again. “I was waiting for the restrictions to ease a little bit, only and only to visit banjara maket. This market is best for shoppers who have a unique taste and love reclaimed items of furniture. No other market can match the price point and value of stuff that you can get here. I am shopping for planters, as I often do,” quips plant enthusiast and Gurugram based architect, Animesh Rao.The market is a haven for interior designers and architects, who are always on the lookout for unique looking pieces at a low price point.Due to restrictions, the lockdown was financially harsh for a lot of businesses and industries. However, it was especially difficult for daily wage earners.The monthly income of the shop owners at the market ranges form 15-20k after a busy month. The income drastically reduced during the restrictions. Therefore, shop owners at banjara market had to dig in their savings, just to survive the lockdown. “Koi customer aa hi nahi raha tha, toh koi kamaai nahi hui, there were no customers and hence there was no earning during the lockdown,” says Ravi Pratap Singh, a shop owner at the market. He further adds, “We had to survive off our savings, which was not too much either. People used to come to distribute food at times, but not a lot.”Some shop owners even had to take loans, “Karza (loan) lekar bhi kaam chala liya, koi na koi maddad kar hi deta hai. Somebody or the other helped with lending money to survive,” says Ravi Rajput, who owns a carpet shop in the market.During the course of lockdown, a lot of migrant workers decided to move back to their native place. Answering the question if they thought about going back, Sunil Singh, who sell vintage wooden frames, says, “Never thought of going back to where we came from, all the work is here only. Going back was futile and hence was never an option.” The market is majorly run by rajput migrants from Chittorgarh, who have settled in tents right behind their respective shops.Since, all the shop owners live on the market space; it has created a sense of community on the field. With no customers coming, there was not a lot to do. “We live right behind our shops, we cook also. When there were no shoppers, we used to cook meals and spent time with each other, socialising. There was nothing else to do,” explains Indira Rajput, who owns a décor shop in the market.On the bright side, the market remained Covid free, as no one contracted the coronavirus, the shop owners tells us. “Hum sab theek rahe ekdum, kuch nhi hua,” quips one, elated with joy of seeing the market flourish with customers again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/customers-return-to-gurugram-s-banjara-market-shop-owners-elated-101623994584051.html

The party workers took out a march from DMCH to Karpoori Square.Party’s district unit secretary Baidyanath Yadav, Abhishek Kumar, Devendra Kumar, Prince Raj, among others, made scathing attacks over the state government’s failure to improve health facilities and the plight of the campus due to acute water logging during monsoon at DMCH, the largest government hospital in north Bihar.Meanwhile, the expected date of completion (EDC) for super speciality hospital (SSH) has been revised again on the PMSSY dashboard. As of now, the revised EDC for SSH is July 31, 2021. As per the information available on the PMSSY dashboard, the progress of civil construction works stands at 78.87%.In December last year, minister of state for health and family welfare, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, committed to start the OPD facility of the hospital by mid-January.The project worth ₹150 crore, is being executed with funds allocated by both central and state governments, having a respective share of ₹120 crore and ₹30 crore.Initially, the construction for the 210-bed specialised treatment facilities on the DMCH campus started in December 2016 and carried an 18-month deadline.DMCH incumbent principal Dr KN Mishra, who assumed charge in February this year, said, “At the given pace, it would take another six months to start the SSH.”“Construction works on the first two floors of the building have been completed while work on the third floor is nearing completion,” he said.Of the total budget, ₹85 crore was to be spent on the construction of the building while ₹15 crore was meant for painting, colouring and finishing touch.

He added daily wage workers have particularly struggled to find work and that has made ensuring three meals a day a challenge. Singh said that is why he decided to leave a share of the seasonal fruits from his orchards for his fellow villagers. He added it will help them boost their immunity and help fight Covid-19.Choti, a 33-year-old housewife, and mother of three, said her husband was without work for six months and the fruits from Singh’s orchard were a great help to her family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/phaldaani-the-fruit-donor-of-prayagraj-s-pachkhara-village-101623987983633.html

What’s the use of working hard and learning if students will be assessed on their previous performances? Appearing in improvement exam may improve board result but college admissions would be over by then.”“Usually, students reserve their efforts for board exams and perform exceptionally well. Inclusion of Class 11 marks is not fair,” he rued.Another class 12 student Vaishali Singh seemed happy over the assessment scheme.“I am not worried about the board results as I have scored good marks in the past. My class 11 score was slightly lower than class 12”, she said, adding that she had scored 10 CGPA in class 10. Meanwhile, several parents blamed Covid-19 infection for the poor performance of their wards in internal exams.Manoj Singh, whose daughter studies in class 12, said, “My daughter could not write three papers of her pre-board exam as she was Covid-19 infected. I am worried about her college admission which is likely to be impacted due to a low percentage. She aspires to take admission in Delhi University”.According to people privy to the matter, more than 82 thousand students in the state have filled the examination form to appear in class 12 exam conducted by the CBSE.Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, city coordinator of CBSE, who is also the principal of Baldwin Academy, welcomed the board’s decision. “The assessment scheme is friendly for students. We have received an elaborated guideline for dealing with various cases while result preparation. Inclusion of class 11 marks is important as students opt for different streams after their matriculation and class 11 results show their understanding of their selected subject. Those who will not be satisfied with results can appear in the improvement exam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cbse-class-12-assessment-criteria-evokes-mixed-response-among-patna-students-101623987203680.html
18-06-2021||Kolkata||It’s ‘Mamata Banerjee vs Suvendu Adhikari’ in Calcutta high court today||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has moved the Calcutta high court challenging her defeat in the Nandigram seat to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari. Justice Kausik Chanda is scheduled to hear the high-profile case virtually at 11am on Friday. Even though the Trinamool Congress (TMC) returned to power for the third consecutive term, Banerjee lost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Adhikari by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes. This was Banerjee’s first electoral loss in 32 years. According to TMC leaders Banerjee’s petition alleged that the votes were not counted properly. Adhikari, who switched to the BJP in December 2020, won the seat and went on to become the Leader of Opposition in the Bengal assembly. Also Read | ‘Wrote thrice to PM seeking Governor’s withdrawal’: Mamata on Jagdeep DhankharThe TMC chief had, on May 3, a day after the election results were announced, said that she would move court. “We will definitely move court. Our party workers are also staging a protest. We want a written statement from the Election Commission of India [EC] that the EVM machine, VVPAT and postal ballots will be kept separately so that they are not tampered with. And if found tampered with, they will have to undergo forensic tests,” Banerjee had said. She had also appealed to all political parties to jointly move the Supreme Court against the EC and urge the apex court to impose some restrictions on the poll panel. “How do you lose an election twice? First, at the hustings and then, like a sore loser, challenging people’s verdict in the court. It would be fascinating to see Mamata Banerjee suffer the humiliation of Nandigram defeat twice over,” tweeted Amit Malviya, national head of the BJP’s IT cell, on Thursday.Before and during the assembly elections, the TMC was at loggerheads with EC, with the ruling party repeatedly accusing the poll panel of working at the behest of the BJP-led government at the Centre. Both the BJP and the commission had, however, refuted such charges. Controversy about the Nandigram election had broken out the day it went to polls, April 1. On the day of voting, Banerjee, who was wheelchair-bound at the time because of an ankle injury, levelled charges of booth-rigging and refused to leave a polling station for two hours. When the election results were declared on May 2, the Trinamool Congress sought a recount when the results were announced but the EC didn’t allow it. Days later, Banerjee claimed that the returning officer who turned down the request for a recount was threatened, a charge the BJP promptly dismissed, insisting that the chief minister wasn’t able to “accept the reality”. The defeat in Nandigram was a blow to Banerjee, who led her party to a landslide victory in West Bengal assembly elections with 213 of the 292 seats — her party’s third straight win. Banerjee, who represented Bhabanipur in the 2016 assembly, announced her decision to contest from Nandigram a month before the eight-phase elections began.The high-profile seat, where a land agitation in 2007 propelled TMC to power in the state, elected Adhikari in 2016 when he was with the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-challenges-suvendu-s-nandigram-win-in-calcutta-hc-hearing-today-101623985943111.html

Scientists said patchy, intermittent pre-monsoon showers are likely to continue in Delhi-NCR in the coming days though it will not reduce the temperature, which will hover around 37°C-38°C, much.The minimum temperature on Friday is likely to be 27°C while maximum temperature is predicted to reach 37°C. The minimum temperature on Thursday was 26.2°C – two degrees below normal and the maximum temperature was 35°C – four degrees below normal.Also Read | How forecasters got their monsoon predictions wrong, againLast week, IMD predicted that the monsoon, which had advanced into northwest India, would hit Delhi by June 15. However, in a later forecast, IMD said that its arrival was delayed by 10-12 days.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the satisfactory category on Friday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7am stood at 92. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI had been 108, which is in the moderate category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".On Thursday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “Rainfall and aerosol washout are expected to improve AQI. AQI is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ to ‘satisfactory’ category for the next three days. An increase in dust emission from dry region of Rajasthan and a marginal increase in long-range dust transport is expected due to favourable wind direction but impact is unlikely to be significant as washout effect in and around Delhi will neutralise it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-intermittent-pre-monsoon-showers-likely-says-imd-101623984383059.html
18-06-2021||Delhi||Land for Ram temple was bought at hiked rates: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) again alleged on Thursday that land for the Ram temple in Ayodhya was bought at a higher cost than prevailing rates, and suggested that there was corruption in the deal.Addressing a press conference, the party’s Uttar Pradesh in-charge and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said 12,080 square metres (sqm) of land was bought for ₹18.50 crore, while a 10,370sqm-plot next to it was bought for ₹8 crore.“This clearly shows that there has been corruption in the purchase of land. If the rate of 10,370sqm of land for ₹8 crore is considered correct, then about 26,000sqm of land could be bought for ₹18.50 crore, whereas only 12,080 square meters of land was bought for ₹18.5 crore. The agreement, which the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) were repeatedly referring to, was cancelled on March 18,” Singh said.The temple trust has denied all allegations, saying the deal was done quickly, but in a transparent manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/land-for-ram-temple-was-bought-at-hiked-rates-aap-101623977870098.html
18-06-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court to hear pleas against activists’ bail release today||The Supreme Court will take up on Friday petitions by the Delhi Police for an immediate stay of Delhi high court orders giving bail to three student activists — Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha — arrested in May last year for allegedly instigating the February 2020 Delhi riots.The bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian will consider three separate appeals moved by the Delhi Police on Wednesday to contest the high court orders, which have indicted the police for invoking the anti-terror law against the students in their “anxiety to suppress dissent”.Police approached the apex court less than 24 hours after the bail orders, and also pressed for an urgent hearing on the ground that a stay on bail orders was imminent since persons accused of serious offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were to be released.However, the three student activists were released from prison on Thursday evening, and the development virtually negates the rationale behind the rush shown by Delhi Police in moving the Supreme Court and asking for a stay.Till the time the Supreme Court finally decides the appeals and accepts the Delhi Police’s request for setting aside the bail orders, the three will not be sent back to the jail. As a common principle of bail jurisprudence, once an accused gets released following a bail order, they cannot be sent back to jail until the bail order is not finally quashed on merits. No interim order, including an order of stay, impacts the liberty of the accused who was let out after a court of competent jurisdiction applied its mind and granted bail. The superior court must allow the appeal against the order of bail, and cancel the bail for an accused to be remanded back to prison.Therefore, even if the Supreme Court were to stay the Delhi high court order and the observation made therein with regard to the UAPA after hearing the Delhi Police’s appeals on Friday, the three student activists will remain out on bail for the time being.Narwal, Kalita and Tanha have also filed their caveats in the top court to ascertain no judicial orders are passed in the appeals without hearing them.Meanwhile, the police’s appeals claimed that the high court orders were not only “perverse” but also based mainly on a “social media narrative”. They added that the high court overlooked evidence on record and made “insinuation” against the state going beyond the remit of the bail pleas.Delhi Police further contended that bail for Jawarharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Narwal and Kalita, and Jamia Millia Islamia student Tanha was premised “on a preconceived and a completely erroneous illusion”. The judicial scrutiny by the high court, the appeals said, seemed to have been not to ascertain whether the evidence on record showed a prima facie case (under the anti-terror UAPA law) but to establish that it was a case of a protest by students and suppression of dissent by the government of the day. This, the plea said, was “without any foundation and appears to be based more on the social media narrative than the evidence gathered and elaborated in the charge sheet”.Challenging the three separate but similarly worded bail orders, the police said the high court “erroneously” interpreted certain provisions of the UAPA and watered down its provisions that will have far-reaching consequences for cases before investigating agencies.The high court order was a scathing indictment of the Delhi Police, terming the charges against the student activists “stretched”, “verbiage”, and “hyperbole” while adding that the state may have, by going after the protesters, blurred the line between the “right to protest” and “terrorist activity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-to-hear-pleas-against-activists-bail-release-today-101623976663649.html

Earlier, the size of the commercial plot allotted was 121 square yards.A senior GMADA officer said there was a good response to the scheme and they will be issuing letters of intent (LoI) to the owners in August. GMADA had announced land compensation for 1,600 acres in 11 villages in February this year. While 1,400 acres are privately owned, the remaining are panchayat land.Owners of around 1,300 of the 1,400 acres have applied for the scheme. Land is being acquired in Bakarpur, Rurka, Safipur, Matran, Siaun, Manauli, Patton, Saini Majra, Chau Majra, Naraingarh and Chhat villages. The compensation ranges from ₹1.82 crore to ₹4 crore per acre, the highest provided by GMADA to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmadas-aerotropolis-project-90-owners-apply-for-land-pooling-scheme-101623963620907.html

The accused, Rajat, 21,and Mukesh Kumar, 23, of Phase 1, Ram Darbar, and brothers Vishal, 24, and Pankaj, 28, of Kishangarh, Manimajra, have been arrested. Their accomplice Ajay Sharma is at large. The kidnappers had demanded ₹50 lakh as ransom, but later released the teen after four hours. “Three of the accused worked as recovery agents with a private bank, while Rajat was unemployed. The accused devised a plan to kidnap the 15-year-old for ransom so that they could settle their outstanding monthly instalments as their financial condition had been rendered tenuous after the lockdown, ” Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said. “Pankaj, who is addicted to online games such as PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and Garena Free Fire, was the mastermind. He had invested some money online and had suffered losses,” said Chahal. The accused were produced in court on Thursday and sent to four-day police remand. The knife used to commit the crime has been seized but the vehicle and toy pistol have yet to be found. Accused knew victim’s family The brothers, Pankaj and Vishal, knew the victim’s family. They were aware that the victim’s sister was to get married in October. “The victim had confided in the brothers about the purchases being made for the wedding. Therefore, the accused knew that the family had cash and gold in their home,” the SSP said. Mukesh was the first to be arrested. He was found by the technical cell after combing through CCTV footage. His statement led to the arrest of the other three. CCTV footage revealed that a white Maruti Suzuki Brezza with a fake Haryana number had been used to commit the crime. The same vehicle was spotted again but with a different number plate registered in the name of a resident of Sector 19, Panchkula. It was learnt that the vehicle’s owners had moved to Baltana and the vehicle was being used by one Ajay Sharma. How the plan fell through While Ajay, Mukesh and Rajat kidnapped the victim, Pankaj and Vishal shadowed the family. They even accompanied the family to the police station. “Pankaj also spoke to the kidnappers on behalf of the family and told them that money was being arranged. Later, Pankaj tipped off the kidnappers about police teams’ presence in the vicinity, after which the accused dropped the victim at Golden Estate, Baltana, from where he was recovered after he contacted his family,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-debt-ridden-men-arrested-for-chandigarh-teen-s-abduction-101623962606234.html

The book, With Honour and Glory: Five Great Artillery Battles, spans iconic artillery battles across four continents and 136 years, and includes the battles of Gettysburg (1863), Vimy Ridge (1917), Bir Hacheim (1942), Chhamb (1971) and Tololing/Tiger Hill (1999).It is written by Maj Gen AJS ‘Abdo’ Sandhu (retd) under the aegis of the United Services Institute of India’s Centre for Military History and Conflict Studies. Maj Gen Sandhu is the best-selling author of the 2017 book, Battleground Chhamb: The Indo-Pak War of 1971.Lt Gen Shukla released the book in an online ceremony, where discussions, chaired by Maj Gen Ian Carduzo (retd), were attended by the director-general, artillery, Army HQs, Lt Gen K Ravi Prasad, Colonel Commandants of the artillery regiments, and senior officers from artillery divisions, brigades and regiments.“The book fills in the gaps in narratives and paucity of information on great artillery battles. The role of artillery is somewhat underplayed while writing military history and my book aims to overcome this,” said Maj Gen Sandhu, a retired gunner officer, with familial roots in Chandigarh. The book features a chapter by HT’s Sunday Read columnist, Vikram Jit Singh, detailing his eyewitness accounts of artillery firing from vantage points at 15,800 feet and above during the Kargil War. It includes Singh’s recount of artillery firing during the night he spent on the Khalubar ridge, Batalik LOC sector, with troops of the 12 JAK Light Infantry, and being subjected to ground-burst and air-burst artillery by the Pakistan Army during his exposed climb up the Bhimbet nallah, Drass, with the 18 Garhwal Rifles, and while negotiating the cliff face above the Gragario nallah, Batalik.

But, with the Punjab assembly elections due early next year, he faces a slew of challenges in reviving his party’s political fortunes that hit a rough patch after snapping a 24-year-old alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last year. It also upset its core constituency of the peasantry over the three contentious farm laws that the SAD initially endorsed. The Badals also face heat over the politically sensitive cases of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and police firing during the Akali-BJP government’s tenure in 2015 as the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government pushes for a fresh probe.Last week, Badal stitched up a seat-sharing pact with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with an eye on Dalit votes that account for 32% of the state’s overall votes. He also took to the aggressive politics of protests to amplify anti-incumbency and galvanise his cadres. In a wide-ranging interview, the SAD president exuded confidence about next year’s high-stakes electoral battle. Edited excerpts:What is your take on Punjab’s political landscape?The ruling Congress has lost its credibility completely. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh doesn’t have a single worthwhile achievement. He made a whole lot of promises in the last elections by swearing by the Gutka Sahib (Sikh religious scripture). The people of Punjab are religious and emotional, and a lot of them voted for the Congress. He used the ultimate weapon he had to garner votes. If you don’t live up to a normal manifesto, people don’t get that angry. But, if you swear by God and fail to deliver, they’re not ready to accept it. Second, Congress MLAs have created havoc in their constituencies. They don’t think there’s a rule of law. Not a single sand mine has been auctioned in five years, but the MLAs have been given a free hand to steal government resources. The Congress will pay a price for corruption and abuse of power.There are several parties in the Opposition space, such as the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP, and breakaway Akali factions. Who will gain the most from all the issues that you have listed ?A party which people believe has the capacity, credibility and experience to run the government. If you leave the Congress out, people have three choices. One is the Aam Aadmi Party, which has also lost its credibility. It was a bubble that burst. Look at the downslide in its vote share, from 22% in the 2017 assembly elections to 6% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The second is the BJP, which will not be able to open an account because it is facing so much public ire. Then, there are splinter groups that will lose their security deposits. The only alternative for the people is the SAD-BSP alliance. It will be successful because of the SAD’s credibility. My father, Parkash Singh Badal, has been a five-time chief minister because of his credibility. In 2017, even though we lost and got only 15 seats (out of 117), our vote share was hardly 4% less than the winning Congress’s.The SAD has forged a poll pact with the BSP after 25 years. But the BSP has been a fringe player in Punjab as is evident from its performance in election after election. In the 2017 assembly polls, it got a mere 1.59% vote share and drew a blank in 111 of the 117 seats it contested. Where does your confidence about the alliance stem from?Our reference point is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. They (the BSP) fought three of the 13 Lok Sabha seats. In Jalandhar, their vote share was 20%; it was 14% in Hoshiarpur, and 13% in Anandpur Sahib. In fact, when AAP first emerged in Punjab in 2014, it took away the vote bank of the BSP and Communist parties. It talked about ‘inquilab’ and was seen as the next party of the poor. But now when the AAP has lost its steam, the same vote bank has reverted to original parties. Still, it was a dead-end for BSP. But, after allying with the Akalis, the BSP cadre will feel empowered that they can also form the government.Your party has historically identified itself with the Sikh peasantry that forms the core of the Akali support base. How has the ongoing agitation against the three farm laws changed your party’s equation with the farmers’ constituency?We are a part and parcel of farmers. The biggest farmers’ organisation is the Shiromani Akali Dal. Farmer bodies never wanted their movement to be politically supported because it would have given a ruse to the Narendra Modi government to brand their agitation as a political game. So, neither us, nor the Congress nor the AAP is a part of that. But, if you go to protest sites, 80% of those sitting there are from the Akali Dal.Your party initially endorsed the Centre’s ordinances Will that not cause a political blow back?Being an ally in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, we got caught in that trap. When the Centre bulldozed its way on farm laws in Parliament, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the sole SAD minister in the Union cabinet, resigned and we pulled out of the NDA. So, the SAD has stood by farmers. It was only when her resignation happened that the farmers’ protest, which was till then limited to Punjab, became a national issue. In 1984 when the army stormed the Golden Temple, the President and Union home minister were Sikh faces, but they never resigned. Harsimrat is the only Union minister to have left the Cabinet on an issue of grave significance for Punjab.What is the way forward to resolve the farmers’ agitation?The Prime Minister will have to take the initiative. He is like the head of a family. Laws are made for people. If the people you are making the laws for don’t want it, nobody should have an ego that I have done it and now I cannot withdraw it. If Mr Modi wants to be seen as Prime Minister of the people, then he should immediately withdraw the farm laws.What if the Centre doesn’t repeal the laws?Then this agitation will continue, whether it takes six months, one year or two years. Look at the way those poor farmers are holding on despite the cold, heat, Covid and mosquitoes.A new special investigation team (SIT), set up by the Captain Amarinder Singh government, is probing the 2015 police firing cases which is seen as a move to put the sacrilege issue in the spotlight in the run-up to the assembly elections.The SIT was not formed with an intention to find the criminal, rather it was done with political intention. That is why four-and-a-half years were wasted and the previous SIT head, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, got a rap from the Punjab and Haryana high court. Rather than going after criminals, he wanted to defame the Akali Dal. Even now, the intent is not to give justice. I urge the new SIT to rise above politics as sacrilege is an emotional issue.A section of the ruling Congress leaders, particularly Navjot Singh Sidhu, accuses chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of going soft on the firing and sacrilege issues, alleging a quid pro quo between him and the Badal family.Did Sidhu ever make this comment when he was a minister? The Congress leaders say such things when they turn Amarinder’s opponents. It’s their internal politics. Have we done anything wrong that the CM can charge us with? Capt Amarinder Singh has used SITs to defame the Badal family. He used Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh and the whole police machinery to go against us. He took every recourse, including the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission, to put us in the dock. But, just because he couldn’t find anything against us doesn’t mean he is soft on us.After snapping ties with the BJP, your party initiated talks on forming a third front at the national level with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. What has been the progress?The natural process has started. The regional parties have started winning elections; the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Next year, elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and other states will take place. More regional parties will come up. As we move closer to 2024, all of them will come on a platform. For instance, we have tied up with the BSP and are open to allying with the Left. Talks are happening. After all, they represent the same political ideology of social welfare that Sardar Parkash Singh Badal has worked for.Now that your father has almost retired from active politics, will you be the party’s CM face in the 2022 assembly polls?That is for the party to decide. He is already 94. From the bottom of my heart, I want him to continue in politics. I want his flag to continue till the end. At the moment he is not agreeing. For me, he is the Harvard University of politics. But for his guidance, I would have made a thousand more mistakes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/-modi-will-have-to-take-the-initiative-to-resolve-farm-stir-says-sukhbir-singh-badal-101623962240772.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Respite for patients as elective surgeries resume at GMSH, GMCH||In a huge relief for patients, Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, have decided to resume elective surgeries.However, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has yet to take a call on these procedures.Elective surgeries are planned in advance and do not involve a medical emergency. While emergency services continued, elective surgeries and out-patient departments (OPDs) in these three government hospitals were suspended after a sudden surge in the Covid-19 infections in April. “Since the cases have been dropping, we will start conducting two to three elective surgeries daily. In another fortnight, the number will be increased to 12-15 surgeries to reduce the pendency of cases. Before the pandemic struck, the hospital was performing over 25 surgeries on a daily basis, including the emergency ones,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director of the UT health department and medical superintendent, GMSH-16.He added that the hospital was also attending to nearly 1,300 people daily at the OPDs.At GMCH-32, director-principal Dr Jasbinder Kaur said, “Orders have been issued to resume elective surgeries, but we have not decided on resuming physical OPDs for now. We have extended the teleconsultation timings and will contact the patients whose surgeries are pending.”PGIMER’s official spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar said, “We are also deliberating on resuming elective surgeries and OPDs for physical consultations. A decision will be taken soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhrespite-for-patients-as-elective-surgeries-resume-at-gmsh-gmch-101623962180965.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||76% people aged over 45 have received first vaccine dose in Chandigarh||The UT health department’s target of inoculating the entire eligible population with at least one vaccine dose may soon be accomplished, as a significant 76% of those aged above 45 have already received the first dose as of Thursday.Besides, 33% of those aged between 18 and 45 have also taken their first dose since May 14, when Chandigarh began the third phase of the vaccination drive.“As per the latest electoral list, a total of 2,50,000 people in Chandigarh were eligible to take vaccine in the 45+ category, of which 1,91,925 people (76.7%) have received their first dose. A total of 47,394 beneficiaries have also completed their vaccination cycle after taking their second dose that amount to nearly 19% of the total people in the category,” said Dr Manjit Trehan, immunisation officer, Chandigarh.“In the 18-45 age bracket, 3,50,000 people are eligible to take the vaccine and 1,15,584 (33%) have already been inoculated once,” Dr Trehan said, adding that 69 beneficiaries in this age group had received the second dose as well.As far as special target groups are concerned, 70.3% of the total healthcare and 75.66% of the total frontline workers have received the first shot.In all, a total of 4,31,853 vaccine doses have been administered to people in Chandigarh.Though residents of other states have also received the jab in the city, the health department does not have specific data on their number.Vaccine supply regular, coverage to rise“The vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group is gradually picking up pace in Chandigarh, as we are now getting regular vaccine supply from the central government. On Thursday, 6,058 beneficiaries in this age bracket got inoculated. To vaccinate the remaining beneficiaries at the earliest, the UT health department has increased the number of mobile vaccination vans from four last week to 13 this week,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services, Chandigarh.On the road ahead, she said, “We aim to inoculate at least 8,000 beneficiaries daily for the next 10 days, as we have enough vaccine stock for this month, including 50,000 doses for those above 45 and 24,000 for the 18-45 age group. We expect another 71,000 doses in the June quota.”Walk-in vaccines for all over 18 from June 21From June 21, Chandigarh will start walk-in registration for all those above 18 years of age. Currently, prior appointment on the CoWin portal is required.“Many people are unable to book online appointments. So, we will open on-the-spot registration from June 21. Health department teams will also visit highly dense areas and call upon people to take the jab,” said Dr Kang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/76-people-aged-over-45-have-received-first-vaccine-dose-in-chandigarh-101623961940779.html

As many as 627 patients are recuperating in Mohali, followed by 432 in Chandigarh and 130 in Panchkula. The recovery rate continued to remain over 97% across the three jurisdictions.Those who died in Chandigarh were a 90-year-old woman from Sector 43, a 77-year-old man from Manimajra and a 57-year-old man from Sector 44.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-covid-cases-drop-to-lowest-in-116-days-101623961700656.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sharp drop in daily Covid tests in Chandigarh tricity as second wave ebbs away||With the Covid-19 pandemic abating, the health departments of the tricity also seem to have lowered their guard, if the number of daily tests is any indicator.Worst-hit by the pandemic, Mohali has seen the biggest drop of 75% in the number of daily tests between May and June, and the health teams here have also discontinued contact tracing.In Panchkula, there has been a 50% decline in the number of people tested in the same period, while the figure is a tad better in Chandigarh at 33%.Health experts have warned against these declining figures, as it may result in delayed detection of positive cases and invite a deadlier third wave.During the peak of the pandemic in May, nearly 4,500 people were being tested every day in Mohali that logged 19,924 cases and 373 deaths in the month, highest in the tricity.But since the advent of June, as the cases and deaths dropped to 1,464 and 373, respectively, in the past 17 days, now only 1,200 people are being tested each day.In Chandigarh, 17,399 people tested positive and 275 succumbed to the virus in May when 3,000 tests were being conducted daily. But the number has decreased to 2,000 per day, as the cases and deaths came down to 1,227 and 49, respectively.A total of 8,915 cases were reported in Panchkula in May and the district also lost 142 residents to the pandemic in the same month.As the district battled an unprecedented spike in cases, aggressive sampling was conducted, which helped in early detection of cases. This helped the cases drop to 540 and deaths to 17 in the first 17 days of June, when no fatality was reported on nine days.But with the decline in pandemic figures, testing has been reduced to less than 1,000 per day. On some days, even less than 500 people were tested.Fewer people turning up for testing“The decrease in testing is due to decline in voluntary testing. We have not withdrawn a single person from the testing teams. They are on duty the entire day but get only one or two samples. Rather, we are persuading people to get sampled but they are not cooperating. We can only provide the facility, cannot force anyone,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh.Mohali’s civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur also attributed the sharp dip in testing numbers to people not coming forward. “But on Thursday we got the fresh target of 4,000 tests per day, which we will pursue next week, she said.A senior official in the Mohali health department said the fall in the number of new cases could be because of lower testing. “Had the department kept up its pace of testing, the cases would have been much higher,” the official added.“The number of tests should be nearly 50 to 100 times the number of cases being reported. If there are an average of 50 new cases in a city every day then at least 3,000 to 5,000 tests must be conducted. In our experience this helps in early detection of cases,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former dean of PGIMER.“Health teams should also focus on contact tracing and at least 15 contacts of every infected person must be tested. Then all those visiting OPDs with flu-like symptoms, pregnant women, admitted patients and their attendants must also be sampled,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sharp-drop-in-daily-covid-tests-in-chandigarh-tricity-as-second-wave-ebbs-away-101623961463012.html

In his complaint, Ashok Rohilla, 47, had stated that on June 6, he received a phone call, with the caller identifying himself as an RBL bank official.To help him stop deduction of monthly charges, the caller took his credit card details and an OTP sent to his mobile phone number. Following this, ₹59,999 that were deducted in four transactions from Rohilla’s credit card. On his complaint, a case under Sections 419, 420 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector-26 police station and the accused were arrested. Police also seized their mobile phones containing data related to the RBL credit card.The duo was produced in a Chandigarh court on Thursday and sent to eight-day police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-two-men-held-for-fraudulent-credit-card-transaction-101623961280729.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Dug-up sidewalks a safety hazard in Chandigarh’s Sector 8||The residents of Sector 8 are fumed over the UT electricity department leaving the roadsides dug up. They allege that the department failed to level and repair such patches after laying underground wires in the area.With monsoon already unfurling in the city, their fears have only compounded. They say that accumulation of water in the pits due to rainfall poses huge safety risk.Sector 8 was chosen for a pilot project in which underground power lines were to be laid by the department. While the project was sanctioned in 2017, works were taken up only at the beginning of this year, giving rise to numerous trenches over the past few months.President of the sector’s resident welfare body, RS Gill said, “Since November last year, sidewalks have been dug up thrice, giving much trouble to the residents. After two telecom companies laid underground wires here, the electricity department dug up the roadsides again for a project.”Gill complained that the earthworks were taken up indiscriminately before people’s houses. “At some places, the road has caved in, inviting mishaps. These pits are also dangerous for pedestrians, especially during rain when they won’t be visible. The sand taken out after digging these holes has been washed away by the recent spells of rain, clogging the water gullies. Now more waterlogging awaits us,” he rued.Captain (retd) GS Ghuman, who lives opposite to the Sector 8 market, contended, “It has been many months now and it seems that the work has been abandoned by the officials, leaving the ruts behind. The dug-up sidewalks pose risk for senior citizens, many of whom tend to use them frequently.”Local area councillor and senior deputy mayor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said, “The timing of the three projects has been such that the trenches have stayed there for the past few months. However, we have followed it up with the UT administration. Once the underground wiring work of Sector 8-C is completed, the MC will start restoration work of all spots that were dug up. If any resident is facing problems due to this, they may approach me, and I shall resolve the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dugup-sidewalks-a-safety-hazard-in-chandigarh-s-sector-8-101623961100866.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab ministers Sarkaria, Randhawa threaten to boycott meeting, CM’s aide Suresh Kumar stays away||Amid their ongoing standoff with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, cabinet ministers Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa threatened to boycott a pre-cabinet meeting held on Thursday to keep his (CM’s) chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar out. Sarkaria and Randhawa were part of one of the two groups of ministers called for discussion on the recommendations of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission that are to be placed before the state cabinet on Friday. The duo expressed reservations about the presence of the chief minister’s top aide in the meeting. “Sarkaria told an officer of the chief minister’s office (CMO) that he would not participate in the meeting in case Kumar is attending it. When the CPSCM learnt about the minister’s stand, he decided to keep away from the meeting,” according to two persons aware of the developments. Both Randhawa and Sarkaria have been critical of the chief minister lately, particularly his handling of the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case and over-reliance on bureaucrats. Sarkaria and Randhawa were in the first group of cabinet ministers that also included Brahm Mohindra, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Charanjit Singh Channi, Razia Sultana and Gurpreet Singh Kangar. The remaining ministers were in the second group and four of them, including Manpreet Singh Badal and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, asked Kumar to join the meeting, but he did not, according to sources. Barring Razia Sultana who was away, all other ministers attended the discussions. Thursday’s developments are being seen in political and bureaucratic circles as part of the ongoing rift in the ruling party and an embarrassment for the chief minister. Kumar, who has been the top aide of Amarinder in the past four-and-a-half years and enjoys his confidence, had along with the chief secretary, arranged for discussion with the ministers on the pay commission recommendations. The pay panel has recommended a two-fold increase in salaries of all employees over the previous pay panel, with increase in minimum pay from ₹6,950 to ₹18,000 per month, with retrospective effect from January 1, 2016. The overall financial implication, including the arrears for the previous five years, of the salary revision has been pegged at a whopping ₹35,000 crore. “Once approved by the council of ministers, the revised pay scales will be implemented from July 1,” he said. It is not clear whether Kumar would attend the cabinet meeting on Friday or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ministers-sarkaria-randhawa-threaten-to-boycott-meeting-cm-s-aide-suresh-kumar-stays-away-101623960680536.html
18-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The work-from-home pro||On the laptop, the Microsoft Excel file is open. The young man with a week-old stubble is urgently poring over sales invoices and balance sheets. This concerns a UK client, and he must complete the auditing of their financial year revenue before the next morning in London.This is just another day for Zubair Alvi, 25. A “Senior 2” in a Gurugram consultancy firm, his office is in the Cyber City. But he is in Chitli Qabar, in Old Delhi. Outside his window the lane is teeming with hawkers and goats. His mother is sitting next to him, checking a recipe (fried rice) on her mobile.“This is my WFH,” says Mr Alvi. Since the pandemic’s second surge, he has—again—been obliged to work from home.Earlier, he would wake up every morning at 7.30, when everybody else at home would be asleep. His mother would have prepared his lunch box the night before, and kept it in the fridge. He would put it into his bag and walk out of the house, then out of the gali, and then towards the Chawri Bazar Metro station. He would reach by 9.45 for the morning meeting with the team.That meeting still takes place at the same time, but Mr Alvi now gets up just a minute before and attends it on his mobile, while still in the bed. “I go to my office by 10.30.”The office is downstairs, the family’s living room, where no one in the large household disturbs him. It has a mattress laid on the floor, covered with a white sheet, and long gaontakian pillows stacked against the wall. The niche has the portrait of poet, the late Musheer Ul Hasan Jhinjhanvi. He was Mr Alvi’s grandfather.“It’s nice to work from home. You get to have short naps in between, which freshens up your mind.”Here his mother intervenes, wishing old days could come back so that her son could start going to Gurugram again. “Hai, it feels so nice to have mera bachcha (my child) going to Gurgaon for work.”Before the second surge, Mr Alvi would leave his office at 8pm and reach home at 10. These days, he shuts down his laptop by 10 “because when you work from home, you end up working for longer hours.” He then walks up the stairs, to a fresh hot dinner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-work-from-home-pro-101623959630347.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||NGT panel visits Una to probe illegal mining in Swan river||A five-member panel constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) visited Una district of Himachal Pradesh on Thursday to probe the allegation of illegal mining in Som Bhadra or Swan river.The panel headed by former judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court Justice Jasbir Singh has regional officers of the Central Pollution Control Board, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Central Soil and Water Conversation Research Institute (Dehradun) and the Himalayan Forest Research Institute, Shimla, as its members.Una DC Raghav Sharma and officers of state mining department and pollution control board were also present during the inspection. Justice Singh asked the state and district mining authorities to conduct a survey of illegal mining and submit a report in this regard.He said the panel would make some recommendations to curb the illegal mining like geo-fencing of mining lease, use of global positioning system (GPS) in the vehicles carrying the mining material and setting up a control room.“The panel would also recommend reducing the mining lease duration from five to two years. Recommendation would also be made that the after completion of mining period, the same area should not be leased out for at least one year,” he said.Justice Singh directed the mining authorities to fix permanent level signpost in each mining area indicating that the mining cannot be done beyond a specific depth from the surface level.He expressed surprise that while the mining was being carried out in the entire area, no one was to be seen during the inspection. If they were doing mining as per norms, it should have continued today, he said.The panel later also visited a stone crusher in the Basal area and directed the operators to maintain a record of labourers engaged and wages paid to them. He observed that the stone crusher had not built storage tanks for gravel washing water and it was being released into the river.He also directed to take immediate steps to curb the air pollution caused by the stone crusher units and minimise the damage to the agriculture. Amandeep, the complainant in this case, told the team that mining mafia already knew about the visit of the panel and had filled up the pits dug earlier. The NGT had constituted an independent five-member committee on March 2 on a petition filed by Amandeep.In his petition, he stated that the Centre had sanctioned ₹ 922 crore for channelisation of the river. Under the project, 73 rivulets were also channelised to save the agricultural land from flooding in monsoons.He alleged that the sand mafia, enjoying political patronage, under the garb of mining licence has been lifting sand and gravel from the riverbed in an unscientific manner.Amandeep alleged that overloaded trucks were damaging the roads and causing pollution while the unscientific mining was defeating the purpose of channelisation and may also cause damage to the bridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-panel-visits-una-to-probe-illegal-mining-in-swan-river-101623959783367.html

18-06-2021||Chandigarh||70% of HP central varsity campus to come up at Dehra, 30% at Dharamshala, says V-C||The issue of permanent campus of Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) is likely to heat up again after vice-chancellor Prof Roshan Lal Sharma on Thursday clarified that the major part of the campus would come up at Dehra as planned at the time of inception of the varsity.Sharma, in a press conference, said 70% campus with main academic block will come up at Dehra. Thirty percent part that is proposed to come up at Dharmshala mainly includes administrative block.CUHP was handed over the possession of 81.7 hectares of land at Dehra on June 14, fuelling hopes that it would soon get its permanent campus. The issue of permanent campus is hanging fire for more than a decade. Since its inception in 2010, the varsity still functions from three temporary academic blocks situated at Dharamshala, Dehra and Shahpur.“CUHP has now 115 hectares of land at Dehra to its name and we are soon going to hold a meeting of the building committee which would plan next course of action so that construction work is started at earliest,” said Sharma.We, however, want to make it clear that campus would come up at both the sites.Acting registrar of CUHP Hem Raj said as per the central government’s norms, 300 hectares of land is required for setting up campus of a central university.He said 99 hectares of land has been identified at Jadrangal near Dharamshala, geological survey report of which is yet to come.The CUHP campus has been a bone of contention between the BJP and the Congress, which is also the major reason for delay in its setting up. When the varsity came into being in 2010, the BJP was in ruling and proposed two campuses — 70% and Dehra and 30% at Dharamshala.The Congress opposed the decision stating that the institution was meant for Dharamshala and was being shifted to Dehra on behest of Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur as it is a part of his parliamentary constituency.The forest clearance delayed the project and the state saw a change of government in 2012. The Congress after coming to power reversed the previous government’s decision proposing 70% campus at Dharamshala. First land was indentified at Indrunag which was rejected by the centre for being unfit for construction. Later, a chunk of land was identified at Jandrangal. In 2017, the BJP again came to power but there was no progress in the project. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and Union minister Anurag Thakur even had an argument over the issue during a public meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/70-of-hp-central-varsity-campus-to-come-up-at-dehra-30-at-dharamshala-says-vc-101623959780523.html

18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Environmentalists fume over forest dept’s move to axe hundreds of trees in Budgam||The forest department has axed hundreds of trees in central Kashmir’s Budgam in the past 10 days, causing outrage among environmentalists and forest lovers.The action comes shortly after a four-year-old girl was mauled to death by a leopard. Locals accused the forest department of ‘wanton felling’ of hundreds of cuprous and robinia trees in the name of thinning the eight hectare (160 Kanal) forest nursery at Ompura in Budgam, where the mauled body of the girl was found on June 4, just 1km from her home.“On the pretext of thinning, the forest department is destroying this nursery of trees. They have been randomly cutting down the trees with utter disregard of the environment and the role this nursery played in the ecosystem of this area,” said a local, Irshad Ahmad.“How can cutting down the forests stop man-animal conflict? The officials have to strike a balance. They have to protect the vegetation as well as the human lives,” he said.Irshad said that officials were also burning the fallen foliage and branches inside the nursery which can trigger forest fires. “They have no idea that it can cause a huge disaster,” he said. Following the death of girl and to assuage the emotions of the enraged locals, the district administration then decided to remove the “fallen material and other cultural operations” from the forest area to “avoid any further loss of life”. On June 15, Jammu and Kashmir administration announced that the leopard responsible for killing was captured following a massive operation.Another resident of Ompura said that the fencing of the lawn of the house from which the girl was taken was open at certain places through which the animal was believed to have entered. “Before the incident, we had been repeatedly asking the wildlife department about the sightings of the wild animals, but they did not seem to care,” he said, not wishing to be named. He said that the administration needs to erect a strong and effective iron-mesh fence around this forest area wherever it has been damaged to prevent animals from entering the colony. Officials said that the eight-hectare land was turned into a forest nursery in the early 90s to stop the soil erosion in Budgam which has many natural slopes.Raja Muzaffar Bhat, a prominent social and environmental activist of Budgam, was aghast over the felling of trees.“It is not right. Instead of afforestation they are cutting down the trees. Most of the nurseries of the forest department are not being properly taken care of,” he said.Wasim Balki, range officer, Budgam forest department, said they have trimmed down and pruned trees on two hectares out of the eight hectares so far.He, however, denied that they were “wantonly felling” the trees.“We are clearing the trees which have fallen on the ground, or those uprooted or broken. We don’t touch healthy green trees. Only their branches are being cut to thin out the area,” he said. “There is no random feeling of trees. Every tree is enumerated and a list of trees which have to be cut and which not, has been prepared,” he said.He said the nursery was having dense vegetation. “We are also pruning big branches to increase the visibility. It may take another 15 days,” he said.He did acknowledge that they were burning the dried foliage to clear the area. “Where else will we take it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/environmentalists-fume-over-forest-dept-s-move-to-axe-hundreds-of-trees-in-budgam-101623959720775.html

BJP leaders and councillors also slammed the civic body over its decision to hand over recovery of taxes/fee to a private contractor, stating that this will encourage “gunda raj” and result in harassment for the public.They said that not only will houses upto 125 square yards now have to pay ₹2,400 every year, the tariff has been increased by upto 60% for different categories. Only houses upto 50 square yards are exempted.BJP district president Pushpinder Singal said that the civic body is putting additional financial burden on residents when they are struggling to make ends meet , which is unacceptable. “We appeal to residents living in houses upto 125 square yards to not to pay the hiked charges, as exemption will be reintroduced after the BJP comes into power after the 2022 legislative assembly elections,” he said.Leader of BJP councillors in MC house, Sunita Rani and former councillor Inder Aggarwal said that the MC should revoke the decision to hire a private firm for recovery of taxes/fee from the residents. They said that BJP will intensify the agitation if relief is not provided. Apart from the opposition, Congress councillors from central constituency and MLA Surinder Dawar had also opposed the move. Dawar had said that he will also take up the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu and if required, approach local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra.Revised tariff approved by MC House: MayorHitting back at the BJP, mayor Balkar Sandhu said that the MC general House, of which BJP councillors are also a part of, had approved the revised tariff in the past. He said that the state government is working to introduce the canal-based water supply project in the city which has to be funded by the World Bank. So, It was mandatory to make changes in the water tariff, otherwise the funds for the project would not be approved. He said that houses upto 50 square yards area have been exempted and less than ₹4 per day is being charged for water supply from houses with area upto 125 square yards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-stages-protest-against-ludhiana-mc-over-revocation-of-exemption-on-water-sewer-charges-101623958044929.html

18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab’s weekly positivity rate sees sharp decline||Punjab’s Covid-19 curve appears to have flattened completely with the state’s average weekly positivity rate coming down to 1.5% from 5% within four weeks. The figures obtained from the health department reveal that the state’s average positivity rate for May 20-26 was 5%, which dropped to 3% and 2% in the subsequent two weeks and was recorded at 1.5% in the week ending June 17. The past one month has also seen the number of daily cases dropping from around 7,000 to 669 on June 17. The sharp dip in the positivity rate has been witnessed even as the state government has been conducting over 50,000 tests a day despite the drop in new cases. Experts say it is expected to go down further. Positivity rate is the true indicator of the growth or decline in the spread of an infection, as it is the proportion of people testing positive among all those sampled. “We have not compromised with testing at all even with the decline in cases. That is why we consider the 1.5% positivity ratio as a sign of relief for us. We expect further dip in the cases by the end of this month,” said the state’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. Punjab had registered the highest positivity rate of 14.2% on May 12. The state at present has 10,046 active cases, which are lowest in the past three months. High fatality rate cause of concernMeanwhile, as in the past, the case fatality ratio (CFR) continues to remain a cause of concern, as the number of deaths registered proportionate to the new cases is still high in Punjab. Data suggest that the state’s CFR has further notched up to 2.7% from 2.6% a week back. In the week between June 9 and 15, the state registered 257 deaths, with an average of 36 deaths a day. “The number of deaths is high as serious patients may take two to three weeks to recover. We expect the daily deaths to fall further by the end of next week,” said the nodal officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19punjabs-weekly-positivity-rate-sees-sharp-decline-101623957620097.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab AG accuses ACS (home) of interference, complains to CM||Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda has complained to the state government accusing additional chief secretary (home) of interference in his office and abolishing some posts without consulting him. In a letter, shot off to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and chief secretary Vini Mahajan on June 14, Nanda alleged that 23 posts in AG office were abolished by the additional chief secretary, home (he did not name Anurag Agarwal) without any discussion with him. Nanda said the move has come at a time when next six months were crucial as the Congress government was nearing towards the end of its tenure and may face critical litigation which will require the AG office to work at its full strength. “It’s a serious matter and amounts to clear interference that affects functioning and administration of my office. At a time like this, to try and cripple my office with the abolishing of posts, betrays an arbitrary approach, if not, a total non- application of mind by the ACS, home,” the AG’s strongly worded letter reads. The letter seeks intervention from the chief secretary so that the ACS (home) can be directed to revive the said posts. The posts, as per letter, were abolished in February. When contacted, Nanda said he would not comment on any communication between the AG office and the state government. Agarwal, on the other hand, said he had not seen the letter. “It is normal government communication, I will respond to it after seeing it, he added. The posts in question are of librarian and steno’s etc which the AG has termed critical for the functioning of any lawyer’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ag-accuses-acs-home-of-interference-complains-to-cm-101623957440270.html
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Portion of road caves in at Model Town’s Gol Market in Ludhiana||A portion of the road caved in at Gol Market in Model Town after one of the walls of a manhole collapsed on Thursday. No casualty or damage to property was reported. Shopkeepers in the area blame the civic body’s nonchalance for the incident, saying that no corrective measures were taken to repair the damaged manhole despite alerting the authorities and submitting a complaint. Arvind Sharma, one of the traders in the area, says the municipal corporation officials were not startled into action after the cave in and have merely poured sand on the damaged portion. “It seems the officials are waiting for some major accident. If the manhole is not repaired in time, the road may be further damaged,” he said. Municipal corporation superintending engineer Ravinder Garg said the damaged portion was covered with sand so that accidents can be avoided. “The field staff has already been directed to take corrective steps. Residents say that the road caved in because of a damaged manhole but the exact reason will be known once the MC staff digs up the road.” A road collapse just ahead of the torrential monsoons does not bode well for the civic body officials as cave-in incidents are reported across the district every year during the period. Authorities say laying of underground wires, which has damaged sewer lines and caused leaking water to wash away the sand, is primarily responsible for the incidents. Last year too, road cave-in incidents were reported in Dugri, and Kaka Marriage Palace Road among other areas. The Gol Market road cave-in comes a day after former councillor Parminder Mehta had slammed the civic body for incomplete sewer installation work near the Clock Tower. He had alleged that sand poured over the dug up areas had caved in due to rain accumulation on June 4, causing at least half-a-dozen vehicles to get stuck in the pits at the construction site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/portion-of-road-caves-in-at-model-town-s-gol-market-in-ludhiana-101623957380763.html

However, a water cut is not on the cards yet, civic officials said. According to BMC data, the water level is only 12.57% in the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city as on Thursday morning, which is a decline from last week’s 12.84% owing to absence of rainfall at catchment areas.A BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “ On June 30, we will hold a review meeting wherein the lake level stock will be considered for deciding whether any water cut needs to be announced or not. Though the catchment areas have not got much rainfall yet, the forecast is good. Hence, we are expecting that in the next two weeks before the review meeting, there will be good rainfall in the catchment areas.” For nearly 10 days, it has been raining heavily in Mumbai and the neighbouring areas, but the catchment areas of the lakes supplying water to the city have not received substantial rainfall. As such, the available water stock has not increased yet. Of the seven lakes, five are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. Only Tulsi and Vihar lakes – located inside the city – are half-filled at 52%, but the remaining five lakes are yet to get substantial rainfall for water levels to increase.Bhatsa, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement, has water level at 10%. Modak Sagar has 34% water, followed by Tansa and Middle Vaitarna lakes at 14% and 11%, respectively. Upper Vaitarna has no water left as on Thursday. Last year around this period too, there was no water in Upper Vaitarna dam.The lakes are bifurcated into two systems: the Vaitarna system supplies water to the western suburbs and the island city, while the Bhatsa system provides water to the eastern suburbs. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand of 4,200 million litres.The city had experienced 20% water cut last year in August amid the Covid-19 outbreak, owing to low levels of water in the lakes. Last year, BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had also prepared a backup plan to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar, if required. However, later the water cut was rolled back owing to good rainfall. No water cut was imposed in 2019, owing to good rainfall in catchment areas, but in 2018, BMC had imposed 10% water cut, while in 2016 and 2014, the city faced 20% and 25% cut water cut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-to-review-lake-levels-to-decide-on-cuts-101623957379546.html

ICG used one of its ships and two Chetak helicopters for rescuing the crew members of MV Mangalam amid inclement weather and very rough seas.An ICG official said that the maritime rescue coordination centre (MRCC) had received a call in the morning from the second officer of MV Mangalam, alerting the centre that the vessel was partially sinking with 16 crew members on board around 3km near Revdanda jetty. The officer also informed MRCC that the crew members were in panic as the water had started entering the vessel. Immediately after getting the information, ICG ship Subhadra Kumari Chauhan sailed out from Dighi harbour and proceeded towards the distressed vessel. “During the conversation, an MRCC team pacified the caller and crew members and requested them to remain on board as the coast guard ship had been deployed for their help,” said an ICG official.“The ICG ship reached the distressed vessel around 10.15am, and after assessing the situation, lowered her boats to rescue the crew amid challenging weather situation,” stated an ICG release.In the meanwhile, two Chetak helicopters were also launched from ICG’s air station at Daman . The helicopters commenced winching of the crew against the vagaries of weather. “The crew was taken to Revdanda port,” said ICG commandant (JG) and spokesperson Avinandan Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indian-coast-guard-rescues-all-16-onboard-a-sinking-ship-in-raigad-101623957259689.html
18-06-2021||Other||Farmers with land on border not paid compensation for three years||Tarn Taran Over 35,000 farmers of 220 villages who own land between the barbed wire fence and the zero line at the India-Pakistan border continue to wait compensation that is due to them for not being able to use their land effectively, because of restrictions that the Border Security Force (BSF) imposes in the area. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government that was in power at the Centre in the early 2000s had started a scheme to provide relief worth ₹2,500 per acre to border farmers. In 2016, the compensation was enhanced to ₹10,000 per acre in 2016. The Centre and state governments contribute 50% each to fund the compensation.Farmers in Tarn Taran are harassed as the administration is yet to clear Utilisation Certificates (UCs) on distribution of compensation to some farmers for 2016 and 2017.The land, roughly around 27,000 acre, is spread across the six districts of Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Ferozepur and Fazilka. Farmers, who had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) in December 2020, for the release of the compensation from 2018-2020, said the Centre was ready to issue its 50% share, but with a condition that the state government should clear the UCs of the compensation distributed to farmers for 2016 and 2017. Farmers, however, have now threatened an indefinite stir outside Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala if the issue is not sorted out by July.“During our hearings in court, the BSF said that it will release its share immediately after the state government issues UCs of the earlier distributed compensation. Barring Tarn Taran, other districts have issued the UCs. Tarn Taran has not issued the UCs due to a scam in the distribution of compensation in 2016 and 2017,” said Raghbir Singh Bhangala, president of Border Area Farmers Welfare Committee (BAFWC).“Over 4,000 farmers were excluded in Tarn Taran for 2016 and 2017 compensation. Some revenue officers, with the collusion of the then sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Anupreet Kaur, misappropriated the funds. These farmers, who belong to 32 villages, are now being asked by officials to sign papers that they have received the compensation,” he alleged.Kabal Singh Muhawa, BAFWC’s Amritsar district president, said, “The compensation should be released immediately as many farmers are struggling to make ends meet due to covid-19.”Bhikhwind SDM Rajesh Sharma said, “The scam was pegged at around ₹2 crore. We have recovered around 30 lakh from the accused and this amount has been distributed to some farmers. We have requested the government to release last three year’s compensation amount.” He said a case against the accused in this regard is pending in a court and UCs of ₹1.75 crore could only be issued, once it was settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-with-land-on-border-not-paid-compensation-for-three-years-101623957080766.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Are Mumbai’s flamingos in the pink of health?||For the past three years, a group of 20-25 researchers and field staff have been residing at the Bombay Natural History Society’s (BNHS) field station in Airoli, which was set up in 2017 to facilitate scientific studies in and around Thane Creek and Navi Mumbai. On three consecutive days each month — depending on when the tide is most favourable — the researchers set out to survey 46 kilometres of marshes that line the banks of Thane Creek, a coastal inlet off the city’s eastern waterfront separating it from mainland Maharashtra. Armed with gumboots, lifejackets, binoculars, cameras, and a variety of data sheets, the group breaks off at Airoli jetty into smaller teams. A few team up with local fishermen, who help them wade into the mudflats on long, wooden planks, where the researchers use a tube-like implement called a grab sampler to extract columns of the loose, squishy sediment that makes up the creek’s mudflats. Each excursion lasts between three to five hours. Samples and data collected from the field are then brought back to the BNHS campus for laboratory assessment. During the months when flamingoes and other migratory shorebirds arrive to feed on the algae, cyanobacteria and small crustaceans that live in the creekbed, the group ventures into deeper water to count, photograph and observe these birds in their habitat. The end goal, researchers explained, is to draw up an evidence-based conservation blueprint for the ecology of Thane Creek, which many say is at risk from pollution and upcoming infrastructure projects. It’s also part of an ongoing long-term study — the first of its kind — to assess the populations and behaviours of flamingos and other waders in Thane Creek. Bridging the gap Flamingos have been flocking to Mumbai for close to three decades, and though experts maintain they have probably visited in smaller groups earlier, the first large congregation (about 8,000 birds) was observed only in 1994. Their numbers have since grown, with hundreds of thousands annually migrating from their breeding grounds in the Rann of Kutch to the landscape in and around Thane Creek, arriving usually in November and staying till early June.Little else is known about why they visit and what their relationship is to the city’s environment. The BNHS conducted a preliminary assessment of the area’s avian biodiversity and prepared a report in 2015, when they were commissioned to conduct a 10-year-long study after the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) — a 22-km-long bridge to be built across the mouth of Thane Creek from Sewri in south-east Mumbai to Chirle in Uran, Raigad district — was given the go ahead. In September 2015, ahead of the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ visit to Japan, to meet with the project’s primary benefactors — the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) — the state accepted a key condition put forth by the Union environment ministry, without which the MTHL would have been denied the mandatory environmental clearance (EC) needed for work to take off. The condition was that a long-term monitoring study of flamingos and other shorebirds in Thane Creek be outsourced to BNHS, who would track their numbers alongside the construction and operation of the MTHL. The BNHS study (which began in 2017) will conclude in 2027. Learning about waders Researchers highlighted four broad aims of their ongoing study. First, they are trying to assess the true extent of the Creek’s flamingo population, with recent estimates putting it between 100,000 to 150,000 annually. The second is to assess the availability and distribution of food in the creek’s intertidal mudflats. The third goal is to learn more about the flamingos’ migratory paths. Though largely from Gujarat, researchers now believe that some birds may also be flying over from Kazakhstan and Iran. A total of 39 birds in the creek have been tagged with aluminium rings bearing unique ID numbers, and may be re-sighted in other countries. Two birds tagged in Mumbai have been tracked from Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in the last two years, and researchers also plan to tag about 10 flamingoes with radio-collars by December 2021. And finally, the researchers also hope to also understand the relationship of the birds to the creek. They now know that the birds are habituated to feeding sites, and that a group of flamingos will forage in the same spot, day after day. Researchers also know that the largest groups congregate in Sewri, Mahul and Airoli, and that they use satellite wetlands in Bhandup, Navi Mumbai and Uran as roosting grounds during high-tide, when the water level in the creek rises. “We are also studying the birds’ behavioural responses to disturbances like the MTHL construction, and fishing,” said Mrugank Prabhu, a scientist at BNHS and one of the residents at its Airoli field station. At the moment though, Prabhu added, it is still too early to draw any conclusions from the work his team has done. When asked specifically if the MTHL construction underway had an impact on flamingo numbers in Sewri and Nhava, he emphasized that “the birds have not abandoned the area despite the project.” “They are keeping a safe distance from the construction site, and are feeding there in good numbers. The disturbance may be temporary, but only long term monitoring will reveal that,” added Rahul Khot, assistant director at BNHS. ““There is a paucity of historical data on the subject of flamingos and the ecology of the creek, which is an incredibly dynamic system. Our long-term ecological monitoring study is a flagship effort toward shaping conservation policies in future. We are finally producing the critical data that is required for this,” said Khot. The absence of a proper study has been a sticking point for environmentalists. Had such a long-term monitoring study been undertaken prior to the construction of the MTHL, the impact of the project would be easier to gauge and mitigate. “The state has been content to use these flamingos as tourist attractions, but didn’t think of investing in conservation until it absolutely had to,” said Stalin D, director of non-governmental organisation Vanashakti. Raising concerns The environmentalists’ main objection to the MTHL has been its direct passage through the Sewri-Mahul mudflats, which provide a habitat for as much as 15% of the near threatened lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor) in South Asia. In its preliminary assessment, the BNHS recommended that this section be re-routed, but the suggestion was not accepted by the state government. However, based on environmentalists’ demands and a recommendation by the Union ministry of environment, the state declared 1,690.5 hectares of the creek — in Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Kanjur and parts of Mandale village — as a Flamingo Sanctuary in 2015. The forest department even prepared a 10-year management plan. With MTHL cutting through a sizeable portion of migratory bird habitat in Sewri and Nhava, the sanctuary, which is north of the MTHL, has delineated a zone in which further development and infrastructure projects would be restricted. Experts, however, also cautioned that the MTHL isn’t the only thing to watch. Pollution from domestic sewage, effluents from over 4,000 industrial units which line the creek, and hot water discharges from Tata thermal power plant and the BARC nuclear research reactor causes an edge effect: rapid ecological changes between two habitats (such as land and water) which can create a set of specific conditions that allow certain species to thrive. In this case, rapid pollution and siltation in the Thane Creek is leading to a proliferation of food (and feeding) grounds and driving up flamingo numbers. “It’s somewhat of a paradox that pollution helps the flamingos thrive. The real question is to what degree the creek could sustain these processes before risking their survival?” asked Dr Prasad Karni, a biologist and member of the Paryavaran Dakshata Mandal, a Thane-based environment advocacy group. Rapid siltation is making the creek shallower and narrower. HT reported on June 14 that a study by the state forest department’s mangrove cell indicated that Thane Creek has lost 30 sq km of its water spread since 1972, with most of this area having been turned into fresh mudflats. These are believed to support flamingos for a time, but soon become overrun with mangroves that take root in the silt. “Flamingos and migratory waders are benefiting from the shrinking waterways as their population increase is being witnessed in the same trajectory as the expansion of mudflats and mangroves. This in combination with high sewage load that MMR is pumping into the creek as well as warm water from refineries and power plants make it a perfect feeding ground, with nutrient rich flora and fauna,” said Dr Deepak Apte, a marine biologist who helmed the MTHL flamingo monitoring programme as former director of BNHS. “The way I see it, MTHL is not as much of an issue as these other changes happening inside the creek. Heavy siltation is already promoting growth of mangroves, which if left unchecked will outgrow the available area for birds to forage. This is not good news for flamingos, who prefer shallow mudflats over mangrove forests,” said Apte, calling for the implementation of an ecological restoration plan for Thane Creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/are-mumbai-s-flamingos-in-the-pink-of-health-101623957079553.html

The complainant, Jaskaran Singh of Sherpur Khurd village, had married the accused Gurleen Kaur in 2018.He had borne all expenses for sending her abroad on a study visa. However, Gurleen, allegedly refused to honour the deal once she reached Canada and said she will divorce him. Gurleen and her mother Sarabjit Kaur of Ayali Kalan village, and their relative Karan Grewal of Aasi Kalan village have been booked for fraud under sections of the Indian Penal Code. Foreign dreams shattered There has been an upsurge in cases where grooms’ foreign dreams have been shattered after their wives, whom they married for the express purpose of procuring a spouse visa, have disowned them upon reaching foreign lands over the last three months, especially in rural areas. The majority of the cases are lodged in Ludhiana rural, Ludhiana police commissionerate and Khanna.Targets found in matrimonial columnsSenior superintendent of police (SSP, Ludhiana rural) Charanjit Singh Sohal says women aspiring to settle abroad often find their targets through advertisements in matrimonial columns of newspapers, which read along the lines of ‘groom wanted for girl with seven IELTS bands’— a clear indication that the woman is willing to help men who have been unable to clear the mandatory International English Language Testing System ( IELTS ) examination themselves to fulfil their ambition of settling in another country.“There is mutual understanding between both the families that the groom will bear the expense for sending the woman abroad. Later, she will apply for a spouse visa for her husband,” the SSP said. ASI scammed by daughter-in-law It is not just men from rural areas who fall prey to women looking for somebody to sponsor their dream of studying in a foreign country, an assistant sub-inspector was also duped of ₹12 lakh by his daughter-in-law, who cut all contact with her marital family once she reached Australia. In his complaint, the ASI, Roshan Lal, had said, “I had arranged for the accused’s visa, college fee, laptop and air ticket after selling one of my plots and taking a loan from the bank as she had promised to arrange a spouse visa for my son, Rakesh. However, the accused stopped taking our calls after the wedding was solemnised and she returned to Australia in February 2020.” The accused’s father, Pardeep Kumar of Captain Colony, Meharban, was booked on April 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-woman-sent-abroad-for-spouse-visa-disowns-husband-3-booked-101623957020075.html
18-06-2021||Other||Online drive hits IIT-Bombay placements||As the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are busy wrapping up their placement report for the season, an article made public by the students of IIT-Bombay (IIT-B) shows that the season was anything but smooth. From complaints of students cheating on tests to companies going back on their promises, the student-run placement team shared anecdotes of what the 2020 placement season at the prestigious IIT-B looked like this year.For starters, the pandemic forced this annual process to go completely online, eliminating any chance of face-to-face interaction and causing more anxiety among students. “Students were not present on campus, which hampered the usual mode of communication through in person interaction. Team dynamics and transparency were also affected due to the lack of visibility of any and every part of the placement process taking place on campus,” stated an article released late on Wednesday night in the IIT-B in-house student magazine, Insight. Members of Insight refused to comment on the article but said a follow-up analysis on the placement season is in the offing. “We had complaints from multiple recruiters regarding evidence of malpractices in tests from the students’ end which led to serious repercussions, including hampering the relations with the placement cell and affecting the recruitment numbers on campus as well. Some companies had even planned to back out from the process,” highlighted the article that quotes members of the students who were a part of the placement cell.While members of the placement cell refused to comment, an official of the placement office said that the details in Insight were circulated for internal purposes. “As this was our first experience in conducting the entire placement drive online, there were a lot of challenges, from lack of face-to-face interviews to the poor hiring market. Despite these odds, we had a decent placement season, with the number of offers made similar to last year’s,” said the official, Owing to the increasing Covid-19 cases and travel restrictions in place across several states, IITs across the country had decided to conduct their annual placements online in the 2020-21 academic year. Tests, group discussions and personal interviews were conducted virtually with neither the students nor the hiring companies stepping foot on campus at all.Across IITs, the first phase of placements took place in the first two weeks of December, while the second phase started sometime in January this year and went on till the end of the academic year. “We sat through several mock tests that were available online and also attended some mock sessions conducted by our institute. However, the real experience was scary, and I didn’t do well in the first two tests, only to find out later that some of my batch mates cheated in the test and scored well,” said a student from IIT-B, who was recruited in the first phase of placements itself.“Several of us raised this point with the placement team in last December itself, and it looks like some companies found out about it and had similar complaints,” he added. The Insight article also mentioned feedback from recruiters about students not performing at par with other IITs. “We received feedback from multiple companies and alumni in the respective firms citing poor performance of students in tests and interviews by the students as compared to other IITs. This led to a decline in the shortlist size as well as final selections,” said the article.Recruiters, too, posed their own share of problems, which started with offering fewer jobs and smaller pay packages this year due to the pandemic. “Companies were also much less flexible to negotiate things such as increase in salary [due to a cash crunch], eligibility and job openings in additional departments,” the article said and further highlighted that logistical issues due to the virtual setup was also not taken into consideration by several recruiters. “There was little or no scope of a retest in case a student faced internet trouble during the test. Many also took longer periods of time to confirm jobs, adding to the anxiety among the student community,” the article added.Channel OptionsNo Product SelectedHT-WebHT-PrintHT-MobileNo Edition SelectedHT_WEUPHT_EDGEHTN_DELHHTN_MUMBHTN_CHANHT_JALAHT_AMRIHTN_JALAHT_UTTAHT_RAJAHT_HARYHT_ALLAHT_VARNHT_KANPHT_RANCHT_PATNHT_PATMHT_EAUPHT_LUCKHT_LULCHT_KOLKHT_BHOPHT_INDOHT_DELHHT_DELSHT_GURGHT_NOIDHT_MUMBHT_MUMNHT_THANHT_BLRUHT_JAMMHT_HIMLHT_HARLHT_PUNJHT_PATIHT_HARNHT_CHANHT_LUDHHT_CHPUHT_LUPUHT_AMPUHT_PAPUHT_BAPUHT_JAPUHTES_DELHHTES_MUMBHTES_CHANHTSH_DELHHTSH_MUMBHTSH_CHANHTSH_PATNHTSH_LUCKHTED_DELHHTED_MUMBHTED_CHANHTED_PATNHTED_LUCKHTED_RAJAHTED_WEUPHT_PUNEHT_PUNPHTC_DELHHTC_DELNHTC_DELSHTC_DELWHTC_DELEHTC_GURGHTC_RAJAHTC_MUMBHTC_MUMWHTC_MUMSHTC_POWAHTC_BLRUHTC_PUNEHTC_LUDHHTC_AMRIHTC_JALAHTC_BATHHTC_CHANHTC_LUCKHTC_AGRAHTC_DEHRHTC_BAREHTC_PATNHTC_RANCHTB_DELHHTB_MUMBHTB_PUNJHTB_PUNEHTS_DELHHTS_MUMBWK_DELHWK_NOIDWK_GGNWK_MUMBSL_TIMENo Style SelectedShow Channel BarsFilter AlternatesShow Strike OutShow AnnotationsAbout the ObjectCreatordivya.nairWorkflow Status Story/ReleaseLocker Object Not LockedMetadataAuthordivya.nairWeb Main SectionWeb Secondary SectionsWeb AssigmentsWord Count686Char Count4250CountryCityLinked ObjectsMUM_COMM_IIT-B@HT-Print-HT_MUMB.xmlEOM::WorkflowTaskUsage TicketsEOM::StatusUsermanjiri.joshiTimestamp17/06/2021 22:59:00CommentEOM::TaskUsermanjiri.joshiTimestamp17/06/2021 22:59:00CommentPrintOutputUserramchandra.pandagreTimestamp17/06/2021 23:24:00Comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/online-drive-hits-iit-bombay-placements-101623956899642.html

Though the land parcel in question, which comes under a 66-acre plot inside Aarey Colony, is outside the 812 hectares (ha) that have now been declared a reserve forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and handed over to the forest department for safekeeping last week, the SRA project would have been located inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) eco-sensitive zone — that is the buffer area around SGNP where development projects are aimed to be restricted. “Not only that, there are multiple directives from HC going back to 2003, which clearly state that SRA schemes need to be kept out of Aarey. So the very act of notifying or intending to notify this land was in contravention of the HC’s clear directives. The fear was that such a project would be snuck in before the remaining area of Aarey is given forest status, which is still remaining,” said Stalin D, director of NGO (non-governmental organisations) Vanashakti, which filed three petitions relating to the Aarey dispute in the Supreme Court. When asked about the authority’s decision to rescind its notification, Satish Lokhande, CEO (chief executive officer) of SRA, said, “When we issued our intent to go ahead and notify the area in Aarey, we were not aware of HC’s past orders. It was brought to our attention only later, after objections were raised by citizens to our public notice in May. As there is a clear directive from HC, we have decided to de-notify our earlier notice.” In response to a 2003 public interest litigation (PIL) by NGO Citispace, all SRA schemes inside Aarey were disallowed. Subsequently in 2014, as a part of the same petition, HC said that any project proponent seeking to implement an SRA scheme would have to record Citispace’s objections in the matter, and also seek the permission of the court. In an unrelated PIL in 2016, HC had barred SRA schemes in Aarey altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slum-rehabilitation-authority-rolls-back-project-in-mumbai-s-aarey-colony-101623956779489.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Sena-BJP trade charges over Hindutva and Marathi manoos||A day after the Shiv Sena and the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) clashed over Sena’s criticism of the alleged scam in the land deal for Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the issue has now become a Hindutva versus Marathi manoos between the two former allies. Calling its party headquarters Shiv Sena Bhavan a pride of Marathi manoos, Sena leaders said they will not tolerate or allow protest outside the building in central Mumbai. The BJP, on the other hand, questioned the Sena if opposition can hold a protest in matter related to Hindus and Hindutva.With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections seven months away, the two parties could target each other over their pet agendas — Hindutva and Marathi manoos. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said no one should hold protest outside Shiv Sena Bhavan. He added that if the BJP is accusing them of ‘gundagiri’ then they accept the charge, saying the Marathi manoos’s gundagiri helped save Mumbai from the Centre. “If there is an allegation that the Sena indulges in hooliganism then it is correct. If you come onto us or at Shiv Sena Bhavan, which is a matter of pride, then we are gundas. Nobody needs to tell us that, we are certified gundas when it comes to Maharashtra’s pride and Hindutva. Because the Marathi manoos did “gundagiri” against Centre, that Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra today,” Raut said, adding that the incident near Shiv Sena Bhavan was “unfortunate” but there was “no other alternative”.The Sena MP said no one has the courage to attack Shiv Sena Bhavan, and those who attempted it were given “Shiv prasad”. He questioned the BJP on why it was enraged by the Saamana editorial. Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday published an editorial saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must intervene to ensure there is no “blot of scam” on the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Following this, high-voltage drama was witnessed near Sena headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, as workers of Sena and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) clashed after the latter held a protest against the editorial.“You (BJP) say allegations were made about Ram Temple [in the editorial]. First, read what is written in Saamana. It is written in Saamana that the allegation should be probed and if they are done with wrong intentions, action should be taken on those who levelled them. Why should it anger anyone? Nowhere have we made allegations against the BJP. Have we said that the scam (ghotala) has been done by the BJP? Ram Mandir Teerth Kshetra Nyas is an autonomous body. The people appointed there are independent. Are there any BJP workers in it? Allegations are levelled in connection with the place of faith. Is it a crime to ask for clarification,” he asked.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil slammed the Sena. “You will go on writing editorials in Saamana but we cannot protest in a democracy? All required permission were taken for the protest. They claim that the [BJP] workers had stones and sticks in their hands; check CCTV footage from the area and take action as per the law if anyone was carrying them... The matter is not about BJP, VHP, or the Ram Mandir Trust. We feel we should react to matter related to Hindus. They have abandoned Hindutva. This issue [of the alleged scam] was raked up by the Congress and anti-national forces, but if you call yourselves nationalist, how can you support it,” Patil questioned.Responding to Patil, Raut said they stand by the opposition party’s right to protest and believe that opposition must protest against things they do not feel are correct. “We stand by the opposition’s right to hold protests. But while doing so they must consider things that concern our faith, such a Shiv Sena Bhavan. What happened yesterday was unfortunate but there was no other alternative... Shiv Sena Bhavan is an exception in Maharashtra and this country; no protest must be held outside it,” Raut said.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the clash between the two parties is expected as their ideologies remain similar. He said it was a “miscalculated step” by the BJP to hold protest outside Shiv Sena Bhavan, as Sena’s credential on Ram temple is clear since the demolition of Babri mosque. “When BJP or no other Hindu outfit took the ownership of the mosque demolition, Balasaheb Thackeray took the moral responsibility saying if it is done by Sainiks he is proud. Sena’s credentials on Ram temple cannot be questioned. Besides that, the BJP seems to be afraid of the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal. They shouldn’t be afraid if questions are raised. The Sena still claims it believes in Hindutva; while their concept of Hindtuva is cultural, BJP’s remains political, so these ideological clashes could continue,” said Jondhale, former professor of political science at University of Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senabjp-trade-charges-over-hindutva-and-marathi-manoos-101623956659485.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||After Congress talks of going solo, Sena-NCP say they may contest Assembly polls as allies||Days after Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said the party will go solo in the next Assembly polls, the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said they may forge an alliance for the next Assembly elections. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said if the NCP and Sena come together to contest polls then there would be miracles in the state. State NCP chief Jayant Patil responded saying his party wants to continue the alliance with the Sena in future. He, however, said he was hopeful that the Congress will reconsider its stand ahead of the polls, even if it is talking about going solo in the polls at present.The three parties formed a coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), that runs the government in Maharashtra. However, so far there is no clear announcement on their future plans — whether they will contest coming municipal and district council elections as a coalition and whether they would be allies in next Assembly elections scheduled in 2024. Earlier this week, Patole said his party would fight all the forthcoming elections alone. The Congress will be the single-largest party in 2024 Assembly polls, he had said. Later, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve made a statement that his party would also contest the next polls on its own.“It is good that the BJP and Congress are preparing towards that [going solo]. That leaves two parties, the Sena and NCP, in the state. If everybody else is going solo then these two prominent parties will have to come together in the interest of the state. Statements to this effect have been made by Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana stated on Thursday.Raut later said that in light of the Congress going solo, the two other parties in the MVA will think about their poll strategy. “In the future, if the two leading parties of Maharashtra, NCP and Sena, come together to contest elections then it can lead to miracles in the state… Both the parties will think about it (pre-poll alliance) in future,” he said.Patil on Thursday said that even if the Congress chose to take a different path, their alliance with Sena will continue. “MVA comprises three parties and all of them should give priority to remain united. In case one of the parties (Congress) decides to contest the elections on its own, the alliance between the other two will remain intact,” Patil said in response to statements made by the Congress.He also said the Congress may reconsider its stand ahead of the polls. “May be the state Congress chief is talking like this with an intention to strengthen the party. After all, everyone knows the strength of all the parties; hence the three parties are expected to work with more unity. It is likely that they (Congress) will reconsider its stand ahead of the polls,” the water resources minister said.In an apparent jibe at Patole, an editorial in Saamana on Thursday said that a party needs to reach the majority mark of 145 to form a government and get the throne. “Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole is a warrior leader. He has announced that his party would fight the next Assembly elections on its own and install a chief minister of the Congress. He has also said that if the party allows, he himself would be the next chief ministerial face. Hence, it is clear that until Patole installs a Congress chief minister in Maharashtra in 2024, he won’t sit quiet,” the editorial said.It further said Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar stated that the one who gets the support of 145 MLAs will form the government. “Parliamentary democracy is all about majority figures. Those who succeed will be able to occupy the throne,” it added.The Sena mouthpiece said that the 2024 polls are still far away and asked if there was any plan to hold mid-term polls in the state. “The 2024 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls are still far away, but the major political parties (BJP and Congress) are suddenly talking of contesting the elections independently. Are there any plans to have mid-term polls?” it asked.Meanwhile, Patole’s predecessor and Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat said the aim of MVA is to keep the BJP away from power and a decision on going solo or an alliance will be taken at an appropriate time. “Every party has the right to expand their party’s base and every party intends to come to power on their strength. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with it. Our stand is that keeping the BJP away from power is in the national interest. Therefore, we will take appropriate decisions at the right time,” Thorat said.Senior NCP leader and state minister Chhagan Bhujbal said there is still more than three years for the next polls and expressed confidence that all three parties within MVA will contest together. “What Raut has said is that if the Congress goes alone then Sena-NCP can come together. But there is still over three years for the next Assembly polls; by then all the parties in MVA will come together, and like Pawar saheb has said, all will contest together,” said Bhujbal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-congress-talks-of-going-solo-sena-ncp-say-they-may-contest-assembly-polls-as-allies-101623956599432.html
18-06-2021||Other||Heavy rain in Mumbai to stay for two more days, says IMD||The suburbs received heavier showers on Thursday than it did the rest of the week. Mumbai’s suburbs recorded 58.2mm of rain in nine hours against 23.8mm of rainfall received the previous day, as per data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD’s) automatic weather station (AWS) in Santacruz, which is representative of the city and suburbs. The AWS in Colaba, however, recorded lighter showers of 15.8mm of rain against Wednesday’s 98.6mm. IMD has reiterated the yellow category weather alert for the city on Friday and Saturday, indicating the possibility of ‘heavy rain at isolated places’, after which lighter showers are expected to prevail on June 20 and 21. As of 8.30am on Thursday, the city had received a total of 757.7mm of rain this month. This is a 249% departure from the normal rainfall up to June 17, which is 217.7mm. The average rainfall for the entire month of June is 505mm. The city recorded a maximum daytime temperature of 29.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday (two degrees below normal), while the minimum nighttime temperature stood at 26 degrees Celsius, which is at normal temperature. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, the mercury may rise slightly and settle at a maximum of 32 degrees Celsius by next week, while the minimum is expected to hover at 26 degrees Celsius. At present, there is no monsoon trough persisting in close proximity to the city, though there is an offshore trough hovering at sea level off the coasts of Karnataka and Kerala, while another stretches from the south Arabian Sea to south Konkan districts.

The leaders discussed various issues such as Maratha and Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation, election to the post of Assembly speaker, forthcoming local body elections among others.Patil is holding meetings with the party’s Mumbai unit on Friday to discuss upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections and the infighting within the unit. He met state unit chief Nana Patole, party’s legislative party chief Balasaheb Thorat and all ministers from the state cabinet at Sahyadri guest house on Thursday.According to Congress leaders, Patil took stock of the political situation and discussed the party’s stand on various issues. “He met all Congress ministers in Maharashtra under the leadership of Thorat and Patole. Right from Maratha and OBC reservation, the leaders discussed election of the speaker of the state Assembly, forthcoming local body elections among others. Patil insisted that party ministers press for the implementation of the common minimum programme which is the base of the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi,” a Congress minister said.Patil also reiterated that the Maharashtra unit should press for separate farm laws in Maharashtra to negate the farm laws passed by the Central government, said another leader. The party leadership has also told the state unit and the minister to push for development schemes meant for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. Party chief Sonia Gandhi had written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray a few months ago, asking him to give priority to the welfare of tribal communities. The party in-charge for the state also took review of the compliance of the tasks set before party and its frontal organisations.In his meeting with party’s Mumbai unit leaders on Friday, besides discussion on preparations for the ensuing BMC elections, the infighting within the unit is also expected to surface. “AICC had set tasks before Mumbai unit soon after Ashok Jagtap was appointed as its president in December. He will take review of their compliance and the discuss issues and appointments in frontal organisations. The issue of MLA Zeeshan Siddique’s complaint against Jagtap is also expected to be discussed,” said a Mumbai unit leader.Meanwhile, former minister of state and a key Vidarbha leader Sunil Deshmukh will re-join the Congress on Saturday. Deshmukh had quit the Congress in 2014 after he was denied ticket to choose former president Pratibha Patil’s son Raosaheb Shekhawat from Amaravati. Deshmukh lost 2019 election to Congress’s Sulabha Khodke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hk-patil-holds-meeting-with-maharashtra-congress-leaders-101623956422169.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||The Maharashtra vaccination gender divide||Nirmala Vishwakarma, a domestic help in Andheri, cannot afford to take time off work and even unsubstantiated rumours about the vaccine are enough to keep her away from getting an anti-Covid jab.“I’ve heard that after the first shot, I may fall sick. I’ve just resumed my work after almost a year of unemployment,” said 40-year-old Vishwakarma, who is yet to register on either the CoWin platform or the Arogya Setu app.After eight months of unemployment, Vishwakarma resumed working in January. A month later, as the second wave of Covid-19 hit the city, she found herself out of work yet again. Since May, she resumed work in few houses. A day off is a luxury, she said. Her husband Vijay (56), who lost his jobs as a driver in Covid-19, got his first shot in April. Since then, he has lost his job which makes Vishwakarma the sole earning member of the family.“If I fall sick, the building societies I work in will ask me to take an RT-PCR test at my own expense. I can’t bear that expense either,” said Vishwakarma.Forty-five-year-old in Ghatkopar homemaker Tilottama (who goes by her first name) is the only one in her family of four who hasn’t been vaccinated. While her 55-year-old husband has received both his shots, her two sons, aged 20 and 22, took their first shots in May. “First we (the family) thought that I should get the vaccine last because someone in the house has to be healthy to take care of the others. Now it’s just pending,” she said.In Maharashtra, more than 1.6 million fewer women have been vaccinated when compared to men, across all age groups eligible for vaccination (18 and above). Of the total vaccinated population in the state, 46.1 % are women and 53.8% are men, as on June 13. In Mumbai, the gender divide is even more prominent as over 350,000 fewer women were vaccinated. The gender divide is most prominent in the neighbouring Raigad district, which includes Alibag, parts of Navi Mumbai, Uran and Pen, where 57.8% men have been vaccinated against 42.2% women. Indeed, even accounting for the skewed sex ratio in India, the gender gap in vaccination is being seen across the country: As of May 28, 161.3 million people have been given at least one dose of vaccines and men comprised 53% of this number.As it turns out, the gender gap has been seen in other immunization drives, and even in accessing healthcare facilities.In 2013, the department of Community Medicine, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Medical College in Pune surveyed 210 children aged 12-23 months in 1,913 houses in the district. The survey found boys (87.61%) outnumbered girls (85.57%) when it came to full immunisation. World Health Organisation defines full immunisation as a percentage of one-year-olds who have received one dose of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine. Experts said that historically women have lagged behind in immunisation drives in the country including that for polio and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine against tuberculosis.“The gender gap in Covid-19 vaccination is not surprising, especially because the number of women testing for the virus and seeking hospital treatment is also low. This has to do with lack of mobility and decision-making powers in the family,” said Shalini Bharat, professor at the Centre for Health and Social Sciences, School of Health Systems Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai.Bharat, who is also the director of TISS, said that lack of digital familiarity and anxieties over the impact of vaccines on their reproductive health.“What we have observed with other vaccines is that traditionally there is greater hesitancy, not just among women but among their family members. Worries about effect of vaccine on their fertility, impact on menstruation, pregnancy and lactation can lead to family members discouraging women to seek vaccination. These worries do not apply to men,” said Bharat, whose research areas include social aspects of HIV and TB including stigma and discrimination.Suvarna Kamble, an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) at the Satpala subcentre in Virar, agreed that women had worries regarding the vaccination. “Once you explain how the vaccine works and that any side effects are temporary, the women understand and then come for the vaccine.”Gender divide in digital literacyThe registration process for vaccination requires digital familiarity. While Vishwakarma doesn’t even possess a smartphone (husband Vijay, however, does), Tilottama said she didn’t understand the process for vaccine registration. “My husband got me registered but we have been struggling to get a slot,” said Tilottama.In Maharashtra, 68.2% of women in urban areas and 43.1% in rural areas have a mobile phone that they themselves use, according to the fifth National Family Health Survey. Only 54.3% of women in urban areas have ever used the internet, compared to 76.8% urban men. In the rural set up, only 23.7% women have ever used the internet, as opposed to 47.2% men.Apart from generating awareness about the vaccine and ensuring that more women are registered on the platform, policy makers can make vaccines available to women closer to their homes.“While women have lagged in the immunisation drives in the country, the gender gap reduces for polio after the door-to-door immunisation programme started,” said Bharat.“The pandemic has affected women worse than it has affected men. Being at home, women have been forced to become the primary caretaker of the house and the family. Not just women but men, too, are worried that if the woman falls sick after taking the shot, who will then take care of the house? I know of many men delaying the shots for vaccines for the women in the house for this reason,” said Neelam Gorhe, member of legislative council and a women’s health rights crusader. “Access to vaccination is a major concern, said experts. “Mobility of women is either restricted or dependent on men. With public transports not available during a lockdown, women find it difficult to reach the vaccination centres,” said Gorhe.Vulnerable identitiesAt least 0.01% of vaccinated population comes from other gender communities.So far Maharashtra has inoculated 2,984 persons who identify as other genders. They include transgender persons and gender non-binary persons, and 61% come from six out of the 35 districts in Maharashtra—Mumbai accounts for 587 (20%) alone; 363 in Pune, 233 in Thane, 176 in Nagpur, 173 in Aurangabad, 159 in Kolhapur and 119 in Nashik.“The root cause of the problem is that there is no official data for the population of transgender persons in India. So, it’s difficult to bring invisible people in the vaccination drive,” said Amrita Sarkar, advisor, Transgender Wellbeing and Advocacy, India HIV/AIDS Alliance.Yet another problem is that of identification, Sarkar added. “Most trans persons have identifications that identify them as cis-gendered persons. So, they may be getting vaccinated but must be recorded incorrectly,” she said.Sarkar has been demanding special vaccination drives for the transgender community. “We need the government’s support. As organisations and community centres, we can arrange for a vaccination drive but we can’t source vaccine shots. The government must help us with vaccine doses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/the-maharashtra-vaccination-gender-divide-101623956421399.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Maratha outfits put forth six demands; govt urges them to call off agitation||A day after Maratha community outfits launched silent marches to push for reservation for the community, Maharashtra government held a marathon meeting with their leaders on Thursday and requested them to call off the agitation. The state assured that a review petition will be filed in the Supreme Court within a week to challenge the Apex court’s May 5 verdict scrapping the Maratha quota in government jobs and education. The outfits have decided to take a call on the government appeal on Monday at Nashik, and insisted that the agitation has not yet been called off.The delegation representing Maratha outfits led by Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati held the meeting with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, public works minister and cabinet sub-committee head Ashok Chavan, at Sahyadri guest house on Thursday evening. The delegation put forth six demands for immediate compliance to give respite to the community on legal and administrative grounds. Sambhajiraje said that the state has positively admitted to comply with all the demands and has also appointed a committee for their compliance on war footing.The outfits have demanded review petition in the Supreme Court against its verdict quashing quota to Marathas in jobs and education. They have also demanded to simultaneously approach the Central government to accord reservation to Marathas through the central list of backward classes under article 338(B) and 342 (A). They also demanded for strengthening of SARTHI, an institute formed to ensure educational and social well-being of the Maratha youth and hostel for the community youth in every district. The leaders also demanded financial allotment of ₹1,000 crore for Annasaheb Patil Backward Financial Development Corporation which finances Maratha youth for entrepreneurial ventures. The community has also sought immediate appointment of the community candidates who have been selected for the jobs but weren’t given letters before the quota was quashed. The delegation also pushed to expedite the Kopardi rape case proceedings to ensure conviction of the accused. They have also sought withdrawal of cases against community members during protest march in 2017-18.Sambhajiraje said the government reacted positively to their demands. “Though we have about 18 demands, we have prioritised six of them. We have been told by the government that the review petition will be filed by next Thursday while the Central government has already been requested for the steps for reservation using its powers. Barring one, 149 cases against our protesters will be withdrawn in the next few days by complying with the legal procedure. We have also been assured appointments to our youth at the earliest. The deputy CM is holding a meeting in Pune on Saturday to take required decisions related to SARTHI,” he said.The MP also said that despite the positive response from the government, they were not calling off their agitation. “We have resolved to hold silent marches in all 36 districts and the second one of them is in Nashik on June 21 after launching it in Kolhapur on Wednesday. The state government has requested us to call off the agitation. The call on their request would be taken in a meeting with all organisers representing all outfits on June 21 in Nashik,” he said.He also said that the government has appointed a coordination committee under principal secretary Vikas Kharge to look into the compliance of the assurances on daily basis.Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said the government has already started taking steps on some of the demands put up by the outfits. “The CM has also constituted a special committee to ensure speedy compliance of the demands. We have already met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the Centre to initiate the process of giving quota to Marathas using their constitutional powers. CM Thackeray has requested the outfits to withdraw their ongoing agitation and we expect their positive response,” he said.The Supreme Court on May 5 quashed 12% and 13% quota given to Marathas in education and jobs under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The court had said that the quota breached the 50% cap of reservation laid down in Indra Sawhney case in 1992 and also stated that the community does not comply with the conditions of backwardness. The five-judge bench had also stated that the states do not have right to decide quota after the 102nd constitutional amendment in August 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-outfits-put-forth-six-demands-govt-urges-them-to-call-off-agitation-101623956419499.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Congress refutes RSS’s claims about RSS veteran worker vacating bed for youth in Nagpur||The Congress has hit out at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that the organisations used the death of a veteran worker for image building. Referring to the information related to the death of octogenarian Narayan Dabhadkar revealed under the Right To Information (RTI) Act, Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said BJP-RSS spread wrong information.As per reports, Dabhadkar, who died of Covid-19 at the age of 85 years in Nagpur in April this year, had offered his hospital bed to a younger patient who was struggling to get admitted for the want of vacant bed. A post stating that Dabhakar, an RSS worker, sacrificed his life to save a youngster by offering his bed to him made rounds on social media platforms.Bed scarcity was at its peak in Nagpur as well as other parts of the state during the second wave of Covid-19 in April and May.Indira Gandhi Hospital, where Dabhadkar was admitted, clarified that he was discharged from the hospital when his relatives insisted on taking him to another hospital since they did not have ventilator at the hospital, said Sawant. The information provided by the hospital stated that the patient and his relatives insisted on discharge against medical advice (DAMA) and took him home. Dabhadkar and his son-in-law Amol Pachpor had given an undertaking to the hospital management, the information has revealed. Sawant tweeted the information while attacking the RSS and said that many BJP leaders including Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promoted the story on social media.“The information and hospital documents including letters given by the patient and his relatives have come to fore under RTI. It proves that RSS’s claim of sacrifice was wrong. Our full sympathy and respect is with the departed, but dragging the deceased worker in politics is unfortunate,” Sawant said.BJP’s media cell chief Vishwas Pathak said, “What is the Congress trying to prove by raising questions on the act of an octogenarian RSS worker? The whole world knows about the training imparted in shakhas (run by the RSS), towards selflessness and sacrifice. Documents (revealed under RTI) speak of the legal and administrative procedure needs to be followed while taking discharge. It is possible that Dabhadkar completed the formalities to achieve what he intended to do. How can one expect his intention behind the act to come there on the records? His discussion with his son-in-law and other family members cannot be part of the hospital records, but it is important to bring the truth behind the story forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-refutes-rss-s-claims-about-rss-veteran-worker-vacating-bed-for-youth-in-nagpur-101623956360663.html

The injections are administered to critical Covid patients, mainly on ventilator support.  A single vial of the medicine costs around ₹34,000 and is provided to hospitals at government price; in the black market, however, the injection is sold at between ₹80,000 and ₹1 lakh. On May 14, an First-Information Report (FIR) was registered under Section 380 (theft) of the IPC against unidentified persons, after the hospital filed a complaint with the SSP. The hospital had formed an internal committee to investigate the matter, but the panel recommended that the police needed to be involved. A doctor with the hospital claimed that the role of staffers could not be ruled out, as isolation wards were under CCTV surveillance. “Policemen had been deployed outside wards to restrict entry of outsiders. The injection were stolen at the time when there was shortage of injections in the open market, and were provided to hospitals in limited stock,” a doctor added.Rajindra Hospital medical superintendent Dr HS Rekhi said the internal committee did not find any concrete evidence. “The committee’s report said the investigation should be shifted to the district police, so that a thorough inquiry can be carried out,” he added. Civil Lines SHO Gurpreet Singh said they have scanned footage from CCTV cameras at the hospital. “The investigation slowed due to a spurt in covid cases. The inquiry process will be streamlined now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-headway-in-probe-into-covid-medicine-theft-from-patiala-hospital-101623956360203.html

To make their point, the opposition made sure it protested in the MP’s constituency. The protesters, however, violated all covid norms with most of them without masks and no social distance maintained at all.  Senior leadership of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) that former cabinet ministers Daljit Singh Cheema and Gulzar Singh Ranike led, submitted a complaint to Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal on Thursday, seeking an FIR against Bittu. They also sought immediate arrest of Bittu. The alliance wants Bittu booked under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Sections 295A (outraging religious feelings), 500 (defamation), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of the peace).The AAP, led by leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, burnt the effigy of Bittu and CM Captain Amarinder Singh at the Jalandhar Bypass Chowk for allegedly inciting hatred towards the dalit community. Cheema (of SAD) claimed that conclusive evidence was available against Bittu in public realm (via the video) and police should not try to save him, just because he was from the ruling Congress. “Bittu has effectively stated that holy seats have been given to unholy persons. This is intolerable as it goes against the Constitution which guarantees equality to all and is also against Sikh ethos and culture,” AAP leaders said the ‘Gurus’ had risen above castes and religions. “The opinion and views of Congress leaders is completely contrary to the message given by the ‘Gurus’,” they claimed.“If the CM had been serious in the matter, he would have condemned Bittu’s statement and acted against him,” said Harpal Cheema, accusing the Congress of dividing society for political interests. Bittu was not available for comments despite repeated calls on his phone. Previously, he has said that his statement had been misinterpreted, and he meant to say that the Akali Dal had deserted ‘Panthic’ seats. In the video, Bittu had flayed SAD for giving away the pious seats of Anandpur Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib to the BSP, as part of their poll alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-remarks-sad-bsp-aap-up-ante-against-ludhiana-mp-bittus-eek-his-arrest-101623955880064.html

The two-time legislator from Hubli-Dharwad west went on to say that he was being monitored and being set up by unknown persons. “My phone is tapped and they are monitoring me wherever I go,” Bellad told reporters in Bengaluru on Thursday. The statement comes days after TV news channels played on loop a few seconds footage of Bellad leaving BJP national general secretary’s (Arun Singh) house in Delhi .Singh is currently in Bengaluru holding meetings with state ministers and legislators to gather information on the current rumblings in the party and communicate the same to the central leadership. Bellad said that he was receiving calls from an accused in jail enquiring about the political developments, which he said was a “move to trap” him. Though Bellad did not name anyone, his allegations purportedly point towards the ruling dispensation headed by Yediyurappa. “I think there is a huge conspiracy behind this call. My father, Chandrakant Bellad, was five-time MLA and led a political life without a black spot. I have practiced smart honest politics,” Bellad said. “Since they could not find any black spot in my career, they are trying to fix me. A few people are made to call and trying to trap me in such issues. Such an effort is happening with the effort of some big hands,” he said. Bellad said that he has formally written a complaint and handed it over to the Karnataka assembly speaker and home minister Basavaraj Bommai on June 14 and asked them to conduct an investigation into this allegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yediyurappas-critic-alleges-phone-tapping-101623955820569.html
18-06-2021||Bangalore||HC pulls up govt over ₹2,000 relief for unorganised sector workers||Bengaluru: Karnataka high court on Thursday pulled up the state government over the practicality of the direction asking unorganised domestic workers to register themselves online for availing the ₹2000 compensation announced in view of the pandemic. The state government had issued an order on May 20 to announce a compensation of ₹2,000 to all unorganized workers in view of financial difficulties faced due to the lockdown imposed across the state. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj asked: “How will persons know that they have to go to this common service centre and other places to get registered on the portal. Perhaps the state government is proceeding on the assumption that all workers can use the internet and upload photo and employment certificate on the portal.” The court made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking registration of domestic workers under the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, (Act) and related Rules, 2009. During the hearing, the government informed the HC that a procedure has been laid out where domestic workers will require a photo and Aadhaar card to register themselves in the Seva Sindhu Portal to get the compensation. It further added that if it is not possible, they may go to gram panchayats or common service centres among others to get themselves registered, the court was told. Responding to this, the bench said: “Suppose he does not have an Aadhaar card, you will not give the amount? Then what is the point of the scheme?” The state’s counsel responded saying very few don’t have Aadhaar cards. The bench then added that the state must correct this procedure and said that the state has not mentioned that beneficiaries can approach offices of gram panchayats, common service centres etc, and get online registration done. “The more we hear, we are convinced that you only want this scheme to remain on paper. This is only a small amount. So many adjournments. The government is giving so many excuses. All this will remain on paper as there is no publicity provided by the state informing the availability of these modes of getting registered on the Seva Sindhu Portal,” the order said. Therefore, it directed the state government to ensure that wide publicity is given informing that those domestic workers who are unable to register themselves may go to such other places as notified by the government. The matter will be next heard on June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/hc-pulls-up-govt-over-2-000-relief-for-unorganised-sector-workers-101623955819994.html

18-06-2021||Mumbai||Bulk drug park project at Raigad: Maharashtra decides to take locals into confidence||The Maharashtra government is making all the efforts to get the ₹30,000 crore bulk drug park (BDP) project at Raigad approved by the Centre. It has decided to take all the locals and farmers in confidence to make setting up of the project a smooth process. It has also decided to give competitive rates against land to be used for the project and also decided to give back 10% of developed land to the affected people. The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday.The decision assumes significance considering strong opposition to the proposed Nanar oil refinery project at Ratnagiri, which would have brought an investment of ₹100,000 crore in the state.The state government is hoping to get approval from the Centre and is also ready to go ahead with the project even if the Centre’s decision goes otherwise, the officials said.The Centre has proposed three bulk drug parks to be set up in the country to reduce the dependence of the Indian drug manufacturing companies, especially from China. It has asked the states to send their proposal for incentive schemes and the top three attractive schemes will be selected by the Centre for setting up the bulk drug park. If approved it will get a grant of ₹1,000 crore for the project.The state government has earmarked 5,000 acres of land covering 17 villages in Roha and Murud tehsils of the Raigad district for the project.In a review meeting held on Thursday, the chief minister asked the officials to ensure locals will not be migrated because of the project. He also directed to take locals in confidence before going ahead with the project.“The project involves no rehabilitation at all as we are not using a single piece of residential plot for the project. Moreover, over 80% land is non-cultivable and around 20% cultivable land for which competitive rates will be offered to the affected people,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.“In addition to the compensation against the land, they will also get 10% developed land which will be allowed to be used for commercial, residential and industrial purposes. The villagers can also give them on lease and create a permanent source of income for them. The affected families will be given jobs in the project and the state government will also develop skill development centres to create skilled labours for the project.,” said state industries minister Subhash Desai.“Fishing is a major source of income for the locals in the district considering that the state government has decided to release sewage water 10-km deep sea. Consequently, local fishermen will not be affected by the project,” said Aditi Tatkare, minister of state for industries. “Besides, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds of the pharmaceutical firms will be used for developing strengthening of civil amenities and welfare schemes for the locals,” she added.On October 29, 2020, the state cabinet has decided to waive 100% goods and services tax (GST) on the first sale of the product from the drug bulk park. It has waived electricity fees against power consumption for the next ten years, a waiver in stamp duty for buying a plot, taking a plot on a lease, bank loan and other related activities. The state has also decided to give a concession of ₹1.5 per unit in power tariff for a period of ten years against power consumption for the project.Besides, the firms will also get a concession of ₹2 per unit against power consumption for sewage management, water supply, solid waste management and other related activities for ten years.

18-06-2021||Bangalore||As B’luru unlocks, authorities wary of Covid case spike||Bengaluru: Even though the government’s new guidelines allows only essential services to remain open from 6am till 2pm in Bengaluru, several ‘non-essential’ shops across the city have started operations after the government relaxed the lockdown rules from June 14. While nod had been given to only those establishments providing material to construction and other related industries, the city saw hardware and garments store reopen since Monday. “We run an engine oil shop. The guidelines are not clear whether we belong to establishments allowed to remain open. There was no one to ask either. So, we opened our shop on Monday. A garment shop next to us and the automobile store few streets away are opened as well. That evening, officials fined the garment store but didn’t say anything to us. So, we now assume that we are allowed to be open,” said a shopkeeper who didn’t want to disclose his name and location. Several shops opening on Monday and the lack of clarity on the guidelines has kicked off a chain reaction, where more shops are opening across the city. This has also resulted in several people returning to the city to re-join work. City authorities expressed concerns over the surge in people returning to Bengaluru from various parts of the state since the lockdown restrictions were removed. “While the number of cases in Bengaluru has come down, the influx to the city could result in another spike in Covid-19 cases,” said a Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official on Thursday Pointing out that one of the reasons why the lockdown restrictions have not been lifted in some districts is because the positivity rate there is high, and the free movement of people could affect the city’s current status on Covid-19, the senior BBMP official said, “Even though the regulations allow only emergency travel, there is hardly any checking. Police are allowing people to come through without any checks at the city borders.” For the first time in over two months, on Tuesday, Bengaluru’s daily infection count dropped below 1,000 as it recorded 985 new Covid-19 cases. Bengaluru recorded 1,209 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, according to the state health department. The city also witnessed 1,510 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 78,943. According to officials in the know of the developments, BBMP has asked the government to continue with the restrictions on intra-city travel till the positivity rate across the state comes down. Bengaluru city police commissioner Kamal Pant, who had issued prohibitory orders across the city on Monday, however, on Thursday said there were some practical difficulties in the implementation. “The government has allowed garment factories, construction activities, private companies and others to operate. This means there is a large number of people on the road. The garment factories account for around one million workers. It is not possible to check every vehicle on the road when the volume is high and these industries need to restart work,” Pant said. He added that even on the main highways leading to the city, there was a large movement of people from different districts. “Once again, the numbers are high here. We are conducting as many checks as possible but in some cases, where there is a pile-up, we have to allow traffic. It is the government’s decision to open these industries and these workers are critical for it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/as-b-luru-unlocks-authorities-wary-of-covid-case-spike-101623955759376.html

We are waiting for reopening for libraries and coaching centres so that we can excel in our studies,” he added.Jyoti Rathee, a resident of Jhajjar who is preparing for UGC-NET exam, said the Covid curve is declining. “We hope that the government will reopen educational institutes especially for postgraduate students,” Rathee said.“Almost two years of our studies have been spoiled due to Covid and the government is yet to reopen educational institutes and conduct new recruitments. We are capable of taking all precautions. We are expecting that the National Testing Agency will conduct the UGC-NET exam in July. For its preparation, we urge the government to reopen libraries,” she added.Sandeep Kumar, who runs a library in Rohtak, said that the government has reopened malls but is still not allowing opening of libraries.“Last year, we suffered a loss of ₹3 lakh. And in the last two months, I had to bear a loss of ₹1 lakh as libraries were shut down due to the pandemic. If the government will not open libraries and coaching centres, we won’t be able to survive,” he added.Arvind Sihag, a private library owner in Hisar, said they suffered huge losses due to both waves of the pandemic.“We had a sitting capacity of 80 students before restrictions were imposed by the state government. Our business has taken a hit. We urge the government to reopen libraries with 50% capacity,” he said.“Most students coming here are from rural areas and are unable to make arrangements of WiFi, newspapers, magazines, books and other facilities due to financial issues,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-urge-haryana-govt-to-reopen-libraries-coaching-centres-101623955583756.html
18-06-2021||Bangalore||BS Yediyurappa can’t function with same spirit: BJP MLC||Fissures within the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Karnataka unit appeared to have widened on Thursday with party MLC AH Vishwanath saying chief minister BS Yediyurappa is too old and “cannot function with the same spirit as before”.“Today it’s not the question on Yediyurappa. It is about how the government is functioning. What people are talking about and what action the high command should take. It’s not grumbling against anybody but it’s the actual and factual of Karnataka’s political situation. I have explained in depth to the general secretary,” said Vishwanath after meeting BJP national general secretary and state in-charge, Arun Singh, who is in Bengaluru to gauge the extent of the unrest within state unit.Vishwanath was among the 18 legislators who switched allegiance from the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance to the BJP in 2019, causing the downfall of the HD Kumaraswamy government.He has proposed the names of Murugesh Nirani, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Arvind Bellad as chief minister.Vishwanath’s statement came a day after Singh and BJP’s state leadership had said that nobody in the party should air grievances against the CM or the government.“I was told about Vishwanath’s statement, but he is someone who is new in the party and is not aware of its ideology or functioning,” said BJP national general secretary and state in-charge, Arun Singh.MP Renukacharya, MLA from Honalli and Yediyurappa’s political secretary and staunch loyalist, countered Vishwanath, saying his words have “no worth” and that he had “cheated” the JD(S) and the Congress before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bs-yediyurappa-can-t-function-with-same-spirit-bjp-mlc-101623955584244.html

18-06-2021||Mumbai||Antilia and Hiran case: Pradeep Sharma, an encounter specialist to arrested accused||Pradeep Sharma, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday in connection with the murder of Thane industrialist Mansukh Hiran, and the Antilia explosives scare case, was well known as an “encounter specialist” and is believed to have to gunned down several members of the Chhota Rajan gang. The 59-year-old was reportedly involved in the killing of more than 100 criminals during his years of service.A 1983 batch police officer, he was dismissed in August 2008 for alleged underworld links, but was reinstated in May 2009 following the orders of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal.Sharma is believed to have been involved in the “encounter killings” of several noted criminals between 1995 and 2004 – a period when Mumbai police officials were a given free hand purportedly to maintain law and order. Other “encounter specialists” of the time included Daya Nayak, Ravindra Angre, Prafulla Bhosale, Vijay Salaskar and Sachin Vaze.In 1999, Sharma and his team reportedly killed gangster Vinod Matkar, a henchman of Chhota Rajan. When Rajan had planned to kill Dawood Ibrahim in Pakistan, Matkar was part of a team that also comprised Ejaz Lakdawala, Vicky Malhotra, Balu Dokre and Farid Tanasha. The same year, Sharma is said to have also killed Dawood Ibrahim’s close aide and sharp shooter Sadiq Kalya in Dadar.In 2001, Sharma is believed to have killed gangster Ashwin Naik’s aide Ganesh Devadiga in Versova. Devadiga had 26 serious offences registered against him.Sharma, however, became famous after his team killed three Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in 2003 in Goregaon, while he was incharge of the Andheri Crime intelligence unit (CIU). Of the three, two -- Abu Sultan, who was LeT’s southern India commander, and Abu Anwar Ali -- were Pakistani nationals.During the gun fight between the three LeT terrorists were armed AK-56 rifles and inspector Daya Nayak was also hit. Several arms and ammunition were recovered from the terrorists.In 2010, Sharma was arrested in connection with the extra judicial killing of Chhota Rajan gang member Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya which had taken place in November 2006. Gupta was picked up from Navi Mumbai and killed in Andheri by Sharma and his team, which also included police constable Vinayak Shinde.Shinde was convicted of Gupta’s murder and was released on parole last year during the drive to decongest the city’s prisons during the ongoing pandemic. Shinde has also been arrested by the NIA in connection with industrialist Mansukh Hiran’s murder. Vaze masterminded the murder and the planting of explosives outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house, the NIA contends.Sharma spent about four years in jail for his alleged role in Gupta’s death, but was acquitted in July 2013 for the lack of evidence. All the other 21 accused in the case were convicted in the case. Sharma’s acquittal is under challenge before the Bombay High Court.In 2017 Sharma was reinstated and became head of the Anti Extortion Cell of the Thane police. Within a month of taking charge, Sharma arrested Iqbal Kaskar, brother of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar. He continued to head the anti-extortion cell at Thane till he resigned in July 2019.He then joined Shiv Sena and contested and lost 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections from Nallasopara constituency against Hitendra Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-and-hiran-case-pradeep-sharma-an-encounter-specialist-to-arrested-accused-101623955099297.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai may see Covid third wave in September; BMC in prep mode||The third wave is likely to hit the city as late as in September, according to the projections of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). While preparing for a larger number of Covid-19 cases in the city during the anticipated third wave, in comparison to the second wave, the BMC said it will scale Covid beds by over 10,000, and is in the process of setting up 16 oxygen plants across the city. Additional jumbo facilities are being set up at Malad, Kanjurmarg, Sion, and Mahalaxmi. While mathematical projects have not been made for cases in the third wave, the civic administration said it is prepared to handle double the number of cases in comparison to the numbers seen in March, April, and May 2021 (second wave). Currently, the bed occupancy is as low as 10% to 20% on some days. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “The number of Covid cases during the second wave were almost twice more than those during the first wave. However, these are mathematical projections, if we are to assume the same in case of the third wave. BMC is preparing for worst case scenario, and ramping up its infrastructure urgently, stocking up medicines needed for critical care, and ramping up its oxygen production, and supply network. It is likely the third wave could hit around September, if we go by past trends post gradual unlock.” According to experts, the first wave hit between May and September 2020, which saw highest active cases at above 34,000, in Mumbai. The total number of covid-19 cases reported during this period in Mumbai was 200,559, according to data from the state government. The second wave started by the end of February 2021, experts say, and has lasted until now. According to BMC, highest active cases during this period crossed 90,000, and the total Covid-19 cases reported in Mumbai during this time were 391,255, according to data from the state government. Through the course of one year, BMC set up centralised bed management system, tightened the micro containment policies. The shortage of ambulances felt during the first wave was dealt with by allotting five ambulances to each ward, by the end of the first wave itself. A presentation was made by the state health department to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, which stated Maharashtra should prepare for a scenario where Covid cases double, during the third wave. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force said, “Most models predict waves come in about 100 days. But models don’t talk about real-life scenario. We need to be prepared for the worst case scenario, assuming everything in the city opens up tomorrow itself, and we see a rise in covid cases. The meeting discussed Maharashtra’s preparedness to handle a surge in covid cases, assuming the worst case scenario.” According to experts, the civic administration was able to carry forward learnings in handling Covid-19 outbreak from the first wave to the second. This led to more scientific understanding of the spread of Covid-19, understanding of medical management and line of treatment, and which is the high-risk group. Dr Pandit said, “The administration did much more proactive work during the second wave. Similarly, for the third wave, Mumbai needs to learn from the second wave. We need to prepare for the worst, ramp up oxygen capacity, stock up on lifesaving drugs and start with dedicated testing in hotspot clusters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-may-see-covid-third-wave-in-september-bmc-in-prep-mode-101623955039373.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||3rd Covid wave in Maha: Curbs, vax can delay it, reduce impact||Maharashtra is likely to witness the third wave of Covid-19 infections as early as mid-August, according to state Covid task force members, but they feel curbs, coupled with faster vaccination, could delay it and reduce its impact.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had convened a meeting on Wednesday over preparations for the possible third wave, where the state health department had projected that the state could see double the cases in a possible third wave, while the active case count could go up to 800,000.Dr Rahul Pandit, task force member and head intensivist at Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said mathematical projections suggest the next wave could hit in eight to 12 weeks of the second wave ebbing and the state must prepare for it hit in the next four weeks. “The third wave hit the UK was shorter [than the 8-12 weeks period]. Therefore, we have to be prepared based on all models. We have to be prepared in the next four weeks, let the wave come whenever it comes. Our efforts should be towards preparing for it, at the same time, avoiding it altogether. It may not hit us for another eight to 12 weeks but we need to be prepared it before,” he said, adding that no model can accurately predict the virus.Dr Pandit added the state needs to learn from the lessons it got from second wave and experiences in dealing with the Delta variant. The B.1.617.2 strain or the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as one of the main drivers of the second wave of Covid-19 infections that devastated parts of India, including Maharashtra, earlier this year. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has further mutated to form the Delta plus or ‘AY.1’ variant. However, Dr Pandit said the new variant is not well documented. “We have to think about the worst-case scenario and then we must prepare and come out with the solutions so that we are not caught off-guard. We have to assume that the virus will mutate. Especially since we have learned out lessons from the Delta variant and the UK variant,” he said. Another task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that the onset of a possible next wave of Covid-19 infections could be pushed with keeping curbs on and vaccinating a large chunk of the population in the next one or two months. The task force has cautioned against crowding and lack of covid-appropriate behaviour which would invite the third wave faster.“It is predicted that the third wave can come after easing of the curbs completely, which would be another month and a half or two months from now at the most. But it is unlikely [that it will hit soon] as curbs are still in place. What is worrying is the non-adherence to Covid appropriate protocols and crowding,” Dr Joshi said.Of the 35 districts in the state, 19 districts and some cities including Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune do not have strict curbs as part of the five-level unlock plan. Senior government officials said that the unlock mechanism is theoretically fine but enforcement has been an issue. “For instance, the activities have almost opened up completely in Mumbai. There is no enforcement of the curfew after 8pm. Certain activities like opening of malls are not open in Mumbai, but neighbouring Navi Mumbai has malls open. The mobility of people is unrestricted,” a health department official said who did not wish to be named.Maharashtra added 9,830 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the tally to 5,944,710. It reported 236 deaths in the last 24 hours, while 400 fatalities were added to the tally taking the death toll to 116,026. The state’s active case count stood at 139,960.Mumbai on Thursday added 660 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 717,832. Mumbai saw 20 deaths in the past 24 hours, pushing the death toll to 15,247. The active cases in the city were 18417 on Thursday.Of the 400 deaths that were added to the tally after reconciliation process, 137 occurred in Ahmednagar, 63 in Pune, 32 in Nagpur, 28 in Nashik, 23 in Sangli, 21 in Aurangabad, 20 in Ratnagiri, 13 in Solapur, 11 in Kolhapur, nine in Satara, six in Thane, five each in Beed and Raigad, four in Akola, three each in Bhandara, Hingoli and Nanded, two each in Buldhana, Latur, Osmanabad, Wardha, and Yavatmal, 1 each in Chandrapur, Nandurbar, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3rd-covid-wave-in-maha-curbs-vax-can-delay-it-reduce-impact-101623954979252.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Kandivli Covid vax drive: Mumbai civic body seeks details from hospitals, centre||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent letters to Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline hospitals along with the civic-run Nesco jumbo centre, Goregaon, on Thursday seeking information about the vaccination drive conducted at Hiranandani Heritage, Kandivli on May 30. This is a part of the civic body’s internal investigation, a report of which is likely to be submitted by Saturday. An employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri, Rajesh Pandey, using his official hospital identity card, gained the trust of the society committee members to conduct a vaccination drive. Later, with help of his partners, the vaccination drive was organised on May 30 at the society. After seven-eight days of the vaccination, when beneficiaries started getting vaccination certificates from Nanavati, Lifeline hospitals and Nesco jumbo centre, they became curious as these vaccination centres weren’t involved in the immunisation drive. A total of 390 beneficiaries were vaccinated at the drive, however, none of them developed any minor side effects like fever and body ache.Considering the seriousness of the issue, BMC decided to investigate the matter. The R-South ward on Thursday sent a letter to Nanavati, Lifeline and Nesco jumbo centre seeking details of the drive. “So far, the hospitals have denied their involvement in the vaccination drive. Thus, we need this officially on paper for your internal investigation. We have also asked for details like if they have signed any Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the society among other queries,” said Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of R-South ward. Now, all the details of the beneficiaries are being reflected on the centralised Co-WIN app with the names of the three vaccination centres. “We can’t individually call people employed with private hospitals as it doesn’t come under our purview. Now, it is up to the police to get their statements,” he added. The Kandivli police station is also investigating the matter. The police have taken two of the accused for questioning.“We have also taken statements of the hospitals whose names have come on the vaccination certificates. But all the issued certificates are genuine,” said a police officer, who is part of the investigating team. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco jumbo centre confirmed that police has recorded their statement. “As I have already said earlier, we have no role in it. We have completely cooperated with the police. I don’t know how the name of our centre has got reflected in vaccination certificates,” she said. As per police sources, allegedly, the accusers have also conducted a similar vaccination drive at other places in the city. Just like the residents of Hiranandani Heritage, other beneficiaries also didn’t develop any side effect after vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kandivli-covid-vax-drive-mumbai-civic-body-seeks-details-from-hospitals-centre-101623954919816.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends Fr Swamy’s stay at hospital for two weeks||The Bombay high court (HC) has extended the stay of Elgar Parishad accused Fr Stan Swamy, the 84-year-old Jesuit priest who was shifted to Holy Family Hospital in Bandra from Taloja jail on May 28, for two more weeks till July 5. The decision comes after the court was informed that the hospital report indicated that he was suffering from critical health issues and has to be kept in the intensive care unit (ICU). The court initially intended to extend the stay for four weeks, however after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) submitted that it wanted to peruse the report before deciding on the court’s proposition, the court accepted it and directed the registry to give the report of the hospital to NIA and the state with the consent of Swamy’s counsel. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Swamy’s bail application filed on medical grounds as well as on merit, was informed by senior counsel Mihir Desai that the report on Swamy’s health, obtained from the hospital as per the June 10 order of the HC wherein the priest’s stay at Holy Family Hospital had been extended till June 17, stated that Swamy’s condition was very critical and he had to be shifted to ICU. In view of this, Desai sought further extension for two weeks. After perusing the medical report, the bench observed, “The hospital report findings are that Swamy’s condition is critical and requires ‘intensive care’ as there are ‘serious medical issues’. In view of aforesaid report, we deem it appropriate to extend the stay of appellant.” After NIA and the state said they had no objection to extending the hospital stay of the priest, the court said it would grant an extension of four weeks. However, advocate Sandesh Patil for NIA said they wanted to see the medical report before agreeing to it. The court then extended the hospital stay for two weeks till July 5, and posted hearing of the application to July 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-fr-swamy-s-stay-at-hospital-for-two-weeks-101623954919276.html
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Will publish weeklong jab slots, provided there is supply, Maharashtra govt assures HC||The state on Thursday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it was willing to publish weekly plans for Covid-19 vaccination for all districts including Mumbai provided sufficient vaccines were made available to them by the central government. The state also submitted that while it had published weekly plans for some districts previously, the plan for those districts had also been reduced to daily plans as they were not receiving adequate jabs. The division bench of justice Sunil Deshmukh and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Yogeeta Vanzara through advocates Rajesh Vanzara and Jamsheed Master was informed that there was a need to have weekly plans for vaccination jabs as citizens were finding it difficult to book slots on the Co-WIN portal. The PIL also pointed to other issues problems faced by citizens especially the senior citizens and the poor who did not have access to smartphones and computers through which slots are to be booked on the Co-WIN portal.Advocate Master in an earlier hearing on June 9 had informed the HC that while some districts in the state districts like Kolhapur, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli had published week-long vaccination slots in advance on the Co-WIN portal, booking for Mumbaikars was available only a day in advance. He had urged the court to direct the BMC to adopt a similar approach as people were facing problems with the current system. Master had suggested that apart from publishing week-long plans the portal should also have a fixed time which was known to everyone so that they can book slots without any hassle. The court had directed the state and BMC to consider the suggestions. In response to the suggestions, the state filed an affidavit prepared by Sadhana M Tayde, director, commissioner of health services which stated, “The state government will publish a weekly plan for vaccination calendar in districts including Mumbai city as per the availability of vaccines which will be supplied to the state government by manufacturers as per the allocation of the vaccines by Union of India.”The affidavit added that due to the reduced supply of vaccines, Kolhapur, Yavatmal and Gadchiroli districts were not in a position to publish a weekly plan for inoculation anymore. It was also clarified that with a limited supply of vaccines, distribution to districts was based on factors including the number of active patients, performance of Covid vaccination, active case positivity rate, beneficiaries pending for second dose and available vaccines stock.The state also assured the HC of having fixed time for booking of vaccination slots and said, “The state government will accordingly issue instructions to that effect to all districts and municipal corporations to publish vaccination session slots at a predetermined time based on the availability of stocks of vaccine to avoid inconvenience to persons.” The affidavit while informing the HC of having a task force to oversee the facilitation of the vaccination programme in each district also said that it would direct district authorities to give priority to persons between 18 and 44 years of age with commodities after adequate stocks were made available.In light of these submissions the state and even the centre requested the court to dispose of the PIL however on the insistence of the petitioner, the court posted a hearing of the PIL after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-publish-weeklong-jab-slots-provided-there-is-supply-maharashtra-govt-assures-hc-101623954802066.html

The seized drug is estimated to be worth ₹21 crore in the illicit international market.DRI officials have said that the foreigner is part of an international drug syndicate that is smuggling narcotic drugs through mules by way of concealment in body and luggage.The accused Zambian national Juliana Mutale was travelling from Johannesburg to Mumbai via Doha. She was apprehended by the officers of DRI Mumbai zone unit based on the specific intelligence the agency had received recently.When her baggage was searched in one stroller bag the DRI officials noticed a specially made pocket to conceal articles.“On tearing the packet three kilograms of cream coloured powder wrapped in black carbon paper packaging was recovered. The recovered material tested positive for the presence of Heroin with the help of the field test kit,” DRI stated.The three kilograms of cream coloured substance purported to be Heroin is valued at ₹21 crores in the illicit market. The same was seized under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Mutale during her interrogation revealed that the drugs’ package was handed over to her in Johannesburg and she was supposed to deliver it in Mumbai. But she is claiming that she does not have many details about the person who was supposed to receive the package. The DRI officials are now trying to find out about other members of the group in the city by scanning her phone call details. She has admitted her role as a carrier of narcotics drugs and told that she was doing that for monetary gain, the central agency said. The accused woman hails from a poor background. She had come to India first time and is holding a business visa.She has been lodged at the Byculla women’s jail.The officials have produced the accused foreigner in a city court that remanded her to judicial custody. The investigators may question her again soon to know more about her handlers. DRI stated that this is the fourth such case of smuggling of narcotics through passengers, detected by the Mumbai unit of the agency in the past six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-heroin-worth-21-crore-seized-from-zambian-national-101623954799364.html
18-06-2021||Pune||Pune civic body urges mechanised cleaning of septic tanks; violators to face action||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), as part of the Central government’s “Safai Mitra Suraksha” challenge, has appealed to housing societies and individual households to ensure the mechanised cleaning of septic tanks at least once in three years. The PMC has also recommended that an authorised contractor or agency, be used to clean the tanks.Those not adhering to the cleanliness drive will be liable to face action, as per the civic body.Sushmita Shirke, superintending engineer, sewerage, and maintenance and repair department, said, “Under this challenge, we will have to provide safety to safai workers. The challenge is focused on avoiding manual cleaning and promotes mechanised cleaning.”She added, “We have appealed to all citizens to stop manual cleaning of tanks to use machinery instead. If it is essential to use manpower for cleaning, it is mandatory to take prior permission from the chief superintendent of the drainage department. It is also compulsory for societies and individual households to have their septic tanks cleaned once every three years by PMC-affiliated contractors; otherwise, they will have to face action.” The Safai Mitri Suraksha challenge is taking place in 243 cities throughout the country, and began in November 2020. The initiative aims to ensure that no life is lost due to the cleaning of any sewer or septic tank.The PMC has carried out a self-assessment and submitted an application with a score of 991 marks. A Union government- appointed independent agency will now assess the ground reality and submit a report to the government.Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Actually, there are no septic tanks used by housing societies as we have a drainage network across the city. However, there are chances of a septic tank mechanism in the newly merged villages. Corporation has prepared a plan for these merged villages.”Safai Mitra Suraksha challengeThe Safai Mitra Suraksha challenge focuses extensively on creating awareness along with infrastructure for mechanised cleaning and building of the workforce. Results of the actual on-ground assessment of participating cities will be declared on August 15, 2021. Cities will be judges in three sub-categories depending on population – one million and more, 0.3-1 million, and up to 0.3 million. Total prize money of ₹52 crore is there to be won across all categories.What is PEMSRA act?Tt is an offence to directly or indirectly employ or engage any person for hazardous cleaning. Violation of the aforementioned safety precautions is an offence under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act-2013 (PEMSRA) Act, even in cases when hazardous cleaning does not result in death or serious injuries. If an officer of a local authority is found to be engaging workers for manual cleaning of a sewer without the written permission of the corporation, the lack of such permission could provide evidence of the offence being committed.Similarly a photograph or video of a worker cleaning a septic tank without prescribed safety equipment can constitute evidence of an offence by the person engaging or employing such a worker.Suhas Patwardhan, chairman, Pune District Co-operative Federation, said, “There are around 11,000 housing societies in Pune city. Most of the societies have interconnected their drainage systems to the PMC network. However, some old societies have septic tanks. It is a good move by the PMC to make it compulsory for the mechanised system. But, the PMC should co-with operate societies and provide facilities in time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-urges-mechanised-cleaning-of-septic-tanks-violators-to-face-action-101623953724716.html

The committee will submit its report to the L-G within two weeks.The BJP hit out at the Delhi government and demanded the resignation of transport minister Kailash Gahlot.However, the Delhi government denied the allegations saying putting the bus procurement plan on hold was solely to comply and cooperate with any form of investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lg-forms-three-member-panel-to-probe-dtc-bus-procurement-process-101623952460394.html
18-06-2021||Delhi||Expenses up by 80% in second wave, but tax receipts down, says Manish Sisodia||The Delhi government on Thursday issued an order to rationalise spending, citing low revenue collection this year and high expenditure owing to the second wave of Covid-19 (fourth in the city). Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said the Capital’s expenditure increased by around 80% in the first two months of the financial year (April and May), compared to last year.“The revenue receipts of Delhi have been ₹5,273.26 crore during the first two months of the financial year 2021-22 (April-May), while its expenditure has reached ₹8,511.09 crore. Delhi has incurred ₹3,237.83 crore more than its receipts which were met from last year’s savings,” Sisodia said.Records showed that during the first two months of the financial year 2019-20 and 2020-21, the expenditure of the Delhi government was ₹4,705.14 crore and ₹4,965.58 crore respectively.April-May this year were the months when Delhi saw its worst surge in Covid-19 cases, with the seven-day average of new cases soaring to 25,294 a day at it peak. This wave, the fourth in Delhi, claimed over 11,000 lives – as many as the previous three waves put together.The Delhi government had to ramp up beds in hospitals and makeshift centres, procure supporting medical infrastructure, including medical oxygen, and manpower. It also forced the Delhi government to impose a strict lockdown from April 19 which continued for at least seven weeks.“The tax collection has declined due to second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. But, the expenditure has increased in comparison to the previous years because of implementation of various measures to check the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi,” Sisodia said.During the first wave of the pandemic last year, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had directed all government departments to stop incurring all expenses other than the salary of employees.“Any expense other than those related to relief work pertaining to the coronavirus lockdown will need special permission from the finance department. The government needs to cut down expenses,” Kejriwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expenses-up-by-80-in-2nd-wave-but-tax-receipts-down-says-sisodia-101623952338979.html
18-06-2021||Delhi||Monsoon will take another five days to reach Delhi: IMD||Residents of Delhi will have to wait for at least another five days before the monsoon hits the national capital, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday, attributing the delay to “large-scale atmospheric conditions unfavourable to the further advancement of monsoon” to Delhi, Haryana and parts of Punjab and Rajasthan.Cloudy skies covered most parts of the city even as light showers were witnessed in some areas on Thursday. Scientists said such patchy, intermittent pre-monsoon showers are likely to continue in Delhi-NCR in the coming days, though it will not reduce the temperature, which will hover around 37-38°C, much.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that throughout the day, parts of Delhi saw light rainfall activity which wasn’t strong enough to be caught by the radar. “This activity will reduce tomorrow (Friday), but will intensify again on June 19 and June 20,” said Srivastava.He said rainfall and thunder will impact almost the entire city during the weekend.IMD forecasts about the monsoon have been consistently wrong this season.Last week, IMD predicted that the monsoon, which had advanced into northwest India, would hit Delhi by June 15. However, in a later forecast, IMD said that its arrival was delayed by 10-12 days.In a fresh forecast issued on Thursday, IMD said, “Large-scale atmospheric conditions are not favourable for further advance of monsoon into Rajasthan, remaining parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. However, there could be slow progress into some more parts of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in the next two or three days.”On Thursday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 35°C, four degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was 26.2°C, two degrees below what is considered normal for this time of year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-will-take-another-five-days-to-reach-delhiimd-101623952219574.html

We were hoping that social gatherings would be allowed too, but that did not happen. We have requested chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to allow social functions, as our industry has been badly hit by the pandemic.”The Delhi government banned social functions and weddings when the lockdown was announced in April to curb the spread of the second and most deadly wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.“As the government is making efforts to ensure that the economy regains normalcy, it is requested that banquets and hotels also be opened along with the opening of other sectors such as markets, factories etc. at the earliest,” the association wrote to the chief minister.Members say the weddings and banquets industry has suffered a lot of losses owing to the restrictions imposed to control the pandemic in April.Industry members said the auspicious period (sayas) for weddings will end by July 20, post which they would not have much business till October.Pankaj Shokeen, secretary of Delhi Tent house association, said, “We had asked our workers to return, as we thought that businesses would resume as Covid cases are on the ebb. If functions are not allowed now, we will have no business till October. We just have a month more of the wedding season left.”Dang further said, “We assure the government that we will follow all Covid protocols and ensure social distancing if we are allowed to hold functions.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/banquet-and-tent-house-owners-want-govt-to-allow-weddings-social-functions-101623951978888.html
18-06-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee moves Calcutta high court against Suvendu Adhikari's Nandigram win, hearing today||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee moved the Calcutta high court on Thursday challenging her narrow loss in the Nandigram seat to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari. This was Banerjee’s first electoral loss in 32 years.According to Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders aware of the development, Banerjee’s petition alleged that the votes were not counted properly.Adhikari, who switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party last year, won the seat by 1,956 votes and went on to become the Leader of Opposition in the Bengal assembly.The case is listed to be mentioned before Justice Kausik Chanda at 11 am on Friday.The development came on a day West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar met Union home minister Amit Shah, President Ram Nath Kovind and Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhury in Delhi.Dhankhar and Shah met for an hour, days after the governor clashed with Banerjee over post-poll violence in Bengal.On Thursday, the CM said allegations of post-poll clashes were a political gimmick and added that she had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi three times to recall the governor.Controversy about the Nandigram election had broken out on the day it went to the polls, April 1.On the day of voting, Banerjee, who was wheelchair bound at the time because of an ankle injury, levelled charges of booth rigging and refused to leave a polling station for two hours.When the election results were declared on May 2, the Trinamool Congress sought a recount when the results were announced but the Election Commission didn’t allow it.Days later, Banerjee claimed that the returning officer who turned down the request for a recount was threatened, a charge the BJP promptly dismissed, insisting that the chief minister wasn’t able to “accept the reality”.The defeat in Nandigram was a blow to Banerjee, who led her party to a landslide victory in West Bengal assembly elections with 213 of the 292 seats — her party’s third straight win.Banerjee, who represented Bhawanipore in the last assembly, announced her decision to contest from Nandigram a month before the eight phase elections began.The high-profile seat, where a land agitation in 2007 propelled TMC to power in the state, elected Adhikari in 2016 when he was with the TMC.TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said there was “no way she (Mamata) could lose” from Nandigram.Adhikari did not comment on the development.Amit Malviya, national head of the BJP’s IT cell, said: How do you lose an election twice? First, at the hustings and then, like a sore loser, challenging people’s verdict in the court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-moves-calcutta-high-court-against-suvendu-adhikari-s-nandigram-win-101623950779402.html
18-06-2021||Pune||PMC vax drive: Only 17% population covered yet||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has vaccinated only 17 per cent population within its limits as of June 15. The corresponding figure in Pune district and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is 11 per cent, according to the district health department data. In PMC, only two per cent beneficiaries between the age group of 18 and 44 years have received the second jab. Whereas, the second dose beneficiaries between the age group of 45 and 59 years are only 10 per cent. On Thursday, 26,976 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune district. Of this 7,583 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune rural, 15,900 in PMC and 3,493 in PCMC. The vaccine was administered at 261 centres on Thursday. Of this, 213 were administering Covishield and 48 Covaxin.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of zilla parishad, said that the vaccine coverage depends on multiple factors. “If we have ample stock, we can reach the target of one lakh each day in Pune district. We have enough centres not just in Pune city, but also in rural parts of the district. We just need enough vaccine stock in time for both first and second doses,” said Prasad. He pointed out that the software glitches in Co-WIN application was not showing beneficiaries. “The error has been rectified and now we are entering these numbers. However, the count is marginal,” said Prasad. Private hospitals inoculating beneficiaries in urban areas helped in increasing the overall coverage. “Now that the government and private supply ratio is fixed for vaccines, we have more stock and intend to reach the 1 lakh mark soon,” said Prasad. The first dose coverage in PMC limit is good. Frontline workers (FLW) and healthcare workers (HCW) have 100 per cent vaccination with the first dose. The coverage for beneficiaries between 18-44 years, 45-59 years is also good for the first dose with even 79 per cent senior citizens have got their first jab. Similarly, in PCMC as well, the FLW and HCW have a good first dose coverage. However, 18 to 44 years of age beneficiaries have only five per cent coverage with the first dose. In rural parts of the district as well, only four per cent 18- 44 years beneficiaries have received the first dose. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (health) of Pune circle, said that the vaccine coverage in Pune district will improve as the frequency of vaccine for Pune has increased. “On Thursday, Pune received around 76,000 doses of Covaxin for second dose beneficiaries. Three days back as well Covishied was given to the district. Every three days, vaccine sock is recharged so we are able to inoculate more people this month than in May,” said Dr Deshmukh. He said in June 15, Pune district has received 60,000 Covaxin and 180,000 doses of Covishield. “If we continue to get more stock, we can inoculate more first and second dose beneficiaries,” said Dr Deshmukh. In January, Covishield doses were to be administered with a gap of four-six weeks. Later, the Centre revised it to four-eight weeks. At present, Covishield doses are to be administered 12-16 weeks apart, following a recommendation by a government panel. However, the gap between inoculations of Covaxin remained unchanged. It has to be administered in 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-vax-drive-only-17-population-covered-yet-101623940097786.html
18-06-2021||Pune||Covid relaxation demand takes high pitch as positivity rate drops in Pune rural||Pune: Though the third round of relaxations was declared in Pune Municipal Corporations (PMC) limits, the rural parts of the district remained under the cover of Level 4 restrictions. While the weekly average positivity rate of rural areas, including the limits of municipal councils, from June 10 and June 16 was 8.58%, business operators and shop owners are seeking more Covid relaxations. The positivity rate in PMC limits for the duration mentioned above was recorded at 4.82%. Under the Level 4 restrictions, non-essential shops are not allowed to operate. Also, restaurants and food courts are not permitted dine-in facility. “Rajgurunagar is a huge marketplace. After a six-month lockdown, the present restrictions of three months have badly hit the business community. We demand permission to reopen shops. If different rules are applied to Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, why not the tehsils? They should only place those tehsils under lockdown where the positivity rate is high. Around 10,000 workers depend on their jobs in Rajgurunagar market. The figure is not less than an industrial unit,” said Manik Hore, representative of Rajgurunagar traders’ association. Hoteliers from the rural parts are also demanding relief from the curbs. “I have a restaurant at Koregaon-Bhima in Shirur tehsil. We have written to the local administration many times to let us reopen. While Covid cases have dropped, yet shop owners and business operators are facing financial issues because of the lockdown. As those reopening shops without permit are booked by the police, better relax restrictions and allow us to run businesses where cases have dropped,” said Jayesh Shinde, resident of Koregaon- Bhima. Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar at the Covid review meet last week had said that the positivity rate in rural areas will be monitored for another week before taking a decision on lockdown curbs. “We approached the tehsils officers and they said that a decision on Covid will be taken soon,” said Hore. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said that a final decision will be taken after a review. “Since last week, we have seen a fall in positivity in rural parts. The daily positivity is around 7%-8%. We will consider all the aspects. We will take a call on Covid curbs after a review,” said Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-relaxation-demand-takes-high-pitch-as-positivity-rate-drops-in-pune-rural-101623934697134.html

18-06-2021||Mumbai||Will fight 2024 assembly elections with NCP: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday said the party will contest the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) “in the interest of the state”, days after Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole announced that his party will go solo in the polls.“It is good that the BJP and Congress are preparing towards that (going solo). That leaves two parties, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party, in the state. If everybody else is going solo, then these two prominent parties will have to come together in the interest of the state.“Statements to this effect have been made by Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar,” an editorial in the party’s mouthpiece Saamana read.Earlier this week, Patole had said that his party would fight all the forthcoming elections alone and added that the Congress would be the single-largest party in the 2024 assembly polls. Subsequently, senior BJP leader Raosaheb Danve, in a statement, said that his party would also contest the next elections on its own.“In the future, if the two leading parties of Maharashtra, NCP and Sena, come together to contest the elections, then it can lead to miracles in the state… Both the parties will think about it (pre-poll alliance) in future,” the editorial said.In an apparent jibe at Patole for his statement, the editorial said the party needed to reach the majority mark of 145 to form the government in the 288-member assembly.The Congress looked to downplay the editorial, with senior leader and Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat stating: “Every party intends to come to power on their strength. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in it. Our stand is that keeping the BJP away from power is in the national interest. Therefore, we will take appropriate decisions at the right time,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-fight-2024-assembly-elections-with-ncp-shiv-sena-101623924256672.html
