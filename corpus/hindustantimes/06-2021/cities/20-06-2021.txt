The change in power connection system has already been completed in eight high-rises, officials said. PVVNL had started the conversion process 15 days ago, they said. Following the recent notices issued by PVVNL to high-rises and group housing societies, seeking details to commence work on providing multipoint connections after the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) decided to do away with the mandatory 51% consent, as many as 270 out of 612 high-rises in the city have given consent for multipoint connections for the flat owners there. Virendra Nath Singh, chief engineer of PVVNL (Noida division), said that supply lines and power meters are being installed in the societies, which opted for multipoint connections. “Later, PVVNL will provide connection and supply electricity after registering all the flat owners on its jhat-pat portal. A consumer will have to pay the stipulated charge of ₹20,720 to avail this benefit,” he said. Singh further said that as per the rules, if a society wants to retain the single-point connection, it will have to show the consent of 51% residents to PVVNL within 30 days. “In case of no response from the apartment owners’ association (AOA) or builder, it will be considered that the society has given its consent for multipoint connections. The recent consent of converting the connections given by 270 high-rises will benefit at least four lakh families,” he said. The chief engineer said that it (multipoint connection) was a long-pending demand of flat owners paying hefty electricity bills in high-rise societies. “It is being done in accordance with the 13th amendment to the Electricity Supply Code of UPERC in August 2018, which allowed apartment owners to have direct power connection from the discom,” he said. Meanwhile, the residents are happy with the discom’s initiative . Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Grihapravesh society in Sector 77, said that the conversion will be a boon for the residents. “We had no option than to follow the directions of AOA, regarding the power charges. In summer days, we were paying about ₹15,000 per month for two ACs and other electrical appliances. Now, we hope that electricity bills will get reduced,” he said. On the other hand, the real estate association, Credai, said that the government’s decision of replacing single-point connections with multipoint connections in high-rises will put a pressure on residents. Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai (western UP), said that the multipoint connection in high-rises is not a good idea due to safety reasons. “The single-point connection is always better in terms of safety and maintenance of the infrastructure. If any developer or AOA is overcharging, then there is a way to file complaint and solve the issue. But multipoint connection is not a way out as it will create more problems,” he said. Goyal also said that the discom is charging a hefty amount for a new meter. “They are taking ₹15,000 for a new meter, which is available everywhere for only ₹3,000. The rate of one unit of electricity is similar in both the systems, i.e. ₹6.35 per unit. Can the discom clarify that who will bear the cost of line loss and faults, besides the maintenance of the high-rises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/discom-begins-conversion-process-as-270-noida-high-rises-give-consent-for-multi-point-connections-101624213713393.html

The total land owned by the department in Delhi is around 1,007 hectares. These are at Madanpur Khadar, Jaitpur, Okhla, Jamia, Iron Bridge (Loha Pul) near Gandhi Nagar and Kalindi Kunj, among others, said officials. “We have written to South East Delhi deputy commissioner seeking the administration help in freeing our land. We have decided to first demarcate our land in a joint operation with Delhi officials and then start taking possession,” said BK Singh executive engineer of UP irrigation department. The move follows the Uttar Pradesh government’s order to officials to evict encroachers and protect land, said officials familiar with development. Officials say freeing the land at khasra (land chunk) number 612 in Madanpur Khadar, which is around 4000 square metres, will be a challenge as the encroachers are Rohingya who had fled persecution in Myanmar, officials added. The irrigation department said that the non-government organisation Zakat Foundation had rehabilitated 55 Rohingya families to a village in Madanpur Khadar four years ago. A fire in 2018 forced these families to be moved to the UP irrigation department’s land. “The Zakat Foundation said these families will be shifted from our land in a week but that was not done and now we want it back,” said Singh, adding that around 70 families live there. Abdul Rahman administrative officer from Zakat Foundation, said, “The administration jointly with UP irrigation department is shifting these Rohingya families to Zakat land. We had helped these families settle at our land. But due to fire these families were provided land on UP government land. We are helping Rohingya families in whatever way we can.” South East Delhi deputy commissioner Viswendra said, “We have sought permission from the Delhi lieutenant-governor (L-G) to free the land. Once we get that, we will demarcate and free the land. Some families were shifted back to the Zakat Foundation after the fire, but some remained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-irrigation-dept-writes-to-delhi-govt-for-help-in-clearing-encroachers-101624213653425.html
20-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, GB Nagar identify 13 clusters for 18+ age group||Ghaziabad: Under the cluster vaccination scheme for 18+ age group, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have selected 13 vaccination sites where beneficiaries will arrive for on-spot registration and get themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 from Monday. According to officials, the scheme has been initiated on a pilot basis on directions of the UP government which will launch a mega drive from July 1 to vaccinate about one million beneficiaries per day in the state. The officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that they have chosen five sites at Bhojpur, Maharajpur, Sadik Nagar, Vasundhara and Adarsh Nagar (in Khoda) where about 14,500 vaccines will be administered per day under the scheme. “We have roped in teams at each cluster to start vaccination for 18+ years’ category from June 21 to June 29 as per directions from the government. The beneficiaries will be able to do on-spot registration and vaccination thereafter. We will try to achieve about 28,000-30,000 vaccinations per day,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “At present, we have about 110 teams working for vaccination. But from July 1, we plan to add 100 more teams as the target from July 1 will be revised,” he added. Under the cluster vaccination scheme, several residential wards or villages have been identified in form of a cluster and teams will take up vaccination of beneficiaries at a central location accessible to residents. The teams under the pilot project will try to saturate entire 18+ category population and thereafter move to another cluster. Starting July 1, similar pattern will be initiated widely across the entire 75 districts whose areas will be divided in number of clusters for vaccinating 18+ age group. In GB Nagar, the officials said that they will be conducting about 14,000 vaccinations per day under the pilot project which is taken up in areas of Dadri and Jewar. “For the 18+ on-spot vaccination pilot project, we have identified four clusters each in Dadri and Jewar. These will cover 72 villages with the help of 18 teams. At present, we are conducting a total of about 20,000 vaccinations per day,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar, while adding that the district has 38,000 vaccine doses available and more will arrive in coming days. Experts said that with the cluster scheme for 18+ category, the vaccination process will be simplified. “The health-care workers often face difficulties in vaccinating different age groups. With 18+ category starting now, the issues will be resolved. Further, the on-spot registrations will encourage residents to go to the nearest centre and get the jabs,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-gb-nagar-identify-13-clusters-for-18-age-group-101624213533995.html

20-06-2021||Noida||Noida traders seek weekend relaxation||Noida: As the night curfew timings are going to be relaxed from Monday, traders in the city have now sought relaxation in the weekend restrictions in order to improve their business.In its unlock guidelines issued on June 15, the government reduced the night curfew timings by two hours that will be in effect from June 21. The new curfew timings will be from 9pm to 7am. Earlier, it was between 7pm and 7am. However, the markets will still be required to shut on weekends for sanitisation, the guidelines had said.However, the traders want work to resume on the weekends now. “Many stores have shut down permanently due to the two Covid-19 waves and subsequent lockdown protocols. Most of our customers usually come out for shopping on the weekends. But with businesses remaining closed during that period, the customers will turn to online marketplace. As a result, we will face further losses,” said Sachin Paul, a shoe shop owner in Sector 18 market.According to Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 market association, nearly 30% shops have been closed in the market in the past one year. “The weekend business is comfortably 1.5 times that of the five weekdays. Plus markets are operational in Delhi. Our customers will end up going there if weekends here remain closed. Also, even though the restaurants are allowed to open, with a 9pm deadline they will not be able to cater to the rush,” Jain said.Markets in the city had reopened from June 7 after a month’s lockdown as the active cases had come down to below 600. Gautam Budh Nagar administration officials said that the weekends will be used for sanitisation purposes. However, the traders feel that it would be more beneficial for them if weekend relaxations came into place and a weekday was instead allotted for sanitization.“If the shops are allowed to open on the weekends, we will see more customers. People are anyway hesitant to step out and there is little chance for huge market rush. But businesses will start recovering the losses they have incurred since last year,” said Vicky Yadav, owner of a photography store in Sector 76.District administration officials said that relaxations are happening gradually. “The Covid-19 situation is slowly improving. With the fresh set of guidelines, more relaxations are being given. The situation is being monitored and necessary calls will be taken accordingly,” said Uma Shankar Singh, city magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traders-seek-weekend-relaxation-101624213473350.html
20-06-2021||Noida||For Covid curfew relaxations, active case criteria revised to 500||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government has revised the curfew relaxation criteria based on active Covid-19 cases to 500 from 600 cases earlier. The latest order issued by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari on Saturday also said that districts where the number of active cases go over 500, the relaxations given under the partial Covid curfew will be withdrawn.According to the state’s health bulletin, all the 75 districts in UP had active cases below 500 till June 19, with Ghaziabad having 93 and Gautam Budh Nagar 133 such cases. The last time both the districts went below the 600 active cases was on June 6 and the trend continues thereafter. “With more relaxations coming in from June 21, we are keeping special focus in areas having high population density. Besides, we are regularly conducting about 12,000 vaccinations per day, and it will be scaled up from July 1. For a positive case, we are tracing 30-35 contacts, and testing has been intensified in rural areas,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “We were expecting that cases will increase with mixing of population when curfew was relaxed from June 7 onwards. But we have only few cases coming in on a daily basis which is a positive sign,” he added. Meanwhile, experts said that the active case criteria should have been based on density of population and demography of the districts. “Since Ghaziabad and GB Nagar are in close proximity to Delhi, rise in cases in the national capital also affects the number of cases in the two districts. Further, the officials must monitor mixing of population as curfew conditions get more relaxed now,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Recently, Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, reportedly warned against the third wave of Covid-19 and said that it could strike the country in the next six to eight weeks. “Ideally, the current period till the arrival of any likely third wave should be used to upgrade health infrastructure, and the heightened enforcement is need of the hour. If possible, the criteria of active cases should also be reduced to 250-300 cases to make people conscious about the need to follow Covid protocols. Otherwise, it is generally seen that people throw caution to wind once cases decline,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of IMA (Ghaziabad). In its order, the UP government has directed that activities, outside the containment zones, like opening of markets will now be allowed from 7am to 9pm from earlier 7am to 7pm, but decided against opening of cinema halls, stadiums, swimming pools, and gyms, till further orders. The order added that the relaxations will be for five days in a week with weekend closure continuing on Saturday and Sunday, besides the night curfew will remain in place from 9pm to 7am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/for-covid-curfew-relaxations-active-case-criteria-revised-to-500-101624213415410.html

20-06-2021||Other||Students taking internals seriously after CBSE made them part of assessment, says teachers||With the CBSE coming up with a revised evaluation pattern for board students this year and a possible third wave of Covid-19 disrupting another academic cycle, students of classes 10 and 12 slated to appear for their board exams next year are focusing more on their internal tests, anticipating that they may be assessed on the basis of these tests next year. Asees Kandhari, a class 12 student at Step By Step School in Noida, said she was glad as they have time to score better in their internals even if their board exams, scheduled to take place next year, are cancelled.“With doctors predicting a third wave and Covid variants coming into play, there is a possibility that we too may be evaluated on the basis of our internals. Our teachers have been asking us to submit our assignments and homework on time and laying more emphasis on school tests and assignments. Students set to appear for the board exams next year have started to take even their routine homework more seriously,” she said.Amid rising Covid-19 cases, the Union government announced the cancellation of class 10 and 12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. CBSE’s revised marking scheme gives weightage to internal unit tests, mid-term, and pre-board exams. Many schools had expressed concerns as students tend to score lower in their pre-board than the final board exams due to strict marking done by the institutions.Nidhi (only first name), the mother of a class 10 student at Springdales, Pusa Road, said, “There is no vaccine for children yet and we don’t know how the pandemic situation will unfold in the coming months. This is why, we are preparing our child to focus on every part of their academics as the previous batch was caught unawares, as they are being marked on the basis of their internals.”With the first round of unit tests set to begin this week in several private schools, students said they are more serious about these tests than before as there is more at stake. Vansh Arora, a Class 10 student at The Indian School, said many of his friends who were earlier “casual” about internal tests, are now working hard for it.“Our schoolteachers have been advising us to take the internal tests seriously because Class 10 students this year were evaluated completely on the basis of their performance in internal exams. It might be the same situation next year, so we have been asked to focus on every such exam,” he said.Principal Tania Joshi said the school is preparing students for any eventuality and focusing on the mental health of the children as well. “These students have not attended classes in over a year and are fatigued by the uncertainty of the situation. We need to prepare them for any outcome. Not just board students but even Class 11 students are now taking their internals seriously because we don’t know what will happen in the future. The existing internal marking by schools will remain the same for the time being as it is too soon to take a call on that,” she said.Several schools, such as The Indian School, Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, Amity International School in Pushp Vihar, Tagore International School, said the revised evaluation pattern had caused a change in the attitude of students who were earlier not very serious about their internal tests and assignments.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “Following the cancellation of board exams this year, we had feared that there may be a lax in the attitude of students. But that hasn’t happened. Everyone has become more serious about it. Parents have questions about how their children will be evaluated and whether there will be any syllabus rationalization. We are still waiting for CBSE guidelines on the matter.”To mitigate academic losses, the CBSE had reduced the syllabi of classes 9 to 12 by 30% for the academic session 2020-21 retaining core concepts. The board is yet to come out with a decision on the same for this academic year.CBSE spokesperson said no decision has been taken on the rationalisation of syllabus for the current academic session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-taking-internals-seriously-after-cbse-made-them-part-of-assessment-says-teachers-101624213413457.html

Several restaurant owners and mall authorities said on Sunday that they are ready to open up their establishments with Covid-19 protocols.As per the latest order issued by the state government on Saturday, shopping malls and restaurants will now be allowed to open from Monday to Friday between 7am and 9pm. The partial Covid-19 curfew was imposed from the night of April 30 in the district. Restrictions were relaxed from June 7 after the district had reported less than 600 active Covid-19 cases.However, malls in GB Nagar had started preparations for reopening after a similar announcement by the government was made on June 15.“Cleaning and sanitising process has been underway at our malls since June 16. Even before the curfew, we had been following all social distancing protocols, including no-contact shopping and hourly disinfection,”said Shameem Anwar, associate director (marketing), Entertainment City, which runs Gardens Galleria Mall and Great India Place Mall in Sector 38A.At DLF Mall of India in Sector 18, officials said that a meeting of all the retailers was held recently to chalk out a plan for reopening. “All our retailers have been following all Covid protocols. When the announcements were made on June 15, we held a virtual meeting of all retailers to talk about the plans and procedure for reopening. We hope for good business this time round,” said Pushpa Bector, executive director, DLF Retail.Bector further said that the mall will reopen with 100% of its staff vaccinated. “DLF Mall of India runs with a staff strength of 3,000, including housekeeping staff, security and parking personnel, salespeople, retailers and food vendors. All of these people working at the mall have been vaccinated with the first dose in order to keep them as well as our visitors safe,” she said.As per the order, a Covid helpdesk has to be set up at the entrance gates of the malls which will be equipped with a pulse oximeter, infrared thermometer and hand sanitisers.Meanwhile, restaurant owners are hoping that people who have been locked inside their houses will be willing to eat out. “I am reopening one of my outlets in Sector 18 with half of our staff to gauge the response. We are glad that restaurants have been allowed to reopen and we are sure that people will be willing to eat out with all Covid protocols,” said Varun Khera, head of National Restaurants Association of India (Noida chapter). Khera runs two food outlets in Sector 18.However, those restaurants that also have a bar are not ready to open their establishments. Vicky Saluja, owner of Baby Dragon Bar and Restaurant in Sector 18, says he will wait for permissions for reopening of bars at restaurants. “The orders do not allow serving of liquor. Hence, we will wait for that as of now. It will be a loss for us if we open our restaurant only for food. The weekend curfew is still there, which again will be bad for our business,” he said.Rakesh Bahadur Singh, district excise officer, GB Nagar, said, “The serving of liquor has not been allowed as per the latest orders. It will be allowed once a separate order for the same is issued by the state government.”District administration officials said that malls are allowed to function from 7am to 9pm from Monday to Friday. “Restaurants are supposed to keep alternate tables reserved with ‘do not sit’ markings in order to follow social distancing. At sweets/street food/fast food shops, people are allowed to eat with 50% occupancy,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.Rannvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, GB Nagar, said that police teams will make surprise checks at restaurants and malls to ensure all guidelines are being followed. “We need to ensure that the guidelines issued by the government are followed. We will visit restaurants and malls to keep a check,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-malls-restaurants-set-to-reopen-from-monday-101624213354582.html
20-06-2021||Gurugram||Two robbers from Delhi arrested||The police arrested two members on Sunday for allegedly robbing over a dozen autorickshaw drivers of their vehicles at gunpoint in the past two months across Gurugram. They were planning to steal two-wheelers in Badshahpur on Sunday night, said the police.The suspects, identified as Sonu alias Sunil, and Sunder Lal Sharma, are from Delhi’s Sadar and Rajasthan’s Alwar, respectively.According to the police, they have recovered a four-wheeler from their possession and also solved at least 12 cases with their arrest. During questioning, the two suspects revealed that they used to come from Delhi to Gurugram thrice a week to rob autorickshaw drivers, adding that they targeted sectors 50 and 56, and Golf Course Extension Road.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects are repeat offenders and have been arrested thrice. The mastermind, Sonu, had contacted other gang members who were out of the jail and started robbing four-wheelers from Gurugram. The gang members have been allegedly involved in the crime for the past four years.The police said that Sonu targeted vehicles at the developing sectors as the presence of police is comparatively lower there.They only stole vehicles that have a high resale value, the police said. The suspects used to hide the four-wheelers at Sunder’s house in Alwar till they were sold, the police said. Sunder used to send pictures of the stolen four-wheelers to his friends in Uttar Pradesh, who used to arrange for customers.On Sunday morning, the gang members visited Badshahpur to steal parked two-wheelers but were arrested. “We had received a tip-off that four men were roaming near parked motorbikes in the area. We sent our teams, barricaded the area, and arrested the two robbers,” said Sangwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-robbers-from-delhi-arrested-101624210476334.html
20-06-2021||Gurugram||Water management in Gurugram to be bettered with flow meters||To improve management of water supply, ensuring equitable distribution and minimal waste, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will be installing 500 flow meters across the city, officials said on Sunday. Officials said that the authority undertook a pilot project, as a part of which flow meters were installed at 31 places, and after successful results, it is being expanded. “We have around 500 underground tanks in the whole of GMDA area, which comprises many big colonies like DLF, Unitech, besides establishments such as hotels. We are planning to connect flow meters in all these tanks. By connecting the sensors to the pipelines connected to these tanks, we will know the level of water, how much water is being supplied and measure if water theft is taking place in between from the pipelines,” said a senior GMDA official, who did not wish to be named. The official said that the pilot project is almost complete, with a few minor tests remaining and that the expansion work will start within a few weeks. Officials said that this measure will not only conserve water but will also ensure that the authority gets the amount due for the water being supplied to residents. The project is a part of a centralised integrated water management system, which is being developed by the Smart City division of GMDA and aims to provide water to all residential housing societies, individual houses and hotels. With the centralised system, the GMDA will have a larger degree of control over the entire distribution and supply chain from a single location through the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC). Electrical sensors in water pipelines help in the proper management of water and tapping of illegal sources used for water theft. “We tested the service in a pipeline which starts from Basai till Dhanwapur and whatever underground tanks are falling on this stretch, sensor devices have been installed in these tanks. The water in this pipeline goes through equipment like a water flow meter (to measure how much water is being supplied), water control valve (to ensure the same water pressure to every house). This way, we are also able to ensure that water is not wasted with the tanks overflowing as regular updates are received at the command centre,” said the official cited above. At present, Gurugram’s water comes from the water channels in the National Capital Region and the Yamuna channel. This raw water is carried to the water treatment plants (WTPs) at Basai and Chandu Budhera, which have a daily operational capacity of 270MLD (million litres per day) and 300MLD, respectively. There are also two boosting stations in sectors 16 and 51 to help overcome the difficulty of transporting water to the eastern parts of the city, which is on a higher ground level than the two WTPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/water-management-in-gurugram-to-be-bettered-with-flow-meters-101624210475829.html

The volunteers held a meeting with Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Friday at the PMC headquarters who agreed in principle to form a committee for the rejuvenation project. MLA and BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil was also present and demanded that an independent committee be constituted for the revival of Ramnadi river as well as funds be made available for the development. “It was a very detailed discussion with the commissioner as well as representatives of the NGO working on the revival of the Ramnadi river, along with mayor Murlidhar Mohol, city engineer Prashant Waghmare, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar, superintendent engineer (construction) Yuvraj Deshmukh, where Patil demanded that a special committee be set up for looking after the Ramnadi restoration project, which has been accepted in principal by the PMC commissioner,” said Virendra Chitrav, director, Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film festival and coordinator Mission Ramnadi restoration project. Kirloskar Vasundhara and 12 other organisations came together to create this mission of restoration of Ramnadi. The mission’s aim is to restore the river, nearest to its former state of continuous pure flow and to bring back the glory of this small and once beautiful river, which is 19.20 lm in length and originates from altitude of 950 meters near Khatapewadi at Jaraseshwar temple and flows through Bhukum, Bhugaon,Bavdhan, Pashan, Aundh and Baner. In a map of 1890 of the Bavdhan area, Ramnadi is referred as river with an original width of 48 meters. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said that he has approved the demand to prepare an independent development plan for Ramnadi and invite the representative of NGOs to be part of this special committee, with the mayor as the chairman. He also added that along with the revival of Ramnadi river, Mula-Mutha river will be developed, in which a separate development plan of ₹1,700 crore has been prepared for the beautification, depth and development of Mula-Mutha river. Kirloskar Vasundhara has been working on the restoration of this river for the past two years and their work along with 12 NGOs, 33 colleges, 25 schools, and three grampanchyats have culminated into a bilingual book on the Ramnadi. called Ramnadi, the elusive river, this book will shed light upon the work on the restoration of the river, its history, geography, the challenges and the dangers that this river faces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-commissioner-agrees-to-form-committee-for-ramnadi-rejuvenation-project-101624203633024.html

The director general of police has instructed superintendent of police (Pune rural) Dr Abhinav Deshmukh to seek the opinion of the gram panchayats which fall under the jurisdiction of the police stations on the proposal list to be merged with the Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissionerate. The PCMC police commissionerate was inaugurated on Aug 15, 2018 where police stations namely Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nigdi, Bhosari, Bhosari MIDC, Dighi, Sangvi and Wakad from Pune city commissionerate were added to the new commissionerate. Also, Pune rural police stations comprising Dehu road, Talegaon Dabhade, Talegaon MIDC, Alandi and Chakan were added to the commissionerate. After that new Chikhali police station was commissioned by the police authorities. Following that a fresh proposal seeking three new police stations comprising Mhalunge, Ravet and Shirgaon which fall under Dehu road and Chakan police stations has been sent to the government by the first PCMC police commissioner R K Padmanabhan. On Jan 4, 2021, the said police stations were sanctioned by the state home department. Rural SP Dr Abhinav Deshmukh has instructed all the four police stations to take the gram panchayat resolution on the issue of merger with the PCMC police commissionerate. The DG office also had directed the SP to take village resolution before the final assent is given to the expansion. PCMC police chief Krishna Prakash said, “A proposal seeking extension of commissionerate jurisdiction has been sent to the DG office for approval.

20-06-2021||Pune||Further delay in HSC results likely||Since the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) continues to finalise the method of assessment for class 12, the results for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) are not likely to be announced before July. The class 12 examination was cancelled by the Maharashtra government recently and the final result of students was to be declared by an internal assessment process.On June 14, MSBSHSE issued a notification cancelling class 12 examination for the academic year 2020-2021. Recently, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued its assessment process. CBSE noted that 40 per cent marks of class 12 and 30 per cent marks from class 11 and class 10 will be included in the evaluation. However, the assessment process for HSC has not been declared yet. Speaking about when the results will be declared, Dinkar Temkar, director, Maharashtra State Council of Education, Research and Training (MSCERT) said that the process of evaluation will be declared soon. “The process will be declared in the next 10 days. It is likely to be similar to that of the class 10 assessment process but it may include a few more details. The final notification will be declared in the next few days,” said Temkar. After the evaluation process is declared, it will take at least a month for Junior colleges to complete and upload the result, said senior board officials. Academic experts noted that it is likely that class 12 evaluation for state board may be similar to class 10. However, the delay in evaluation and further delay results in putting a lot of pressure on students. Sampada Waghmare, a student of class 12 from state board said that the process should be declared soon. “Usually,state board examinations are over by March and class 12 results are declared before class 10 results. However, this time it will be totally opposite. It may affect further competitive examinations and the admission process to further colleges. All of these uncertain decisions are increasing the stress on students tremendously,” said Waghmare. The class 10 examination was cancelled in April whereas the education department waited until June to take a conclusive decision over class 12 offline examinations. It was earlier postponed and then cancelled in June. This is as per academics, the first time when Class 12 results will be declared after the class 10 results for state board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/further-delay-in-hsc-results-likely-101624203273021.html
20-06-2021||Pune||Skywalk project proposed for Lonavla||Looking at the popularity of twin hill stations Lonavla and Khandala, a skywalk has been proposed in a meeting held on tourism development in presence of Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. The estimated project is ₹35 crore and four designs were presented during the meeting. The initiative of proposed plan of building skywalk was the brain child of the MLA Sunil Shelke. “The question is - what can we do for the most visited eco-tourismspot in Pune, for example, the tiger point, when tourists come there - they see a cluster of shanty shops. A skywalk with associated shops and centres was thought of to make it an even greater attraction. It will increase foot falls, and the place will have a greater tourist carrying capacity. More jobs would be generated,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad. During the meeting, four designs were proposed. The estimated cost of design A is ₹23 crore while estimated cost for design B is 32 crore while for proposed design C and D the estimated cost is ₹34 and ₹36 crore respectively. “More tourists coming there would mean more tourists into Pune, restaurants on the way would have more business and greater number of jobs would be created. Tourism is the fourth largest sector in Pune. There are so many places in Pune and the idea is to develop each with regard to amenities, engagement activities and access,” added Prasad. Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar said “The project initiated is commendable and I will try my best as the guardian minister of the district to get maximum funds for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/skywalk-project-proposed-for-lonavla-101624203212976.html
20-06-2021||Pune||BJP will conduct statewide agitation on OBC reservation: Munde||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) OBC leader and former child and welfare minister of Maharashtra Pankaja Munde has declared that BJP will file a litigation in court to withhold civic polls until the state government resolves the issue of political reservation for the Other Backward Community (OBC). She made a statement in Pune while addressing a press conference on Sunday. She also declared that BJP will conduct an agitation on June 26, 2021 against the state government. After the Supreme Court (SC) verdict to abolish political reservation of OBC, all OBC leaders of different political parties have started expressing their views. Recently, the Akhil Bharatiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad (ABMPSP) led by senior NCP minister Chhagan Bhubal declared to start agitation to support their demand of political reservation for the OBC community in local bodies across Maharashtra. Now, BJP has also declared to conduct the agitation on June 26, 2021. While addressing the press conference, Munde said, “BJP has decided to conduct state-wide agitation on June 26. The state government is responsible for the abolition of OBJC political reservation. The government failed to produce empirical data of OBC to the Supreme Court. Now, the BJP has decided to conduct strong agitation so that the state government can hear the loud demand of OBC.” She said, “We cannot wait for the next assembly election. We want that issue to have to be solved before civic polls. Therefore, we have decided to file litigation in court to withhold the process of civic polls in the state.” She said, “I can share the stage with any party leaders on the issue of OBC reservation. The state government cabinet ministers have the right to take decisions. There is no need to point the finger to the central government for the decision. It is the state government’s responsibility to submit empirical data of OBC to court. However, the state government is busier to stabilise their regime and ignore the basic problem of the common man.” While ruling out that the reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50 per cent cap in reservation quota, the apex court directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed. It means no seat is going to be reserved for the OBC community in the upcoming local bodies comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats at least for this year or until the state completes the entire process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-will-conduct-statewide-agitation-on-obc-reservation-munde-101624203152968.html

The consultant change process has received a response and a consultant has been appointed after discussion. Therefore, government permits for the work of these two tunnels will be obtained immediately.” Indrabhan Randive, executive engineer of the project department said, “After rendering, four consultants approached PMC. Of that, two consultants were finalised. One consultant has quoted a rate of 3.38 per cent consultancy fee which is more than as per state government ( two per cent consultancy) . We have given a letter to the consultant to reduce the consultant fee.” “After finalizing the consultant, he will have to conduct a topographical survey and aerial survey. At present, we got NOC from central and state government agencies such as Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), National Chemical laboratory (NCL), forest department, Automatic Research Association of India (ARAI),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/panchavatikothrudgokhale-nagar-tunnel-gains-momentum-101624203093044.html

20-06-2021||Patna||Bihar health dept sets up 3-tier committee to update Covid-19 death toll||Shortly after the Patna high court’s flak over inconsistencies in the Covid-19 related death toll, the Bihar health department has set up a three-tier committee to compile, verify and update the details of Covid-19 deaths in the second wave of the pandemic, HT has learnt. The death toll due to Covid-19, which officially stood at 9,543 till Saturday evening, would be updated once the state-level committee, headed by the director-in-chief, health services, issues a fresh list of casualty after verification of documents of those who died before June 7. The state-level committee, comprising administrative officer of the state health societies and the additional director, health department, has been asked by the department to scrutinise the claims of deaths recommended by the district magistrates (DMs) based on reports submitted by the committees set up at medical colleges and hospitals and the district levels. “The principals will head the medical college-level committees, while civil surgeon would preside over the district level committees,” said a senior officer, citing a letter issued to all the DMs by the department. In the letter issued on June 18, additional chief secretary, health, Pratyay Amrit asked the DMs to compile the fatality figure of all those dying due to Covid before June 7 and help the department update the figure before the next date of hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) that the Patna high court lodged for hearing suo moto. On Friday last, the court had taken serious exceptions to huge discrepancies in deaths as furnished by the state health department and those compiled by other civic agencies during the second phase of the pandemic. Owing to the high court’s intervention, the department revised the Covid-19 death toll on June 9 to 9429 from the earlier stated toll of 3951. The department, however, refrained from specifying as to when these additional deaths took place, even as the district-wise breakup was released. The Patna High Court, in an order uploaded Friday, made scathing observations on the Bihar government, saying it is most reluctant to put in the public domain the number of deaths that occurred in the state during the last year during the Covid-19 pandemic and that it is obligatory on the state to fight the “infodemic”. A division bench of Patna high court comprising chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice Sanjay Kumar, while hearing the PIL on the Covid-19 management in Bihar, observed that “…Transparency is the hallmark of good governance, more so in today’s era, especially when the government, both Central and the state, are committed to making success the flagship “Digital India” programme and the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) – 2012.” The bench stated that the need to undertake such an exercise arose only “when the court did not find the number of deaths reported by the government of Bihar during the second wave of Covid-19 to be correct, which stood confirmed through the affidavit dated June 10, 2021, filed by the chief secretary wherein it is stated that the total number of deaths which took place in Bihar is 9375 and not 5424, the figure indicated earlier”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-health-dept-sets-up-3-tier-committee-to-update-covid-19-death-toll-101624194994776.html

They added that substantial work was done on the three corridors in Phase-4.One of the important construction activities done during lockdown was the tunnelling work between Janakpuri West and Krishna Park Extension on the Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor.“We have completed the tunnelling of 500 metres of one of the 2.8 kilometre long twin tunnels. Delhi Metro has also completed the casting of over 50% of tunnel segments in the casting yard. The first of the twin tunnels on this stretch is expected to be completed by September later this year,” said Dayal.On the Majlis Park– Maujpur corridor, construction of piers at the station as well as viaduct locations was carried out. The work on Delhi Metro’s fifth bridge over the river Yamuna, near the Signature Bridge, is also going on as part of this corridor. The Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor is significant, as its completion will complete the entire ring of connectivity on the Pink Line.For the Tughalabad-Aerocity corridor, the casting yard at Panchsheel Park was prepared for casting with installation of all necessary equipment during the lockdown. This corridor will connect the Kashmere Gate– Raja Nahar Singh Violet Line with the Airport Express Line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/completion-targets-of-metro-phase-4-will-depend-on-covid-19-scenario-dmrc-101624192413235.html
20-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka and Maharashtra to share info on interstate water resources||Karnataka and Maharashtra will share information on interstate water resources data on a real-time basis to mitigate floods in both the states. Both the state governments will set up data-sharing platforms for better water management of Krishna river basin and Bhima river.An agreement was signed in Bengaluru on Saturday between chief minister B S Yeddyurappa and water resources minister of Maharashtra, Jayant Patil, as reported by local media Prajavani.Both the states will work towards mitigating the flood situation by managing water flow out of the reservoirs built across the two rivers.The two states will exchange data on the volume of water in reservoirs, the bulk of water flowing in the river course. They will also share data on the rainfall in the catchment area.Both the states have also unanimously agreed to complete the interstate ‘Dudhganga dam project’ in the next two years. The Dudhganga project that will provide both the states surplus water for irrigation, could not be materialised due to several differences.The project line estimate and plan have been prepared by both states and the civil works were yet to begin.A special technical team will be created for effective water sharing between the states. The team will oversee the day-to-day developments in the rivers and water sharing.According to the agreement, Maharashtra will deliver 4tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) water to Karnataka in summer. In lieu of this, Karnataka will deliver water to drought hit areas of Maharashtra in the monsoons.Both the states will jointly fight in the Supreme Court to enact the Brijesh Mishra tribunal's report on water sharing of Krishna river. This report has also been pending due to legal issues.Law and parliamentary affairs minister of Karnataka Basavaraja Bommai hailed the interstate coordination as historic. He said both states will have ministerial and secretary-level talks to level out the differences and work out modalities for a plausible solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-and-maharashtra-to-share-info-on-interstate-water-resources-101624190679804.html
20-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka should approach CWMA for the surplus Cauvery water going in Tamil Nadu: Justice Manjunath||Justice Manjunath, the chairman of Karnataka Boundary and River Conservation Commission advised the Karnataka state government to claim its legal share of Cauvery river water. He advised Yediyurappa to approach the Cauvery water management authority (CWMA) for a concordant solution on equitable distribution of water between the two states.He further counselled that if Tamil Nadu disagrees for an amicable solution to the water sharing problem, then the matter would be resolved through Inter-states water disputes Act of 1956.Justice Manjunath explained that Karnataka has been discharging surplus water for 45 years, except for the year 2016-17 when Tamil Nadu fell short of 50tmcft water. He pointed out that according to the Supreme court order, Karnataka was obliged to release only 177.25tmcft to Tamil Nadu.But Karnataka has released more than double the volume, for 38 years since 1934-35, excluding the average flow of 177-300tmcft water to Tamil Nadu for 8 years. Consequently, Tamil Nadu was getting surplus water to the tune of 396.201tmcft annually, for 38 years at the Biligundlu gauge point.“Even Tamil Nadu admitted in an affidavit to Madras High Court, that in the absence of adequate storage reservoirs, Karnataka was letting more water. The Tamil Nadu government thus, was only trying to utilise it and augment its reserve before it joined the sea.”To which K.L Manjunath reasoned, citing the Supreme court judgement, that a riparian state like Tamil Nadu cannot use surplus water.Justice has urged Karnataka to seek Central government’s help for postponing Tamil Nadu’s Kaveri-Vaigai link canal project, until Karnataka’s rightful share of water is determined.The surplus water could be used by Karnataka for addressing the problems of irrigation and drinking water scarcity, he suggested.Tamil Nadu government has plans to divert the excess water to various reservoirs in Salem district at Edappadi, Omalur, Sankari and Mettur through a network of lined canals”. This was challenged by the farmers of the lower riparian areas of Tamil Nadu at Madras high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-should-approach-cwma-for-the-surplus-cauvery-water-going-in-tamil-nadu-justice-manjunath-101624190357618.html
20-06-2021||Pune||Jayant Patil, Karnataka CM discuss Almatti dam issue||Jayant Patil, cabinet minister of Maharashtra, met BS Yediyurappa, chief minister of Karnataka, in Bengaluru on Saturday and discussed measures to tackle possible flood situation during the ongoing monsoon season.In a video statement issued after the meeting, Patil mentioned that Karnataka does not have real-time data tracking system for the Almatti dam, which is located near the border of the two states.“In Bengaluru, I met Karnataka CM, their ministers and chief secretary and other officials. We discussed how to keep a check and control the flow of river Krishna and Bhima in the upcoming months in case of flooding, and how to maintain tandem between the two states in that process,” said Patil.“Especially in Maharashtra, a real-time data acquisition system has been installed, however, Karnataka does not have one. They must install it at the earliest, and if this system is put in place, collectively the Almatti dam levels can be controlled dynamically. The water inflow and outflow of the dam according to the rainfall can be controlled, and if we do so, the water discharge and ideal water level maintenance can be achieved. I’m sure today’s meeting will help us overcome any eventuality if flood situation threatens to occur this year,” he said.The discharge of the Almatti dam is a crucial factor in water levels around Sangli, Kolhapur and other border towns.In the 2019 floods, Western Maharashtra saw at least 50 deaths and displacement of thousands of people as the floods raised the water level to unprecedented levels. The Indian Army had to be deployed along with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to rescue and provide relief to people stuck due to the floods. In urban areas, the water had crossed above the first floors of the building, submerging the Irwin bridge in Sangli city, and in rural parts, the floods destroyed a maximum number of fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jayant-patil-karnataka-cm-discuss-almatti-dam-issue-101624188574225.html

With various exams either postponing or getting cancelled, students fear the possibility that the NEET exam may get rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.As of now, NEET 2021 is scheduled to be conducted on August 1. However, so far the forms for the same are not yet issued. The registration for the same was expected to start from May 1.NEET 2021 will be conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA) for admission to MBBS/BDS courses and other undergraduate medical courses in approved/recognised medical/dental and other colleges/institutes in India.Milind Telawne, a parent of a student who will be appearing for the NEET exam for the second time, said that his daughter is anxious regarding the exams.“Due to the pandemic, there is so much uncertainty around the examinations. In such a case the forms for the same are not available yet. The registration process is long and if it does not start then there is a possibility that the exam may get postponed. My daughter is taking the NEET for the second time. And the uncertainty is harming her morale,” said Telawne.Another student from the Maharashtra State Board, Taranjyot Narula, a student of Class 12 said that first there was an uncertainty regarding the Class 12 board now NEET is an extension of the uncertainty in a students life.“I appeared for Class 10 examination from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). And to prepare for NEET, I switched to Maharashtra State Board. This year, the decision to cancel Class 12 by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Certificate (MSBSHSE) was delayed. In addition to this, so far the evaluation method for Class 12 is not declared yet,” said Narula.In addition to this, Narula said that it is likely that the NEET exam may get postponed.“There is a delay in registration. So it is likely that the exam may get postponed. I am studying for NEET for the last two years. Those who are attempting this exam for the second time are studying for the past three years. Some people are saying we have got plenty of time to study the paper may be difficult. Some say due to the pandemic, the question paper may be easy. It is very difficult to study with focus due to so much uncertainty,” said Narula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/neet-amid-date-uncertainty-students-left-in-the-dark-101624187613520.html
20-06-2021||Pune||We can vaccinate 1.5 lakh beneficiaries daily, extend drive to housing societies in Pune if we have enough doses: Ajit Pawar||During the Covid-19 review meet on Saturday, Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister, said, that if we have enough vaccine doses the administration can vaccinate about 1.5 lakh beneficiaries every day and extend the ‘vaccine on wheels’ initiative to larger housing societies.While Mumbai has already begun vaccination drive in large housing societies, Pune is yet to start the same. In early March this year, the administration had prepared to vaccinate over one lakh eligible beneficiaries daily which has now been raised to 1.5 lakh beneficiaries daily. However, due to the shortage of vaccines, the administration has not been able to reach its set target.Pawar said, “If we have enough vaccines with us we can vaccinate about 1.5 lakh beneficiaries every day and we could also extend the drive to larger housing societies. Even the administration does not want people to step out as much and crowd the vaccination centres but we await vaccines.”“The chief minister had said that the supply of vaccines would be streamlined by June 21. However, we are yet to receive the stock. Also, along with Pune as per the respective district’s population, we will increase the vaccination drive,” he said.Pawar also announced that a small village in Pune rural, Bahirwadi, in Purandar taluka has become the first village in the country to vaccinate its entire population.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, said, “It is a small tribal village located on the foothills of the Purandar fort and the area MLA had tied up with Pune’s Bharati Medical College to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries. The population is estimated to be about 500 out of which 38- are eligible for Covid-19 vaccination while remaining were children who were also given the influenza vaccine, anticipated to protect against Covid-19 as well.”Pawar, meanwhile, appealed to foreign education bound students and parents of such students to ensure that the students who have been fully vaccinated with Covaxin should not go for the Covishield shot again.He said, “As Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin awaits World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmation, many such students or people who want to travel abroad are asking whether they can get a Covishield dose after completing the Covaxin dosage. It is not recommended by health experts. Bharat biotech is ensuring that they get the approval soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/we-can-vaccinate-1-5-lakh-beneficiaries-daily-extend-drive-to-housing-societies-in-pune-if-we-have-enough-doses-ajit-pawar-101624187433390.html

The south-west monsoon arrived in east Madhya Pradesh on June 10 – seven days ahead of its schedule -- and covered the entire state by Saturday, G D Mishra, senior meteorologist at the IMD's Bhopal office, told PTI. The state has received 94 per cent more rainfall than normal from June 1 till date, he said. Some parts of MP received heavy rains since the onset of the monsoon, but the state has not recorded extremely heavy showers so far, he said. As per the weather pattern prevailing right now, very heavy rainfall is unlikely in the state for a week, he said. All 20 districts in east MP have so far received more rainfall than normal, while 10 out of total 31 districts in west MP have received below normal downpour, he said. This month, Singrauli in east MP has received 441 per cent more rainfall than normal, while in west MP, Hoshangabad received 211 per cent more showers than normal, he said. Dhar in west MP recorded 69 per cent less rainfall than normal. The moderate showers that lasted for a long period helped farmers to sow their crops, the official said, adding that such rain water seeps into the ground and gets accumulated in reservoirs fast, as against the water from heavy downpour which gets washed away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/madhya-pradesh-gets-94-excess-rainfall-in-june-101624186467742.html

Looking at the trend we are assuming that a possible third wave may hit the lower age group. I don’t want to raise fear among parents. We are preparing for the third wave,” he said.Pawar has ordered civic chief Vikram Kumar to conduct a similar analysis in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits.The positivity rate of PCMC is 5.1 per cent and the administration is undertaking preventive steps ahead of the possible third wave. PCMC administration has started 22 fever clinics, 21 testing centres in 32 wards and child dedicated ward in New Jija Mata Hospital.The analysis also showed that more men succumbed to Covid-19 than women. The trend was the same during the first wave.Also, 43 per cent of deaths occurred among the people who did not have any comorbidities.“The finding shows that even fit people should not have a casual attitude about Covid-19,” said Pawar.The analysis also reported that many deaths occurred due to late admission in the hospital and patients had received no treatment during earlier stages.“The analysis was conducted to bring awareness among the people as many take early symptoms lightly and it should not be the case. The person can be treated for Covid-19 if one consults doctors at the early stage,” said Rajesh Patil, civic chief PCMC.Rajendra Wable, dean of Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, said, “In second wave the number of deaths was more in the age group below 60 years, unlike the first wave. People should not have a casual attitude toward earlier symptoms as many become victims of such attitudes in the second wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/53-covid-deaths-registered-under-less-than-45-60-age-group-pcmc-data-101624186473504.html

If such activities continue in large numbers we might have come out with the order of 15 days quarantine for whoever goes out of the Pune district. All need to follow norms and stay safe,” he said.“Although positivity rate is dropping in Pune city, places like Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Beed, Osmanabad, Kolhapur, even in a few places in Pune district the positivity rate is higher so we have decided to impose weekend restrictions again,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahabaleshwar-panchgani-reopen-for-tourists-viewing-points-to-remain-close-101624185573360.html

It is causing other issues too — related to hospitals, foodgrains, houses, or employment. We believe that there should be a check on population. Population control is different from family planning,” Mittal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Mittal further said that his statements are not targeted towards any community nor does he want to challenge human rights’ of citizens. “We don't want to give a message in Uttar Pradesh that we are against any particular religion or anyone's human rights. We just want to see to it that the government resources and facilities are available to those who are helping in and contributing towards population control,” Mittal further added.Earlier on June 10, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also stressed on the need of controlling population to reduce poverty. Sarma asked the stakeholders of the minority community to speak to the members to work towards effective population control measures.“The government is the guardian of all poor people but the government also requires the support of the government in reducing poverty and tackling the issue of population growth, which is the primary cause of poverty, illiteracy and leads to lack of proper family planning,” the chief minister said.The chief minister on Saturday batted for a two-child policy for people using benefits under the government scheme. “If a housing scheme is launched by the state government, the two-child norm can be introduced. Slowly in later stages, the population norm will come in every state government scheme,” Sarma was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-follows-assam-to-raise-concerns-regarding-rise-in-population-101624181925721.html
20-06-2021||Jaipur||Political turmoil in Rajasthan as independents, BSP MLAs join hands against Sachin Pilot camp||The political turmoil in Rajasthan seems to be unending, as the independents and BSP-turned-Congress MLAs have joined hands against the Sachin Pilot camp, which is demanding cabinet expansion and political appointment, HT has learnt.“We stood with the ruling government and still do. In the meeting after discussions with the other independents and six of BSP, who joined Congress, we will pass a proposal reminding the Congress party of their promise,” an independent MLA, considered close to CM Ashok Gehlot, said.Sachin Pilot loyalist Congress MLA: ‘No one is bargaining for posts merely asking for what is due’The six BSP MLAs, who joined Congress in September 2019, are already mounting pressure on the high command claiming that the government was saved because of them during the political crisis last year. Now, the 13 independent MLAs and these six MLAs are jointly holding a meeting on June 23 to claim their stake in the cabinet and the political appointments.The move comes after AICC general secretary and in-charge Rajasthan, Ajay Maken on Friday made a statement that the central party leadership is in touch with former deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who is a star campaigner and asset to the party.Tensions resurface among Pilot camp, CM Gehlot in Rajasthan: ReportThe MLA said that the central leaders camping in Rajasthan assured of accommodating the independents in the cabinet and political appointments within a month. “It has been close to a year but nothing has been done, and now Maken’s statement in favour of Pilot camp has put us all in dilemma,” he said.Another independent MLA, supporting the agenda of the meeting said, “We were there with the Congress in crisis and deserve to be given what was promised. But I have my reservations on inviting BSP MLAs in the meeting as they are now members of the Congress party.”The political turmoil, which started with the MLAs of the Pilot camp hammering the government daily with the demand of cabinet expansion and political appointments, and later with charges of phone tapping and spying, now seems to be turning into Pilot camp versus non-Congress MLAs.Though Maken claims ‘all is well’ in Rajasthan Congress but the war of words between the Pilot's MLAs and the Gehlot camp on media and social media suggests otherwise.Political analyst Manish Godha said the joint meeting looks like a counter to the Pilot faction, though BSP MLAs did come in open recently against the Pilot camp but seems that they are now coming as a bigger front with more numbers.

However, a sharp increase in footfall at the airport--made operational on November 8 last year under Centre’s RCS-UDAN project for building regional air connectivity infrastructure-- has put pressure on the existing facilities resulting in the need for another 2.43 acre of land adjacent to the current terminal building for the purpose of an immediate expansion.A passenger’s footfall data showed that a total of 2,139 flyers in as many as 16 flights travelled to and from Darbhanga airport in a day on Friday, June 19, indicating its popularity as a destination on India’s aviation map.An airport official said on condition of anonymity that a passenger’s shade outside the main airport gate, vehicles access to civil enclave from the main road, a shelter between the main gate and the civil enclave apart from extended parking space are some pressing requirements from the passengers’ point of view that the upgrade was likely to resolve.Apart from SpiceJet, which connected Darbhanga to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Kolkata, IndiGo airlines was all set to start flights on Hyderabad and Kolkata routes beginning July 5, which was likely to put more pressure on the existing facilities.Recently, two AAI staff from Gaya airport were brought to Darbhanga to deal with the rising volume of traffic, taking the total to 9 staff members, which was far less than what is required to man the affairs at this airport, an AAI official said. Darbhanga airport director Biplab Kumar Mondal could not be reached for his comments.AAI chairman Sanjiv Kumar said the authority has been seeking 54 acres of land from the Bihar government for construction of a big terminal to house the civil enclave and parking space apart from 24 acres of land for establishing CAT-I precision approach lighting system. It has already prepared a master plan for the expansion. The AAI chairman added that the state government had already identified a suitable chunk of land on the city side near NH-57 and now the required land needs to be allotted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/land-sought-from-air-force-for-instant-upgradation-of-darbhanga-airport-101624176334080.html

The vaccine was meant to be available at Indraprastha Apollo and Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital, but the officials said that supply issue led to the delay."We are expecting (roll out) next week," the spokesperson of Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital said. Apollo Hospitals, meanwhile, said the facility will tentatively start administering the two-dose vaccine by June 25.Fortis Healthcare, which had said it would make Sputnik V available at its Gurugram and Mohali hospitals from Saturday, also has not started administering the Russian vaccine so far."The rollout did not happen on Saturday. We expect there will be some clarity on Monday," an official said.Gurugram will be the first district in Haryana to begin the inoculation of Sputnik on a pilot basis. Doses will be initially administered to the hospital staff, according to health officials.Fortis has procured the vaccine directly from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Sputnik V is the third vaccine to get emergency use approval from India's drugs regulator DCGI. The other two vaccines are AstraZeneca's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.The Centre has fixed the price of the vaccine at ₹1,145 per dose. The maximum price of Covishield for private Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) has been fixed at ₹780 per dose, while that of Covaxin is ₹1,410 per dose.Sputnik V has been developed by Russia's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and its marketing is being handled by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).The RDIF said on Thursday that it will offer a booster shot (second dose of Sputnik V) to other vaccine manufacturers. This booster shot, the RDIF said, has been adjusted to work against the Delta Covid-19 variant, which was first detected in India.Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country, has been importing vials of Sputnik V from Russia. Over a period of time, the vaccine is expected to be manufactured in India.Sputnik V uses two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. It employs a different vector for each of the two shots, given 21 days apart.According to Gamaleya and the RDIF, Sputnik V has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 92 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sputnik-v-rollout-delayed-in-delhi-hospitals-point-to-supply-issues-101624175352083.html

Abrupt breaking for loading and unloading of passengers often causes accidents. Establishment of the IPT stands will make pedestrians and private vehicle commuters’ lives easy,” PSCPL’s public relation officer Harshita said.IPT stands will fix stoppages for small and medium public transport vehicles and end the dangerous and unruly practice of stopping anywhere on the road to pick up passengers, disrupting traffic and also inviting accidents. According to All India Road Transport and Workers Federation, there are around 30,000 auto-rickshaws running in Patna along with 5,000 CNG-driven and battery-operated rickshaws.As per PSPCL, the 10 identified congested spots include the General Post Office (GPO) roundabout, Chiryantand flyover, Planetarium, Veerchand Patel road, Bans Ghat, Gandhi Maidan gate no. 5 and Jamal road.Harshita added that all stands will have shades and seating arrangements for passengers along with basic amenities like dustbins, digital display board and a LED screen. “We are also planning to install CCTV cameras and WiFi facilities in future,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-to-get-10-public-transport-stands-under-smart-city-project-by-august-101624171532666.html

We also required vaccination but many of us don't have an Aadhar card. Due to this reason we were not being able to get vaccinated. So we requested Thane administration to organise a separate camp for our community. We are thankful to the Thane Municipal Corporation for organising this camp.""We are very thankful to the administration who have organised this camp. They not only helped us with vaccination, but also in our documentation, They provided us with forms for getting our basic documents prepared. I would urge all the people to not fear vaccination and step forward to get vaccinated because it would save their lives," said Kamini, another transgender community member.Dr Aayaz Sheikh, medical officer at the centre said, "We always wanted to help the selected population which is unable to get vaccinated either due to inadequate documentation or financial restraints. This was the idea of the Mayor and the Municipal Commissioner to organise various camps for the selected population like we organised a camp for the differently-abled on Friday and then this camp for transgenders today."Responding to question that there are over 100 transgenders but only 20-25 have come to participate in the camp, Sheikh said, "There is fear among them regarding its side effects. We have a team who are counselling people. Even after vaccination, we conduct counselling of beneficiaries.""We have organised such a drive for the transgenders because they need special attention, specifically in the time of Covid-19. We want to make sure that everybody gets vaccinated. This is the only vaccination centre where a camp for transgenders has been organised. Our aim is to vaccinate each and everybody in the society," informed Dr Sukesh Thakur, MS, Vaccination centre."Thane Municipal Corporation has come forward with this idea of special vaccination camp for the transgender community. A special Nodal Officer has been appointed to co-ordinate with the community and if they don't have their proper address or identity proof even then they will be considered for vaccination through this Nodal Officer under special category," he added.Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 8,912 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, said the state health bulletin.

20-06-2021||Patna||Bihar poll body requisitioning EVMs for panchayat polls likely in October||Almost two months after the deferment of the panchayat polls, the Bihar state election commission (SEC) has started requisitioning electronic voting machines (EVMs) from different states to conduct the rural local body polls tentatively from October onwards. Right now, all panchayats are being run through advisory committees following the expiry of the term of the three tier local bodies on June 15 due to the deferment of the polls-- scheduled to be held in March and April—due to factors like non- availability of EVMs and the second wave of the coronavirus. Officials aware of the developments said the election commission foresees a requirement of 850,000 EVMs for conducting multi-phased polls in about 115,000 booths to fill 250,000 posts in the three tier local bodies and gram kutcheries. The state commission has also got the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) approval to use single post EVMs (M2 model) for the exercise. The M1 and M2 are the older models that are less sophisticated than the latest M3 model.“By our estimate, 850,000 EVMs will be required. The assessment of requirement of EVMs based on the number of booths in each district is being done. Once it is done, we will send our people to get the EVMs from different states across India. It will be completed in the next few months,” said SEC secretary Yogendra Ram. State poll officials said the poll exercise will likely begin from October after the end of the rainy season in September and results will be announced by the end of November or by December. “We are keen to complete the poll exercise by November or early December so that all rural local bodies are constituted, preventing further legal or constitutional complications,” said another SEC officer, seeking anonymity. However, the possibility of a third wave of coronavirus in the coming months had the potential to impede poll preparations. The use of single post EVMs or the M2 model instead of multi post EVMs also presents challenges such as requirement of large space inside the booths to keep the voting machines and longer time taken to cast each vote. “Six EVMs and six control units have to be placed in each booth on an average. If the candidates are more than 15, two sets of EVMs have to be used. This will consume large space in polling stations. Besides, voters would take at least two to three minutes to cast each vote. In that case, the voting percentage will be less because large crowds will not be allowed to gather at booths due to Covid-19 containment protocols,” said one poll body officer. However, SEC officials added that preparations were in full swing and all logistical problems will be sorted out in time. There is a chance that the panchayat polls could be held in more than 10 phases in case the poll panel does not get as many EVMs as required, said the secretary, SEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-poll-body-requisitioning-evms-for-panchayat-polls-likely-in-october-101624167272290.html

We are planning to reverse this by reducing the number of beds for male patients and increasing those for the females and make it 40:60," he said.The plan is being formulated to cope up with a possible increase in the demand for beds for children during the third wave, Chakraborty said."The new Covid-19 variant (Delta) is affecting all in a family. So, there will be high possibilities of children getting infected as well as their mothers. We have planned to keep them together even in case the mothers are negative or they have recovered," he said.The government is consulting health experts to chalk out the plan, the official said."We have set a September deadline to be battle-ready for the possible third wave," he added."The admission rate of children was much less compared to the adults since the outbreak of the pandemic. But, it went up during the second wave and going by the warnings of the doctors and scientists, we presume that it will go up by two-fold in the coming months," Chakraborty said.In view of this, the state government has decided to reserve at least 5 per cent of the critical care unit beds and another 10 per cent of the high dependency unit (HDU) beds, he said.Chakraborty said the health department is planning to scale up paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds to 500 and HDU beds to 1,000.Six new PICUs are being set up in Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, Purulia, Rampurhat and Diamond Harbour, he said.For infants, aged below a month, the Health Department has decided to set up Covid-19 beds at 68 special newborn care units (SNCUs) and newborn intensive care units (NICUs) in different parts of the state, he said.The Health Department is also planning to procure paediatric oximeters and send paediatricians and nurses of the SNCUs and NICUs to different facilities to train healthcare workers, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-aims-to-reverse-gender-ratio-allot-more-covid-beds-for-women-ahead-of-third-wave-101624165416455.html

It is also known as Gangavataran.According to Hindu mythology, Goddess Ganga descended to the Earth on Dashami tithi of Jyeshtha month to free the souls of Bhagiratha’s ancestors from a curse. Thus, Ganga Dussehra falls in the month of Jyeshtha, during the Shukla Paksha or the full moon fortnight. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the river on this day will get them rid of their sins and also heal any physical ailments.It is believed to be an auspicious day for Griha Pravesh (housewarming) and buying expensive things like vehicles or starting new businesses. Every year, hundreds of devotees participate do Ganga Snan and participate in Ganga Aarti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/covid19-no-holy-dip-on-ganga-dussehra-in-haridwar-district-borders-sealed-101624148883930.html
20-06-2021||Delhi||Water supply in Delhi to be affected today in these areas||The water supply to several areas in the national capital will be affected due to rise in ammonia pollution and algae in Yamuna river, according to Delhi Jal Board (DJB). The board said that this will hamper water production at its Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla plants.“Due to increase in the Ammonia pollution and high algae in Yamuna River, water production has been curtailed from Water Treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla and water supply shall be affected in the morning and evening of June 20, 2021, in the following areas and so on till the ammonia level in river reduces to treatable limit,” the DJB said in a release on Saturday.It has advised people to make judicious use of water and said that water tankers shall be available on demand in certain areas.According to the DJB, the areas that will be affected are Civil lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas Karol Bagh, Pahar Ganj and NDMC areas Old and New Rajinder Nagar, Patel Nagar (East and West), Baljeet Nagar, Prem Nagar, Inderpuri and adjoining areas, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Tugalkabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar. Prahladpur and adjoining area, Ramleela Ground, Delhi Gate, Subhash Park, Model Town, Gulabi Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, Jahangirpuri, Moolchand, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Burari and adjoining areas, parts of Cantonment areas and South Delhi.Last month too, the water supply to parts of Delhi was affected twice - due to turbidity in raw water from Upper Ganga Canal and Haryana releasing less water into the Yamuna.The areas affected on May 12 due to high turbidity were Saket, Pushp Vihar, Katwaria Sarai, Lado Sarai, Khirki, Saidulajab, Gokulpuri, Sonia Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Babarpur, Tahirpur, Dilshad Garden, Nandnagari, Shahdara, Laxmi Nagar, Geeta Colony, Mayur Vihar, Kondli, Dallupura, Yamuna Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Jafrabad, Jhilmil, Mandawali, Laxmi Nagar, Shakarpur, Vivek Vihar, Karkardooma, Jagatpuri, Shalimar Park, Krishna Nagar,Patparganj, Preet Vihar, Vishwakarma Park, Lalita Park, Seelampur, Shastripark, Bhrampuri, Gandhi Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan, Okhla, Kalkaji, Batla House Ext., Kalindi Colony, Badarpur, Sarita Vihar, Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli, Greater Kailash, South Extn., Lajpat Nagar, Jal Vihar, Lodhi Road and Kaka Nagar.On May 6, DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha said that the supply from Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants was hit due to a reduction in the release of raw water into Yamuna river by Haryana, which has consequently pulled down the water level at Wazirabad pond.Water supply to parts of central Delhi, north Delhi, south Delhi, west Delhi and Cantonment areas was affected for three days due to it.On average, the DJB supplies 900 MGD (million gallons daily) water, with demand peaking at 1,100 MGD in summer months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-in-delhi-to-be-affected-today-in-these-areas-101624147046693.html
20-06-2021||Lucknow||Now, absconder linked to Ayodhya temple land deal||Controversy continues to hound the land dealings of the Ran Janmabhoomi Trust, with Harish Pathak, who (along with his family) sold 1.2 hectcres to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tiwari for ₹2 crore on March 18 (which the buyers promptly sold to the trust for ₹18.5 crore), and another 1 hectare directly to the trust for ₹8 crore turning out to be a certified absconder.In other words, the seller who executed land deals with the trust that have since become controversial has evaded the law by simply dropping off the map — since 2016.Harish Pathak is wanted in several cases related to a company they promoted, Saket Goat farming, which is alleged to have cheated investors of around ₹50 crore.Babu Ram Shukla of Gonda district, one of the investors, lodged an FIR at Cantonment police station, Ayodhya, on April 9, 2016.In this FIR, managing director of the company Pratap Narain Pandey, chairman Harish Pathak and partner Firoz Alam were named.The police arrested Firoz Alam but Harish Pathak and Pratap Narain Pandey were declared absconders.They filed the charge sheet in court on September 18, 2018. following which a bailable warrant was issued for Pathak.On this chargesheet, additional chief judicial magistrate (first) on December 15, 2018, issued a bailable warrant against Pathak and Pandey. When they could not be arrested, the same court issued non-bailable warrant against them on January 17, 2019.Finally, on February 28, 2019, the court issued a showcause notice to station officer, Cantonment police station, Ayodhya for failure to arrest Pathak.Sub inspector Manoj Kumar Singh, investigating officer of the case, declared both of them absconders.Mahant Dharam Das, who has raised a question mark on land purchase deal of the Trust, has demanded action against Harish Pathak.“When Harish Pathak has been declared an absconder by the court then how come he is openly executing registry of land with the Trust? He should be arrested immediately,” said Mahant Dharam Das.Other saints of Ayodhya are also demanding action against Pathak.Former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya, Tej Narayan Pandey, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh have alleged corruption in a land deal by the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust for the temple in Ayodhya. They have alleged that on March 18 this year, on March 18, Kusum Pathak sold the plot for ₹2 crore to Ansari and Ravi Tewari, who then sold the land to the trust for ₹18.5 crore 10 minutes later. The trust has rejected the allegations, stating that land for the temple was purchased at rates lower than market prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-absconder-linked-to-ayodhya-temple-land-deal-101624143802109.html

After taking the jab, the auxiliary nursing midwife (ANM) asked her to sit on a chair. After five minutes, another ANM, giving shots to the 18-45 years age group, administered her a dose of Covishield. My grandmother did not know that the two shots should not be taken on the same day,” said Akash Kumar, Devi’s grandson, adding that Devi was running a high fever till Friday.Akash also claimed that the two queues for vaccinating the 18-45 years age group and those above 45 years of age were held in one room. “The doctors are enquiring only over the phone. We got medicines for the high fever my grandmother had till yesterday, but she’s feeling weak today,” he added.Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, has assured action against the guilty. “We have issued show-cause notices to our officials and expect their response on Monday. We will definitely take action against the guilty because we had specifically instructed officials not to have two different vaccines at one session site to avoid mixing of vaccines.”The camp was headed by Dr Sanjay Kumar, medical officer-in-charge of the Punpun primary health centre.The State Health Society, Bihar, meanwhile, tweeted on Saturday night that the woman is doing fine right now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/67yrold-woman-administered-two-jabs-of-different-vaccines-in-bihar-101624141143566.html

20-06-2021||Delhi||Curb Covid complacency, orders Arvind Kejriwal||A day after the Delhi high court observed that Covid-19 protocols are rampantly being flouted in markets across the national capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Saturday directed the authorities concerned to follow the “strictest measures” to ensure adherence of the rules laid down by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.“Instructions have been given to follow the strictest measures against those flouting norms. It is in the welfare of our own people that Covid norms are followed by all means,” said a government spokesperson.Following the instructions, the Delhi Police on Saturday formed committees in every police station to conduct localised campaigns on wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene.The step follows a a meeting held on Saturday by Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava who directed all district deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) to take the help of market and residents’ welfare associations.An order, a copy of which HT has seen, was also issued on Saturday for the formation of police station and district level committees chaired by the district DCP.It will include health professionals, notable residents under the police station limits, NGOs, and representatives of public lodging facilities in the area, in addition to members of residents’ and market welfare associationsDCP Chinmoy Biswal said, “The police chief asked the field officers to enlist the cooperation of citizens... noting that it is not possible to ensure 100% compliance only though coercive challans. Covid compliance can be ensured only when citizens voluntarily observe it. Prosecuting people for violations should be the exception, not the norm,” he said.The functioning of the committees will be monitored by a Public Health Management Cell, headed by a special commissioner of police at the police headquarters.Similarly, Delhi government officials said they have also ramped up enforcement while keeping up with the strategy of testing, tracking and treatment of Covid-19 cases.In the past six days, district administrations have collectively issued 4,673 challans on an average every day. Till 5pm on Saturday, 2,280 challans were issued.Records showed that so far, 20,702,001 samples have been tested which translates to 1,089,579 Covid-19 tests per million population.“Under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government is persistently working on a war footing and preparing an extensive road map to curb the effects of an impending third wave,” said the government spokesperson.Traders say working with policeMeanwhile, traders across the city said they are working with police to ensure compliance, adding that shoppers also need to cooperate to prevent the spread. Rakesh Kumar Yadav, president of the Federation of Sadar Bazaar Traders Association, said they surveyed the market in the presence of police to check compliance. “We have asked shopkeepers to ensure that there is no crowding. They are also handing out masks to people without one. We are also encouraging both shopkeepers and visitors to get vaccinated,” said Yadav.In Sarojini Nagar, police used drones to monitor those who were moving without masks and, using the attached loudspeakers, warned people of fines. Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, said both police and volunteers appointed by the association were keeping an eye on the enforcement of protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/curb-covid-complacency-orders-arvind-kejriwal-101624138008107.html

The constable has been arrested and a medical examination has shown alcohol in his blood, investigators said on Saturday.The accident was reported to the police around 10.40pm by eyewitnesses.Police said cab driver Prem Pal was driving his Swift Dzire car towards Sarai Kale Khan when an allegedly speeding Mahindra KUV 100 being driven by constable Mohit Bhardwaj rammed it from behind. Pal was not carrying any passengers at the time of the accident.The impact of the crash was such that the rear portion of the Dzire car was completely damaged. Pal suffered critical injuries in his head and chest. A police team rushed Pal to a nearby hospital but the doctors declared him dead on arrival. Police said Pal was a resident of Agra, and it was not known where he was headed when the accident took place. Officers said his brother, who lives in Jaipur, was informed about the incident.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena confirmed Bhardwaj (35) was drunk at the time of the incident. Bhardwaj is posted in the motor transport unit of the Delhi police’s north district. “At the time of the accident, he was returning to his home in Greater Noida’s Jewar.

20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The timid kakar||Jungle lore has it that the rarely seen barking deer or ‘kakar’ is an inordinately timid creature. Taking to its heels at the slightest sign of danger or a perceived threat, perhaps, accounts for its survival in a jungle where poachers particularly savour its flesh and natural predators such as leopards are forever on the prowl. Fascinating evidence of the Kakar’s jittery nerves comes from a camera trap installed at an artificial waterhole atop a Shivaliks ridge at Karaundiawallah village, Mohali. The camera was placed by Chandigarh-based farmer and orchardist Narbir S Kahlon, a member of the state wildlife advisory boards of Chandigarh and Punjab.The kakars, including a pregnant female, come regularly to Kahlon’s water hole. Night-time footage revealed that one of the kakars jumped back in fright when nearing the water. On closer examination of the footage, it transpired that the kakar had been rattled by a creature many, many times smaller in size: an Indian bullfrog! The pugnacious bullfrog, perhaps wary of the kakar drinking up the water in which the amphibian was dwelling, jumped to the edge of the water, squarely faced the approaching kakar and snorted loudly. The nervous kakar swallowed its pride and thirst and slunk away leaving the David-like bullfrog not only dominant over the precious pool but possibly also chuckling at having impelled the Goliath to beat an unceremonious retreat!“Footage further revealed that the kakar would not dare drink water even when a peacock was quenching its thirst at the water point that the deer was habituated to. The kakar would retreat and return only after the peacock had departed,” Kahlon told this writer.Apart from umpteen birds, insects, bees and moths, sambars, porcupines and an Asian palm civet regularly drink water from Kahlon’s benevolent provision. What has thrown a spanner in the works is that, on Friday night, thieves filched the US-made camera trap recording the valuable proceedings at the water hole. “I will not give up. I will either track down the thieves or buy a new camera trap and install safeguards against theft,” said Kahlon. The mini-leopardNarbir S Kahlon has suffered just the first of his expensive camera traps being burgled. Imagine the plight of eminent zoologist, Rajiv S Kalsi, who has lost 24 camera traps (priced at ₹28,000 each) to such thefts at the Kalesar National Park (KNP),Yamunanagar, Haryana. The burglars included rifle-wielding poachers apprehensive about their nefarious nocturnal activities being caught on these stand-alone cameras. But the positive news is that Kalsi was not thwarted in his research effort by these thefts. The camera traps that escaped the burglars’ attention managed to record the hitherto unknown existence of the leopard cat at the KNP. A rare creature of north India, records of this species are scanty. Even at the iconic, sprawling Corbett National Park, this small but gorgeous cat is but rarely recorded. “As for the KNP, there were no previous records of the species until my camera traps captured three specimens at night. The reason for KNP records drawing a blank is that firstly, no one had conducted a techno-savvy research on the lesser cats here; secondly, lesser cats are small and inconspicuous, secretive and get active deep into the night. So, their presence can easily be missed by the human eye. However, camera traps finally unearthed them. The leopard cat can be described as a mini-leopard as it is an ace hunter of jungle rodents and a crucial species in the predator hierarchy,” Kalsi told this writer.The species was discovered during the course of a two-year research (2018-20) titled ‘Spatial ecology and prey base of lesser cats’, funded by the Government of India’s department of science and technology. Conducted by Kalsi — an author, associate professor and zoology head at MLN College, Yamunanagar — the research revealed the presence of four species at KNP — the leopard cat, rusty-spotted cat, jungle cat and Asiatic wildcat. The first two did not exist in the KNP records till Kalsi’s intrepid cameras nailed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-timid-kakar-101624136731597.html
20-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi government announces policy to support kids in distress||In a first, the Delhi government on Friday issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for family-based sponsorship of children who have either lost their parents or their guardians are not in a position to support them financially. Delhi has now formally opened the system of child foster care or sponsorship, which was pending for nearly six years despite it being mandated under the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015.The new “guidelines for family-based sponsorship in Delhi” will also allow corporates (under Corporate Social Responsibility) and individuals to sponsor for the education, health, and basic sustenance of children through a proper government channel. Till now, such activities were limited to a few NGOs, which also meant that the Delhi government was neither able to maintain a proper database of children receiving such help nor were they able to track the all-round development of the children.The state department of Women and Children Development (WCD), along with the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) and other experts, has formulated the guidelines to provide supplementary support, financial or otherwise, to the families to meet the medical, educational and developmental needs of the children who are either orphaned and living with their extended family, or their parents are incapable of providing for them. Children up to the age of 18 years will be eligible to receive family-based sponsorship.The sponsorship programme has been notified in the backdrop of several children losing either both parents or at least one parent to Covid-19. As per the recent data collected by the DCPCR, at least 1,436 children lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19 in Delhi. Of them, 59 children lost both parents, 467 lost their mother while 910 lost their father.Dr. Rashmi Singh, director of the WCD department, said, “We have issued the guidelines for sponsorship and foster care of children in need. Finally, foster care will be possible in Delhi, but it will be strictly on a case to case basis. It will be imperative for the child welfare committee to do the due diligence and decide foster care for such children based on the social investigation report of each case. A family will be considered eligible for foster care only if we find it meets all the criteria after inspection and thorough investigation.”The SOP, seen by HT, states families keeping foster children will get a monthly financial supplementary assistance of ₹2,000 per child. Each family will not be allowed foster care of maximum two children. This incentive will initially be for a period of six months, extendable to the period ordinarily not exceeding three years or till the child attains the age of 18 years whichever is earlier, the document said, adding that there will be a physical verification and review of the progress of the child by the District Child Protection Unit after every six months to continue the sponsorship.“While this monthly allowance will go directly through the Sponsorship & Foster Care Fund of the Delhi government, the SOP has also made a provision where individuals or organisations can directly provide sponsorship to the children through the government’s child welfare committee. The WCD department will create a list of empanelled sponsors, which will be updated from time to time. So, the moment the police or the DCPCR or district child protection unit, NGOs or even schools identify such children, they will get care and support through the list of empanelled sponsors after completing all the investigation,” said Dr. Singh.The foster care scheme, a non-institutional family care programme for children till 18 years, was pending with Delhi’s WCD department for years. But an exception was made in this case once in October 2013 when the CWC allowed a couple to take in four siblings who were rescued from a factory in Punjab’s Jalandhar.According to the SOPs, a child in need of sponsorship support may be referred by the district childline workers, police, DCPCR, district-level legal services authorities, a district task force of the WCD department, and special juvenile police, among others to the district child welfare committees or Juvenile Justice Board. The committee or the board will conduct extensive background checks before passing the order for putting the child under foster care.The children covered under the sponsorship will be assisted for his/ her immunization, health check-up, growth monitoring, age-appropriate education, higher education, skill development and pre-employment training.The department also issued rules for the guardians or parents who opt for the scheme. “They shall ensure that the child aged between five and 16 years has at least 75% attendance in schools. Those less than five years and not attending school shall be mandatorily enrolled in an anganwadi or a playschool. The child in the 16-18 age group shall either attend the school for at least 75% of the days or a vocation course, as the case may be,” the SoPs added.DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu, who co-chaired the committee that formulated the SoPs, said the sponsorship programme also allows private individuals and organisations to donate for the purpose as per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. “There are so many people who want to donate to help children in need and with this, the government has created a mechanism through which they can do that. We will soon launch a bank account link on our website for this,” he said.Experts say such a scheme is required across the country. Sudarshan Suchi, CEO of Save the Children said not only Delhi, but it is essential for all states to prepare a detailed comprehensive plan and guidelines on promoting and institutionalizing foster care in India.These guidelines need to go hand in hand with the capacity building and training of all the staff involved in child care to ensure adequate delivery. In absence of these detailed guidelines, it is critical for the child welfare committees to pay home visits and prepare a social investigation report for children who are in urgent need of care and protection.“Under the provision of the Juvenile Justice Act, we need to identify the most appropriate care-giving support that is created and delivered at an individual level, because the needs of children are of utmost importance and vary on a case to case basis,” said Suchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-announces-policy-to-support-kids-in-distress-101624136101634.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: From callow to mellow – a roller-coaster ride||For as long as I can remember, my younger sister, Rashmi, has always chosen to march to the beat of her own drum. Those who know her describe her as a feisty, energetic, jubilant, happy-go-lucky, gem of a person, who has clear fundas in life and is content in being her own self. During her school days, she was a consummate tomboy. An outdoorsy person, she dabbled in select co-curricular activities and excelled in fields of her choice, rather than participating in the rank wars like her peers. Our parents did prod her to try and secure the top positions in class, but she simply refused to fall in tandem. She was content in academic mediocrity and after a lot of cajoling, settled on striving for a ‘decent score’. In the subsequent examination, she attempted the question paper only for 70% marks — the yard stick of decent — and kudos to her for securing exactly the desired marks. To her credit, whenever she studied, she did it thoroughly and with utmost focus. Clarity of fundamentals and mastery of basic concepts was her forte. During her graduation, she acquired a knack of predicting the expected questions. She would decipher the syllabus unit wise, dissect the previous papers and compile a probable question bank. She was so confident that she would start filling in her answer sheet, while the invigilator was yet to distribute the question paper. To all her classmates’ surprise, she always hit the bullseye. She always sat on the last bench, securing her reputation as the quintessential back bencher. Slowly but surely, a competitive spirit seeped into her during her post graduation. She opted for mathematics as well as econometrics as electives — very scoring but equally taxing as well. She standardised her modus operandi: make notes and solve exercises daily. Before burning the midnight oil (literally as her study hours initiated after dinner), she would spread her duvet precisely ( bunker was the term), set up the morning alarm and place the clock under her pillow. No family member dared ask her when she slept. She would determinedly put up her queries for resolution in the subsequent lecture. Her perseverance bore fruits and her name is etched on the honour board of her alma matter. She went on to pursue her PhD and is well settled in her career. Both of us ventured into driving when scooters were a prized possession in middle-class families and subsequently acquired a driving license as well. When our paternal uncle bought a Maruti, she was keen on learning. He agreed to give her driving lessons at 4am only. She arrived dot on the appointed time daily and swiftly picking up the nuances of driving, happily ferried everyone around. As my little sister enters her golden years, nostalgia engulfs me as I recall numerous anecdotes of our shared childhood. As we moved on in life – career, matrimony, maternity — the storehouse of our memories give us solace and brings a smile. The prevailing pandemic has put restrictions on physical movement but emotions are boundless. Here’s wishing you dear sister loads of happiness and prosperity. May your golden years be as enriching and fulfilling as your tender ones. My callow girl transitions to a mellow woman.

20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Retirement is truly a new beginning||The thing about retirement is its inevitability. What is not as certain is the nature of the second act or second innings, as some like to call post retirement lives.Some retirees live life anew, with renewed fire and enthusiasm, with passions aflame for new pastures and newer endeavours. Their age does not really matter to them, what matters is the pizzazz, the verve, the nerve!The bold retiree of today will thus not allow himself or herself to sit back and relax with a dozen newspapers, once breakfast is over. He or she will start up an enterprise or learn a new skill or even take up a practice such as law or teaching. He will be off to work at 9 o’clock just as he used to forever.There are of course those who have slogged so hard in their careers that they just want to hang up their boots and ‘chill’ in the sun or shade as the case may be. They are quite content to bask in the glory of their halcyon days and cuddle their grandchildren, whenever the latter choose to arrive.Both sorts of human beings who enter the portals of the retirement zone are entitled to their own perspective, of course. There is no universal answer to life’s choices. I know of a dozen retired government officers and CEOs who have taken up new consulting assignments after the age of 60. Still others have gone on to launch companies which have prospered by benefiting from their class and experience. Mentoring youngsters has also become one of the main roles of retired officers, and with heartening results. The youth of today is truly befuddled by the varying forces of pulls, pressures and expectations, and can certainly do with some mentorship from vastly experienced individuals.There are also those who take up creative pursuits like singing, painting, photography or writing, which were hitherto out of bounds due to the busy nature of their careers. Many a retired government officer has today shed the straightjacketed mode to flower as a multifaceted human being, post retirement. Even the apparel, which such an officer sports, usually undergoes a metamorphosis. There is more colour, less formality and much more effervescence in his persona today, than when he was the secretary sahib, or whatever.Some find it tough to get back to driving a car, having had the benefit of being chauffeur driven for over three decades. Parking one’s vehicle in a busy city is an even bigger pain, more often than not!VK Kapoor, a former IPS officer, has proved to be a torchbearer of sorts for several retired officers who might otherwise have felt that they had been ‘pushed off a cliff’ on superannuating from service. He peps up ex-colleagues on a regular basis and counsels them not to live in the past, but to adopt new-fangled ways to keep themselves busy. Sarban Singh, a retired IAS officer, has taken to writing his memoirs with meticulous detail these days. His sunny disposition and musical bent of mind have always made him a popular colleague among officers. Today, retired officers like them continue to cheer up their brethren even when the going seems tough.Aditya Prakash, former chief architect of Chandigarh, once performed a mono-act at the Tagore Theatre, an iconic building, which he himself had designed. The title was ‘Zindagi retire nahin hoti’ or ‘Life does not retire’ and I found it a very apt viewing for all those who feel a little morose at having crossed a certain age, which means that their active career days are over. Life, after all, does not have a use-by date. Until one has to depart. A career professional from any realm of endeavour will ultimately call it a day. But with life expectancy and general health levels going up dramatically in modern times, a new career can well begin after retirement. The best part is that expectations are fewer and the chances of taking an afternoon off to spend with those cuddly grandchildren are pretty high.There is every reason to dive deep within and discover a new you!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-retirement-is-truly-a-new-beginning-101624136010949.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Kabir Bedi still in tune with the Punjabi within||It was while anchoring a session called ‘Punjabi by nature’ at the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) back in 2013 that I spotted Kabir Bedi sitting in the audience with his daughter Pooja. Among other things, there was a heated discussion on the pride of patriarchal society, including offensive Punjabi pop music. Listening to it all with a gentle smile, Kabir intervened, saying, “The Punjabi men may have a hard exterior, but actually they are quite soft hearted. To tell you the truth they are like teddy bears.”The remark brought back the general bonhomie and restored good humour. A few years earlier as wine flowed freely on the eve of the JLF, Kabir had quietly entered the lawn enclosure, as he was on the jury of that year’s literary prize, and a little high on Sula. I stood up and made a loud welcome speech. The actor who had wowed Europe and Hollywood as a star asked politely, “Was I?” When I said “nobody”, it was his turn to chuckle, obviously enjoying the improvisation, and say:“So, it was just like that!”Not quite just like thatWell, it was not really “just like that” for it was a short story penned by him in the Illustrated Weekly of India, edited by author Khushwant Singh, which had won a 14-year-old girl’s heart in the early sparkling 70s. Called ‘Ramblings on the Beach’, the story is about school races being held on the beach with students in brown uniforms lined up neatly in rows. It has been included in his recent memoirs.Witness to the race, he is more concerned by the girl who loses and writes: “In her eyes, I see shame. I see fear. I see despair at not knowing what to do next. I see the face of a child who has been bruised and humiliated. I see a soul that is being bruised and brutalised by comparison, by being forced to compete with the physically stronger on the beaches and playgrounds. In the classrooms, the same game will continue. She will be compared to the more intelligent, the ones with better memories and those who can write faster than her…I want to tell her that she is beautiful and sensitive, that this race does not matter, that it’s just a silly system that the grown-ups invented for their own reasons. I want to give her something to feel better. In my hand I have an orange. Impulsively, I reach forward, take the hand of this child and put the orange into it, “Take this,” I say. “It’s for coming second.”One does not know what the little girl’s reaction was to this act of empathy, but Kabir had found a forever fan in me as I was the hopeless failure in the playground as well as the classroom till then. But somewhere this story had given me a ray of hope and taught me to not wallow in inferiority.An eventful journeySo as one eagerly reads these tell-all memoirs of a long journey, starting with a scoop interview with the Beatles as a young reporter with the All India Radio, one of the odd jobs Kabir did through his St Stephen College years to support his college education, one moves easily through his Bombay advertising executive years to his theatre performances with Alyque Padamsee and onto the romance and subsequent marriage with yet another illuminated soul, Protima, the tall and dusky model, who shocked everyone with a streaking spree. Of course, she was to later find her real talent as a leading Odissi dancer of repute, trained by none other than Kelucharan Mohapatra. When I mentioned to a male friend that I was up most of the night reading Kabir’s stories and enjoying them every bit, pat comes the reply: “Kabir Bedi has always been lacking in intelligence and whatever little he had existed in his groin!” A harsh remark indeed but then intelligence is not all, he was never lacking in a generous soul that does a Punjabi proud.The second son of the idealistic couple Baba Bedi of Lahore and the British scholar Freda, who chose scholarship and philosophy as a way of life rather than wealth, Kabir sure had a stormy life. Married four times and father of three he saw pain, sorrow and the tragic death of his son Siddharth Bedi but took it all with hope and grace, bravely marrying Parveen Dusanj, the British-born Punjab girl, 28 years his junior, a day before he turned 70. In an interview with Preeti Gill of Majha House, Amritsar, he spoke proudly of his being a Punjabi by nature and thus most in tune with his fourth wife. Recalling his reading of Punjabi scriptures to his bhabhoji (paternal grandmother) for whom he had taken the trouble of learning Gurmukhi, he adds with conviction: “You can take a Punjabi out of Punjab but you can’t take Punjab out of a Punjabi!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-kabir-bedi-still-in-tune-with-the-punjabi-within-101624135651205.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Milkha Singh cremated with full state honours in Chandigarh||Jeev Milkha Singh could not hold back and burst into tears as the mortal remains of India’s legendary sprinter and his father, Milkha Singh, were consigned to flames at the Sector 25 crematorium on Saturday evening. The 49-year-old golfer, along with his sisters, Dr Mona and Sonia, and wife Kudrat huddled in grief as Milkha was cremated with full state honours. Milkha’s grandchildren Harjai, Amaan and Amaanat were also present along with other relatives, but his third daughter, Aleeza, could not make it from the US. Jeev performed the last rites of father Milkha, an Asian Games and Commonwealth Games champion, whose fourth place finish at the 1960 Rome Olympics remains a benchmark for Indian athletics. A police contingent accorded the legendary track and field athlete the guard of honour. The contingent reversed arms and sounded the last post in the honour of the sprinter, who was also given a gun salute. The funeral procession started from Milkha’s residence in Sector 8. His body was carried in a bedecked vehicle as fans paid their respects with a heavy heart en route to the cremation ground. The 91-year-old Olympian died on Friday night after battling Covid for a month, five days after his wife, Nirmal Kaur, 85, also succumbed to the virus. Jeev also penned an emotional post for his late parents on Instagram, saying, “The relationship between a child and their parents never changes. It doesn’t matter how old you get or where in the world you end up living or how much you have accomplished in life. The relationship remains simple, it’s one of unconditional love.” “As parents, you have been the strength and backbone of our family since as far as I can remember. Together, you have nurtured and supported each one of us with so much love and care, while somehow inspiring an entire nation to dream big and believe that anything is possible if you work hard and dedicate yourself,” Jeev added. Milkha was dressed in a black suit with a white shirt and his trademark maroon turban and tie, with a photograph of his late wife tucked in his hands as he lay on the pyre. “You have touched so many lives over the years and the impact you have made on this nation will long be remembered. Being around you has taught me how to be a better father, brother, husband and has made me into a more compassionate and empathetic human being. I love you with all of my heart mom and dad. It’s not going to be easy without you, but I know you’ll be up there, together, protecting us as you have been all our lives,” wrote Jeev. ALSO READ: Milkha Singh: Asia’s most dominant runner at his peakThe Punjab government had declared a one-day state mourning and a holiday as a mark of respect to the legend. Milkha was bid a tearful adieu in the presence of his family members and several dignitaries, including Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju, who also paid homage to Milkha at his house, Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Haryana sports minister Sandeep Singh.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, state sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh, health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and sports director DPS Kharbanda visited Milkha’s house and reached out to his son, Jeev, to share his grief. Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha, former Punjab cabinet minister Bikram Majithia and former Punjab education minister Dr Daljit Cheema were among others who also offered their condolences at Milkha’s residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/milkha-singh-cremated-with-full-state-honours-in-chandigarh-101624135471437.html

Spots prone to water accumulation have been identified and they are looking to divert the traffic to other routes. They are also seeking the municipal corporation’s help to repair the roads.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh said that they have identified 12 points– including Dholewal Road, Vishwakarma Chowk, Giaspura, Sherpur Chowk, Chandigarh Road, Samrala Chowk, Transport Nagar Cut, Shingar Cinema Road, Jalandhar Bypass, Gill road and Rahon Road which are worst-affected during rains.According to traffic police officials, faulty sewage covers are one of the main reasons behind the traffic mishaps during rainy days, as they are either above or below the level of roads or broken.“We have requested the MC to repair pit holes on roads and faulty sewage covers. We have also requested them to clean sewage lines using suction machines, so that there is no problem of water accumulation,” said the ACP.“The traffic police will serve the city no matter what the situation is.

If any district has active cases over 500, then suspend the corona curfew relaxations there immediately,” the chief minister said to the officers concerned. He also said the corona curfew relaxation hours would be increased from Monday across the state. The relaxation would be in force from am to 9pm (Monday to Friday). Earlier, it was allowed from 7am to 7pm.Apart from shops and markets, malls, restaurants and parks would reopen with Covid protocols on Monday, he said.Religious places, depending on the size of their premises, can have a maximum of 50 people at a time. Weddings will have a maximum of 50 people. Stadiums, gyms, clubs, and education institutions (for academics) will continue to stay closed. He reiterated that the night curfew will be from 9pm to 7am and weekend closure will be observed from Friday night (9pm) to Monday morning (7am). Among the state’s 75 districts, Lucknow has the highest number of active cases (370) at present and it is just 130 short of the 500-mark. Active cases refer to the number of patients under treatment. Meerut is next with 195 active cases. The state government had begun easing the corona curfew from June 1 in the districts where active Covid-19 cases dropped below 600. Gradually, all the districts introduced relaxations as and when the cases dropped below the 600-mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/upto-withdraw-corona-curfew-relaxations-in-districts-where-active-covid-19-cases-cross-500-101624134872567.html

After evaluating their medical condition, doctors will call the patients for physical consultation in OPDs from June 21 only if in-person examination is required,” said Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson, PGIMER.The physical OPDs will be resumed across PGIMER, including at the New OPD building, Advanced Eye Centre, Advanced Cardiac Centre, Advanced Paediatrics Centre, Drug De-Addiction and Treatment Centre, and Oral Health Care of Children and Elderly Centre.The hospital authorities are also working on making one floor of the operation theatres functional for elective surgeries that were suspended in April after sudden spike in Covid-19 infections.“Physical distancing among patients and attendants visiting the OPDs will be maintained. As overcrowding can lead to outbreak of Covid among this susceptible population, physical OPDs will be run through appointment system only and those walking in without one will not be entertained,” Dr Ashok said. The institute also requested the patients to ensure that they are accompanied by only one attendant. Meanwhile, PGIMER will continue to provide emergency outpatient services round the clock during the pandemic.

Her statement came a day after the Punjab government decided to appoint sons of two Congress MLAs as a police inspector and a naib tehsildar as a “special case”. The decision to appoint sons of two Congress MLAs Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey on the “compassionate” ground was taken in a cabinet meeting. Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa was appointed as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the state’s revenue department. Talking to reporters at Chaura village in Sanaur constituency in Patiala, Navjot Kaur Sidhu said no post should be given to anyone without merit, especially those who were already financially well off. Rather jobs could have been given to a sportsperson or ward of a freedom fighter, said the wife of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu. “I do not think that without passing any test you can join as a tehsildar or join the police,” she said. To a question on Navjot Singh Sidhu, she said the party has asked him to wait. “After their (party high command) decision comes, then he will take a decision that is in the interest of Punjab,” she added. He had even refused to join Kapil Sharma’s show and rejected a ₹10 crore contract for a cricket tournament, she said.

The DC said the administration had scaled up the vaccination drive as they intend to vaccinate another million people over the next two months. “The administration has a stock of 55,000 Covid vaccines and all eligible people should get the jab. As per experts, the third wave can be prevented by building herd immunity. This is possible only with speedy coverage of all beneficiaries,” he said. Sharma said people should not doubt the efficacy of either vaccine — Covishield or Covaxin — as they are both effective and safe. Meanwhile, MC councillor Mamta Ashu appealed to all councillors, sarpanches, and resident welfare committees to encourage people to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-jabs-cross-million-milestone-in-ludhiana-101624134691139.html

Since hitting the peak of 20 on May 20, the district’s casualties started declining, falling below 10 on May 24 and staying so ever since, until no death was reported on Saturday.While it was a milestone the district was awaiting after tiding over the devastating second wave, health authorities have warned that zero deaths don’t mean zero caution. Further, the easing of lockdown restrictions may also spur another spike in infections with increased public movement, as more people were streaming into public places like malls and markets.“With the decline in numbers, there also comes a greater need to strictly adhere to safety protocols so they continue to remain low. Vaccination is also crucial to check the severity of disease. Those still not inoculated should come forward,” said Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, adding that from June 21, anyone over the age of 18 could walk into any government facility offering vaccination and get registered on the spot for the jab. A similar drive will begin in Chandigarh on the same day.PGIMER Dr Jagat Ram also cautioned that not following Covid-appropriate behaviour will lead to a third wave as the pandemic was still not over.“The daily cases and deaths are coming down in the tricity as well as across the country. This is a positive sign, but if people don’t adhere to safety protocols, the third wave may arrive in six to eight weeks, with another surge in September. However, since vaccination is underway, and many people have developed antibodies after recovering from Covid, the magnitude of the third wave is expected to be low,” he added.“Also, all age groups will be equally vulnerable to getting infected in the third wave. Hospitals are advised to arrange oxygen supply and check functionality of life support systems, which will help control the death rate in the third wave,” Dr Ram said.Tricity’s cases drop to 55, three deadIn a new low since the second wave, the tricity logged only 55 Covid cases, a first since 50 cases on February 21, and three deaths, a number it had last recorded on April 12.Apart from Chandigarh’s 23 cases, lowest since February 21, 28 people were found positive in Mohali and four in Panchkula.Among those who died, two were from Chandigarh, a 91-year-old man from Sector 8 and a 52-year-old man from Manimajra, and one from Panchkula.Tricity’s active cases also dropped to 1,000 against the all-time high of 24,201 on May 12. A total of 489 people are still infected in Mohali, 396 in Chandigarh and 115 in Panchkula. The daily positivity rate also came down to less than 2% across the tricity – lowest in Panchkula at 0.5%.During the peak of the pandemic last month, tricity had clocked a record 2,612 cases on May 10 and 38 deaths on May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-covid-death-in-mohali-after-84-days-chandigarh-cases-down-to-lowest-in-120-days-101624134452771.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Brazen disregard for Covid protocols witnessed across protest sites in Ludhiana||Abandoning caution amid warnings of an impending third wave of coronavirus infections, political parties are mustering large gatherings to stage protests in different parts of the city. Party workers could be seen flouting all pandemic protocols with impunity. On Saturday alone, disregarding the ban on political gatherings, around 200-300 people gathered for protests called by the Aam Aadmi Party and Youth Akali Dal over different issues. Similarly, a large number of BJP workers had gathered outside the four MC zonal offices to protest against the water-sewer tariff on Thursday. Participants were seen huddling together without masks just four days after Covid relaxations were announced across the state. The district administration and police department were silent bystanders. As per reports, All India Institute of Medical Sciences chief Dr Randeep Guleria has said that a third wave of Covid infections is “inevitable” in India and is likely hit the country within the next six to eight weeks. Social activist Amandeep Singh Bains said strict action should be taken against politicians as their activities are likely to increase the state’s Covid count. “It seems the political parties have failed to learn anything from the deadly second wave of the pandemic. Politicians should not put residents’ lives at stake for their vested political interests,” said Bains. Meanwhile, leaders said limited gatherings had been arranged in light of the pandemic. YAD president, Parambans Singh Bunty Romana said, “We would have gathered a larger number of protesters if not for the pandemic.” AAP’s state joint secretary Aman Mohie said, “Raising our voice against the wrongdoings of the government is important and our protest was organised against the multi-crore post-matric scam, due to which the future of around two lakh students is at stake. A limited gathering was arranged with social distancing and the use of face masks.” Meanwhile, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “It is the responsibility of every citizen, more so of political leaders, to observe Covid appropriate behaviour. Police will take appropriate action.”YAD’s protest causes traffic snarls Heavy traffic jams were witnessed at Jagraon Bridge for around an hour as the traffic moved at snail’s pace after the YAD staged a protest against the state government. Despite deployment of police force, the leaders and workers parked their vehicles along the bridge, creating bottlenecks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/brazen-disregard-for-covid-protocols-witnessed-across-protest-sites-101624134332373.html

AAP leaders, including deputy leader of opposition Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, Manwinder Singh Giaspura,Dharminder Singh Fauji, and Amanchain Singh had been staging a hunger strike against the alleged multi-crore post-matric SC scholarship scam since June 15 at the Jalandhar bypass. Mann, who was in the city, chalked up the release of the arrears to the AAP leaders’ hunger strike. “Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should immediately dismiss minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot who embezzled ₹64 crore and jeopardised the future of Dalit students. If no action is taken against the corrupt minister, AAP will raise an agitation across the state.”The decision to release the funds indicates that only the Centre’s share is pending and the state government had dilly-dallied in releasing ₹200 crore to colleges, he said. “Now, that the Congress, SAD and BJP have been exposed thanks to their anti-people decisions, and multi-crore frauds committed by their leaders. People will choose AAP in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections,” added Mann.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/scholarship-scam-aap-will-continue-stir-till-dharamsot-is-expelled-says-mann-101624134030657.html

In an interaction with mediapersons outside the residence of legendary athlete Milkha Singh, who died of post-Covid complications in Chandigarh, the CM said those who made sacrifices for the nation should never be forgotten. “Their families deserve to be compensated for the loss,” he added. Taking a dig at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which have criticised the government’s move, he said if these parties provide names of any youth whose father or grandfather made similar sacrifice, they will also be provided jobs in the state government. “In fact, I tried to find such persons in these parties but could not,” he remarked.“Punjab has been through tough times in the dark days of terrorism when 35,000 innocent lives were lost to senseless violence. As many as 1,700 police personnel had also died. It is not sufficient to pay tributes to these people at their memorials and the state needs to do something more to compensate their families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-defends-jobs-to-cong-mlas-sons-says-it-s-recognition-of-their-grandfathers-sacrifices-101624133971701.html

20-06-2021||Chandigarh||YAD hits out at Capt for providing jobs to sons of Cong MLAs in Ludhiana||Terming the Punjab Cabinet’s approval of jobs for the sons of two Congress MLAs — Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey —as ‘unconstitutional’, the Youth Akali Dal slammed the state government for backstabbing the youth of Punjab on Saturday. Taking a dig at the Captain Amarinder Singh-led state government, YAD president Parambans Singh Bunty Romana and other Akali leaders distributed sweets among the youth at Jagraon Bridge. They alleged that the CM had tweaked rules as a bribe to save his chair amid a feud in the Congress. Romana said, “The MLAs’ net worth is in crores as per the affidavits submitted during the 2017 vidhan sabha elections. The state government has overlooked thousands of unemployed youngsters, many of whom are on the brink of ending their lives thanks to the policies of the Congress government.” Pointing out incongruities in the appointment of Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa as a Group B inspector in the Punjab Police, and Bhisham Pandey as naib tehsildar, Romana said, “The jobs have been approved by the state cabinet on compassionate grounds in recognition of the sacrifices made by their grandfathers, who laid down their lives for the country. However, as per the rules set by the Supreme Court, the beneficiary in these cases should be a dependent person.” “The CM had himself written to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in 2014 saying that Bajwa’s father Satnam Singh did not die in a terrorist attack, but had died due to smugglers’ inter-gang rivalry in 1987.” “Even if the MLAs’ sons have been granted jobs on compassionate grounds, then why have the sons of farmers who have committed suicide during their tenure and the families of farmers who died during farmer agitation been ignored,” said Romana. “The Captain had promised to provide jobs to the youth during the last assembly elections but only three jobs have been provided so far. The first to former CM Beant Singh’s grandson Guriqbal Singh — who was made DSP in 2017 — and now to the sons of the MLAs. SAD and BSP will challenge this appointment in court and jobs will be terminated once our alliance comes to power in 2022,” said Romana, while urging the public to gherao the Congress leaders over the issue when they seek votes in the upcoming elections. During the protests, Covid norms were flouted as a large number of leaders gathered at the protest giving social distancing and masks a miss.AAP will terminate the jobs after coming to power: Mann In the city to protest against the alleged multi-crore post-matric SC scholarship scam, Aam Aadmi Party’s state president and MP Bhagwant Mann also slammed the state government for approving jobs for the sons of Congress MLAs. Mann said the AAP will terminate the services approved for the MLAs sons and the grandson of former CM Beant Singh. The jobs will be given to unemployed youth who are struggling to make ends meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yad-hits-out-at-capt-for-providing-jobs-to-sons-of-cong-mlas-in-ludhiana-101624133851074.html

They will not listen to our party-centric, ambitious talk of contesting elections alone,” said Thackerey, addressing the Sena’s 55th foundation day.The CM’s statement comes days after Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap said he was ready to contest the next year’s Mumbai civic polls without allying with the Sena. The Sena and Congress, along with the NCP, formed a government in Maharashtra after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party’s alliance with the BJP fell out in 2019.Thackeray also asserted that the Sena’s primary aim is not obtaining power and it would not compromise for that. “Sena will never become desperate for power and compromise for it.

20-06-2021||Lucknow||UP govt asks state’s power regulator to make changes in tariff structure||At a time when the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) was giving the final touches to its tariff order for 2021-22, the state government has directed it to make certain changes in the existing tariff structure. The government has also convened a meeting in this regard here on June 21, asking the power regulator to attend it.The move, according to people aware of the issue, may spark off a controversy with the UPERC, a quasi-judicial body, already feeling miffed with the government holding a meeting on the issue related to tariff revision which is supposed to be the regulator’s exclusive jurisdiction.The government has issued directions to the UPERC exercising its powers under Section 108 of the Electricity Act 2003 that empowers the state government to issue directions to the electricity regulator in matters of policy involving “the public interest”.The directions came through a letter written and signed by under-secretary, energy, Anand Kumar Tripathi on June 15. “I am directed to convey that a meeting has been convened under the chairmanship of additional chief secretary, energy, here on June 21 to discuss government directions to the UPERC under the section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 to discuss classification of sub-tariff slabs under the LMV-2 and the LMV-6 categories,” the letter says.The LMV-2 and the LMV-6 categories pertain to the power looms and the commercial consumers, respectively.Apart from the UPERC secretary, others who have been invited to the meeting are additional chief secretary, handloom development, the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) chairman and the UPPCL managing director. “The UPERC has taken exception to the government issuing directions to it under section 108, asking it not only to make changes in the tariff structure but also attend the meeting on the subject,” a commission official said, adding, “The UPERC may not send any of its official(s) to attend the meeting.”The date and timing of the government’s proposed meeting coincides with the date and timing of the State Advisory Committee’s (SAC) meeting called by the UPERC to discuss the annual revenue requirement (ARR) proposal before issuing the tariff order by June end. SAC member Awadhesh Kumar Verma said the additional chief secretary (energy), the UPPCL chairman/MD were among the SAC members. “They could have discussed the issue in the SAC meeting instead of convening a separate meeting the same day and thus avoided the unnecessary controversy,” he said. “The section 108 cannot be invoked for things like calling meetings,” he added.Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003, however, gives supremacy to the government when it comes to decide whether a matter on which it has issued directions to the regulator is of “public interest” or not. The clause 1 of section 108 says, “In the discharge of its functions, the State Commission shall be guided by such directions in matters of policy involving public interest as the state government may give to it in writing.”And the sub-clause of the same section adds, “If any question arises as to whether any such direction relates to a matter of policy involving public interest, the decision of the state government thereon shall be final.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-asks-state-s-power-regulator-to-make-changes-in-tariff-structure-101624133734267.html

As per medical experts, Mw decreases mortality in patients with severe sepsis and thus, the research was conducted to check its use among Covid patients.Researchers said that the Mw drug could potentially decrease cytokine storm in patients with Covid-19, and may thus be of effective use in decreasing mortality. It was also found that the severely infected Covid-19 patients, who were also suffering from co-morbidities, could be successfully managed without the need for mechanical ventilation.Also, no adverse events of the drug were observed. On the basis of preliminary findings, the institute will conduct larger trials in various institutes and will recommend the use of the Mw drug to other institutes for treating severely ill Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-pgimer-finds-use-of-leprosy-drug-effective-for-severely-ill-covid-patients-101624133673236.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Residents of Panchkula and around complain of erratic drinking water supply||At a time when mercury has touched 40 degrees, people living in Panchkula and adjoining villages have been complaining of erratic water supply since the beginning of June.SK Nayar, president of the Citizens Welfare Association (CWA), said: “First, the drinking water supply is quite irregular. The timings are from 4am to 9am, but at times water comes late and only for a few hours. And even when there is supply, the pressure is too low.”People living on the first and second floors are the worst sufferers, who are not able to fill their tanks. “People living on the ground floor are getting water but at very low pressure. However, those living on the first floor hardly get drinking water for about 15 to 30 minutes and those living on the second floor are totally deprived of the fresh drinking-water supply since the beginning of the month, when summer is at peak,” he said.Nayar said that he was receiving complaints from residents on the daily. They approached the authorities concerned, but the situation had only worsened, he added. “For the last two days, I have been getting complaints from people getting worms in their tap water in Sector 15,” he said.“In one of the pictures shared with me, a black thread-like creature was seen floating in drinking water. In another picture, the residents claimed a worm came out from the tap of the bathroom. This is a health hazard and residents should be cautious as the authorities are sitting silent,” Nayar said.Problem persists even in villagesA woman from Bhudanpur said that they had not been getting drinking water for the last many weeks and people had to walk a long distance to get some.When contacted, the official concerned did not revert.Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta said: “There was a problem in a few sectors as one of the motors was dysfunctional after the storm last week. But it was repaired and there is no such problem now.” He added, “When I went to Budhanpur and asked the people to tell me where exactly was the problem, They didn’t tell me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/residents-of-panchkula-and-around-complain-of-erratic-drinking-water-supply-101624133610741.html

The vehicles sped at 100km/hr and reached the airport within 15 minutes,” Jindal said. Motorists to be sensitised The traffic police will initiate a special drive in the city next week to sensitise people about the importance of providing passage to emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire brigades and police vehicles .The ACP said, “It has been observed that some people do not give way to emergency vehicles, which causes delay in reaching the destination for rescue proceedings.

People can doubt whether the inquiry will be accurate or not,” said Rawat.The former CM added that he asked for a judicial inquiry as it will be more credible. “I am not against the special investigation team (SIT) but it is a question of public perception. People have more faith in the court. In this year’s Kumbh mela, people from all over the world came to Haridwar. In such a situation, it would be better if a trusted investigative agency probes the matter.”Trivendra Singh Rawat’s statement comes days after chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat alleged that the fake testing case did not happen during his tenure. “I came in March and this is an old issue. When we got information about this, we immediately instituted an inquiry... Strict action will be taken against the guilty,” he said on June 17.On the same day, the former CM had called the case “a serious crime, not negligence”, and sought an investigation.Tirath Singh Rawat replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat in March this year, weeks before the mega holy event was to kick off in Haridwar. One of the CM’s first decisions was to approve a full-scale Kumbh mela despite experts warning that social distancing and adequate testing will be impossible amid a raging second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/sit-not-enough-need-judicial-probe-trivendra-singh-rawat-101624133216389.html

We even missed our freshers.”As many as 13,856 students were admitted in various undergraduate and postgraduate courses for the 2020-21 academic session. From physical classes to fests, they have missed out on aspects of college life which students look forward to the most.PU had suspended entrance tests last year and admissions were conducted on merit basis. Even the counselling was conducted online.Anoop Raj Tiwari, 18, a native of Solan, Himachal Pradesh, said he is lucky as he got to visit the campus once during his admission last year, but he has not seen his department yet.Aditi Monga, 20, A first-year PG student from Bathinda, Punjab, said, “After getting admission, we were hoping that university opens soon. But, we are in second semester, now and I haven’t even met my classmates in person.”Students lamented not getting access to libraries and practical labs and also expresses disappointment over missing out on extra-curricular activities which are the most cherished aspects of college life for most.Anureet Kaur,19, who hails from Punjab’s Gurdaspur, said, “Due to lockdown, we missed the opportunity to experience campus life. We could not even meet our teachers and classmates in person.”Anureet recalled visiting the campus once when she was in school. “When we were in school, we had imagined the experiences which university life has to offer. But now, we are just opening our laptop and studying from PPTs,” she said.PU’s dean student welfare (DSW) SK Tomar, said, “Apart from curriculum learning, students missed out on the all-round exposure which they get on campus. Interactions with the professors and academia were missing. They also couldn’t meet students from other disciplines. We will try to compensate for the loss once the pandemic ends,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-freshers-lament-missing-out-on-campus-life-101624133430742.html

His wife, Nirmal Kaur, helped my wife with her arthritis and tended to the garden. Milkha would greet us very cordially and every morning a queue of poor people would form outside his house and he would try to help them all. He also had many admirers in the police and in the armed forces who would drop in to meet him. His son, Jeev Milkha Singh, threw the best parties in the city.”ALSO READ: Flying Sikh together with his sweetheart againMilkha was also close to his immediate neighbour Colonel SS Bedi (retd), who also passed away due to Covid in April this year. The Colonel’s wife, Vijay Bedi, was good friends with Milkha and his wife. “There was a couple’s kitty in which we used to participate and we have very fond memories of them. When my husband died, Milkha Singh and his wife offered to help me. I will miss them dearly,” she said.‘Was in the best of health’Milkha was an avid golfer and many residents of Sector 8 recalled running into him at the Chandigarh Golf Club. General secretary of the Sector 8 Resident Welfare Association, Captain GS Ghuman (retd) said, “We would regularly spot him at the Chandigarh Golf Club; he had only stopped coming a couple of months back. Milkha was in the best of health and after playing his shot, he would run towards the ball to play the next shot. He was also fond of going for walks in the sector. I would run into him at the park behind the Sector 8 dispensary. He was very proud of his health and often at the park he would tell me he didn’t take any medicines even after turning 90. We will miss his energy.”Local area councillor and senior deputy mayor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, who also lives in Sector 8, recalled that Milkha was active at the Central Club in Sector 9: “It’s a place for senior citizens to socialise and he would go there almost daily with his wife to play cards.

According to the police chief, anti-social elements and criminals can take advantage of such tags and threaten law and order.Keep record of sale of army uniformsThe commissioner of police also issued orders to the shopkeepers, who sell army print clothes and uniforms, to keep a record of their sales and the identity of the buyers under Section 144 of the CrPC. Anti-social elements can misuse the same and commit crime in the city, he said. He ordered the shopkeepers to keep pictures, copies of identity proof, and phone numbers of the buyers. He also asked them to keep a record of the stock and submit it at the concerned police stations. Ownership of second-hand vehiclesThe commissioner also ordered that the ownership of second-hand vehicles be transferred to the new buyers within 30 days of purchase.

Agrawal also banned the pasting of black films on windows of vehicles.Ban on modified auto carts Agrawal banned modified auto-carts, which are used to ferry goods, vegetables, fruits, and garbage. He said such vehicles are difficult to trace in case of mishaps or crimes as they don’t have number plates.

Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring appealed to Fateh Jung Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey not to accept these jobs for their sons.Later, in a tweet, the CM’s media adviser said,“’No question of rescinding #PunjabCabinet decision on jobs for sons of 2 @INCPunjab MLAs. It is just a small token of gratitude & compensation for the sacrifices of their families. It’s shameful that some people are giving political colour to this decision.’:@capt_amarinder.”“’I fail to see any reason for removing any officer in my govt under political pressure.

Ontario premier Doug Ford on Friday reshuffled his cabinet, with former finance minister Rod Phillips — who resigned from his post following a Caribbean vacation during the Covid-19 pandemic — returning as the new minister of long-term care.The reshuffle comes just under a year before next June’s provincial election.In the previous ministry, there was one Indo-Canadian - Sarkariya, who was the associate minister of small business and red tape reduction. Sarkariya has now been promoted to take over as president of the Treasury Board. He is the first turban-wearing Sikh cabinet minister in Ontario. “It is an honour to be sworn in as #Ontario’s President of the Treasury Board. I am dedicated to working hard with Premier @fordnation and my colleagues to support Ontarians as we continue to tackle the #COVID19 pandemic & work towards our recovery! ,” Sarkariya tweeted taking over the new role.Sarkaria’s parents immigrated from Punjab in the 1980s. Parm Gill, 47, took on the new portfolio of citizenship and multiculturalism. Gill was born in Moga, Punjab. He moved to Canada at a young age. “Thank you Premier @fordnation for this great honour and thank you to my community of Milton for allowing me to represent you each and every day as part of this Provincial Government,” he tweeted after his appointment.“Who would have thought a young boy who immigrated from India to Canada at a young age, raised by a single mother, would today be sworn in as minister of citizenship and multiculturalism for the province of Ontario,” Gill added. Nina Tangri was appointed associate minister of small business and red tape.“Excited to be sworn in as the associate minister of small business & red tape reduction. Thank you to Premier @fordnation for his confidence in me and to my family and staff for their continuous support,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-punjab-origin-politicians-join-cabinet-in-canada-s-ontario-province-101624132890603.html
20-06-2021||Chandigarh||Akalis, AAP mount attack on Amarinder govt over jobs to Cong MLAs’ sons||The opposition parties — Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — on Saturday took on the Capt Amarinder Singh-led government over the state cabinet’s approval to provide jobs to the sons of two Congress MLAs. The cabinet on Friday okayed the appointment of sons of ruling party legislators Fateh Jang Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey as inspector and naib tehsildar even as five cabinet ministers opposed the move. The SAD termed the move “open horse trading by Amarinder to save his chair” amid an intense infighting among the party leaders. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, party leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljeet Singh Cheema said the Punjab governor should take a note of the manner in which the cabinet legalised corruption by doling out jobs to wards of Congressmen on compassionate grounds even though they were not eligible for the same. “In case the governor does not take action in the matter, the President should take note of the unconstitutional appointments and dismiss the Amarinder Singh government immediately,” said the former ministers. Majithia said after coming to power, the SAD and its alliance partner Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) would quash all illegal appointments made on compassionate grounds and also register cases against those responsible for the wrongdoings. “Amarinder took an oath to provide jobs to each and every household. But jobs are being given to ‘crorepati’ Congressmen. Also, the son-in-law of cabinet minister Gurpreet Kangar was given out-of-turn appointment as an assistant excise and taxation officer (ETO),” said Majithia. ‘Cong govt’s anti-peopleface stands exposed’ Leader of opposition and AAP legislator Harpal Singh Cheema said the anti-people face of the Congress government has been exposed with the cabinet giving nod to the MLAs’ sons. In a press statement, Cheema said they condemn the decision as the beneficiaries’ families are well off. “Amarinder Singh’s ‘ghar-ghar rozgar’ has turned out to be ‘Congressiyan de ghar rozgar’. On the one hand, the wards of martyrs and common people are being humiliated in the name of job fairs, the sons of select Congress leaders are being appointed as inspector and naib tehsildar on the other,” he said. The Captain government circumvented the rules in 2017 by directly appointing former CM Beant Singh’s grandson as a DSP, he added. “The ETT-TET pass youths are sitting on dharnas for jobs. Also, contractual employees waiting for regularisation and fulfillment of other demands are cane-charged, beaten up and harassed,” said Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akalis-aap-mount-attack-on-amarinder-govt-over-jobs-to-cong-mlas-sons-101624132771037.html

He also called on chief minister Yogi Adityanath and claimed he would work in the party as a “karyakarta” (cadre). “I don’t want to say anything at the moment. In times to come, my work will speak,” Prasada said when asked about his likely role.There is a buzz that Prasada could be accommodated in either the Union council of ministers or the Yogi Adityanath ministry that has seven vacancies at the moment.A few spots in the UP legislative council are to be filled by July and Prasada could be one of the party picks, some BJP leaders suggested. However, some others feel that Prasada could get to contest the 2022 UP assembly polls when the party would look to capitalise on his Brahmin appeal. “It’s an either/or call. The final decision would be in the public domain shortly,” a BJP leader said. Prasada’s supporters arrived in large numbers at the state BJP office even as he appeared at ease in his new party. He met senior party functionaries, met media persons with the party’s state chief Swatantra Dev Singh, hailed the BJP leadership, profusely praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then chief minister Yogi Adityanath from whom he also took “ashirwad” (blessings).“Since I joined BJP, this is my first visit to UP, my home state, and hence I met party leaders, took ‘ashirwad’ from the chief minister,” he said, adding he would help strengthen the BJP even further.“There is great joy among my cadres, especially from the place I represent. My decision to switch to the BJP was done following public sentiments,” he said. Jitin Prasada, a two-time Congress MP had twice been defeated in the Modi wave, first in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and then in 2019 parliamentary polls, from Dhaurahra spread over Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur districts.“The BJP has a strong organisation, strong leadership and clear vision. Policies and their implementation are done with consensus and where cadres have the opportunity to aim higher,” he said. Prasada played down the role that his Brahmin Chetna Parishad would have now following his switch to the BJP. He had floated the Parishad while being in the Congress in 2020.“My Brahmin Chetna Parishad never had a political purpose and hence should not be seen as such,” he said when reminded of his previous attacks on BJP government over the perceived neglect of the key upper caste community. “I would help popularise all the schemes of the Yogi Adityanath government among the people,” he said. He said the BJP was the only true national party with a democratic set-up where any ordinary cadre can aspire to become the party’s top leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jitin-prasada-calls-on-yogi-says-he-will-serve-bjp-as-a-worker-101624132110796.html

The MLA has said the Rae Bareli police officials were reluctant registering FIR against him. The MLA confirmed that he had written the letter to the additional chief secretary (ACS), Home, on Saturday in connection with the harassment of one Kunwar Mohit Singh of Rae Bareli. He said he had asked the officials concerned to take cognizance of the victim’s complaint and register a criminal case against sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Singh for creating fake evidence after registering a fake criminal case against him. Sharing details, the complainant Kunwar Mohit Singh said the local officials of Rae Bareli district were reluctant in registering FIR against the sub-inspector even after he was found guilty in departmental enquiry conducted by an additional SP rank officer. He said the sub-inspector was recently transferred to Bareilly zone citing the same reason. He said the sub-inspector was a repeated offender as he was also a key accused in fake encounter of four youths in Badohi in which cops had claimed to gun down mafioso Dhananjay Singh on October 17, 1998 before he joined politics. He said the sub-inspector was even charge-sheeted in the matter and the case was pending in court. The complainant said the sub-inspector had registered the fake case of criminal breach of trust and fraud against him in December 2016 at the behest of a land mafia who wanted to grab his parental property. He said the sub-inspector had been harassing him for the past six years and helped the land mafia to get register several cases against him but every time he was given a clean chit on the basis of evidence. Rae Bareli superintendent of police (SP) Shlok Kumar said the sub-inspector had been relieved from Rae Bareli after he was transferred to Bareilly on June 4 on the same complaint of harassing the complainant by creating fake evidence against him in a case of criminal breach of trust and fraud. The SP said he was not aware whether or not the complainant had given any written complaint to register FIR against the sub-inspector. Another Rae Bareli police official confirmed receiving the complaint to register FIR against the sub-inspector and said senior officials had sought legal opinion in the matter. He said the senior officials were initially reluctant in registering an FIR against the sub-inspector citing his act as negligence and not a criminal offence. Sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Singh, however, denied all allegations and said that his investigation was based entirely on land revenue records made available to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-mla-writes-to-home-dept-for-fir-against-indicted-subinspector-101624131270039.html

The downward trend in new Covid-19 cases in the state continued on Saturday too, with the state recording 8,912 cases, which included Mumbai’s 676.Though Mumbai graduated to level one on the basis of the oxygen bed occupancy and positively rate, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has refused to ease restrictions, insisting that the situation would not be fully in control till the new cases reach to a minimum. Thane, too, adopted a similar cautious approach. Though it qualified for level one from level two, Thane has continued with restrictions, with malls, restaurants, gymnasiums, salons and wellness centres allowed to operate only at 50 % capacity. Jalgaon, Buldhana and Washim districts, which saw significant drop in positivity rate and bed occupancy also continued with the ongoing restrictions, instead of relaxing them further.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, opined that the restrictions should not be eased. “The districts may graduate to higher levels, but these are just parameters. The local administration is the best to assess the situation, or else we’ll slip down to a lethal third wave,” said Dr Salunkhe.Pune, which is in level 3, has imposed a weekend lockdown. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also hinted that those travelling out of Pune district will have to quarantine themselves for 15 days once they are back.Dr Amin Kaba, who practises in several private hospitals, said reopening at this stage would spell disaster. “We should learn from the first wave and understand that reopening at this stage will lead to surge in the cases. We need to open only when a substantial amount of people get vaccinated,” said Dr Kaba. There are 36 districts in Maharashtra, of which 25 are in level one, eight in level three and three (Kolhapur, Raigad and Ratnagiri) in level four. As per a state government notification issued earlier this month, level one means shops can operate at regular timings, restaurants, malls and theatres will be reopened and allowed to operate during regular timings with full capacity. Workplaces will be allowed to have 100% attendance and both marriages and funerals will not have restrictions on the number of attendees. However, the Maharashtra government is adopting a cautious approach and is reluctant about unfettered access. On Saturday, 234,379 tests were conducted in the state, while 10,373 recoveries were recorded. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 132,597, with Mumbai having the highest count of 18,788 patients, followed by Pune (18,108). The total number of Covid-19 recoveries from the outbreak has now reached 5,963,420, while the toll stands at 117,356, with Pune leading with 15,994 deaths.

The accused, Amit Agarwal, allegedly misused the position of honorary consultant of DRC for four years and cheated the governments of the two countries, the police said. DRC officials, through an email, requested FRRO to initiate appropriate action against Agarwal so that he does not cheat any person by misusing the said post. Police inspector Ravindra Katkar, on behalf of FRRO, recently filed a criminal complaint against Agarwal at Azad Maidan police station. Acting on the complaint, the FRRO in a preliminary inquiry, found a cognisable offense and registered a first information report (FIR) against Agarwal a few days ago. Katkar stated in the complaint that Kasongo Musenga, the first advocate for the DRC government in India, in an email dated May 21 to FRRO informed that the authority concerned of DRC government on September 27, 2017, had requested MEA to withdraw Agarwal’s appointment from the honorary consultant post. MEA approved the request on October 30, 2017. Following this, DRC’s advocate in India informed Agarwal about the withdrawal of his appointment on December 4, 2017, and also requested him to stop using the post with immediate effect. However, despite this, Agarwal kept on misusing the post and allegedly enjoyed many privileges and took direct and indirect benefits by attending government and social functions and contacting organisations under the state and Central governments, the FRRO officer stated in the complaint. “Agarwal has been booked under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code. The investigators may soon summon him for questioning,” said an officer from Azad Maidan police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-man-booked-for-cheating-mea-congo-government-101624130189977.html

During the speech, he said his party would not get dragged behind anybody for power. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole had recently said that the party will fight the local bodies and Assembly polls on its own. He has also said that if his party leadership opted to, he does not mind becoming the CM face in the next Assembly polls. Sena leader Sanjay Raut had reacted sharply to it. He said that in such a scenario, Sena and NCP would have to join hands in the interest of people. CM said parties should come together during the pandemic by keeping differences aside. Amid this backdrop, all eyes were set on CM’s speech.Thackeray also took indirect pot shots at BJP leaders, including former CM and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. He said that some people have become desperate for power and cannot survive without it. “They have been suffering from stomach ache and keep dreaming about power. I don’t care about them and can treat them politically, if need be. After 55 years of existence, we have learnt to read them and their minds thoroughly. We also saw the distortion and disfigurement of the politics. They keep defaming us by spreading lies about us, but they should first check their mirror image to see if they are clean,” he said, hinting at BJP.CM said Sena has its own stand but its primary aim is not obtaining power. “Sena will never become desperate for power and compromise for it. We’ll not play second fiddle to anybody for the sake of power. We’ll tread our path strongly with self-esteem and pride. That’s the strength of our party and that’s the reason why it has survived for 55 years,” he said.He attacked the Congress without naming it. CM said that even Sena can declare to go solo, but people will not approve of it at this difficult time of the pandemic. “This is not the time to run behind power and judge political might. People are also facing financial crisis. If we talk about claiming power, they will ask us to speak about their livelihood. We can get power by adjudging our political strength, but it’ll be of no use if people are left in the lurch,” he said.CM also justified the act of Shiv Saniks who had resorted clashed with BJP workers near the Sena Bhavan this week over the issue of the alleged Ram Janmabhoomi land scam. He said that it was the teachings of party founder (and his late father) Bal Thackeray to “treat detractors with tit-for-tat approach”. He lauded West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for putting up a strong and successful fight against BJP in the Assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-cm-snubs-ally-congress-says-won-t-play-second-fiddle-101624130070479.html
20-06-2021||Other||Mumbai housing society vax scam: BMC to seek details of vials from SII||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to write to Covishield vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII), seeking details of the vials used by the accused in the immunisation drive conducted at Hiranandani Heritage, Kandivli, on May 30. The civic body is trying to identify the supply chain of the vials through the batch number printed on them. The preliminary report submitted by BMC on Friday night has found the vaccination drive to be ‘unauthorised and illegal’.“We need to find out from where the accused got the vials. This can be tracked from the batch number printed on the surface of the bottles of the vials. We will write to SII seeking details about those vials that had been used in the immunisation drive,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani.The civic body stated that the investigation into the matter would continue. It is also coordinating with the police. “If the vials have been procured from outside the state, then we also have to verify how they were supplied in the city,” he added.Late on Friday, Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of R-South ward, submitted the preliminary report of the internal investigation to Kakani. Following this, BMC on Saturday issued an official statement saying that no legal protocols were followed in the immunisation drive. “There were several loopholes in the drive. Our investigation shows that none of the hospitals/vaccination centres signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the society to conduct the drive. In fact, the local health officer and ward office weren’t informed about it. The drive was completely illegal and is considered a criminal act. The police are already investigating the matter,” said Kakani.According to police sources, the residents had allegedly approached Rajesh Pandey, a former employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, to inquire about the vaccination drive at their residential complex. Pandey, then allegedly approached the mastermind, Mahendra Pratap Singh, 39, who got in touch with his aide, Sanjay Gupta, 29, and organised the vaccination drive.On May 7, BMC issued a circular stating the guidelines, according to which, it is mandatory to sign an MoU with the hospital before conducting vaccination drive in societies and corporate offices. Also, as per the rules, nodal officers, who would be responsible for registering the beneficiaries on the Co-WIN portal at the spot, should be present for the immunisation drive. However, no nodal officer was present during the vaccination drive at the society. “The drive was conducted without any device to register beneficiaries on the portal. The accused took the beneficiaries’ details, such as Aadhaar card number, on paper. No authorised doctor was present at the drive, which is a clear violation of BMC guidelines for vaccination drives at residential complexes,” said Kakani.Also, the vials for the vaccination were procured through illegal means. “The accused logged into the Co-WIN portal by forging details of employees of other hospitals to create vaccination certificates for the beneficiaries,” read the BMC statement.The incident came into the light after residents became suspicious as seven-eight days following the inoculation, they started getting vaccination certificates from three different hospitals and vaccination centres— Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline hospitals and the civic-run NESCO jumbo centre — that were not even involved in the drive. Out of the 390 beneficiaries who were administered with the first dose of Covishield, 120 received the vaccination certificates. Later, all these three vaccination centres denied their involvement in the immunisation drive. Kandivli police arrested five accused on Friday in connection to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-housing-society-vax-scam-bmc-to-seek-details-of-vials-from-sii-101624129829951.html
20-06-2021||Other||Mumbai society vax fraud: Hunt on for doctor who trained accused||Kandivli police are on the lookout for a doctor, who owns a nursing institute at Borivli, for allegedly training one of the men arrested in the Hiranandani Heritage society vaccination scam. The police had on Friday arrested five men for allegedly conducting an unauthorised vaccination camp at the society, located at Kandivli (West). One of the accused, Karim Ali, had revealed that the doctor had recruited him and other ward boys who had been working in the vaccination drive at hospitals and possessed the login IDs and passwords of the government portal for vaccine registration. According to the police, the doctor had asked Ali and others to approach societies and other organisations to conduct vaccination camps. After administering the vaccination, the accused used to feed the identification documents of the beneficiaries and print the certificates. “When we went to the institute owned by the doctor, we found it closed,” said a police officer.After the society members of Hiranandani Heritage approached the police reporting about the vaccination scam, Aditya College located at Saibaba Nagar, Borivli (West), also lodged a complaint about a similar unauthorised drive on their campus. According to a statement issued by the college, on June 3, a vaccination camp was organised by an event management company, allegedly managed by Rajesh Pandey, chief manager (sales) of Kokilaben Hospital. Pandey had assured the college that the camp will be supervised by the hospital. He also said that the event management firm will organise the camp and procure all the necessary permissions and complete legal formalities and the college management will only have to make the payment.The college decided to hold a vaccination camp for its students, staff and their family members as well as college trustees. However after the camp, when the management did not receive the certificates, they suspected foul play. They came across the vaccination scam at Hiranandani Heritage in the newspapers and approached Borivli police. Pandey had allegedly conducted the immunisation drive at Hiranandani Heritage too on May 30. He has now been suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-society-vax-fraud-hunt-on-for-doctor-who-trained-accused-101624129709983.html

He said in four years four lakh youth were appointed.It took the state government two years to wrap up the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers in government primary and upper primary schools across the state. The posts were advertised in December 2018 and the state government could complete the appointment only in December 2020, after a long-drawn legal battle in the high court and Supreme Court after candidates filed a lawsuit.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had distributed appointment letters to select recruits in October and December and even interacted with them while others received them from local MLAs, MPs and ministers in the Yogi government in their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/assistant-teachers-recruitment-merit-list-for-6000-vacant-posts-to-be-declared-on-june-26-101624129469899.html
20-06-2021||Mumbai||Fewer ICU, ventilator beds vacant in Mumbai||A steady decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai over the past two weeks has lifted the oxygen-bed availability to 82%. However, fewer intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator beds are vacant in comparison, at 45% and 36% respectively. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and experts have attributed this to the nature of infections in the devastating second wave, with critical patients taking longer to recover. The higher ICU and ventilator bed occupancy is behind the BMC’s decision to stick to its level-three unlock status, even though Mumbai now qualifies for level one. For any city to qualify for level one, it needs to have a positivity rate of less than 5% and oxygen-bed occupancy less than 25%. However, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Friday evening that Mumbai may continue to remain in level three. The civic body will take a call on easing restrictions in the city next week, authorities had said on Friday. As of Saturday morning, Mumbai has 9,007 of 10,933 oxygen beds vacant, but only 1,185 of 2,633 ICU beds and 527 of 1,450 ventilator beds vacant. When asked if the higher occupancy of ICU and ventilator beds is a matter of concern, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said on Friday night, “Even though the lower vacancy of ICU and ventilator beds is not a concerning factor at present, if restrictions are eased immediately, and cases increase rapidly, we don’t want to be in a difficult situation.” Experts have attributed the higher occupancy of ICU and ventilator beds to longer recovery time in critical patients who got infected during the second wave. Some Covid-19 patients who were admitted into critical care at the peak of the second wave, last month, remain on critical care still, experts said. Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care at Global Hospitals in Parel, said, “Early development of fibrosis, intensity of the infection in critical patients, and new strands of the virus are mainly responsible for critical patients needing medical care longer. In such patients, we are also seeing that the final outcome is not too good.” In such a scenario, increased caseload in the near future can prove challenging, according to experts. “It is important to identify infection in patients with lower immunity in the early stages. We are also identifying patients in whom severity of the virus has chances of rapidly increasing, and treating them accordingly,” Dr Chafle said. On Saturday, Mumbai reported 676 cases, corresponding to 33,136 tests conducted in Mumbai, with a daily positivity rate of 2%. The city also reported 13 deaths. There are 18,788 active cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fewer-icu-ventilator-beds-vacant-in-mumbai-101624127909869.html
20-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 impact: Mumbai’s poor have got poorer||A large-scale study in Mumbai’s M East Ward — one of the poorest in the financial capital — has found that the average income of its residents has decreased by as much as 47% due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The preliminary findings from the surveyed areas including Mankhurd, Govandi, Shivaji Nagar, Cheetah Camp, Trombay and Deonar, also revealed that unemployment increased from 7% to 12% and self-employed people like vendors, drivers, shop owners, and daily-wage earners were the hardest hit. At least 12.5% have not been able to find work even after economic activities resumed after the unlockdown last year.The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) surveyed 26,000 households in 26 bastis of M East ward, covering a total of 97,414 men, women and children to study the impact of the pandemic on health, education, livelihood, housing and education in what it refers to as the Community-Led Action Learning and Partnership (CLAP) project.TISS partnered with Tata Trusts and the Asian Development Bank to conduct the survey and the findings will be released in the first week of July.The findings from the livelihood part of the study, a copy of which Hindustan Times has seen, are in line with recent unemployment trends in the rest of the country: the national unemployment rate had reached a record high of 23.52% in April 2020 during the national lockdown. It improved to 6.52% in January 2021, in line with an economic recovery. But the second wave delivered another hit to the jobs market in April and May. The two months saw about 23 million job losses—both salaried and non-salaried, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data revealed. To put things in perspective, a 7.97% unemployment rate in April erased some 7.35 million jobs, including 3.4 million salaried jobs.In M East ward, where many who work in the informal sector reside, the average monthly income is ₹12,050, which is ₹1,400 less than the minimum wage (as set under the minimum wages act) in the city. “The impact of the loss of income was grave, with many people struggling to pay rents or buy basic medications for pre-existing ailments such as hypertension,” said Shubham Kothari, program manager for the CLAP project. “A lot of people we surveyed could not even afford to pay for the community toilets.” The survey was carried out between November 26, 2020, and January 14, 2021, through a detailed questionnaire on a mobile app. “The M East is structurally vulnerable ward and has been neglected for long,” said Amita Bhide, professor and dean, School of Habitat Studies at TISS. “The pandemic and the lockdown unravelled worst of its issues, and it prompted us to conduct this detailed survey.” “The pandemic has been a prolonged disaster for the communities in M East,” she said.“Our findings show that the pandemic resulted in nearly 30% increase in healthcare expenses,” said Avinash Madhale, programme coordinator of CLAP. “Many people were unwilling to seek medical help for their ailments, while some borrowed money for treatments. There is also a section of people who have suffered from adverse impacts due to delaying medical help or not seeking medical help at all,” he said, citing a case of a domestic worker from the ward who died because she could not afford to buy high blood pressure medication.The survey also aims at compiling a detailed database of people in the ward, mainly the most vulnerable ones. Such data can be helpful to implement aid-related projects and other programmes in a better way. For instance, the database of people from the survey came in handy for the Covid-19 vaccination drive. “We were able to give basti-wise lists to the civic authorities, our volunteers helped in transporting people to the centers and we even helped fighting vaccine hesitancy by recording video testimonies of people who have taken the vaccine,” said Madhale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-impact-mumbai-s-poor-have-got-poorer-101624127789821.html

The decision comes a day ahead of the national executive meeting called by the Paswan faction.With Paras as its president, all four other MPs figure in the executive – Chowdhary Mehbob Ali Kaiser and Veena Devi have been made the national vice-president while Chandan Singh and Prince Raj have been appointed as national general secretaries. In a letter, Paras said the other state committees and cells would be formed in due course.Later in the evening, Paswan met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to present his case against the decision to accept the claim of the other faction declaring Paras as the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha.“I told the Speaker why he needs to review the decision. Our party’s constitution says the central parliamentary board has to clear all decisions. I am sure the Speaker was not aware of this party constitutional requirement. He can give them the status of a separate party, but Paras cannot be appointed as the party chief in the Lok Sabha,” Paswan said after the meeting.Earlier this week, Paras and four other MPs ostensibly ousted Paswan from the posts of party president and leader of the party in the Lok Sabha.On Friday, Paswan told the EC that the rebels had no locus standi to make the decisions that they had. He asked that they be barred from using the party symbol. “Only nine members elected Paras as the president of the party,” he had said and demanded a ban on the use of the party’s symbol and flag.During the meeting with EC officials, while the Paswan faction submitted the names of 77 members, the Paras faction is yet to submit its list.People familiar with the matter said that the list of members of the party’s National Executive Committee on each side is going to be an important evidence for the EC. “Both factions are claiming support of majority but nobody knows the exact number,” said an LJP leader who asked not to be named||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/paras-declares-new-team-paswan-faction-to-meet-today-101624122990418.html
20-06-2021||Ranchi||Congress leadership won’t change in Jharkhand: Rameshwar Oraon||State Congress chief and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on Saturday ruled out possibilities of change in guard of the party in Jharkhand, saying that his recent meet with party leaders in the national capital was a “courtesy call”.Oraon has been stationed in New Delhi for past three days and has met senior Congress leaders, including K Venugopal, general secretary (organisation). Speaking to a news agency, Oraon said he met the senior leaders on account of his good relations with them.“It was a courtesy meet. If there is an agenda for a meeting, we will inform. If changing anyone makes the party stronger, then the high command can do it. I think there won’t be any change,” he said.The comment comes at a time when speculations were rife about a change of the party’s president in Jharkhand, on lines of some other states. A section of party workers has also been openly demanding that Oraon should make way for someone else, following the central leadership’s stated stance of “one person, one post” for the party workers.Oraon took charge of the faction-ridden Jharkhand unit of the party months before the Assembly elections in 2019 in the state. After the three-party alliance came to power, Oraon was also made the finance minister in the Hemant Soren government.After Oraon left for the national capital on Monday last, chief minister Hemant Soren also left for the city the same day, stoking speculations that the alliance parties could finalise filling the only vacant berth in the Hemant cabinet. Both JMM and Congress have staked claim to the position of 12th ministerial position in the state government.Though Oraon reiterated party’s claim to the ministerial berth, he played down reports that it was on the agenda as of now. “We will demand the remaining berth in the Cabinet, but it’s the prerogative of the chief minister to do that as per the Constitution. This time, neither I nor the chief minister have come to Delhi for the 12th minister,” Oraon was quoted saying by the aforementioned news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/party-leadership-won-t-change-in-jharkhand-oraon-101624120890378.html

Arif (the elder brother), however, managed to escape after a fight,” said a police officer. Police said the accused even dug a tunnel to drag the four to the tank before burying them in two-foot-deep graves.“When the bodies were exhumed, they were in decomposed condition. Their hands were tied with ropes and mouths were taped. We also recovered the bottle in which they were offered drinks,” said the officer.Superintendent of police (Malda), Alok Rajoria, said: “We have arrested the accused. The involvement of the elder brother, who lodged the complaint, cannot be ruled out and he is also being interrogated.” “We have to verify a lot of things, including the motive, the role of the two brothers, why did the elder brother not inform the police earlier? Was there any involvement of a third person?”The neighbours said they had not seen the family for the last three to four months. “Asif told us that his parents had gone to Kolkata,” said Naushad Ali, a neighbour.Police said Asif needed a huge sum of money for his business and was forcing his family to transfer some properties in his name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-man-killed-4-of-his-family-buried-them-in-their-house-arrested-cops-101624106069509.html
