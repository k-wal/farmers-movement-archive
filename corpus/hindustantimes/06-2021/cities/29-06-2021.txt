29-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD slams Kejriwal, say poor will lose out on 200 units free power||After Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal promised free power in Punjab if his party wins the state polls, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said on Tuesday that far from giving any relief to the common man through subsidised power, the AAP would even do away with 200 units per month free power provided to the poor, including Dalits and backward classes, by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. Addressing a press conference, SAD senior leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema said the Delhi chief minister had admitted that the party’s promise of 300 units per billing cycle free power facility will only be applicable in case the consumption is less than 300 units. “This amounts to a cruel joke on Punjabis as a majority of them will not be eligible for any benefit. Instead, the poor and disadvantaged will lose out on the 200 units free power facility, which is applicable without any conditions,” they claimed. Accusing Kejriwal of trying to introduce a flop model that had already failed in Delhi, Majithia also presented power bills of Delhi consumers, which showed that they were charged ₹5.30 per unit for bills slightly above 200 units and not extended any benefit of subsidised power. The SAD leaders also castigated the Delhi CM for trying to lie his way out of the press conference by stating that farmers in Delhi were “probably” given free power when this was clearly not the case as they were charged astronomical fixed charges. “Similarly power tariff of shops and the domestic sector in Delhi, which constitutes the lion’s share of consumers, is extremely high, they said. Majithia said that the AAP leader was tom-tomming about ₹6,500 crore subsidised power facility extended in Delhi in six year forgetting that the free power facility extended to farmers in Punjab by Parkash Singh Badal had given them a benefit of ₹90,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-slams-kejriwal-say-poor-will-lose-out-on-200-units-free-power-101624990878651.html

Soon, the remaining farmers will be shifted there so that their land can be transferred to the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) that will begin work on this project,” said Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary Arvind Kumar who inspected the township on Tuesday. The administration said they have asked the remaining farmers to shift to the new township. “All farmers are cooperating and busy in shifting to the township. We will achieve the target as per deadline,” said Balram Singh additional district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar administration. Kumar also inspected Vivo’s manufacturing plant and HIG, LIG flat project in sector 22D located near the Formual-1 Buddh International Circuit along the 165-km Yamuna Expressway. Kumar was unhappy with cleanliness there. “We will clean the area and provide all basic amenities, including sewage connection, water supply, drainage and lift etc so that residents do not face any issues in living there,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2200-farmers-shifted-to-make-way-for-airport-project-yeida-101624990817534.html
29-06-2021||Noida||Vaccination suspended in GB Nagar for 2nd day||Noida Due to paucity of vaccines, the Gautam Budh Nagar health department will now resume vaccinations at its centres only on July 1 when the Uttar Pradesh government’s mass vaccination drive is expected to kick off and the district will look to vaccinate 40,000 people a day, said officials.The government had reduced vaccine supply to districts in view of this drive and forced the department to cancel Covishield vaccinations at government centres on Tuesday. Now this has been extended to Wednesday as well. Those who booked their slots for these two days will be accommodated next week, said officials. Six centres administered Covaxin on Tuesday but now even that was exhausted.Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said “We are now completely out of stock. So much so that we can’t even conduct the trial run of the near-to-home vaccination drive on Wednesday, which is crucial to the mega vaccination drive. The state headquarters has assured that we will get at least 100,000 vaccines before the drive kicks off in the district. It will cater our need for two days, and the remaining stock will be kept in reserve,” Ohri said.According to the CMO, the district had been getting 25,000 vaccines from the government daily for the last one week. “We did our best to inoculate as many eligible persons as possible with the available vaccines. But now, we are running out of vaccine stock. Many people, who had booked slots for the jab for Tuesday and Wednesday, will be vaccinated on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, i.e. July 5 and 6, subject to the availability of vaccines,” he said.Crowd but no vaccinesA large number of people, unaware of the suspension of the vaccination drive on Tuesday, reached vaccination booths. Many were domestic helps and they said they could not go back to work till they got at least one dose of the vaccine, as per rules by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs).Suniti Patra, a domestic help who works in Sector 27 returned disappointed from the Sector 30 district hospital, said. “It was a complete mess there. My friends and I failed to get vaccinated. We don’t know what to do to get entry into the residential complex. This will affect our work,” she said.Deboshree Laha, another domestic help who works in Sector 104, said, “I am helpless. There are many others like me, who have not yet taken the jab. Now, it depends on the housing complex management, whether they will allow us to work or not.”Federation of Noida RWAs (FONRWA) president Yogendra Sharma said that all RWAs and AOAs that had decided not to allow unvaccinated domestic helps inside from July 1, were asked to extend the deadline for a week. “What can these domestic helps do if vaccines are not available. I hope these residential complexes adapt a sympathetic approach towards them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccination-suspended-in-gb-nagar-for-2nd-day-101624990759857.html

I hope the administration does not cut the salary, if someone has not taken a vaccine due to genuine reasons.”The order is issued under various initiatives which the civic body is taking to promote vaccination.A corporator on condition of anonymity, said, “I don’t think such orders need to be issued. It may create panic among employees. Many were coming to municipal corporations even during the second wave and they may not have got time to go for vaccination. They will go and take the vaccine on their own. Why make them scared.”In April, PCMC had passed the same order after which 30 per cent of the employees got vaccinated. No salary cut was initiated after the first order.The second order, passed on Monday, had civic chief Rajesh Patil directing departmental heads to ensure every one completes both the doses of the vaccination before July 20.“Those who have not taken vaccines should enrol themselves and complete the vaccination. We are initiating this step to keep all employees safe,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcmc-order-for-all-employees-to-get-vaxed-before-july-20-or-face-salary-cut-draws-mixed-reactions-101624990758737.html

It was first active on the premises of the Aditya Multispecialty Hospital in Miraj, after which it was granted a permit to operate as a dedicated Covid hospital. Dr Mahesh Jadhav, currently in police custody, started operating the Covid centre under aegis of Apexcare, in agreement with the owners of Aditya hospital.Documents related to the facility after it shifted to an independent building on the Sangli-Miraj road, reveal a series of glaring lacunae.While the local health department official says that the permit application for a trauma centre is pending, advertising hoardings claiming that the Apexcare hospital is a 24-hour accident, trauma, and ICU hospital are on display. The facility has now been sealed.“After an oxygen leak happened at Aditya Hospital, the facility was shifted to its present location. At Aditya Hospital, it operated on the Bombay Nursing Act permit for that hospital, but later on, a separate permit was granted. During that procedure they had submitted a list of three intensivists, a resident medical officer, 21 medical officers, and 30 paramedical staff as employed at the hospital. If, over the period of time, the staff quit, positions needed to be refilled immediately. Moreover, if a staff shortage is reported, we issue orders for filling positions with private hospital doctors. A shortage was never reported by the hospital. The shortage was reported by victims and their families,” said Nitin Kapadnis, commissioner, Sangli, Miraj, Kupwad municipal corporation (SMKC).The police found 18 fina-year students working in the hospital and have recorded their statements along with nursing staff. There are 50 statements on record.The first serious complaint against the hospital came immediately after its inception in 2020 - relatives were neither allowed any contact with the patients nor were they given updates. In response, commissioner Kapadnis claims to have visited the facility on April 22, 2021. However, by the end of April, complaints of no doctors and absence of equipment started pouring in, according to Kapadnis.Commissioner Kapadnis made a second visit on May 2 and served a notice to the hospital for fulfilling requirements, but since the hospital refused to respond, the dedicated Covid hospital licence was cancelled on May 7.“When a district-level monitoring committee made visits to the hospital, four ventilators and 10 bipap machines were in place. On the third visit, the number of ventilators had reduced,” he said.A family from Pandharpur was among multiple families promised a ventilator bed for their relatives at Apexcare on April 27, 2021. The Maharashtra government’s health department spreadsheet for bed availability on April 27, and every day since, shows no ventilator beds available at the hospital. The same family from Pandharpur had four patients in the hospital - one allegedly on the ventilator. However, they were all charged the same amount as that of the ventilator patient.Meanwhile, complaints by the district-level bill audit teams against the hospital kept piling up. District collect Abhijeet Chaudhury then issued orders for a case to be registered against Dr Mahesh Jadhav.“If the doctor had treated and given wrong treatment, then it could at least be a case of medical negligence. Here, the case is of not providing treatment after charging money for the treatment. The ones present in the hospital were a Munna Bhai-kind of BHMS final year students who were drawing a salary from the hospital,” said senior police inspector Shashikant Chavan of Gandhi chowk police station, who is investigating the case.The SMKC officials have launched a parallel enquiry for verification of the names which were provided by the hospital as trained medical staff while applying for a permit under Bombay Nursing Act.Dr Sunil Amboli, head of health department of SMKC which granted the Nursing Act permit, is woefully unaware of the details of the hospital.The case continues to get murkier as one starts wondering what happened to the four ventilators which were allegedly seen by the district monitoring team, but were not found by the police when the hospital was sealed. The local government is also checking if there are records for structural, fire, and electric audit of the hospital which are mandatory for inception of a dedicated Covid hospital, according to Kapadnis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/layer-upon-layer-of-lacunae-clouds-probe-into-apexcare-s-status-as-dedicated-covid-hospital-101624990759295.html
29-06-2021||Other||Admission into Apexcare hospital is a tale of going from hope to despair||PUNE The story of horrors at Apexcare hospital has only now started coming to light. However, complaints had begun in the Covid first wave itself, in 2020. A particularly harrowing story is that of a farmer whose family claims that his oxygen levels were shown to be in 60s, even when the oximeter showed it to be in 90s.A small concrete room, surrounded by endless agriculture fields is the home house fora family of three - Bhimrao Khatave (55), his wife Sangita (45), and their daughter Snehal (21); until Covid-19 claimed Bhimrao’s life, or so the family was told by the Apexcare Covid hospital, where he breathed his last. These events unfolded in October 2020.The Khatave family sold gold jewellery, two cows, and borrowed money from relatives in to pay the bill at the hospital after the 55-year-old spent 22 days there. Thefamily paid ₹3,50,000 for treatment and did not have any more left when the hospital staff allegedly asked for ₹40,000 more, according to Sangita.Snehal, a final-year Arts student, is soft-spoken and determined to find a job after graduation. However, she refuses to consider nursing. “I saw how nurses treat people. I had never been to a hospital before. I do not wish to be in that kind of system,” she said, remembering the alleged arguments with the hospital staff while her father lay dead.The uncle of Dr Mahesh Jadhav (36), the brother of Dr Madan Jadhav, who owns the hospital, was reminiscing days of pride that he Jadhav family enjoyed due he brothers’ achievements.“They are both highly qualified and never should have lived in a small town. While Mahesh trained for plastic surgery in Aurangabad, Madan trained at KEM, Mumbai. Their father passed away and their mother is too unwell to be here,” said Rajendra Jadhav (57), paternal uncle of the Jadhav siblings.One would think that the emotional, mental, and physical effects of the alleged misdeeds at the hospital were felt only by patients in Miraj; but the list of victims mentions people from other towns, including Pandharpur and Sangola.SANGOLASaurabh Swamy (23), owner of a bakery and son of a home guard, is struggling to get an insurance claim for some ₹25,000 he spent on travel and treatment of his father Shashukant Swamy.“We took him to the hospital on May 2 around 8:30pm. The ambulance driver was asking for ₹14,000, but I could not pay him that much. I paid him ₹4,000. When we reached the hospital, they asked for ₹50,000 deposit but I could only pay ₹10,000. By 3:40pm, they had told us that he was on bipap machine, even though they had promised a ventilator. Then he passed away. They kept on asking us toclear the remaining bill,” said Saurabh Swamy.When Swamy came to Miraj police station to record his statement, he came across other people from nearby villages who were suggested the name of the hospital by either ambulance drivers or private doctors.“I met at least four other families who were from the same village and had lost their relative in the same hospital. I even found a person who was informed about the hospital by the same ambulance driver who had told my family about Apexcare,” said Swamy.We spoke to at least two other families from Sangola and Bhose village areas of Solapur, who lost their patient at Apexcare and none of them were provided with a printed bill to explain the charges.PANDHARPUR At the peak of the second wave, four people from one family in Dnyaneshwar nagar in Pandharpur were struggling to get a hospital bed in their hometown. Ghule family had four members showing symptoms and eventually testing positive in the last week of April. To people in rural western Maharashtra, where beds were running out fast, the availability of a bed at Apexcare hospital seemed like a ray of hope.“We were struggling to find a bed in Pandharpur. So we contacted a private doctor, but even he had normal beds and our 60-year-old grandmother needed a ventilator. Three other people in the family were also positive and needed hospitalisation. The doctor told us that there is bed availability at Apexcare in Miraj, and Miraj being a hub of medical colleges and hospitals, we readily went there,” said a relative of the patient, Nihal Chougule (20).“They charged us ₹20,000 as deposit per person. We all got admitted on April 27 early morning. On May 1, our grandmother, Saraswati Aba Ghule (60), passed away and they asked us to pay ₹2,75,000 more. When we asked for details, they had charged the rest of us with same amount as that of our grandmother whom they claimed they had ventilated,” said Krishna Ghule (20) who was admitted with his younger brother Shubham (17) and mother Vaishali (36), at Apexcare Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/admission-into-apexcare-hospital-is-a-tale-of-going-from-hope-to-despair-101624990757571.html

These funds helped the civic body buy necessary equipment for civic hospitals. Before the pandemic none of the civic hospitals had any ventilators or ICU beds, or even an oxygen generation plant. However, the pandemic forced the civic body to enhance its hospitals with all essential medical equipment. As of June 27, 10 civic hospitals have 214 ICU beds and 1,274 oxygen beds. Similarly none of the hospitals, including Naidu hospital which was the only infection control hospital in the state in March 2020, when the pandemic began, had an oxygen generation plant and had to completely rely on oxygen cylinders. As of Sunday, the 10 civic hospitals located across the city have got, or will receive, 15 oxygen generation plants. Of the 15 plants, four plants have been commissioned, work orders have been issued for eight plants and three are in the process of sanction. These 15 plants when put to use will generate 12,733 litres of oxygen per minute. Each hospital of these 10 will receive one plant each, except for major hospitals like Naidu hospital, Dalvi hospital, Baner (old), Baner (new) and Rajiv Gandhi hospital, will have two oxygen generation plants each. Except for the two oxygen generation plants at Rajiv Gandhi hospital which have been built completely on PMC funds, the rest of the construction has either been funded through CSR, the mayor’s fund or in collaboration with PMC and CSR. The addition of oxygen generation plants will make the hospital independent of oxygen cylinders and this will become a permanent addition to the hospital. The shortage of oxygen was felt during both the first and second wave of Covid-19, and so these plants will ensure that the same situation is not repeated if the anticipated third wave is harsher than the first two. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “During the pandemic, along with the administration, multiple organisations stepped forward to lend their support to the city. Through such contributions we could upgrade our civic hospitals. As of now all our major hospitals, including Dalvi maternity home, have oxygen generation plants. These plants will help the city even after the pandemic ends.”Med Asia has donated ₹1.5 crore worth of medical equipment to BJ Medical college and Sassoon general hospital. The equipment includes ventilators, oxygen concentrators, rapid antigen kits, PPE kits and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/csr-funds-ensure-oxygen-supply-at-pmc-hospitals-ready-for-third-wave-101624990758147.html

The district had also participated in a state-level survey earlier this month. Districtwise results of all surveys are yet to be released This was also the first such serosurvey after the second wave of Covid-19 ravaged the country in April and May. Experts had previously said that they expect the antibody levels to be higher as cases were more widespread in the second wave.Ten teams of 10 people each from the ICMR’s National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) and the district health department collected the samples at random, officials said.“While 400 samples were collected from the general population, 100 samples were collected from health care workers at the district hospital in Sector 30. The samples will be sent to ICMR to test them for the presence of antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, district chief medical officer.As per Dr Amit Kumar, nodal officer from the district health department for the sample collection, the collections centred around 10 areas - Acheja, Bisahda, Nagla Nainsukh, Sarakpur, Ronija, Neemka, Sahjahanpur, Dankaur, Kherli Hafizpur and Balwant Vihar Chipiyana. Around 40 samples were collected from each area, he said.“Of the 400 people sampled from the general populace, 40 (four from each area) were from children between six and nine years, 80 (eight from each area) from children between nine and 17 years, and 280 (28 from each area) from adults (14 men and women),” said Dr Kumar.Dr Shalini Singh, director, ICMR-NICPR, said, “The survey will give us a clue on the presence of antibodies among children as well as adults and health care workers. It will tell us about the trend of spread and presence of the infection in the community and health-care workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-500-samples-collected-for-icmr-s-sero-survey-101624990699230.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Eye on Punjab polls, Kejriwal promises 300 free electricity units, 24-hour supply||Ahead of assembly elections in Punjab early next year, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday promised 300 units of free electricity for each household in the state and waiver of their pending bills if his party wins the state polls. Kejriwal, whose party is the principal opposition in Punjab, also assured restoration of electricity supply to domestic category consumers whose connections have been snapped due to arrears and round-the-clock power supply in the state. “With 300 units of free power to each household, 77-80% families in Punjab will get zero bill. They will get 24-hour power but no bill,” he said at a press meet at the Chandigarh Press Club. The AAP chief said power in Punjab is the costliest in the country despite it being a producer state that is surplus. “We do not produce power in Delhi and buy from other states and still supply at almost the cheapest rates,” he said, blaming the “dirty nexus” between the state government and the (private) power companies for expensive power in Punjab. “If this nexus is ended and things are set right in power companies, we can ensure cheaper power,” he added. Kejriwal was accompanied by state AAP president Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema, Punjab affairs in-charge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh and AAP spokesperson and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha, besides former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Kejriwal’s guarantee, not Capt’s promisesThe Delhi CM said these are his guarantees, not Capt’s (Amarinder Singh) promises. “As soon as the AAP government is formed in the state, we will ensure free power and write off all pending bills of consumers of domestic supply category with the first stroke of pen. The 24-hour supply will require strengthening of the distribution network and may take three to four years,” Kejriwal declared before responding to questions. Asked about his free power promise, he said that it is for domestic consumers with consumption of up to 300 units. If power consumption exceeds 300 units, the consumer will have to pay the bill, he said. The party, in a press release later, clarified that all the existing beneficiary categories such as SCs and BPL families, which were getting 200 free units, will now get 300 free units and will be charged only for consumption over and above 300 units. “All other non-beneficiaries who do not receive any electricity benefits currently will get 300 units per month. If this category consumes more than 300 units per month, they will have to pay for the whole consumption,” it said. ‘Will replicate Delhi model’On freebie politics, Kejriwal said he was asked the same questions in Delhi six years ago, but his government has achieved this there. “In Delhi, people get free electricity and the government and power companies are in profit. We will do it in Punjab in the same way. Yeh jadoo hai hamein hi karna aata hai (Only the AAP knows how to make this possible). I have done my calculations before announcing power sops for Punjab residents,” he said. Slamming the mafias in Punjab, he said there is no dearth of money in the state, but it lacks a government with “acchi neeyat” (good intention). He also said farmers will continue to get electricity free and industry at the present rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/eye-on-punjab-polls-kejriwal-promises-300-free-electricity-units-24-hour-supply-101624990698081.html

Sinha, a former Union minister, on Tuesday arrived at UP Gate and met farmers’ leaders, including Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait. Sinha had left the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2018 and joined Mamata Banerjee’s TMC ahead of the this year’s assembly elections in West Bengal where his party returned to power with over 200 seats and the BJP winning less than 100. “As far as I know, the farmers’ leaders from the agitation went to West Bengal and they asked people to vote for anyone but the BJP. So, if they their role is same role in UP elections, it will have huge impact over the people as their agitation is standing strong. The government is helping corporate, and those I am indicating to, their net worth has increased despite Covid situation,” Sinha said at UP-Gate. “In our economy, the terms of trade are not in favour of farmers. So, the government should supplement the income of farmers. Its calculation should be taken up by some expert group either regularly or on annual basis. When I was with the same party when its government came to power in 2014, I wrote (to the government) on this. But they had no interest in it.” The farmers have camped at different borders of Delhi since November 26 last year and demanding repeal of three new farm laws and also for a new law on minimum support price (MSP). Since the decline in second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the farmers have regrouped and renewing their agitations at different borders of Delhi. “We will give ‘dose’ in upcoming elections, and we will go to Uttarakhand and UP as well. It is now easy for us since we have different ‘morchas’ (agitation points) set up at different borders. We will go from here and return back,” Tikait said. The UP BJP spokesperson could not be reached for comments. “People have seen how different opposition parties contested together in UP and lost ground. In West Bengal, the BJP secured more vote percentage than before and secured more seats than before. We also saw how other parties did not give a contested in West Bengal and this benefitted the TMC. So, the situation in UP are different and the BJP led government by chief minister Yogi Adityanath will come more strongly than before in 2022,” said Sunil Sharma, the BJP MLA from Sahibabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-agitation-can-have-huge-impact-in-up-elections-yashwant-sinha-101624990637535.html

This eco-friendly mode of transport will be for the common man as well as for tourists, to be used within city limits.The bikes, to be operated through a smart app embellished with a unique identification code for each of the bicycles, will be available for use on a rental basis. The app will allow a user to take the bike from a select PBS docking station for a fixed time and by paying the rental upfront.Once the use of the bicycle is over, it can be returned to the nearest docking station, mostly located near a bus stand, private taxi station or a railway station, which will enable the person to carry on with his/her journey further, officials said. However, no date has yet been given for the formal start of this facility.A vision of this proposed PBS system was presented before the Prayagraj Smart City Advisory Forum in a meeting held at Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) on Monday. CEO of Prayagraj Smart City Ltd Rajiv Ranjan presented details of the ongoing work and the proposed projects to be undertaken as part of the Smart City initiative in the city. The meeting was attended by mayor Abhilasha Gupta, MLA Allahabad North Harshvardhan Bajpai and Mission Manager of Smart City project SK Sinha, besides other members of the forum.“The bike share system allows people to borrow a bike from a dock and return it at another dock. Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place,” explained Ranjan.The idea is to connect residential localities with markets, etc, officials said. The plan is to have 75 docking stations across the city with 10 bikes each. In the first phase, 30 docking stations with 300 bicycles will be installed, while the remaining 45 stations with 450 bicycles will be installed gauging the success of Phase1, as also the acceptance of the project by citizens.Some of the sites identified for setting up the docking stations include Nagar Nigam Prayagraj, All Saints Cathedral, Girls High School and College, Hotel Harsh Ananda, Sardar Patel Marg, Hotel Allahabad Regency, PD Tandon Park, Chandra Shekhar Azad Park Gate number 3 and 6 besides Anand Bhawan and Allahabad University among others.Details of various projects like augmentation and upgradation of the existing streetlights, strengthening the ICCC system were also shared with the members. The members also gave their suggestions including installing tracking devices on the bikes of the proposed PBS system, undertaking a road-widening exercise keeping the traffic load in mind, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smart-city-prayagraj-bike-sharing-system-to-come-to-town-soon-101624990578252.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown relaxed: Shops can stay open till 9pm in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration has allowed all shops to remain open till 9pm. However, shopkeepers have to ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed by the workers and customers.The decision was taken during the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday. Last week, the market timings were extended till 8pm. While night curfew has been in force in the UT since April 6, lockdown was imposed on May 4. In the past few weeks, the administration has been easing the restrictions in view of the decline in the second wave of the pandemic. It was on May 24 that the administration had decided to open all non-essential shops. On May 31, salons and barber shops were allowed to open, while on June 8, restaurants and bars were allowed to offer dine-in services.During the meeting, Badnore also directed the director general of police to take strict action against those who violate Covid protocol, particularly for not wearing masks at Sukhna Lake and other public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-relaxed-shops-can-stay-open-till-9pm-in-chandigarh-101624990518159.html

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||15 children rescued from liquor bottling factory in Chandigarh||Fifteen minors, including eight girls, working at a liquor bottling plant at Chandigarh’s Industrial Area, Phase 1, were rescued in a raid on Tuesday. The joint raid was conducted by the district task force committee, childline, anti-human trafficking unit of Chandigarh Police and the NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan. After their medical examination, the rescued children — who are aged between 15 and 17 years and belong to Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and even as far as Tamil Nadu — have been shifted to the Snehalaya, where they will be kept in quarantine. The Industrial Area police have initiated the process to book the owners of the unit, Rock and Storm Bottlers Private Limited, and the contractor through whom the children were arranged under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act 2015 for exploitation of children and employing them under hazardous conditions. “The district administration has been continuously working towards non-tolerance towards child labour and this raid was aimed at ensuring the children are not deployed in hazardous industries,” said Mandip Singh Brar, deputy commissioner, Chandigarh. Harjit Singh Sandhu, subdivisional magistrate, central, said the children will be rehabilitated soon.A tip-off and two-week recceIt was during a counselling session that a juvenile recently apprehended for a crime had said that he was working in a liquor factory along with many other minors. “Recce was conducted for two weeks, and the raid was planned only after the information was found to be authentic,” said a senior official privy to the development. Sources said the factory is engaged in bottling and packing around half a dozen liquor brands. When the raid was conducted, the children were found branding and filling the bottles. “We suspect that there might be more children working in the plant,” said an officer, who did not wish to be named. Covid protocol given the go-byThe team that raided the factory found about 200 people, mostly women and youngsters, working there without wearing masks. The premises was quite congested and unhygienic. “The rescued girls have scars on their hands, which indicate they have come in direct contact with chemicals. Children cannot be deployed in hazardous factories,” said the officer. The SDM (central) said action will also be taken for the violation of Covid safety protocol. Wages, work hours being looked intoThe labour department is also looking into wages being paid and the amount of hours the children were made to work. During preliminary interaction, the children said they were paid ₹4,000-5,000 a month for working eight hours daily. According to officials, this is lower than the minimum wages fixed by the DC’s office. Meanwhile, the child welfare committee will be interacting with the children to establish since when and in what circumstances they have been working at the factory. The district authorities would also be investigating the child trafficking angle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/15-children-rescued-from-liquor-bottling-factory-in-chandigarh-101624990398363.html
29-06-2021||Other||‘Smart signages’ to guide tourists around heritage sites, ghats in Varanasi||Heritage sites, ghats and historical monuments in Varanasi will soon have ‘smart signages’ with Quick Response (QR) code as part of the ‘smart city’ project. These signages will apprise visitors or tourists about cultural importance of heritage sites and the 84 iconic ghats of the city which are known for their antiquity and marvel of architect, said an official of Varanasi Smart City Limited. “We are installing five types of signages, including name signage, information signage, map signage, sculptural signage and step signage with QR codes at these places under the project. The name signages have already been installed at several ghats,” said D Vasudevan, general manager of Varanasi Smart City Limited. “The project is worth ₹5 crore and the work of installing all types of signages will be completed by July end this year. All these signages are made of Corten steel which has long life,” said Vasudevan. A person or a tourist may know about complete history and heritage importance of any ghat by scanning the QR code on the name signage being installed at every ghat with its name. “For instance, if any tourist wants to know about Dashashwamedh ghat, he/she just needs to scan the QR code on the name signage. As soon as he scans the QR code all information will be before him on his mobile phone,” he said. Likewise, a map signage will be put up at tourist facility centre coming up near Dashashwamedh ghat. It will be a 3D map with a complete visualisation of the ghats. While sitting at tourist facility centre, the tourists will have an idea about the map of the ghats, Vasudevan said. Around 280 step signages with a line of poem are also being installed at several ghats while heritage siganges would be put up at 20 different ghats. Each of these signages will have information about cultural heritage of Kashi, he said. A sculpture signage each has to be installed at the Assi ghat and Khidkiya ghat that will have information about various events like Ganga Arti at Dashashwamedh ghat, annual Naag Nathaiyya event at Tulsi ghat, the official said. The tourists can also get information about methods of different rituals like ‘mundan sanskar’ and puja done at several ghats, including Dashashwamedh ghat and Shitla ghat, with help this signage. As many foreign tourists visit Manikarnika Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat where last rites of Hindus are performed, the smart signage would help them know traditional rituals of these gahts. Vasudevan said all the information about the ghats and heritage sites for this project has been compiled with the help of historians, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smart-signages-to-guide-tourists-around-heritage-sites-ghats-in-varanasi-101624990339643.html

As many as 200 such establishments in Noida were shut down in April.Following losses, they started using a residential property that was converted into a guest house for the operation from March,” said a senior police officer who requested anonymity.“We got a tip about the racket following which teams from the local police and anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) raided the building,” said the officer. Police said the arrested suspects include six men and two women managers of the guest house- including the alleged mastermind who the police identified by a single name Ramesh - and 10 customers who were from the Delhi-NCR region. “The rescued women, mostly from West Bengal and the north-east, used to work at the spa centre. The managers had forced the women, most of whom are from economically disadvantaged background, to work in the racket after the spa centre was shut. They were also threatened that they would be fired in case they refused,” said Vinod Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO), Sector 49 police station.They advertised about their operation on online portals and social media platforms, said the police, adding that they have seized account books, contraceptives, and cellphones used for bookings, among others during the raid.The suspects were booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 370A(2) and 34, and relevant Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956, sections by the Sector 49 police station.Earlier, the Sector 49 police had busted a prostitution ring on June 25, that was being run from a beauty parlour in Sector 73. Three women, who were forced to work there, were also rescued, while the owner had managed to escape. Efforts are being made to nab the female manager, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/prostitution-ring-busted-in-noida-residential-area-18-arrested-101624990338286.html

29-06-2021||Noida||Loni triple murder: Victim’s nephew arrested||Ghaziabad: A day after a 65-year-old cloth trader and his two sons were shot dead in their home in Loni town, the Ghaziabad police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old nephew of the trader in connection with the case. Police said that the suspect allegedly killed his uncle after he refused to give ₹10 lakh for starting a business. The suspect was identified as Mohammad Ayyub, who lives in the same locality. The fourth victim of the incident, 60-year-old wife of the trader, is still critical at a hospital in Noida, police said. On early Monday morning, Haji Raisuddin, the trader, and his two sons -- Azhar, 30, and Imran, 25 -- had been shot dead, while his wife, Fatima, had suffered critical gunshot wounds in the incident that had taken place in Toli Mohalla. According to police, Ayyub was forcing his uncle, Raisuddin, to provide the money for a scrap business. When the victim denied, the suspect gunned him down and later fired at the other victims to protect his identity. “On the night of the incident, Ayyub, as per plan, visited his uncle’s house at 9.45pm and said to him that he will stay for the night. He brought along a pistol and a magazine. When his uncle woke up around 2.30am, the suspect asked him for money, but he denied. This angered the suspect and he opened fire,” said Amit Pathak, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ghaziabad. Then the suspect tried to flee through the main door but he heard some noises of locals gathering outside. So, he decided to escape through the roofs of nearby houses, police said. “During interrogation, the suspect said that he started shooting at the victims one by one in order to protect his identity,” Pathak said. Police officials involved in the investigation said that after fleeing from the uncle’s house, the suspect threw his blood-stained shirt in one of the lanes of the locality and disposed of the pistol in a drain. They said that one of the buttons of the shirt broke off during the incident and was found at the crime spot. The officials further said that they also got clues from the CCTV footage in which the suspect was seen escaping while his identity was revealed to police by the trader’s daughter-in-law, Afsana, who was the only one who escaped unhurt in the house. “She said that she identified the suspect during the incident. The suspect said that he tried to fire at her, but the pistol malfunctioned. One live cartridge was also found which got ejected from the weapon during the process. The pistol and the blood-stained shirt were recovered,” said an officer attached to the investigation. “The suspect also told us that he was viewing some YouTube videos about fitting a silencer to the pistol. So, he was planning the incident for quite some time and finally gave way on Monday morning,” the officer added. Police had filed an FIR on Monday night against unknown persons under IPC sections 396 (dacoity with murder) and 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) at Loni police station.SSP Pathak said that the claims of robbery have been ruled out as alleged by the victims’ family members. The family members on Monday claimed that the suspects had also escaped with cash and jewellery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/loni-triple-murder-victim-s-nephew-arrested-101624990277571.html
29-06-2021||Noida||Noida sizzles at 43°C, heat wave to continue||At 43 degrees Celsius (°C), Noida experienced its second heat wave of the year on Tuesday, thanks to a delay in the monsoon, cloudless skies and unfavourable winds, said weather analysts. The trend is expected to continue for the next few days, they added.The temperature rose 2°C over the maximum temperature on Monday.According to the weather analysts the heat wave occurs when the maximum temperature is either 45°C and above, or is over 40°C and over 5°C of the seasons average. Tuesday’s maximum temperature was 6°C above average.The city had suffered its first heat wave on March 29 when the temperature was 40.5°C, which was 7°C above the seasonal average and also the first heat wave to be realised in March in 76 years. According to the weathermen the region may experience heat wave for the next two days due to extremely dry weather conditions.“The heat wave is due to several reasons, including the dry northwesterly winds (overcoming the moisture laden southwest monsoon winds), no clouds and no rains. There is no chance of any respite for another two days. There is a possibility of drizzle on July 2,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). “This is also the first heat wave in June since 2019. Last year there had been several instances of heat waves in May but not June. This year, due to a number of pre-monsoon showers, the region was saved from heat waves in May.”On Tuesday, the IMD recorded the minimum temperature for Noida at 28.8°C as against 28.6°C on Monday. At the IMD’s Safdarjung weather monitoring station, which is considered standard for the National Capital Region, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 43°C and 27.4°C, respectively.“There are high chances of heat wave in next 24 to 48 hours, then between July 2 and three comparatively cooler winds accompanied with light rains may bring the temperature down by four to five degrees Celsius ,” said Mahesh Palawat, Vice President, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sizzles-at-43-c-heat-wave-to-continue-101624990097490.html
29-06-2021||Gurugram||Measures to mitigate roadkills not yet taken despite several reminders: Wildlife officials||A day after a two-year-old female leopard was killed in a road accident, wildlife officials said that mitigation measures for wildlife have not been taken up on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road, despite several reminders. “In the past two years, around 10 reminders must have been sent to senior wildlife officials and Public Works Department to construct underpasses for wildlife or increase the number of rumble strips on stretches where there is wildlife movement, but we did not get any response,” a district wildlife official, who did not wish to be named, said. On Monday, a two-year-old female leopard was found dead on Pali-Surajkund Road near Gurugram with autopsy reports suggesting it could have been hit by a vehicle. This is the seventh such death of a leopard to be reported from this region since 2015. The stretch from where the leopard’s carcass was recovered is an ecologically sensitive area, as it is flanked by the Asola Bhati wildlife sanctuary on both sides. The official cited above said that on-ground signage has been installed, giving details about the movement of wildlife in the region. “Leopard is a big animal which is easily visible and its death becomes known. But smaller animals, such as monkeys, monitor lizards and snakes, also get killed in road accidents, which do not get noticed,” the official said. In 2017, the Wildlife Institute of India, in a study titled Mapping land use/landcover Patterns in Aravallis Haryana, with reference to the status of key wildlife species, states, “There is a need to identify road crossing zones for key wildlife species especially leopards to suggest mitigation measures. Radio-telemetry study will help in identifying critical leopard crossing zones.”The report states, “Highways passing through the wildlife habitats have adversely affected the fauna in these forests. Fast-moving vehicles kill these animals when they move across these road stretches. The Gurugram-Faridabad expressway is one such road in Aravallis.”Senior wildlife officials said that meetings are being held with departments concerned to construct underpasses for animals to reduce such incidents. “Signage asking motorists to slow down and informing of wildlife movement have been put up on the Faridabad road and near Manesar. Rumble strips have also been installed at different places to reduce the speed of vehicles. We have regularly been in touch with the Public Works Department and have asked them to prepare an estimate for the construction of an underpass in Faridabad. If we get an estimate, we can plan how to proceed with it, depending on funds available with us as part of a conservation plan or from other sources,” said MS Malik, the chief conservator of forest for Gurugram circle. He said that on National Highway-48 near Manesar, there are a few culverts that are choked with boulders and rocks, and that the area is being cleared and levelled for an animal underpass. A proposal regarding the same has been sent to the state forest department and the process is likely to take one year. Meanwhile, officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) in Gurugram said that they have not received any clear instructions from the wildlife officials on areas where an underpass can be constructed. Sandeep Singh, the executive engineer with the PWD who looks after the Gurugram-Faridabad Road, said, “So far, neither locations are identified where underpass can be made nor there is any clarity on the funding. We were requested to set up rumble strips, which have been set up at spots identified by the forest department.” Environmentalists from Gurugram have been demanding the construction of wildlife underpasses on the busy Gurugram-Faridabad highway, which passes through the ecologically sensitive Aravalli forest. Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist, said, “We have to understand that these roads pass through the wildlife habitat. So, measures need to be taken to ensure their safety. Rumble strips have been installed, but they do not necessarily reduce the speed of the vehicle. The number of speed breakers needs to be increased. Passages need to be made along with the installation of wires or other forms of barricading over the walls so that animals do not jump off on roads and get accustomed to using the passages.” “This is not the first such incident that has been reported from the region. These highways have been there for years and officials have still not taken any concrete action that reduces roadkill incidents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/measures-to-mitigate-roadkills-not-yet-taken-despite-several-reminders-wildlife-officials-101624990040542.html
29-06-2021||Gurugram||Waste recycling hubs to be opened in DLF Phase-1, Badshahpur||As part of efforts to reduce the load on the Bandhwari landfill, the municipal corporation and a non-governmental organisation (NGO) will start two waste recycling hubs, in DLF Phase-1 and Badshahpur forest corridor, on Thursday. Residents can dump segregated dry waste, such as e-waste, paper, solid plastics, soft plastics, multilayered plastic (MLP), glass and metal, for each of which separate bins are installed, officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said. The Badshahpur forest corridor facility is located on the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) in Sector 69 behind Tatvam Villas, while the other facility is located at the Sikandepur Pahadi, near Khushboo Chowk, in DLF Phase-1.Officials of the MCG said that the objective behind opening these two hubs is to process and recycle higher quantities of dry waste in a quicker time and also make it more accessible for residents. Further, the facilities are expected to decrease the load on the Bandhwari landfill.Currently, there is only one recycling facility, the Samadhaan Hub in Sector 43, where waste can be deposited for recycling and processing purposes. Anjali Khatri, a member of iamgurgaon, the NGO involved in the projects, said, “It was proving difficult for citizens across the city to commute to a solitary recycling facility. More such facilities (besides the two) will be set up so that there is easier access for residents to drop waste. Our main objective is to reduce the quantity of waste being carried to the Bandhwari waste plant, as well as, simultaneously, ensuring that the maximum amount of dry waste can be recycled and reused, or given to responsible recyclers for processing,” she said.The daily operations of the three facilities are primarily being managed by the NGO, with support from the MCG. The new facilities are funded by an IT solutions company. Khatri said that there are six main categories of waste collection at the three facilities, and the NGO is in the process of adding another category, expired and unused medicines, at these two hubs in the future. “The idea is to collect unused medicines that can be distributed to the underprivileged or NGOs in need of them while the expired medicines will be sent to biomedical waste collectors for further processing,” said Khatri.A collection point for expired medicines and unused medicines was set up at the Samadhaan Hub in October last year. “Any initiative that helps in reducing as well as recycling of waste is always supported by the MCG. We will be lending our support to this cause to ensure it is not only a success, but also that maximum number of residents are aware of its existence and make use of them,” said Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, one of the officials supervising this project.Dr Indu K Murthy, a principal research scientist working in the climate, environment and sustainability sector at the Center for Study of Science, Technology, and Policy (CSTEP), said that waste is an ever-increasing source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cities. “Not just landfills, but even the trucks used in transporting the waste contribute to GHG emissions. Improving waste management and introducing recycling hubs in cities will help save space, avoid pollution and reduce the carbon footprint. Recycling of waste will minimise environmental and climate impacts, and lead to substantial resource savings,” said Murthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/waste-recycling-hubs-to-be-opened-in-dlf-phase-1-badshahpur-101624990038722.html
29-06-2021||Gurugram||Efforts on to build heliport, aero museum in Gurugram||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who held a meeting with officials of the state civil aviation department and the Gurugram administration in the city on Tuesday, directed the officials to explore possibilities of developing a heliport and aero museum in the district at the proposed global city along the Dwarka Expressway.“There is no aero museum in India at present, and it will be a unique effort if one is built in Gurugram. Also, it will boost industrialisation and trade in Gurugram and its surrounding area if the heliport is built here. Efforts will also be made to build the heliport and aero museum on a public-private partnership (PPP),” said Chautala, who holds the portfolio of the civil aviation department.In a state budget presented in March 2021, the Haryana government announced that a new business district will be developed on land allocated for the global city project in Gurugram. It will come up on the land acquired by the Haryana State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation in Harsaru, Jharsa, Khandsa and Gadholi Khurd villages, which falls under sectors 36, 36B, 37 and 37B.“Work is being done to make Haryana a hub of industries in the field of aerospace and defence. For this, an aerospace and defence policy is being prepared... The state leads in the auto sector. Now, the target is to invite more industries by making the aerospace and defence policy, so that Haryana can become a hub in these sectors as well,” Chautala said in a statement issued by the Gurugram administration.Haryana will also see the opening of flying schools at four locations across the state. Tenders have been signed for running flying schools in Mahendragarh and Bhiwani on PPP basis. Now, the possibilities for running these schools in Karnal and Pinjore are also in the pipeline. The existing airstrips in Haryana will be revamped in addition to the establishment of an international aviation centre in Hisar.Chautala discussed improvement of Bachhod and Bhiwani airstrips near Narnaul in Mahendragarh.Lights will be installed on the runway of these airstrips, and taxi tracks will be made along with the runway, he said. Useful equipment will also be installed in terminal building and navigation. Similarly, the Bhiwani airstrip runway will be extended, and lights will be installed there. The airstrip will be improved by making a parallel taxi track.During the meeting, officials have also agreed to set up an additional hangar at Narnaul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/efforts-on-to-build-heliport-aero-museum-in-gurugram-101624990039284.html

Such colonies will be removed from the water billing system, according to an MCG release on Tuesday. The development comes amidst complaints of drinking water supply bills being distributed in illegal colonies, or those waiting to be taken over by the MCG.Ahuja issued these directions to the MCG officials during the first monthly meeting held with councillors at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Tuesday. They mainly discussed points related to the water supply, said officials, privy to the matter.A meeting will be held between MCG councillors and the commissioner over civic matters pertaining to the MCG, identifying problem areas, and coming up with possible solutions so that development work could be expedited, on last Tuesday of every month, Ahuja had issued an order earlier this month.Many councillors had raised issues over water bills with Ahuja, and he subsequently asked all the councillors to compile a list of such areas, so that those could be removed from the billing list altogether, said a senior MCG official who was present at the meeting.“The MCG commissioner (Ahuja) has also directed the MCG chief engineer, TL Sharma, to ask all executive engineers (XENs) to check unauthorised water connections and ensure that the water supply is metered,” said SS Rohilla, public relation officer (PRO), MCG.Ahuja also sought records of all water boosting stations build by the civic body in the past three years, along with the status report, to check whether those are functional or non-operational at the moment. According to the officials, Ahuja has directed Sharma to compile the list — details of which will be filled by respective XENs.The issue of cleaning weeds and dirt spread across vacant plots in the district was also discussed briefly during the meeting. On this, Ahuja has directed the officials of MCG’s horticulture wing to take action and spread pesticides wherever needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/colonies-with-unauthorised-drinking-water-supply-to-be-removed-from-billing-system-101624990037474.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Vehicular emissions in Mumbai double in five years, says study||The transport sector’s contribution to air pollution in the city has almost doubled in the last five years, reveals a new study by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), an initiative under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, which is under the Union ministry of earth sciences.The study, conducted over one year between 2019 and 2020, shows that vehicular emissions contributed 30.5% of all PM2.5 particles in Mumbai during the study period. This is up from 16% contributed by the same sector in 2016-17, as per a previous source apportionment study conducted by SAFAR.PM2.5 refers to small, ultrafine particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and travel throughout the body, causing health problems such as asthma, lung cancer and heart disease. PM2.5 is made up of hundreds of different chemicals and is emitted by a range of sources, from construction work to industrial smokestacks, power plants, open fires and automobiles. According to SAFAR, other prominent sources of PM2.5 in Mumbai include the industries and power sector, which contributed 18% of the city’s overall PM2.5 pollution load. Another 15% came from domestic sources - such as residential cooking practices in slums, burning of garbage, wood, cow dung and other cheap fuels.Windblown dust (referring to transboundary pollutants originating outside of the city) made up another 15% of PM2.5 pollutants, while the remaining 21.5% is estimated to have come from an amalgam of sources, including solid waste plants, brick kilns, crematoria, aviation and various miscellaneous activities.A similar source estimation for PM2.5 pollutants by SAFAR in 2016-17 had shown transport accounted for 16% of this distribution, while industry and power was the biggest contributor at 36%. Domestic sources of PM2.5 made up 27% of the inventory, while the share of windblown dust was 21%.Experts said this trend is indicative of the substantial threat posed by vehicles powered by conventional, non-renewable fuels like petrol and diesel. Such vehicles have exploded in number on city streets in the past decade. Gufran Beig, senior scientist and the founding project director of SAFAR, said, “This (trend) is a combination of both an increase in the number of vehicles in Mumbai and more stagnation at traffic junctions leading to congestion.”While all major Indian cities have witnessed a significant rise in the number of vehicles over the past decade, Beig pointed out that cities like Delhi have pushed for the adoption of compressed natural gas (CNG), in both public transport and private vehicles. “The uptake of clean fuel has been very less across Mumbai. The majority of the vehicles continue to be petrol and diesel,” he said.As per data with the Maharashtra transport department, Mumbai has already registered at least 40 lakh new vehicles, a threshold which it crossed earlier this year. Of these, 11.6 lakh are private cars and 24 lakh are two-wheelers. This is up from 30.69 lakh vehicles registered by 2016-17, and 20.28 lakh vehicles in 2011-12. A recent, state-wide economic survey estimated that there are roughly about 2,000 vehicles per kilometre of road in Mumbai. As the city gets more congested and more vehicles idle in traffic, the more emissions they generate.That automobiles are a significant threat to clean air in the city was highlighted as early as 1982, when the Indian Journal of Environmental Protection had published a study titled Level of Air Pollution in Bombay. “The urgent task is to reduce the number of cars and their movement in the city. It should not be difficult to provide an efficient public transport system,” the study said.Though Mumbai’s favourable position along the coastline helps in the quick dispersal of pollutants, experts have expressed concern over the SAFAR study’s findings. “We may soon approach a natural tipping point where environmental buffers will not make any difference to the overall pollution scenario. A sector-wise plan to tackle emissions at source is needed,” said Beig.Commenting on the preliminary results, Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, said, “Even though we have to see the exact numbers, the source apportionment analysis seems logical in identifying the transport sector as a rapidly growing source.” She also pointed out that the increase in vehicles coincides with a slowdown in the establishment of new industries and power plants around Mumbai, which is consistent with SAFAR’s findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vehicular-emissions-in-mumbai-double-in-five-years-says-study-101624989437488.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Civic dashboards for oxygen, Covid drugs to be functional soon, Maharashtra govt tells HC||The state government on Tuesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the dashboard on oxygen and anti-Covid drugs availability across civic bodies in Maharashtra would be operational from today, however, full access to the public would be after two weeks. The state also clarified that the dashboard would have a separate access window for the details from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which will be updated every three hours initially. Meanwhile, actor Sonu Sood has filed an intervention application in the public interest litigation (PIL) alleging improper Covid management, seeking to respond to the allegations made by the petitioners that he had procured Covid drugs unauthorisedly to address SOS calls on social media. The application is expected to be heard on June 30. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL seeking directions to the Centre, state and BMC to have better management of Covid-related issues was informed by the state that the issue of providing a statewide dashboard on availability of oxygen and Covid drugs was finally ready. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state said, “The issue of the statewide dashboard has been haunting us for long but today I would like to assure the court that it is finally ready. Work on merging the existing dashboards of the two municipal corporations is being done and the final dashboard will be available for public use in two weeks,” said Kumbhakoni. In earlier hearings, advocate Rajesh Inamdar for the petitioner Sneha Marjadi had informed the court that in the absence of any centralised system for providing information about the availability of oxygen, Covid drugs and other facilities for getting treatment for Covid and mucormycosis, patients and their relatives had to run from pillar to post and at times it was too late. Inamdar had submitted that the existing helplines in the various municipal jurisdictions across the state were not very helpful and hence the state should be directed to have a dashboard with the latest area-wise information of various Covid-related facilities. On Tuesday, Kumbhakoni submitted that the integrated dashboard for 32 municipal corporations, except BMC and PMC was ready and the software was adaptable and could be accessed even on smartphones. He assured the court that new features would be added to the dashboard as and when the need arose. “The updation time should ideally be real-time but initially it will be updated every three hours. Tracking of essential medicines like Amphotericin, Remdesivir and oxygen supply will be available within two weeks,” said Kumbhakoni and added that a copy of the action taken report would be supplied to the petitioner and the state Covid task force would be giving a presentation of the dashboard on July 1. ‘Had undertaken philanthropic work since lockdown last year’ Actor Sonu Sood in his intervention application through advocate Milan Desai informed the bench that he had undertaken philanthropic work ever since the lockdown had started last year and his work of providing food and jobs to those rendered jobless due to the lockdown had also secured him an award from the United Nations Development Programme. In light of these averments in his petition, Sood said that the allegations made against him by the petitioner of hoarding and procuring Covid-essential drugs were unsubstantiated and as the petitioner had failed to corroborate the allegations he wanted to apprise the court of the drugs and other Covid-related reliefs he provided to people in need. The court has allowed the intervention and will hear the actor on Wednesday, June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/civic-dashboards-for-oxygen-covid-drugs-to-be-functional-soon-maharashtra-govt-tells-hc-101624989377545.html

It is only created by none other than the media. We are all together in the party and all discussions go in the party forum, not in front of the media."Speaking to media persons, he further stressed that such issues will be discussed in the official party forum instead of media."If at all any issues need to be discussed, those issues will be discussed in the official party forum and not in front of the media," he said.Siddaramaiah also condemned the media reports and said that the tussle and confusion between the leaders was wholly created by the media and not by the leaders, despite there being "no such in Congress."From the last one month, several leaders from the Congress party initiated discussions over the chief ministerial candidates for the next assembly polls to be held in 2023. A loyalist of Siddaramaiah, Zameer Ahmed made a statement demanding Siddaramaiah for the post of Chief Minister. Following his suit, many other political leaders favoured his demand. Furthermore, a plethora of reactions came from the followers and loyalists of Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-infighting-in-congress-only-created-by-media-siddaramaiah-101624989014456.html

Narsalay, 47, a managing director with a multinational company (MNC), at the time, wondered how the poor could afford an ambulance service. In April, while he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19 and were home isolated, he thought about starting an ambulance service to patients anywhere in Navi Mumbai for merely ₹100. “While we were blessed to have a house and a comfortable atmosphere to be home isolated, I wondered about the less privileged. Many have been doing good work during the pandemic, and I wished to contribute too. The initial idea was to start a food service, but that would involve having a quality check daily.” Narsalay, after repaying all the loans, initiated to invest for the welfare of society. “Navi Mumbai has helped me grow professionally in many ways and it was time to repay the city,” he said. He purchased a Tata Winger for ₹16 lakh and completed the formalities. On Friday, he received all the documents for the ambulance service. “I haven’t received a call yet for service. No service request is also a good sign that the people now are not needing an ambulance,” he added. Around ₹40,000 is the estimated expense for the ambulance, which includes fuel and the salary for the chauffeur. The plan is to run the service from 10am to 10pm. “I am learning the whole process. Once established, I will think of getting another ambulance,” he added. His wife, Madhavi, 48, is an assistant professor of Sanskrit at Mumbai University, while his daughter Maitreyi, 21, has a startup. For ambulance service, people can call on 9820770021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambulance-service-at-100-in-navi-mumbai-101624989137483.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||HC fumes at state for seeking Centre’s approval for experimental home vaccination in Mumbai||The state health department on Tuesday filed an affidavit in the Bombay high court (HC) wherein it has proposed to start home vaccination for the severely ill and bed-ridden persons on an experimental basis, but with five mandatory conditions. The affidavit states that though a policy on the same is yet to be declared, it has formulated the plan based on suggestions of the state Covid task force and sent it to the state government for approval, which will then be sent for a nod from the Central government. The court then sought to know why it required the approval of the Centre when the issue of health was also on the state list in the Constitution.The affidavit was filed in the public interest litigation (PIL) which has sought door-to-door vaccination for those who cannot go to vaccination centres. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, was informed by the advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the Dr Dilip Narayan Patil, deputy director, State Family Welfare Bureau, Pune, had filed an affidavit illustrating the implementation of the home vaccination proposal on an experimental basis. The affidavit listed five conditions including home vaccination only for bedridden beneficiaries, a prior certificate from treating doctor to show beneficiary is truly immobile, doctor to certify the beneficiary not likely to have adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) and be ‘entirely responsible’ to provide appropriate treatment in case of AEFI as a requisite for the vaccination. The affidavit also added that a written consent from the family members was required and to avoid wastage of the vaccine there should be at least 10 beneficiaries in close proximity for the home vaccination to be carried out. The affidavit concluded that the proposed regime would be sent to the state government and thereafter to the Central government for approval before it was implemented. On June 22 the state had submitted draft guidelines prepared by the state Covid task force on implementing door-to-door vaccination and had sought a week to get it approved by the state government. The HC had observed that progress on the issue of formulating measures for elderly and specially-abled persons was in the right direction. However, after perusing the affidavit, the court questioned the state government on the diluted guidelines and sought to know why it required the approval of the Centre when the issue of health was also on the state list in the Constitution. The court further asked whether states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Kerela had obtained approvals from the centre before starting home vaccination initiatives in their respective states.Responding to the affidavit Kapadia submitted that private doctors would not issue prior certificates of home vaccination beneficiaries not having AEFI nor would they take responsibility for the same and hence insisted that such conditions should be left out from the guidelines. The bench then observed, “This affidavit dilutes the task force guidelines. Today’s affidavit again takes a back step. We had appreciated the draft guidelines framed by the task force. You will find a radical change. This is not what we expected from the state.” Thus saying the bench adjourned the hearing of the PIL on Wednesday, June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-fumes-at-state-for-seeking-centre-s-approval-for-experimental-home-vaccination-in-mumbai-101624989077521.html

Four other hospitals have also been selected for the trial.Covovax is the Indian version of the Covid-19 vaccine, originally developed by US-based Novavax Inc, that is being manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Results of the phase three trial have demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, and 90.4% overall efficacy.Confirming the development, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, said, “The clinical trial has started among adults above 18 years at the hospital as part of the national phase two and three clinical trials.” Deshmukh, however, refused to divulge any other information due to the non-disclosure rule of the hospital’s ethics committee that approved the trial.Around 80 volunteers above the age of 18 years will be part of the trial. As per the Clinical Trial Registry issued on June 29, a nationwide clinical trial will be conducted on 1,600 volunteers across 20 hospitals. Of this, five have been selected from Maharashtra. Other than KEM, the list includes Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur and three hospitals from Pune—Dr DY Patil Medical College, Noble Hospital and Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital.Two shots will be given to the volunteers. The second dose will be given on the 22nd day of taking the first jab. Also, the written consent has been taken from the participants.“All participants will be tested for Covid-19 to overrule any possible Covid-19 infection. This also includes testing them for antibodies. Individuals who have been vaccinated or earlier infected with novel coronavirus can’t take part in the trial,” said a senior officer from BMC.As reported, SII plans to apply for permission from the Drug Controller and General of India (DCGI) to conduct a clinical trial of the same among the paediatric population.Covovax is the second vaccine being made by Serum, the first being the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, produced in India by SII as ‘Covishield’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-kem-hospital-starts-clinical-trial-for-covovax-101624988897480.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination scam: Catch big fish, HC directs Mumbai Police||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Mumbai Police to catch the big fish behind the fake vaccination scam that has rocked the city and leftover 2,000 Mumbaikars affected. The HC, while observing that it was a failure of the state to prevent fake or unauthorised vaccination camps, asked the BMC to inform it on measures to provide proper vaccination to the affected persons and also verify whether they were vaccinated or not and what was administered to them in the camps.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai resident Siddharth Chandrashekhar, was informed that as the general public especially the elderly faced problems while booking vaccination slots on the Co-WIN portal, the court should pass appropriate directions to the authorities to initiate measures to address the issue. During the hearing of the petition, Chandrashekhar through advocate Anita Shekhar-Castellino had drawn the attention of the HC to news reports on fake vaccination camps being held in the city and sought strict action against the perpetrators. On its part, the Mumbai Police on June 24, had informed the court that over 2,000 people received fake Covid-19 jabs at nine private vaccination camps in Mumbai and five FIRs had been registered against the perpetrators who mostly operated in the western suburbs. On Tuesday, while responding to the directions of the HC in the June 24 hearing, the state and BMC filed affidavits on the progress of the investigation and measures being taken to avoid such cases in future. Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare for Mumbai Police through an investigation progress report informed that seven cases of fake vaccination camps were registered and 11 accused were taken into custody. The accused Dr Manish Tripathi had also surrendered to the police. “There has to be a meaningful and fair probe. Please tell the police officers that there could be big fishes, who are not investigated and none should be spared irrespective of any colour and probe should be proper. The lives of citizens are involved and the accused should be punished accordingly. They should be taught a lesson,” the bench directed the police. The court further observed that earnest attempts need to be made by the investigating officers and hope that the investigation would be completed at the earliest.Senior Counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC informed the bench that the civic authority was trying to ascertain what was injected in over 2,000 people by conducting an antibody test on them. He added that the victims could also get the test done themselves and come for vaccination. He, however, added that the issue of vaccination certificates given to the victims had to be checked with the central government. The bench was then informed that SOPs for holding vaccination camps for housing societies, commercial premises, educational institutions among others would be published by Wednesday. Castellino however pointed out that while the BMC SOPs spoke about measures to be taken to prevent further frauds, it did not address the issue of grievances of people affected by unauthorised vaccinations especially the concerns of victim students who have to travel for studies to foreign countries. The bench then directed BMC to file its response to the concerns raised by the petitioner and also directed the police to submit the further investigation progress report and posted hearing of the PIL to Thursday, July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-scam-catch-big-fish-hc-directs-mumbai-police-101624988839612.html

The firm approached the police after the employees did not receive the vaccination certificates. “We are awaiting the reply from BMC before registering the first information report (FI)R against the accused,” said Hanke. Hanke said that the complaint was being verified.The police are recording statements of the firm’s officers to find out who had approached them and collecting all the evidence against the accused.On Tuesday, one of the accused in a fake vaccination scam, Dr Manish Tripathi, was arrested by Kandivli police after the Dindoshi sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail plea. The vaccination scam came to light after Hiranandani Heritage society in Kandivli approached the police complaining they were duped by Mahendra Singh and four others who administered fake vaccines to their society members on May 30. The society members claimed they received the vaccination certificates, but they had names of different hospitals and different dates, but when the residents checked the Co-WIN portal, their status was shown as “yet to receive the first dose.” Six more cases have been filed at Versova, Borivli, Bangur Nagar and Khar police stations against the same group. So far, police have arrested eight accused and are on the lookout for two more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-scam-police-receive-one-more-complaint-of-a-suspected-fake-camp-101624988838970.html

29-06-2021||Lucknow||IIT-Kanpur, PGI Lucknow join hands to set up healthcare robotics CoE||Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, (IIT-K) has and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to advance innovation in accessible healthcare through indigenous solutions. Under the MoU, the institutes will set up a centre of excellence (CoE) in telemedicine and healthcare robotics to nurture smart healthcare with an overarching objective of strengthening healthcare system. The MoU signing ceremony, held on Monday, was attended by key members from both the institutes, including Prof RK Dhiman, director, SGPGIMS and prof Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT Kanpur.Addressing the gathering on the occasion, prof Karandikar said, “Through this initiative, two leading institutions of India will join hands to uphold their vision of a robust, indigenous healthcare system focused on promoting interdisciplinary innovation. The MoU is a timely step in the right direction to enable an exchange of ideas across engineering and medicine as professionals from IIT Kanpur will receive the opportunity to collaborate with specialised doctors at SGPGI, Lucknow.”IIT Kanpur and SGPGI Lucknow have agreed to establish an R&D set up for promoting telemedicine aided by ICT and 5G, and point-of-care testing and diagnostics. An integrated network of mobile health vans in rural areas and smart kiosks in urban locales will ensure last-mile connectivity to ascertain availability of emergency healthcare services. Prof RK Dhiman said, “We will jointly launch courses in various fields of digital health which is not available in any engineering and medical educational institutions in the country at the moment. Current corona pandemic has made telemedicine technology a very popular and useful tool to bridge the gap between care providers and citizens. So, there is a need to develop indigenous technology platform and systems in large scale which can be affordable and made available widely.”“This will promote entrepreneurship and develop a rural health system which can be deployed far and wide to strengthen the health system. The future holds the key for hybrid healthcare system for which the bond between engineering and medical discipline needs to be strengthened. In that context, the timing of handshake between two major institutions is appropriate which is going to yield immense benefit to the society,” he added.Role of IIT KanpurAny telemedicine system is about creating a network of expected beneficiaries and medical experts and integrating them in a digital platform. A cost-effective platform consisting of hardware sensors and IoT (internet of things) controller devices needs to be developed for collecting patient health data. The system has to be integrated with cloud servers and mobile apps. In this regard, the role of IIT Kanpur will include:• * Development of such portable IoT enabled health care systems along with point-of-care testing and diagnostics.• * Designing customized mobile vans and kiosks equipped with AI-based diagnostics.• * Integrating multi-lingual avatars with systems to give patients the feel of the presence of a doctor or a care giver. The avatars would especially be essential for patients with mental health disorders and elderly care.Role of SGPGI, LucknowSGPGIMS, Lucknow, set up a school of telemedicine & biomedical informatics in 2006 with the objective of teaching and training healthcare personnel and clinical engineers’ tools and strategies of ICT-enabled health care. It received a major Grant-in-Aid from the Union ministry of electronics & IT in 2007 to elevate the school to a national resource centre in telemedicine & biomedical informatics which was continued for five years. From 2007 till date, the facility and trained technical human power have been supported by Union ministry of health & family welfare to develop and manage the national medical college network as the national resource centre. With the collaboration with IIT Kanpur and the centre of excellence, the engineering aspects of clinical application of digital technologies can be addressed. With two decades of experience in application-oriented telemedicine research, development, and deployment, SGPGI’s collaboration with IIT Kanpur will foster synergies to cultivate an ecosystem at the intersection of technology and healthcare through capacity development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/iitkanpur-pgi-lucknow-join-hands-to-set-up-healthcare-robotics-coe-101624985418080.html

Conductors have been instructed by the administration to carrying sanitizer bottles and sprinkle it on the hands of passengers once they are seated. “Before issuing tickets, we tell the passengers to wear face masks. The conductors are ensuring that the social distancing is maintained in buses,” a PMPML official said. Efforts have been taken to make the seating arrangements in few buses changed to ensure social distancing while in the majority of the buses the conductors are making sure that the seat next to a passenger remains vacant. The conductors have also been issued directions not to allow standing passengers to ensure social distancing. However, due to a large number of common citizens travelling, it being difficult to maintain social distancing rules for the administration. Meanwhile, civic activists have welcomed the PMPML decision to deploy more buses. Sameer Patel, a civic activist from NIBM said, “The PMPML must ensure that all the measures like social distancing and use of sanitisers are done in the bus. At the same time, the increase in the number of buses will lessen the burden and hardship of citizens during the new restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-deploy-950-buses-to-ensure-citizens-reach-home-on-time-101624984398544.html

29-06-2021||Lucknow||Ruling BJP ‘manages’ dominance in Zila Panchayat chairpersons’ poll||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) extended its domination in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ poll on Tuesday, as in a series of dramatic political developments, opposition candidates became ruling party’s members in several districts and withdrew their candidature. After the close of withdrawal time on Tuesday, the ruling BJP got 21 candidates elected unopposed in as many districts, with the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) having to content with a lone unopposed win in its stronghold of Etawah. The BJP had lost to the Samajwadi Party in the elections to the zila panchayat ward members but has now stamped its domination in the indirect elections of panchayat chairpersons amid opposition allegations of foul play and misuse of official machinery. There was some high drama in Baghpat when the BJP first looked set for another ‘unopposed’ win when the SP-RLD candidate Mamta Kishore ‘withdrew’ her papers.It turned out to be ‘fake Mamata’ as the real SP candidate put out a video and sent a representation to the election officials claiming she hadn’t withdrawn from the race. But, in Shahjahanpur, the SP candidate’s withdrawal was for real. The SP candidate’s withdrawal set up BJP’s unopposed win in the bastion of UP’s finance minister Suresh Khanna.Here, SP candidate Binoo Singh joined the BJP and then withdrew from the race as SP candidate setting up BJP candidate Sangeeta Yadav’s unopposed win.Some local leaders, considered close to former Congress heavyweight Jitin Prasada, who joined the BJP recently, described it as “Prasada effect.” In Bahraich too, the SP candidate Neha Azeez who had been talking of putting up a strong fight against the BJP, suddenly withdrew, to set up BJP candidate Manju Singh’s unopposed win.Here, BJP MP Brij Bhushan Saran Singh was ‘managing’ the entire election, party leaders said. In Pilibhit, the Lok Sabha constituency of BJP MP Varun Gandhi, the SP was relying on former BJP man, Swami Pravakta Nand, who suddenly pulled out of the contest. In Saharanpur too, the opposition candidate Johnny Kumar Jaivir withdrew from the race paving the way for BJP’s Mangey Ram’s win. On the nomination day itself, the BJP was assured of unopposed wins of 17 panchayat chairpersons. The districts where the results were known on Tuesday itself, well ahead of the July 3 elections, include Saharanpur, Bahraich, Etawah, Chitrakoot, Agra, Gautambudh Nagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Moradabad, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Banda, Shravasti, Balrampur, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Mau, Varanasi, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur. In majority of the 53 districts, where elections would now happen, the BJP is up against candidates put up by mostly SP or its ally RLD. In 37 districts, just two candidates are in contest while in 16 other districts it is a multi-cornered contest.The BJP had left out two seats – Jaunpur and Sonbhadra – for its ally Apna Dal. In Farrukhabad, the BJP has put up Monica Yadav, ex-wife of Samajwadi Party leader Dharmendra Yadav while in Gorakhpur, Sadhna Singh, the daughter in law of former UP chief minister Vir Bahadur Singh was declared elected unopposed on BJP ticket. Vir Bahadur Singh was a senior Congress leader. “The BJP’s attempts to force SP out of the race in Unnao proved futile,” said SP leader Sunil Singh Sajan. In Unnao the BJP had to replace its candidate Arun Singh with Shakun Singh, wife of slain BJP MLC Ajeet Singh, after the Unnao rape survivor raised objections against Arun’s candidature. Arun however is now contesting as an independent with the support of Unnao BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ruling-bjp-manages-dominance-in-zila-panchayat-chairpersons-poll-101624982837268.html

29-06-2021||Pune||PMC launches amnesty scheme to regularise illegal water connections||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday announced an amnesty scheme to regularise illegal water connections and recover dues from water tax defaulters. The city has many illegal water connections, and the administration believes there are anywhere around 50,000 illegal water connections in the city. For the last several years, PMC has been taking action against illegal connections but after a few days they are being restored again. By considering this, the municipal commissioner suggested to launch an amnesty scheme to regularise the illegal water connections. Many government offices like BSNL, banks, railways, MSEB, police, cantonment boards and private firms like IT Companies, hotels and malls have water tax dues. To recover the tax from them, the PMC launched an amnesty scheme. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “The water tax dues are almost more than ₹600 crore. If these defaulters came forward and paid the tax, it would help the PMC to provide more facilities during Covid-19 pandemic. It has been decided to regularise the illegal water connections from slums and houses erected under the guntewari scheme.” Rasne said, “This scheme is only for three months. PMC officials would appeal to the government offices and private firms to pay their dues or cut the water connection.” PMC water department officials said in the standing committee that it is better to regularise the meters as they are using water but not paying tax to PMC. Even if the PMC holds a drive, there is a lot of opposition from the citizens. PMC said that those who want to regularise their water connection, they need to submit an application at their water zone office with address proof and contact number.

29-06-2021||Pune||Man loses ₹51 lakh to fake cop in job fraud||A 43-year-old man was arrested by Pune police on Monday for posing as a police officer and duping two people to the tune of over ₹51 lakh under false pretext of getting one of them a job in the customs department. The arrested man was identified as Rajendra Ramchandra Shinde (43), a resident of Tukai Tekdi area of Kalepoadal in Hadapsar and Sulochana Dadu Sonawane (37), a resident of Tingrenagar in Vishrantwadi. A case was lodged against the two by a man identified as Deepak Mundada (51) a resident of Shaniwar peth area of Pune. In 2014, the man had met the complainant at his Ganapati idol stall and told him that he is an assistant sub inspector in Mumbai police. He had made an occasional phone call and visit until 2017 when he told Mundada that there were positions opening in the customs department where he knows some high-rankingofficers. He told Mundada that a clerk position for his nephew would cost ₹15 lakh and a superintendent position for his son, who is more educated, would cost ₹25 lakh. However, over a period of time, after multiple visits to Mumbai, Mundada ended up paying ₹51, 17,400 to him. In the meanwhile, he brought a female wearing a khaki uniform and cap to meet with Mundada in a car. “Shinde told them that she is a high-ranking customs officer. She used to sit with him in a car and roam with him and he told everyone that she is a high-ranking government officer. She is his second wife and is involved in the crime with him,” said Police sub inspector Shrikant Sawant of Faraskhana police station who is investigating the case. Since 2017, Shinde allegedly duped Mundada of ₹51, 17,400 under various reasons including the fee for application etc. In 2018, he took the two boys to a facility in Mahim where they underwent medical tests and Shinde gave them material like uniform, shoes, cap. When Mundada’s friend got interested in the process, Shinde again showed up in a uniform but wore a name plate describing him as an “assistant police inspector” which is much higher in rank than ASI. That made Mundada suspicious and his relatives helped him catch Shinde. The police have urged other people who may have been duped by Shinde and Sonawane to come forward and lodge a complaint. A case under Sections 170 (personating a public servant), 171 (wearing garb or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intent), 406 (criminal breach of trusts), and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-loses-rs-51-lakh-to-fake-cop-in-job-fraud-101624982237244.html

In a first of its kind initiative in Bihar, Manzoor Khan, councillor of ward number 45 in Katihar, doled out a 24-inch LED colour TV, bicycle, pedestal fan, wall clock and tiffin box as gifts for winners of the lucky draw held among those who took the vaccine at a special camp held in his constituency recently on June 26. The trick did wonders, as nearly 800 people, a record for the district, turned up at Bhatta Tola vaccination centre to take the shot, officials said on Tuesday. “Before this, we never achieved around 800 vaccination shots in a single day at any vaccination session site since commencement of Covid-19 inoculation drive on January 16. Earlier, we would be happy by vaccinating around 200-350 people at a vaccination centre. However, we achieved a new milestone for our district on June 26,” said Udayan Mishra, district magistrate (DM) of Katihar. “We are now planning similar initiatives, involving public representatives, and doling out gifts among beneficiaries on a weekly basis,” he said. The draw of lots was done in presence of the DM, who also handed out gifts among the winners present there. Khan, who recovered from SARS CoV-2 infection last year, admitted to vaccine hesitancy in Muslim-dominated areas. “I took my idea of organising a lucky draw competition at the vaccination centre to the DM, who supported me. I then got in touch with a potato cold storage firm M/s Neha, that agreed to sponsor the gifts. We had to pitch pandals, draw up tarpaulin because of rainfall and decorate the vaccination centre with balloons etc. to give it a festive look, for which I also contributed some money. The entire event was organised for about ₹52,000,” said Khan. “If we public representatives take up such small initiatives, I am sure we will be able to achieve the target our Prime Minister and chief minister have set of vaccinating the eligible population by December,” he added. District immunisation officer Dr DN Jha appreciated Khan’s initiative. “Had it not rained, we may have achieved 1,000-plus vaccinations, but we had to stop at 782 vaccinations that day,” said Dr Jha. Katihar is among the laggard districts so far as vaccination is concerned, largely because of hesitancy in the area. It had vaccinated only around 2,500 people against an eligible population of 22 lakh before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic in early April this year. The vaccination drive started on January 16 in the country.However, as per figures provided by officials, the drive gained momentum during the last one month. “We have vaccinated 3.10 lakh eligible people with the first dose, accounting for 15% of the eligible population. We have been able to almost saturate ward number 45, where the special vaccination drive was organised,” said Dr DN Pandey, civil surgeon of Katihar. In addition to the static vaccination sites, the district has got 20 Teeka Express or mobile vaccination vans for rural areas and two for urban areas to inoculate people at their doorsteps. “We have vaccinated 13,211 beneficiaries so far at an average daily 287 vaccinations per van since the two mobile vans started to ply in urban areas of the district from June 4,” said Rahul Kumar Sonkar, district technical officer, outreach and nutrition, Care India, which is the development partner to the state health department. Bihar has so far administered 1,58,25,605 doses of Covid-19 vaccine among its 7.22 crore eligible beneficiaries. Of this, 1,36,25,770 have been given the first dose and 21,99,835 the second dose. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has set a target to vaccinate six crore people in six months, beginning July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ward-councillor-doles-out-gifts-in-lucky-draw-to-boost-vaccination-drive-101624982177272.html

The state government on December 24 had issued a notification, officially paving the way for initiation of the merger process for the 23 villages. These villages are highly urbanised, although lacking in basic amenities like road, water supply and waste management. Pawar on Tuesday held a review meeting at Mumbai to discuss various civic issues pertaining to Pune. Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif, minister Jitendra Avhad, minister of state for rural development Abdul Sattar, Prajakata Tanpure and city’s elected representatives were present for the meeting. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol remained absent for the meeting, but the mayor claimed that he did have an invite for the meeting. “Ajit Pawar instructed our department to hand over all the amenities in these 23 villages to urban development ministry as part of merger of these areas into PMC,” said Sattar. Pawar also hinted to merge 23 villages in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) before the municipal elections scheduled early next year. It is likely that the official order for merger of these villages into PMC limits will be issued within a month as the divisional commissionerate has already submitted its report comprising suggestions made by locals.The rural development ministry has given a nod to hand over all its properties including schools and water schemes to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which falls under urban development department. These 23 villages are mainly dominated by NCP and party is hoping that it would help them to get power in the upcoming municipal election. However, city mayor Murlidhar Mohol was absent for the meeting citing he did not get proper information for it.Mohol said, “This meeting was scheduled to discuss Pune city’s issues. I have been attending all the meetings, though I did not get the information for this meeting. It is wrong that the politics is getting done over issues related to Pune. Our stand is very clear that these villages should be merged step by step as it would add burden on the city’s infrastructure. If the state government wants to merge all the villages in a single phase, they should allot the funds for same and handover it to the municipal corporation.” Along with the merged villages, the issue of handing over Maharashtra’s Jeevan Padikaran water project to PMC, which is meant for Uttamnagar, Shivane and Kondwe area. Pawar instructed to handover the project to the PMC immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pawar-instructs-handing-over-amenities-in-23-merged-villages-to-pmc-101624982118034.html

The hospital, which became the first health facility in the state to get the Russian vaccine through private channel, received limited supplies of 600 doses last week. Given its high demand and limited availability, the hospital has restricted vaccination slots through the CoWIN portal. “We are insisting on pre-registration and pre-booking of slots through the CoWIN portal for the Sputnik jab after we began administering it to beneficiaries on June 25,” said Dr Ravi Shankar Singh, associate medical director of the hospital. The newly built hospital has so far administered 350 doses to beneficiaries during the last four days, he added. “We have requested our Gurgaon head office for 2,000 more doses of the vaccine. We are yet to get a confirmation about the arrival of new stocks,” said Dr Singh. The Sputnik V vaccine efficacy was around 91.6% in India. However, the Russian Direct Investment Fund on Tuesday announced that the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in the United Arab Emirates was 97.8% among over 81,000 people. Given the high efficacy of the Russian vaccine against Covid-19, the hospital, said sources, was receiving requests from ministers, legislators and senior government officers for administering jabs among their friends and relatives. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had inaugurated the super-specialty hospital on September 18 last year. Though it commenced outdoor patient department services soon after its inauguration, the hospital is yet to become fully functional. It expects to begin indoor patient department services in August. As per the agreement with the state government, the hospital will offer around 25% beds to poor patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/high-demand-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-at-medanta-101624982117250.html

The accused, identified as Anil Bhatt, was also arrested, police said. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said police earlier detained Bhatt’s wife for investigation. During her questioning, she revealed the location of her husband. Police traced the location, rescued the boy and took Bhatt in custody. “Police are bringing the boy back to the city. It seems like there was some financial dispute between the boy’s father Rajendra Mishra and Bhatt, which could be the reason behind the kidnapping,” SSP added. Police said that Shivam was abducted from the Bageshwari-Bambam locality under the Delha police station area on Monday morning. The abductors demanded ₹4 lakh from his father and threatened to sell the boy’s kidney if failed to pay the ransom. Police have registered a case of abduction against Anil Bhatt, based on the statement of the victim’s father. Shivam’s grandfather Tirupati Mishra said that the incident took place around 11am when Bhatt took his grandchild away on the pretext of buying a bicycle.

29-06-2021||Pune||Man arrested for duping at least 14 in ATM fraud||A man was arrested for using sleight of hand to swap people’s ATM cards under the guise of helping them and is suspected to be involved in at least 14 such cases in and around Pune. The arrested man, identified as Shravan Satish Minjagi (25) a resident of Kadam Wak Vasti, Lonikalbhor and a native of Solapur. He is currently in police custody until June 30 at Wanowrie police station, according to senior police inspector Deepak Lagad. The Lonikalbhor police believe his involvement in one case with three victims registered on Monday. The man gained credentials of the card by looking at the PIN by peeping into the ATM machine while the victim used it in the first attempt, according to the police. “He mostly targetted old people. He always kept another card with him. He would cunningly exchange the cards when the victims were not paying attention and used the PIN to use the cards and then passed on the stolen cards in a similar cycle,” said senior PI Lagad. He was booked for duping three people, including a 19-year-old girl, by pretending to help them withdraw money from two ATMs in Haveli area. In the Wanowrie case, he duped a retired policeman of ₹1,30,000 by using the card to withdraw money and shop. “There is CCTV showing him involved in three incidents at two separate ATMs. We suspect that the man caught in the exactly same case in Wanowrie is the accused in our case as well,” said On April 21, when the 19-year-old girl was not able to withdraw cash from an ATM in Lonikalbhor, he pretended to help her and duped her of ₹12,000. In the same ATM on the same day, he duped a woman of ₹9,000. After two months, on June 20, he duped a man of ₹20,000 in another ATM in Kunjurwadi. A case under Sections 379 (theft) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code was registered in the matter at Lonikalbhor police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-arrested-for-duping-at-least-14-in-atm-fraud-101624982057237.html
29-06-2021||Patna||Be ready, time is yours, Tejashwi tells his MLAs, party workers||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who convened a meeting of party legislators on Monday evening and office bearers on Tuesday, has asked them to “remain vigilant as anything is possible in politics”.The party is planning to celebrate its 25th foundation on July 5 in a grand manner and is trying to bring party chief Lalu Prasad, who is recuperating in New Delhi, to Patna to mark the occasion. “If four governments can be formed in four years, anything can happen in politics,” Tejashwi said in his address. “Be honest to your work, remain vigilant and work in your constituency. The time to come is yours,” said Yadav in his address. He was apparently referring to political flux in the state between 2013 and 2017 when JD-U broke up with BJP, tied up with RJD only to return to the NDA in 2017. Tejashwi Yadav, who is also leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly, had predicted the fall of NDA government during visit to his constituency Raghopur Friday last. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary said there was demand from party office-bearers to bring Lalu Prasad for the foundation day function. “He will come only if the doctors permit him to travel. His visit will certainly galvanise party workers,” he said.JD (U) and BJP reacted mockingly to Tejashwi’s advice to his MLAs. “Legislative party meeting concluded, leader elected. Ministries divided. Now just the oath of the post of Chief Minister remains... ” tweeted JD (U) spokesperson Nikhil Mandal. “He hasn’t stop day dreaming, A person who doesn’t visit his constituency is aspiring to become CM,” said BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel. The NDA government has the support of 127 MLAs in the 243-member Assembly. These include 74 of BJP, 44 of JD-U (The party had won 43 seats in 2020 polls. While LJP MLA Rajkumar Singh and BSP MLA Jama Khan joined the party later, one seat fell vacant after the death of its MLA Mewalal Choudhary), and four each of HAM-S and VIP. An independent MLA is also supporting the NDA government led by Nitish Kumar.In the Opposition camp, RJD has 75 MLAs, Congress 19 and the Left 16. With 110 MLAs altogether, the opposition’s grand alliance is only 12 seats away from the majority mark of 122. The AIMIM, which has 5 MLAs, has promised unconditional support to the grand alliance. This leaves GA just seven seats away from the majority. In such a situation, if HAM-S and VIP, which of late have been sulking, hold the key. “There is no weight in Yadav’s claim in that NDA government is going in 2-3 months. All this is hogwash. The NDA is united. HAM-S and VIP are solidly behind the NDA. One should not be misguided by the growing proximity between Tejashwi and Chirag Paswan,” HAM-S president and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/be-ready-time-is-yours-tejashwi-tells-his-mlas-party-workers-101624981997972.html
29-06-2021||Patna||Don’t be misled: Bihar edu minister tells protesting STET candidates||The State Teacher Eligibility Test (STET) qualified candidates need not to worry or get misguided, state education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said on Tuesday.“All the students will get the opportunity to apply for the teachers’ recruitment to be conducted in a decentralised manner at the level of Panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies. The recruiting agencies will publish the merit list. At present, there is no relevance of the merit list, as all the qualified candidates are eligible to apply,” he said.The minister said that the status of those candidates who are on the STET merit list will remain unchanged, but they should understand that the merit list is for eligibility, not appointment. The merit list for appointment will come after due process, starting with category-wise advertisement and online submission of applications. “All the STET candidates are eligible to apply, so there is no reason to become restless at this stage under any influence.Students should have patience,” he added.The STET candidates have been agitating since the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) published their results in two categories - one for those who qualified and were on the merit list and another for those who qualified STET but their names were not on the list. Besides, the candidates said that there was no category-wise cut-off mentioned for the students.The STET was held in 2011 and 2019. The government had advertised 37,540 seats in the state’s secondary and higher secondary schools, while the number of candidates turned out to more than double. It has created insecurity among the students.After the confusion, the education department set up a committee under the department’s principal secretary to correct the anomaly and declared that all the qualified candidates would be eligible to apply in future recruitments. The committee blamed the two categories of results on the earlier validity of STET score for seven years, which the Centre has now made for the lifetime. However, the candidates want all qualified students to be appointed.However, the STET candidates blamed the government for all the confusion, calling it an attempt to divide the teacher aspirants. They also met the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav with their demands. “The government has created this situation and it should find a way out. The candidates are on the streets as they felt cheated even after passing the test. The government wanted litigation so that the matter reaches the court, to stall the appointments,” said a STET candidate..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dont-be-misled-bihar-edu-minister-tells-protesting-stet-candidates-101624981997196.html

Few candidates have also been taken into custody. We had requested the protestors to retreat as it was a prohibited area. However, they ignored the warning and became furious. We had to use mild lathicharge to disperse the mob,” Sachilwalya DSP Rajesh Prabhakar said.During lathicharge, about half a dozen students were injured. A magistrate, who was handling the law and order, fell on the ground and received minor injuries in the incident, police said.Additional forces have been deputed near ECO park to maintain the law and order situation.Later, the candidates met the opposition leader Tejaswi Yadav and requested him to look into the matter.

Following the recommendations of the UP experts’ committee on Covid, all necessary preparedness must be put in place in advance without any delay,” he told officials.He said the Covid situation in the state was improving with each passing day, but this was the time to be more alert and vigilant – a little negligence and laxity could cause huge problems and complications.The CM said Covid vaccination was an effective safety shield against the virus and UP so far had administered 3.10 crore doses of vaccines. As many as 44 lakh people had got both their doses, he added.In the last 24 hours, 2.37 lakh Covid tests were done, of which only 174 tested positive. In the same period, 254 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospitals, said Yogi. “The daily positivity rate in UP is below 0.1%, recovery rate is 98.5% and total active Covid cases have fallen to 2,946, of which 1,810 patients are in home isolation. The state, so far (since March last year) has done 5.75 crore Covid tests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/so-far-no-delta-plus-infection-in-up-cm-101624981757212.html

29-06-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan claims vaccination suspended on Tuesday due to shortage||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday demanded immediate delivery of 15 million vaccine doses from Centre citing Rajasthan’s increased requirement in the month of July while accusing the Centre of not meeting state’s requirement leading to repeated suspension of the drive and resentment among people.While Gehlot said that the Centre’s assurance of no shortage of vaccines to states was not being met, an official in the state’s health department said that the vaccination drive was suspended on Tuesday since inoculation centres ran out of doses by Monday and the vaccines sent by the Centre arrived late and will reach centres only by Tuesday evening.“The state received two lakh (covishield) vaccines last night and 60,000 (Covaxin) but it will reach districts by today evening,” the official said on condition of anonymity. He added that due to the depleting stock, only 8-10 districts were able to administer vaccines on Monday.He pointed out that the state has been consistently asking the Central government to increase the number of doses supplied to the state to feed its ambition to vaccinate 1.5 million people daily after having successfully administered 1.045 million doses on a single day on June 25.The official claimed that the “shortage” of vaccines was slowing down the drive, which was stalled at least ten times in the state in the last three months. Rajasthan has so far administered 24.423 doses including 20.543m first doses.On Sunday chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the state needed to vaccinate 1.5 million beneficiaries daily if it were to vaccinate the 7.5 million people due for their second dose by the end of July on time. Gehlot said the Centre was currently supplying 300,000-400,000 vaccines doses daily, on an average to the state, which will obstruct the state’s effort to prevent the 3rd wave of Covid-19.“...More than seven million people will be due for their second dose by the end of July, 2021. To ensure time-bound and expeditious vaccination, we have created a capacity to vaccinate over 1.5 million persons per day. Presently our daily vaccination is limited to the extent of supplies received from the Central government. The daily average of vaccine doses received, since the start of vaccination drive for 18 years plus, has been 300,000 to 400,000 only,” Gehlot wrote.Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry said some delays were part of the “normal process” due to the logistic challenges involved in the massive exercise. However, he assured that the manufacturing of vaccines was being scaled up continuously.“For example, in the case of Covaxin, that [the manufacturing] has gone up from 5-6 million doses a month to 10 million and will go up further. All this is a part of upgrading the health infrastructure to manage the needs of the country,” he said during the ministry’s briefing on Covid-19 on Tuesday.The Central government reversed the vaccination procurement policy after persistent complaints by states over its pricing and availability in the open market. From June 21 onwards, Centre is procuring and providing vaccine doses to states, based on their vaccination rate in the past and future needs. The Central government has told states that it will distribute 120 million doses including 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin to all states and Union Territories for the month of July.The Union ministry of health and family welfare said it will share the estimated number of vaccine doses available in a particular month with states before the start of the month as part of its advance visibility plan so that states and UTs can prepare and schedule vaccinations accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-claims-vaccination-suspended-on-tuesday-due-to-shortage-101624981157715.html

Over 5,000 people were killed in one of the worst industrial disasters when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the factory in December 1984. Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation department director Basant Kurre said a tender was issued on May 4 for the disposal and two companies won the bid. “Now, the Central Pollution Control Board, State Pollution Control Board, and a team of experts will check the efficiency of these companies and their work. If the companies are found eligible, the work order will be released. The companies will get four months to collect the waste and dispose of it.” He added the state will get ₹350 crore from the Centre for the disposal. Also Read | IMD issues ‘orange’ alert for several MP districtsOfficials said the disposal was delayed due to a lack of clarity over who would dispose of the waste--whether the state or the Central government. Rachna Dhingra, an activist, said the waste cited is just 5% of total lying there and the state government should conduct a proper survey. “After the disaster, about 200 metric tonne waste was dumped in a pond by covering the ground with sheets while about 137 MT was in the factory. According to a report of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, the Pollution Control Board, and independent research, the toxic waste poisoned the groundwater and soil of the nearby area. There is a need for the survey and real disposal of waste,” said Dhingra. Rashida Bi, a survivor, said the government is trying to dispose of the waste in hurry. “The survivors of the tragedy are waiting for compensation. The state government is planning to spend ₹100 crore on a memorial and research centre. They should first focus on providing the victims with quality water and a good life...” Vishwas Sarang, the minister in charge of the relief and rehabilitation, said the government wants to give a good life to the victims and that is why they are making efforts to provide them health facilities and jobs. “The hazardous waste is lying in the area for years and we are trying to dispose it of as soon as possible as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court and ministry of environment. If required, we will do a survey of groundwater and soil of the nearby area and will accordingly.” In 2012, the Supreme Court ordered the ministry to dispose of the waste after conducting a trial and an assessment of the impact of the disposal on the environment. After a ministry report, the court asked the state government to release tenders under the guidance of the Central Pollution Control Board for waste disposal. The Board disposed of 10 tonnes of waste from the factory premises on a trial basis in Pithampur Industrial area in Dhar. But after the trial, the government did not take any further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-dispose-of-hazardous-waste-for-memorial-to-bhopal-gas-tragedy-victims-101624977077880.html

29-06-2021||Kolkata||TMC sharpens attack against Bengal governor Dhankhar over Jain Hawla case||The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal sharpened its attack on governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday saying that “the name of one Dhankhar can be found in the Jain Hawala case”.“Names of several politicians who took bribe cropped up when the case was being heard. One of them was that of Dhankhar. It is not possible for me to say whether our governor and that person (Dhankhar) named in the Jain dairy are one and the same person. Only Dhankhar can clarify,” said TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray.This comes a day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that the name of Dhankhar appeared in the case. The Jain hawala case was a political scandal in the mid-90s centered around a handwritten diary that mentioned alleged hawala payments of about ₹65 crore. The names of the recipients were written in codes and matched the initials of some top political leaders. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed over two dozen chargesheets in this case. But the cases collapsed because the CBI did not produce any corroborative evidence to prove the bribery charge.Also Read | Statehood for north Bengal: The story of an old demand, new political dynamicThe governor has refuted the charges. “I never expected a leader of her stature to create a sensation, engage in misinformation and misrepresentation. I have not been charge-sheeted. There is no such document. This is far from fact. This is plain and simple untruth, misinformation. I have not taken any stay from any court,” Dhankhar said on Monday.There was no response from Dhankhar on Tuesday till almost two hours after the TMC’s fresh attack.Ray said the party will decide if any legal steps are to be taken in this regard. “Chief minister has already sent three letters to the Prime Minister on three occasions to relieve Dhankhar of the post. The parliament sessions start on July 19. We would explore if any steps could be taken against the governor in the parliament.”Dhankhar said on Monday that everyone named in the charge sheet was acquitted. Ray said that the case was still pending in the court and hence the question of acquittal does not arise.“TMC abides by the Constitution. It is not safe for the country if a man who doesn’t abide by the Constitution, is corrupt and may have links with terrorism is made the governor.”Samik Bhattacharya, the Bhartiya Janata Party’s Bengal spokesman, said the TMC is trying to divert the attention because it knows that the corruption in the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA) has now come out and the lid has been taken off from the fake vaccination racket in which senior leaders are involved.The governor said on Monday the TMC’s attack came after he raised allegations of corruption against the GTA, which runs the Darjeeling and Kalimpong regions.

After the revised rules, bars, pubs and 'ahatas' can resume services, starting July 1. However, a condition of 50% capacity will be applicable. They will also be required to follow all Covid-19 norms like social distancing and mandatory wearing of face masks.It will also be mandatory for waiters, bartenders and other employees working at those bars and pubs to take at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Skill development centres and universities have also been allowed to open with conditions that staff and students must have taken at least one dose of vaccine. The onus of vaccination on the owners, the chief minister asserted.Expressing satisfaction over the decline in positivity to less than 1%, with an overall fall in inactive cases, Singh noted that the positivity rate in some districts still remained over 1%. Further, speaking on the rising cases of Delta PLus variant, Singh said it is a "matter of concern," hence it is essential to continue with the curbs.The month-wise whole-genome sequencing has shown that more than 90% is a variant of concern, with the original virus having been practically replaced by variants, he also informed at the Covid-19 review meeting.Two cases (Ludhiana and Patiala) have shown Delta plus variant, while in May and June, the Delta variant was most prevalent, he pointed out.Singh also directed health officials to ramp up testing as he reviewed the preparations for the imminent third wave.On the Black Fungus (Mucormycosis), a fungal infection commonly being found in Covid-19 patients in the recovery stage, the Singh noted that Punjab has had much fewer cases than most other states, including Haryana, and Delhi, which not only saw more cases but more than three times the deaths in Punjab. However, it was still unfortunate that 51 people had died due to black fungus in the state, he also said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delta-plus-matter-of-concern-covid-19-curbs-extended-till-july-10-punjab-cm-101624968054558.html
29-06-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Pune municipal polls must reflect civic reality||With elections coming up, the public should express what they want the future government to do. Hopefully, we will be over the worst of the health crisis of Covid-19 by the end of 2021 and can look forward to resuming work and education. Safe transport is a crucial service we would want the city government to focus on. A basic expectation is that going anywhere in the city should be easy, safe, and affordable. Since the transport sector is a major pollution source in Pune, it is equally essential to reduce the number of private vehicles on road. Strengthening bus-based public transport is among the most critical needs in Pune currently, for providing mobility for all and reducing vehicular pollution. People living in the Pune municipal area used to make roughly six million trips daily going to school, college, or workplaces, for domestic chores, or for leisure or social needs, prior to the pandemic situation. Only about 17% of these trips used public transport. The share of public transport must rise to at least 40% in the next four to five years and facilities for walking and cycling improved alongside. Though many Punekars and perhaps politicians feel that the Metro will meet public transport demand, in fact, in most big cities which have a substantial metro network, such as London, New York and Singapore - the bus system often carries as many, if not more people. This is because buses are easier to access and convenient for medium-length trips, which is the bulk of the trips in Pune. Pune’s Comprehensive Mobility Plan has projected that unless public transport is improved, congestion will rise dramatically. Peak-hour travel times would increase, and traffic would move at about 10km per hour along the major arterial roads. Air pollution would become much worse. So how will the shift from private-transport to public-transport happen? It can only happen with excellent public transport. We are fortunate to have PMPML as a publicly-owned city bus service. Now, PMPML must step up, and also receive PMC and PCMC support, to provide high-quality, easily accessible to all, affordable, high frequency bus services. Good network, but strengthen the fleet As per an ITDP study “People near Transit, Transit near People”, about 25% of the population will have access to rapid transit within 500 metres, considering that both metro and Rainbow BRT networks will be operational. All the rest of us, who don’t live near the metro or Rainbow BRT would use the regular city bus services by PMPML. This is eminently possible since 96% of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad live within 500 metres of the extensive PMPML network. Bus connectivity is already pretty good. However, according to Pranjali Deshpande, who authored the study, the frequency of the bus service needs to be greatly improved, as only 66% of people have a bus available every five minutes at a walking distance of 500 metres. PMPML must increase the number of buses substantially, and strengthen routes and operations for more people to ride the bus. PMPML’s new business plan suggests that fleet size would be 3,600 buses in the next 10 years. Considering the service area and population, the Pune urban region already needs 2,500 buses in service. Currently, only 1,400 are operational. In fact, PMPML should aim for at least 5,000 buses over the next few years just for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The benchmark by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is 40-60 buses per 0.1 million people. Bus Rapid Transit When Rainbow Bus Rapid Transit was launched in 2015, it received a huge positive response from commuters with its high-quality services, dedicated bus lanes, covered bus shelters, bus arrival information, safe access to the bus, clear branding, and customer relations. However, the city has so far operationalised only two corridors in Pune–Sangamwadi-Vishrantwadi and Yerwada-Wagholi – though funding was accessed for 60km of BRT. Sujit Patwardhan, founder of Parisar, advises that PMPML and PMC need to renew the commitment to the Rainbow BRT and implement the network and maintain it well, and this should have been included in the business plan. Finance Both the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations should continue to support PMPML by providing it annual core funds, regularly and in time. They should also help raise additional revenue and create the necessary facilities of good bus shelters and for pedestrians and cyclists to access public transit services. Though experts’ views differ on the exact strategies for strengthening the organisation and its operations, and the fleet size essential, PMPML’s new business plan is a step forward. Will election manifestos support excellent bus-based public transport? They must if politicians care for the well-being of people and aim to improve air quality and climate action.

29-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi opens up: Fashion designers feel optimistic||The second wave of the Covid-19 crisis and lockdown brought the fashion industry to a halt once again. Production and sales were severely hit by the temporary closure of manufacturing units, stores. However, now with the ease in restrictions, Delhi designers feel hopeful about bouncing back to business.“We opened just a few days ago and business has been encouraging. I’m surprised to see such numbers already,” says Rahul Mishra. Echoing the sentiment, Gaurav Gupta says, “Couture clients were waiting to visit the store in Mehrauli and my other store is getting decent footfall as well.”The stores have reopened with utmost safety precautions after the hiatus. “People were locked in and want to feel normal once again. The stores are following safety protocols, are well-ventilated,” says Namrata Joshipura. Designers are also ensuring the garments for trial are well sanitised.And in a move to entice shoppers, some are offering rare discounts. Mishra says, “We don’t give discounts usually, but stores were shut for two months. So we are offering off on certain pieces for a week.”However, many are still encouraging virtual meetings to maintain social distance. Suneet Varma says, “People are getting more comfortable buying digitally, especially the NRI and international clients. But a few personalised appointments are also there.” Although there is limited clientele at any given time, but digital sales have seen higher conversions. Gupta is also advocating a combination of offline and online appointments. “Before fixing an offline meet, all queries and concerns are considered to lessen visits to the store,” he adds.Despite reopening, some designers are facing challenges due to vaccine hesitancy among artisans and taking the onus of inoculation on themselves. Anju Modi says, “Kaarigars went back to their villages and are coming back now. We have to get them vaccinated.” Joshipura also feels this is their responsibility. “Some kaarigars are afraid to get vaccinated, but we are assisting them in getting slots booked,” she says.Nevertheless, the sudden break has been a moment to pause and reflect for many including Modi who says, “We have taken this time to restructure our way of working. We are doing more in-depth research, thinking of holistic ways, consuming less and becoming more conscious of the wastage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-opens-up-fashion-designers-feel-optimistic-101624965317022.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Savouring the hidden agenda of a blabbermouth Mintu||The tallest mint plant in the backyard talks to me twice a day. I go there to see the progress of the kitchen garden, turned into one by filling earth in the small swimming pool for children. With the kids having flown the nest, we decided a couple of years ago, to go for home-grown vegetables. For the last four seasons, it has supplied us with organic, green veggies, just enough for Koumdi and me. How does he do the talking? “For the ensuing Covid period, we have been, on an experimental basis, endowed by Mother Nature, to engage traumatised humans into conversation, to give them some relief and mental succour,” said Mintu, a name I gave it. With the last season withering out, the crop that had matured beyond not yielding anything had been uprooted by the mali (gardener), who spared Mintu and its family bunch, since they still looked fresh. In April, when the mali sowed lady’s finger and gourd seeds, Mintu told me that it was time for brinjal and tomato, too. “Your mali is a good for nothing fellow. He should have made you an expert in growing, pruning, watering and nurturing plants by now.” I told Mintu that the mali had transplanted brinjal and tomatoes but Mintu ignored my statement. “Uprooting sounds barbarous, no?” it referred to the mali’s act. I told Mintu to wait for a few days when the mali’s efforts would bear fruit. It smiled wryly. I sprinkled some water on it and its family bunch and moved on. The next morning, Mintu looked fresh. “Hey, I saw the lady’s finger seed germinating moment by moment at night. I even heard a ticking sound. By sunrise two small leafy eruptions were there.” “Wow!” I said, “Let me have a look!” I was excited to see the callow, pastel green, pithy mini-bulge. I looked at the point where the gardener had grown gourd seed. Going closer, I saw some groundswell there as well. It was my turn now to surprise Mintu who looked excited and exclaimed, “More the merrier! Tell your mali to fix prods in time for these creepers to lean on, or else their tentacles will interfere with the tomatoes when they find roots, and maybe they reach our colony too.” A fortnight flew by when Mintu found enough verdure greenery around in the vicinity. It kept informing me about what transpired in the bed in my absence. Mintu knew I was happy visiting the backyard regularly and talking to it. It talked about the lemon-coloured flowers that grew on the branch before fruiting into lady’s finger and gourd. Mintu was worried about the brinjal plant leaves that had begun to be eaten by pests. “Your mali should have arranged for some pesticide,” Mintu cribbed again, “he doesn’t even properly water them all.” The next day, I asked the mali to arrange for some pesticide. I talked to him about some other things that Mintu had shared with me. The mali was intrigued with my knowledge of plants and maintenance of the bed. I returned to Mintu when it pleaded with me, “Sir, can I ask for a favour?” “Please go ahead.” I said. “If you are happy with me, can you ask the mali not to uproot me and my family one more time this season? In case he has to, can you have some of us transplanted here in this bed only?” My faith in life, and the place where one belonged, got reaffirmed, that too with a hint of mint. rajbirdeswal@hotmail.com The author is a retired IPS officer and an advocate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/savouring-the-hidden-agenda-of-a-blabbermouth-mintu-101624964897038.html

He told reporters on Monday that Kumar was under tremendous pressure due to ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s antics.“Given the nature of Nitish Kumar and marginalisation of the Janata Dal (United)... it is for all of us to see how long he could survive...”Also Read | Bihar councillor beats vaccine hesitancy with a lucky draw in KatiharAnwar’s comments came days after Rashtriya Janata Dal leader (RJD) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav last week said the government would fall in a couple of months.The Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) has dismissed the claim of the imminent fall of the government. “No power in the world can bring down Nitish Kumar’s government for five years,” said JD-U leader Upendra Kushwaha on Sunday.BJP leader Prem Ranjan Patel said on Sunday, “They are dreaming that the government is going to fall in two to three months.

In the meantime, they are being also tracked and efforts are on to ensure that they get vaccinated in whichever part of the country they are.”The vaccination drive started on January 30. “We came across many villagers who feared repercussions of vaccination in the form of death, fever or impotency, and hence, the vaccination drive did not yield the desired result at the outset,” said Gyan Prakash, sub-divisional magistrate.Over 20,000 people were inoculated during a mega drive on June 21 and 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bankatwa-is-bihar-s-1st-block-where-everyone-above-18-has-got-1st-vaccine-dose-101624961117441.html
29-06-2021||Patna||Bihar councillor beats vaccine hesitancy with a lucky draw in Katihar||In a first of its kind initiative in Bihar to overcome vaccine hesitancy, a ward councillor in Katihar district gave out gifts in a lucky draw and made a record by getting 800 persons to come forward for vaccination at one centre in a single day. An impressed administration said it may repeat the formula at other centres to step-up the drive.Manzoor Khan, councillor of ward number 45 in Katihar, gave away a 24-inch LED colour TV, a bicycle, pedestal fan, wall clocks and tiffin boxes as gifts for the winners of the lucky draw among the 782 persons who took a jab of the vaccine at a special camp held at the Bhatta Tola vaccination centre in his constituency on June 26, creating a record for vaccinations done in a day at a single centre in the district. “We had never achieved around 800 vaccinations in a single day at any vaccination session site since the commencement of the Covid-19 inoculation drive on January 16. We would be happy to vaccinate around 200-350 people at a vaccination centre. However, we achieved a new milestone for our district on June 26,” said Udayan Mishra, district magistrate of Katihar, who handed out the gifts to lucky beneficiaries. “We are now planning similar initiatives, involving public representatives, and doling out gifts among beneficiaries on a weekly basis,” Mishra added. The hero of the campaign, Manzoor Khan, whose idea made the drive a huge success, admitted there was vaccine hesitancy in Muslim dominated areas. “I took my idea of organising a lucky draw at the vaccination centre to the district magistrate, who supported me. I then got in touch with M/s Neha, a potato cold storage firm, which agreed to sponsor the gifts. We had to pitch pandals, draw up tarpaulin because of rains and decorate the vaccination centre with balloons, etc. to give it a festive look, for which, I also contributed some money. The entire show was organised at a cost of ₹52,000,” Khan said.District immunisation officer Dr DN Jha was appreciative of Khan’s initiative. “Had it not rained, we may have achieved 1000-plus vaccinations, but we had to stop at 782 vaccinations that day,” he said.Khan said it was possible to achieve the target of vaccinating the country’s population if public representatives took interest in the drive.One of the laggards on the front of vaccination, Katihar initially managed to vaccinate only around 2,500 persons out of the 2.2 million eligible population before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic, which caused several thousand deaths. The drive has, however, picked pace in the last month.“We have vaccinated 310,000 beneficiaries with the first dose, which makes up 15% of the eligible population. We have been able to almost saturate ward number 45, where the special vaccination drive was organised,” said Dr DN Pandey, civil surgeon of Katihar. The district is also using 20 Teeka Express or mobile vaccination vans to take the drive to rural areas and inoculate people in urban areas at their doorsteps. “We have vaccinated 13,211 beneficiaries so far at an average of 287 vaccinations per day, per van since June 4, when two mobile vans started to ply in urban areas of the district.” said Rahul Kumar Sonkar, district technical officer, outreach and nutrition, Care India, which is the development partner to the state health department. Bihar has so far administered 15.825 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine among its 72.2 million eligible population. Of this, 13.625m have been given the first dose and 2.199m the second dose. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has set a target to vaccinate 60 million people in six months, beginning July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-councillor-beats-vaccine-hesitancy-with-a-lucky-draw-in-katihar-101624960817302.html

The Crime Branch had sent the notice to Joshi, asking him to appear before it on June 24 for questioning in the phone-tapping case lodged on a complaint by Shekhawat. The chief whip replied to it, refusing to appear before the Delhi Police.The case was registered in March this year against the OSD to Rajasthan chief minister, Lokesh Sharma, on the complaint by the minster, who is also the BJP MP from Jodhpur. Sharma had allegedly circulated audio clips purportedly with Shekhawat talking about toppling the Congress government in the state. Sharma rejected the allegations and moved Delhi high court seeking quashing of the FIR against him. Also Read | Petrol crosses ₹100/litre in West Bengal, ₹110/litre in Rajasthan’s GanganagarMeanwhile, Joshi’s supporters have put up big hoardings at the prominent places in Jaipur. The hoardings with Joshi’s photo carry slogans such as ‘Har Anyay Ka Denge Jawab’ (will answer every injustice) and ‘Yah Anyay Nahi Sahega Jaipur’ (Jaipur will not tolerate this injustice). Reacting to this, Shekhawat’s supporters held a demonstration with a poster depicting the minister as an elephant with some dogs barking charges like “ACB ka Pata Batau kya (should I tell the address of ACB)”, “Shekhawat ko Isteefa dena chahiye’ (Shekhawat should resign)”. Leading the protest near Civil Lines railway crossing, Shekhawat supporter Prem Singh Banwasa said, “We held a demonstration against the chief whip who has been insulting the Union minister instead of appearing before the Delhi Police.” Reacting to the demonstration, Joshi said, “PM Narendra Modi talks about the elimination of Covid-19 but BJP workers are polluting the environment by burning effigies. Till date, I don’t have any FIR against me. A wrong notice has been sent, if such a notice is sent in a threatening manner, we will protest again.” After the Delhi Police notice, Joshi attacked Shekhawat, calling him a fugitive and asking why he has not given a voice sample to the anti-corruption bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/joshishekhawat-spat-turns-into-poster-war-in-rajasthan-101624959977865.html

29-06-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh fails to appear before ED, requests to record his statement online||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh again failed to show up at the office of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday. Instead, he sent a letter through his legal representative, requesting the agency to record his “statement on audio/visual mode at whatever time convenient.” He has also sought a copy of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) that ED has registered against him.ED had, on Monday, issued a second summons to Deshmukh to question him in connection with the alleged money laundering linked to the extortion racket involving dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze.Deshmukh had failed to appear before investigators on June 26 when the first summons were issued.Responding to the second summons, Deshmukh sent a three-page letter to ED through his lawyer, advocate Inderpal B Singh, on Tuesday morning.Also Read | ‘BJP using agencies to trouble leaders of Maharashtra’s ruling parties’“It would not be possible for me to furnish the documents sought by you unless I am furnished with or supplied the copy of the ECIR MBZO-I66/2021 or list of documents. Unless the said ECIR is perused by me, it will not be possible to furnish the documents sought,” the former minister stated in the letter.“I have already exposed my person to some extent on June 25, in my long interaction with you spanning over several hours during the course of search and recording of my statement. I will furnish all information and any document that you may require once I am aware of the contents and details thereof. The copy of ECIR is not available with me, I am handicapped and incapacitated to furnish the documents as of now,” he added in the letter.He said, “Contrary to the fact that I had duly complied with the summons dated June 25 in the letter and spirit by appearing through authorised representative, an adverse propaganda against me was unleashed in social and print media platforms alleging that instead of complying I have sought time to appear.”The senior Nationalist Congress Party leader further stated that, “I have been repeatedly highlighting that the proceedings being initiated against me at the instance of certain individuals who are themselves guilty of grave offences & have dubious antecedents as also the fact that a political tug of war has been initiated by the Central Government led by a particular political party who seek to abuse their power and authority for vested interest.”“Please note that your summons do not clarify the particular purpose of my personal appearance. You have arrested two persons who were associated with me. Therefore, insistence on personal appearance without even supplying me a copy of the EClR or documents may strengthen my assertion that there is some kind of malice being nursed against me,” he said in the letter.If the ED’s investigators are not satisfied with Deshmukh’s letter, the agency may soon issue third summons.The anti-money laundering agency already arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde early Saturday morning after carrying out raids at their properties in Mumbai and Nagpur on Friday. The two are in ED’s custody up to July 1. The ED also claimed to have found that Vaze had collected ₹4.7 crore from various orchestra bar owners in Mumbai for “smooth functioning of the bars”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to the Delhi-based Jain brothers who operate paper (bogus) companies, said the agency. It claimed that the Jain brothers, on the instructions of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh, diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family. ED has said that while collecting money from the bar owners, Vaze told them that part of the money was to go to “No.1”, crime branch and the social service branch of Mumbai Police. ED has also said that when they recorded the statement of Vaze, presently in Taloja jail in connection with his alleged role in the Antilia explosives and Mansukh Hirani murder cases, he told the investigators that Deshmukh had called him to his official residence and instructed him to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments. ED has also identified 24 private entities that are directly and indirectly controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money had moved among them without any rationale.“From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers and can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered based on an FIR by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him on April 21.CBI, in turn, started the probe after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that the NCP leader ran an “extortion racket” in Mumbai and had instructed some Mumbai Police officers to collect ₹100 crore for him every month from various establishments.Deshmukh has called the allegations false and claimed that Param Bir Singh levelled the accusations only after being shunted out from the Mumbai Police chief’s post for his poor handling of the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-fails-to-appear-before-ed-requests-to-record-his-statement-online-101624955836905.html

In Delhi, we buy power and provide electricity at the cheapest rates. Power is expensive in Punjab because there is a nexus between the government and (private) power companies.

Secondly, all pending bills of domestic connections will be written off. Thirdly, 24-hour supply will be ensured as the state has surplus power.”He clarified that free power is for domestic consumers with consumption of up to 300 units. If power consumption exceeds 300 units, the consumer will have to pay the bill.He said these were Kejriwal’s guarantees, not Capt’s (Amarinder Singh) promises. “As soon as the AAP government is formed, we will ensure free power and write off pending bills of consumers of domestic supply category,” Kejriwal declared.He was accompanied by state AAP president Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema, Punjab affairs in-charge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh and AAP spokesperson and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha besides former Indian Police Service officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.Will replicate Delhi model “I am sure these announcements will make everyone, particularly women, in Punjab happy,” the Delhi chief minister said.“We have done this in Delhi in six years where people get free power and the government and power companies are in profit. We will do it in Punjab in the same way. Yeh jadoo hai hamein hi karna aata hai (Only the AAP knows how to make this possible). I have done my calculations,” Kejriwal said.Free power will continue for farmers Farmers will continue to get it free and consumers of other categories will continue to get it at the present rate, Kejriwal said. “There is no dearth of money in Punjab, but it lacks a government with acchi neeyat (good intentions),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aiming-at-power-kejriwal-promises-punjab-free-electricity-101624955716781.html

29-06-2021||Delhi||Monsoon style: Fun, funky, frutilicious||If you have ever shied away from fruit prints thinking that they look kiddish, it’s time to change your mind. Fruit prints can inject a big dose of fun into your wardrobe. If done rightly, they look refreshing and cool and help make a chic style statement. Be it cherries, berries, banana, sliced coconut or watermelon, you can take your pick from a variety of cheerful, vibrant prints.Fruit prints are not new; they have been popular since 18th century. In old times, waistcoats were embroidered with berries on it. In the 1920s, abstract prints, which could be interpreted as cherries and berries became a fashion statement for the elite. In the 50s, dresses with cherries and strawberries were considered glam. In 1953, Christian Dior presented one of their jaw-dropping collections with berries, blueberries and strawberries. We keep seeing refreshing versions of fruit prints on the global runway with brands such as Dior, Gucci, D&G and others create jaw-dropping collections with delicious fruits every year.“The uniqueness of this print is that it is a part of nature but different from the run of the mill florals and animal prints. They signify a prosperous, comfortable lifestyle,” says fashion designer, Gautam Gupta. Designers have their own interpretation of this print. “Fruits, just like florals can have a beautifully poetic appeal on fabric and garments, given that its usage is done with a balance and restrain of making them look classic than overtly kitsch,” says fashion designer Karan Torani who has recently unveiled his latest collection with fruit prints.Fruit prints can be presented in various ways from quirky and fun to serious and elegant. “To ensure the prints don’t look childish, they can be made in seamless patterns and can be done in muted colours with a vintage, European feel. Also, while using bright colours is a good idea, it should not be overdone to avoid childish vibe. And toile fabric gives it a mature feel,” says Gupta. The right choice can enhance one’s entire look. Fashion designer Rina Dhaka, says, “Fruit prints were a big trend when I was growing up. In early 90’s, the tropical pineapple print, its leaves, cherries, little apples, even banana were the most popular. Now with the revival of trend and its recreation involving modern elements, you see its creative version that can totally cheer you up.”Wondering how to pick up the right prints? “If you like quirky and fun fruit prints, go for deep, dark backgrounds to bring out their vibrance and juiciness. If one is looking an elegant look, go for white, beige or off-white with toile prints or watercolour look prints. I guess cherries are the fruits everyone can safely try on, they fit in all moods,” says Gupta. Fashion designer Jenjum Gadi, says, “If you are road testing the look, go with the same pop colours of the fruits like orange, banana, yellow, peach while pairing it up. For a quirky look, play with lots of different fruits in an uneven abstract way to stand out.”Stylist Aakansha Kapoor shares a few tips to rock fruit prints:1. For a casual look, you can pair a fruit printed shirt or a crop top with plain trousers or a skirt.2. For your office/formal wear, you can pair small fruit printed shirt with jeans/pants.3. For your ideal beach vacation look, you can pair fruit printed dresses or T-shirts with shorts.4. To create a fun look, you can match your accessories with the same fruit print you are wearing.5. You can accessorize your fruit print outfits with neutral accessories like a bamboo bag.6. For a bolder look, go for print on print. A fruit printed shirt with striped/checked bottom can look great.7. Don’t go overboard when styling prints. Add a neutral element to your look.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/monsoon-style-fun-funky-frutilicious-101624952543504.html

No butter, no cheese… well your gym trainer will definitely be happy seeing you eat these,” says Chef Natasha Gandhi.The wrap consists of two components, the base and the filling inside. “The basic ingredients to make tortillas for a vegan wrap are wheat, salt, water and vegetable oil. Various other flours like millets, almond flour, white chickpea flour can also be considered. One can substitute lettuce with cabbage or steamed collard green to ramp up the flavor,” says culinary expert Vindhya Karwa of Vinsplate. All kinds of seeds and plant roots can be used to create flour for the wraps. “One can also experiment with soya base, amaranth flour, ragi and jowar flour too,” says chef Juliano Rodrigues, general manager of Out of The Blue. For filling one can also pick up from a variety of options. “From the point of using Asian elements, one can stuff with pickled radish and pock choy to using tofu and miso. Indian food such as mock cottage cheese, pickled mangoes, pickled lotus stems can also be used,” says chef Rajdeep Kapoor, executive chef ITC Maurya.Making them with the right blend of ingredients is all one has to do. “One can go wild with the color of the tortilla sheet, maybe by making a purple cabbage or a beetroot cheela to make it purple, a spinach infused chapatti for a green outer layer or even a tomato infused tortilla for a red colored wrap. Using thinly sliced zucchini is also something that one can try to make fresh zucchini wraps. When it comes to fillings, one can flavor their wraps with anything from anywhere in the world, be it a Thai filling or a raw mango – coconut filling, there are absolutely no boundaries to limit imagination,” says chef Rajesh Singh, executive sous chef, Taj Mahal, New Delhi.They’re the best place for your leftovers and help minimise food waste. “You need to create a good sauce or chutney as base, layer your left over veggies, add some pickled vegetables like onion beets and cabbage, some spices and I would recommend folding the edges and cooking it on the pan till it’s heated and crispy. I personally do this whenever there is a vegetable I don’t like, but you can totally do this with leftover gajar matar sabji or pav bhaji or even some bhindi,” says Gandhi.A wrap is evidently incomplete without a sauce and the best sauces to go in a wrap are vegan. “A simple cilantro-jalapeno sauce with a cashew paste base or a spicy mexican style adobo dressing can help get the heat levels high. Something as simple as an arugula pesto or a raw mango-coconut sauce can still help get the perfectly balanced wrap. If you have a flair for Japanese food, a must try is the vegan-wasabi sauce,” says Singh.Recipe Gluten-free Tortillas Ingredients 1/2 Cup millet flour (Ragi in one and Jowar in second ) 1/2 cup boiling water 2 tbsp tapioca starch Salt as per taste Process In a bowl add the flour and starch and knead with hot boiling water. Add the water gradually and knead into a medium soft dough. Let the dough rest for 5-7 mins Shape into equal sized balls and roll into thin round sheetsToss them onto a hot pan and cook on medium heat from both sides. Transfer to a plate once cooked on both sidesFor the FillingsLoad your Wrap with hummus or labneh as base, boiled kidney beans or chickpeas in a tomato sauce, swap the rice with cooked quinoa and top with a refreshing mango salsa and greens. by chef Natasha Gandhi Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories in Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/its-a-wrap-go-vegan-with-these-beauties-101624952258811.html

We have managed to keep the herd in the Tundi forest area by training the villagers who have been armed with equipment such as search lights. We have also been tracking the movement of the lone tusker all along, alerting villagers on the route,” said Jharkhand chief wildlife warden Rajiv Ranjan.Also Read | Chhattisgarh: 3 forest officials removed, 2 suspended over elephant’s deathThe elephant reached Sahebganj district from where it almost retraced its steps to return to Tundi forest area. On the way to Sahebganj from Tundi in Dhanbad, it crossed four other districts of Jamtara, Deoghar, Dumka and Pakur.The distance by road from Tundi to Sahebganj is over 250 kilometres, making the total distance covered by the stray tusker at least 500 kilometres as animals tend to drift.Now that the tusker has reached closer to its herd, the officials are trying to lead it to its family. “As of now, it is in the Tundi mountainous pocket. We are trying to make it join the herd which is stationed in the Tundi forest area. However, that is tricky as it would depend on the herd to accept the tusker back,” said Rajiv Ranjan.Finding a way out for the elephant in case it is rejected by its herd would depend on its behaviour, said Ranjan. “It is not easy to tranquilise and move such a big animal from dense forest areas. If it goes wild, the other possibility would be to shoot it down. But that is the last option for us as we have been trying to lead it back to its herd,” said Ranjan.The last time the forest department was forced to kill an elephant was in 2017 in Sahebganj. Another tusker was killed in 2008 in Bokaro, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lone-tusker-may-join-herd-after-over-500km-trek-through-6-jharkhand-dists-101624948579230.html

He claimed that his party’s stand against the farm laws passed by Parliament has led to the attack.During the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), AAP leaders claimed they are not being given enough oxygen to treat critical patients. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too joined the attack and blamed the BJP-ruled central government of not paying heed to their demands.The BJP, on the other hand, alleged that the oxygen supply issue was exaggerated by the AAP leaders. The party leaders shared an interim report by a sub-group under the Supreme Court-appointed committee to audit oxygen utilisation in the national capital. The BJP leaders alleged that the actual requirement was much less than what was claimed by the ruling party in Delhi.There has also been sparring among the two parties over law and order situation int he national capital.

29-06-2021||Kolkata||Two more arrested in fake vaccination racket in Kolkata||Two more persons were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the fake vaccination racket that was busted by the Kolkata Police last week. Police had earlier arrested four persons including the mastermind, Debanjan Deb, 28, who had been impersonating an IAS officer for the past four months to organise fake vaccination camps. The two arrested persons have been identified as Kanchan Deb, 37 and Sarat Patra, 52. While Patra had earlier worked under a doctor and was hired by Debanjan Deb to administer the fake injections to people, Kanchan Deb is Debanjan Deb’s cousin. “Kanchan Deb had knowledge about the fraud from the beginning. He even used to cheat Debanjan Deb,” said a senior police official. Till now sleuths have found transactions of over ₹2 crore in just one year in the bank account maintained by Debanjan Deb. Also Read | Debanjan Deb: Saga of conman who spent his money to run fake vaccination camps“He had taken a loan of ₹20 lakh from a private bank using forged documents. He had procured items such as mask and sanitiser worth ₹1.2 crore from a stockiest but never paid him. He hired employees who had to pay him for getting the job,” said the officer. Earlier police had found that Debanjan Ded had cheated at least two private firms and a contractor of nearly ₹1 crore, impersonating a senior IAS officer. Investigation so far has found Debanjan Deb had organised at least two fake vaccination camps in Kolkata, in which over 800 people, including Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mimi Chakraborty and family members of another TMC leader received the fake jabs. In one camp, police suspects the victims were given Amikacin, an antibiotic. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation and state health department organised health camps to conduct health check-up of the victims. While the Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded a CBI probe alleging that the mastermind had close links with senior TMC leaders, including ministers, MPs and MLAs, the ruling party leaders have rubbished the charges saying they might have come across Debanjan Deb in public programmes where it is not possible to check the credentials of each and every person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/two-more-arrested-in-fake-vaccination-racket-in-kolkata-101624944196277.html

The other man was associated with a doctor of the Taltala area and assisting Deb in administering the fake Covid-19 vaccines to the people who came to the camps," he said.The investigators also found that Deb as an "IAS officer" even conducted a raid near his office in the Kasba area after getting information that adulterated petrol was being sold, the police officer said. A report about the raid was published in a newspaper with Deb's photograph, he said."He had also conducted an election where his employees cast votes. After the election, he declared himself the winner and also got that news published, mentioning that he won in West Bengal Employees Federation elections," the officer said.Deb was arrested last week for masquerading as the joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and operating dubious immunisation camps.

The state reported 980 cases last week (June 21-27) as compared to 1,557 the week before (June 14-20).The virus curve has been flattening after 11 weeks of devastation when the contagion spread was at its peak in May. The state had registered a weekly six-digit infection tally and more than 2,000 deaths during the period.There are now 1,593 active cases in the state and 698 patients are in home isolation. Seventeen districts have less than 100 active cases and nine have less than 50 active cases. Statistics show that only five districts - Hisar, Sirsa, Panipat, Gurugram and Bhiwani have more than 100 active cases.Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan, however, warned against complacency. Vardhan said he has advised health authorities to conduct special sampling drives in places with high-population density such as colleges, offices, shopping malls and industrial establishments.“We should not lower our guard. At least 50,000 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antigen tests (RAT) should be conducted every day,’’ the chief secretary said.Despite the decline, the cumulative positivity rate for 15 districts continued to be in the critical category (more than 6%). Nuh is the only district with a positivity rate less than 2 %. The high cumulative positivity rate, officials said, was indicative of the virulent impact of the contagion during the second wave. “It will take many weeks of decline in infection to get the cumulative positivity rate in the desirable category,’’ said an official.Statistics show that loss of lives due to the virus-induced illness has also come down with 139 fatalities being reported last weeks. The number of fatalities had shot up in May when 2,199 deaths were reported in the first two week. Hisar with over 1,000 deaths has the highest number of cumulative fatalities, followed by Gurugram (896), Faridabad (716), Bhiwani (578), Karnal (540), Panipat (536), Jind (511) and Ambala (508).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-spread-ebbs-in-haryana-less-than-1-000-cases-in-a-week-101624934537337.html

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Mustard oil subsidy will be transferred after 2 months: Haryana govt||The Haryana government on Monday said it will start transferring mustard oil subsidy into the bank accounts of beneficiaries after two months. The food department attributed the delay in transferring subsidy to a mismatch in the bank account numbers of beneficiaries and the lack of a bank account number in some cases. Earlier this month, the Haryana government had stopped the monthly supply of mustard oil and salt through ration depots among 11.40 lakh beneficiaries, saying mustard oil was not available with the HAFED due to a steep rise in prices. The state government had announced that it will transfer ₹250 in lieu of two litre mustard oil as subsidy into the bank accounts of eligible families. The process of transferring the mustard oil subsidy, the government had said, will continue until mustard oil became available with HAFED. However, on Monday the state government said: “The dues of mustard oil would be deposited in the (bank) accounts of the eligible beneficiaries in about two months through DBT.” An official spokesperson said the food department is “working on war footing” to obtain bank account numbers of the eligible beneficiaries whose data is not available in the department’s ration card database to release the dues. “Besides, wrong or incomplete bank account numbers are also being rectified so that eligible beneficiaries can easily get DBT benefits,” the spokesperson said. The government said that due to lockdown the supplier was unable to arrange 1kg packing of salt in June, due to which salt was not distributed. “Now, 1kg packing of salt has been arranged and its distribution will take place in the month of July,” the spokesperson said, adding that government does not provide subsidy on salt as it is bought in bulk and distributed at low prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mustard-oil-subsidy-will-be-transferred-after-2-months-haryana-govt-101624933638685.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||DSR technique: Haryana govt yet to pay ₹5k per acre incentive promised in 2019||KARNAL The Haryana government has announced a cash incentive to encourage farmers to adopt direct seeding of rice as opposed to transplanting seedlings from the nursery. However, farmers who had opted for this method in 2019 are still waiting for the ₹5,000 per acre incentive promised by the government. The government collectively owes 1,685 farmers in the three major paddy-growing districts of Kaithal, Karnal and Kurukshetra around ₹2 crore, as per reports. Officials of the state agriculture department said the delay in disbursement of incentives has discouraged farmers from opting for this method, which consumes 50% less water as compared to the traditional method of paddy cultivation.With the technique receiving a tepid response from farmers, the government had announced an incentive of ₹5,000 on demonstration plots of around 30,000 acres in eight districts under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. Applications of interested farmers had been invited online. As per data obtained from the state agriculture department, the state owes ₹1.12 crore to 934 farmers, of which 104 are women, for opting for the DSR technique over 934 acres in Kaithal; ₹47.67 lakh is owed to 504 farmers in Karnal, while 234 farmers who grew paddy over 736 acres with this technique are owed ₹36.80 lakh.Officials monitoring the project said payments had not been disbursed amid reports of fake registrations. Several farmers applied for the scheme but did not opt for it. District-level officials have submitted their reports to the head office after the ground-level physical verification but the file was stuck as top-level officials say there are some discrepancies in their field survey.Haryana Agriculture Department additional director Surinder Dahiya said disbursement of incentives was delayed as there were some internal issues in the field survey, which has been conveyed to district-level officers. This year, the Haryana government has announced a cash incentive of ₹ 5,000 per acre to farmers of eight districts opting for DSR technique. A target of 20,000 acres, including 4,000 acre in Kaithal; 3,000 acre each in Karnal and Kurukshetra and 2,000 acre each in Sonepat, Panipat, Jind, Ambala and Yamunanagar has been set.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsrtechnique-haryana-govt-yet-to-pay-5k-per-acre-incentive-promised-in-2019-101624933516401.html

29-06-2021||Delhi||28-year-old held with heroin worth ₹1.5 crore||Delhi Police on Monday said they have arrested a 28-year-old man allegedly with one kilogram of heroin, worth around ₹1.5 crore in the international market, from outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar -- one of the 15 areas in Delhi recently identified by the police as a hot spot for drug peddling.The accused, Irfan Saifi alias Bona, was previously involved in 11 criminal cases including robbery, snatching and vehicle theft, said DCP (crime and narcotic cell) Chinmoy Biswal.On June 23, the DCP said, they received information that Ifran would visit Satsang Wali Gali in Nihal Vihar to deliver heroin and accordingly, a trap was laid and he was caught.“A plastic bag, tied to his bike, contained one kilogram of heroin. Irfan was arrested under the NDPS Act. His bike was also seized,” the DCP added.Investigators said Irfan is the brother of Shakeel Saifi, a former RPI leader at whose farmhouse in Nihal Vihar a firing incident had taken place last year. When contacted, Shakeel confirmed said that he had disowned his brother because of his drug addiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/28yearold-held-with-heroin-worth-rs-1-5-crore-101624924980221.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi puts out tenders for new liquor retail licences||The Delhi government on Monday floated tenders for appointing new licensees for retail sale of liquor in the national capital, paving the way for a range of sweeping reforms to boost the city’s revenue, to crack down on the liquor mafia and improve user experience under the new state excise policy, documents seen by HT showed.Under the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, the city has been divided into 32 zones and allotment of licenses will be on a zonal basis. On Monday, the state excise department issued e-tenders for stakeholders to apply for L-7Z and L-7V licences which are meant for retail sale of Indian and foreign liquor (except country liquor) in Delhi. The department floated 32 e-tenders, one for each zone.“With these tenders, we can say that the city administration has formally started the process of bringing in liquor reforms in Delhi. The Delhi government’s objective is to allow responsible players of the industry to carry out trade transparently without resorting to any proxy model. It aims to ensure equitable access to liquor supply to all the wards or areas of Delhi so that there are no areas with no shops or few sellers,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity.Under the new policy, business hours have been fixed at between 10am to 10pm, while those at the airport may open round-the-clock. The government has kept the annual reserve licence fee (which will subsume all existing taxes and other charges) for the 30 zones under the three municipal corporations between ₹220-228 crore per zone. For the 31st zone, which is the NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board area, the fee will be Rs217 crore, while the zone 32 (airport zone), will have an annual reserve licence fee of ₹105 crore, the document showed.However, liquor retailers in the city said the government has floated the tenders without making the final Delhi excise policy document public. “While the tender document claims that the new excise policy has been approved by the Delhi government, we could not find the document anywhere on its website. It is expected to be made available tomorrow. In the absence of the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021 being made public, potential bidders like us want more clarity on the license regime such as fixation of MRPs, rate of VAT/excise see subsumed, retailer margin, etc,” said Naresh Goyal, a retailer licensee and president of Delhi liquor traders association.The tender documents stated that bidders will have to pay a non-refundable fee of ₹10 lakh and an earnest money deposit (EMD) of ₹30 crore, if applying for one zone; and ₹60 crore, if bidding for two or more zones. The pre-bid meeting has been scheduled for July 6. Until now, the EMD was ₹8 lakh. Officials said by increasing the EMD amount manifold, the government wants to ensure that only the big and premium players get involved in Delhi’s retail liquor trade, and curb proxy ownership, brand pushing and corruption.However, this does not mean that the existing retail vends or retail licences will become invalid. On June 10, the excise department extended licences of all retail liquor vends in Delhi for three more months till September 30. It stated that all licences are being renewed as per the existing rules for now because “the government of NCT of Delhi has approved the new Excise Policy 2021-22, which is likely to be implemented in the next three months”. Rather, the existing retailers will also be able participate in the tender and may bid for any zones, said the official.The tenders are also significant because as per the new excise policy, the Delhi government will completely exit the retail sale of liquor. So, all existing retail licences — L6, L6FG, L6FE — will not be renewed as these were meant for government liquor vends. However, country liquor vends will operate till the new country liquor policy is framed.Delhi has 849 liquor stores, of which 276 are run by private entities. The rest are run by the state government. Under the new policy, the government will keep the total number of vends intact, reshuffling them to ensure a more equitable distribution across 272 municipal wards in the city, the New Delhi Municipal Council area and the airport, which has been classified as a ‘special zone’.“Any private legal entity or individual who has proof of filing Income Tax Returns for the last three years (2018-19, 2019-20 & 2020-21) is eligible to participate in the bid. The entity willing to participate in the tender for retail vends in one zone should have a net worth of at least ₹6 crore, and of at least ₹12 crore for more than one zone. No manufacturer or wholesale (L-1) licence holder will be eligible to bid for retail zone/vend or vice versa. Similarly, the retail licence holder should not have any manufacturing facilities/distilleries/breweries/in India or abroad either directly or through any sister concerns/related entities,” the documents stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-puts-out-tenders-for-new-liquor-retail-licences-101624923178745.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The backpacker’s last stop||The white walls are covered with handwritten scrawls in Russian, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch, French, German, Arabic, Portuguese, Thai, Italian, and English. There are drawings too — a woman’s face, a Turkish darvesh, a peaceful tiger, a mermaid with Medusa-like hair, an auto (in its customary green), a map of Canada, a man with tree roots as his torso.This is the small, dimly lit lobby of a backpackers’ hostel in Paharganj. The sights on the walls are the souvenirs of the many travellers who have passed through it over the years. Among the budget hotels of Paharganj, this hostel — its entrance is so unremarkable that nobody might notice it unless one is actively looking for it — is a dormitory filled with bunk beds (laundry service provided). The hostel has been empty of foreigners since the coronavirus pandemic hit the world early last year, and India stopped giving tourist visas. There’s no Indian guest either for the moment.This afternoon, reading the scrawls on the wall produces awe, as if one had encountered the remains of a vanished civilisation. Some are messages from one traveller to another, some are attestations of love for India, some travellers just wrote down their names to immortalise their fleeting presence, and some just don’t make any sense. There’s also a poem by Emily Dickinson.Frankly, most lines have the sort of wisdom available on the backs of the painted trucks that roar down the Delhi-Jaipur highway. Even so, these handwritten words must be recorded to commemorate Paharganj’s recent past. In today’s difficult times, there’s no knowing of the future of such a place. And the owner, who doesn’t wish himself and his property to be identified, is planning to repaint these walls. Here’s a very brief selection from the many scrawls in English. Read and weep.“I take India in my skin”“Sakoora, you my one and only”“The future is female”“That it will never come againIs what makes life so sweet—Emily Dickinson”“Thank you for asking DuDu for me to train station”“I love you India…don’t ever change!!!—Mara, Canada”“This too shall pass”“Don’t think, just go”“Forever in my heart—Elly”“After three weeks in India, things to say:Don’t worry, be happyNo hurry, no worryNo chicken, no curry”“I love Waseem!”“Go travel now!—from Julio in Texas”“Shall we move?”“—Asha—Steph—Gracie—Trisha—Emma—Eimear—Godge—Ellie”“Rancho Poiema was here”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-backpacker-s-last-stop-101624921943063.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds just 59 new cases of Covid, fewest in a day since April 15 last year||The national capital on Monday added 59 new cases of Covid-19, as infections continue to plummet to levels not seen since the initial phase of the pandemic in April last year, while latest deaths due to the disease also fell to a 100-day low, showed the state government’s health bulletin.As daily infections dropped, the Covid-19 test positivity rate on Monday fell to 0.10% —the lowest ever in Delhi.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a positivity rate below 5% for at least a two-week period for an outbreak to be considered under control in a region. The positivity rate in Delhi has been below this threshold for 39 days. Of these, it has spent the last 29 days below the 1% mark.This number stayed below 1% for 82 days during the lull in cases, between December last year and March this year, after the November wave.The Capital also logged two more deaths of the infection, showed Monday’s health bulletin, the fewest fatalities in a day since March 21 this year, when just one person succumbed to the viral infection. The city has now added an average of six daily deaths over the past week.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore, said, “Delhi has almost reached the endemic levels as majority of the population seems to have been exposed to Covid-19 already. A sero survey result at this point will help a lot to decide the course of action for the coming months. Also, at no point should mask wearing be taken lightly and vaccination should be accelerated,” he said.Delhi last added fewer than 59 cases 440 days ago — on April 15, 2020, the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak in the national capital, and three weeks after the Union government put in place a hard lockdown across the country to stem the spread of the illness. Further, Covid-19 testing infrastructure was in a nascent stage at that point and far fewer tests were conducted in a day than they are now.The seven-day average of cases, also known as case trajectory, fell to 100 on Monday. This number has now dropped for 59 days in a row and is now at its lowest since end-April last year. Delhi added an average of 96 new cases a day in the seven-days ending April 22, 2020.Delhi administered 204,586 doses of Covid vaccines till 10.30pm on Monday -- just short of the record 207,000 doses given on Saturday. However, only 9,563 persons were inoculated on Sunday.On Sunday, AAP MLA Atishi said the Delhi government has informed the Centre that the city needs 4.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in July to keep up the current vaccination rate of 1.5 lakh jabs daily.According to Atishi, 25% of Delhi’s population in the 18-45 age group has received at least one dose of vaccine. At least 9.2 million people in this age group are eligible for vaccination in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-just-59-new-cases-of-covid-fewest-in-a-day-since-april-15-last-year-101624918430835.html
29-06-2021||Gurugram||Leopard dies in suspected road accident||A two-year-old female leopard was found dead on the Pali-Surajkund road early on Monday, with autopsy reports suggesting it could have been hit by a vehicle, officials of the forest department said.Raj Kumar, the divisional forest officer for Faridabad, said, “The carcass of the two-year-old female leopard was sent for a post-mortem examination, which suggests that it died due to a head injury after being hit by a vehicle around 4am on Monday.”The incident was reported by traffic police around 10.15am, following which a team of the forest department staff collected the carcass.The stretch from where the leopard’s carcass was recovered is an ecologically sensitive area, as it is flanked by the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary on both sides.“We cannot call it a leopard corridor as such, but there is significant movement of leopards in the region. This is the first such case to be reported this year but roadkill incidents have been seen in this region before. Last year in October, a leopard was killed in a road accident near Mangar village on Gurugram-Faridabad road,” Kumar said.Officials said they could not identify the vehicle due to the absence of CCTV cameras on the busy road, which cuts through a forest area.A case is yet to be registered in the matter, as it is difficult to trace those responsible due to lack of surveillance, officials said.Wildlife experts said the place where the carcass was found has a sharp bend and the authorities need to put in place safety measures to protect animals.Sunil Harsana, a wildlife researcher from Mangar village in Faridabad, said, “The spot where the carcass was found is a fragmented forest area, as the road cuts through the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. At such a place, if the animal has to cross the road, it will first jump off a wall, reach the road and jump another wall to enter the forest. Due to this fragmentation, such roadkill incidents take place. We have been requesting the forest department to take measures, such as creating an underpass or installing rumble strips so that vehicles slow down on the stretch.”Besides the road cutting through the forest, heavy encroachments in villages of Ankhir and Mewla-Maharajpur that fall in the vicinity compound the problems for animals, experts said.Chetan Agarwal, a city-based environment analyst, said, “The forests in that whole area has been fragmented with roads and illegally built farmhouses, the walls of which impede the movement of animals. In the past five years, many such cases of leopard depths have been reported from roads in the Aravallis.”A monkey was also found dead at the same stretch on Monday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/leopard-dies-in-suspected-road-accident-101624917347947.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||No stay on order allowing schools to levy annual fees||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Delhi high court order that allows private schools in Delhi to collect annual charges and development fee for 2021-22, ruling that the state cannot be aggrieved with an arrangement between the schools and parents.“How the state is aggrieved in a matter between private schools and (parents of) students…State is not concerned according to us,” a three-judge bench of the top court led by Justice AM Khanwilkar said on the appeal by the city government’s education department against orders passed by the Delhi high court.A single judge of the Delhi high court on May 31 set aside the Directorate of Education’s (DoE) orders on April 18, 2020 and August 28, 2020 that sought to restrict private, unaided schools from collecting annual charges and development fees due to the Covid-19 situation.The DoE rushed to the division bench of the high court in appeal against the May 31 ruling and asked the two-judge bench to stay the court order but the judges declined the request and posted the case for further hearing on July 12.Since the high court order enabled schools to collect annual charges (subject to deduction of 15 per cent) to be payable in six monthly instalments beginning June this year, the DoE filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court to seek a stay.At Monday’s hearing, senior advocate Vikas Singh, who was representing the Delhi government, reasoned that parents were being harassed on account of the high court stay on its orders. “I (state) am the repository of students. Who will represent the innocent children? Do you want lakhs of parents to be in court? There should be a stay on the (HC) judgment. Parents are being subjected to harassment.”Around 450 private schools, who secured the order from the Delhi high court under the banner Action Committee for Unaided Recognized Private Schools, argued against a stay order.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, who represented the schools’ body, said the high court was yet to form a conclusive view of the matter.The June 7 order of the high court had emphasised that staying the single judge’s order “without a deeper examination of the facts would only compromise with the ability of these schools to continue serving this critical function.” The schools agreed to continue charging the fees collected by them during the past year. The Delhi Public School Society, also represented by senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, supported this submission of private schools.While declining any immediate relief to the Delhi government, the Supreme Court noted that the government can argue its appeal before the high court which was slated to hear the plea on July 12.“The dismissal of the special leave petition (SLP) is not to be treated as an opinion on the correctness of the high court order or the contentions raised by the parties,” Justice Khanwilkar said.The high court’s May 31 order was a blow to the powers of the DoE to direct schools not to collect annual and development fees. This power was vested under the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 and the accompanying Rules. The Delhi government argued that if schools were collecting full tuition fees, there was no need to collect annual and development fees as only 40-60% of the tuition fee component was getting utilized to pay salary to teachers and staff.The high court, however, relied on a Supreme Court order in May 2021 where the top court allowed private schools in Rajasthan to collect annual fees in six monthly instalments after deducting 15% and applied it as it is to the context of Delhi schools.Senior advocate Vikas Singh argued that the high court got it wrong as the top court’s judgment related to schools which had partially reopened and were stopped from charging even tuition fees by the Rajasthan government which invoked its powers under the Disaster Management Act. Further, the Supreme Court order in this case was passed under Article 142 of the Constitution, a power exclusively reserved for the Supreme Court and not the high courts, Singh added.In the May 31 order, the high court judge, however, pointed out that even when schools were physically shut, they incurred expenses like rents, taxes, travelling, conveyance, insurance charges, remuneration of auditors, repair and maintenance of building and maintenance of equipment, furniture and fixtures. This became the basis to set aside the DoE orders of April 2020 and August 2020.Delhi government officials did not respond to requests for comment.SK Bhattacharya, president of the action committee unaided recognised private schools-- an umbrella body of over 400 private schools in Delhi-- that had challenged the Delhi government order in the high court said, “Its a big relief for schools. The recent Covid situation has brought schools to the verge of closure as they were finding it difficult to meet essential expenditure such as salaries. Several schools can now pay salary to their staff only by charging the annual fee and development funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-stay-on-order-allowing-schools-to-levy-annual-fees-101624914419409.html

He assured us that our demands will be fulfilled. We have called off the strike and hope that the authorities will roll back their decision.” “NPA comprised 25% of our basic salary. However, the Sixth Pay Commission, which aims to better our pay scale, has reduced the component to 20% of our basic salary. It has even de-linked NPA from the basic salary,” Dr Rampal added. Earlier during the day, members of the Joint Punjab Government Doctors Coordination Committee, comprising general physicians, specialists, rural medical officers, homeopaths, and ayurveda specialists, staged a protest at the civil hospital. On the call of the Punjab Civil Medical Services (PCMS) Association, several services such as outpatient departments (OPDs), inpatient departments (IPDs), unique IDs for persons with disabilities (UDID), Ayushman Bharat - Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-SSBY), and elective surgeries remained suspended as around 400 doctors employed at the civil hospitals in Ludhiana, Khanna and Jagraon, and 10 community health centres boycotted work. Government-run dispensaries remained closed as well. A visit to the civil hospital at 11 am revealed that the few patients, who had turned up at the hospital, had to return home without getting treated as no doctor was available due to the strike. Kavita Kumari from Shahpur Road, who visited the mother and child hospital with her husband for check-up, was asked to visit again as doctors were not available. 50-year-old Bhagat Ram, who works in the factory, visited the civil hospital for treatment on Monday. He said, “I had slipped from the roof and suffered injuries so was rushed to the hospital but because the doctors were observing a strike, I had to go to a private hospital. I don’t understand why the government wants to implement rules that are not in favour of the employees. These protests and strikes ultimately make the common mam suffer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-doctors-call-off-strike-after-principal-secretary-s-assurance-101624910359955.html

BJP had announced that its workers would protest outside the houses of 62 Congress councillors on Monday. In that course, a protest was also staged outside the house of Gurcharandeep. While BJP workers were raising slogans against Congress, the councillor and his supporters started raising slogans against them and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Both parties entered into a scuffle, following which BJP leaders led by district president Pushpinder Singal staged a protest at Salem Tabri police station seeking action against the Congress leaders. A few Congress councillors and interim district president Ashwani Sharma also reached the spot following which both the parties reached a compromise. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Gurbinder Singh said that no formal complaint was received from any of the sides. While the Congress councillors stated that the resolution to revoke the exemption was suspended by the mayor on Sunday, BJP accused Congress of befooling the public ahead of assembly elections. BJP district president, Pushpinder Singal stated, “Mayor Balkar Sandhu is befooling the public ahead of assembly elections by announcing the exemption has been reinstated as the resolution can only be revoked by the MC general house. The BJP will continue the protest until the resolution is revoked. The mayor should call a meeting of MC general house over the issue.”Meanwhile, mayor Sandhu stated the resolution was approved by the general house of MC which also includes BJP councillors and an announcement has already been made to revoke the resolution.“BJP is trying to gain political mileage and is befooling the public. I have already announced the reinstatement of exemption and bills are not being issued against houses up to 125 sq yd area now. The resolution will also be tabled during the next meeting of MC general house,” he said.Starting this financial year, the MC had revoked the water-sewer fee exemption for houses upto 125 yards area and increased the water-sewer tariff by upto 60% for different categories. Only the houses with area upto 50 sq yards with only ground floor were exempted from water-sewer charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-water-sewer-tariff-cong-bjp-leaders-enter-into-scuffle-in-ludhiana-101624910358538.html

On June 21, the price of petrol was 98.82 per litre. This was the fourth consecutive hike in the last seven days.The price of diesel also rose in the district by 60 paise. It has now reached ₹91.52.Protesting against the diesel price hike, city transporters observed ‘Black Day’ on the call of All India Motor Transport Congress on Monday and submitted a memorandum to deputy commission (DC) Varinder Sharma. The memorandum was addressed to PM Narendra Modi and Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal.Seeking a reduction in prices, the transporters, under the banner of Ludhiana Goods Transport Association (LGTA), demanded that the union government should reduce the excise duty while, the state government should reduce VAT.They rued that diesel rates had increased by around ₹30 since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. They said the price of diesel in the state was around ₹62 per litre last year, and now it has reached ₹91.52.The transporters across the country have announced an indefinite ‘Chakka jam’ from August if fuel prices are not reduced by the government.LGTA president Didar Singh and general secretary JP Singh said that operations of 50% of the trucks have been put to a halt by the transporters as they are not being able to cover the expenses. JP Singh said, “The freight prices have gone down due to low demand in the market and the expenses are increasing due to hike in diesel rates and rising inflation. The transporters are struggling to make ends meet but the government is not paying heed to their problems. If these circumstances continue then the sector will not be able to survive.”Chairman Charan Singh Lohara said, “Around 20 crore people are associated with the sector across the country. AIMTC has now announced indefinite ‘Chakka Jam’ from August if the government fails to reduce the prices by July end. A month’s ultimatum has been given to the government. We have also demanded that the price of fuel should be uniform across the country.”PS Bhogal, professor, Arya College, said, “Petrol has crossed ₹100 benchmark in Ludhiana. Diesel prices are also rising fast. Soon it too will cross the ₹100 benchmark. The union government’s financial mismanagement is visible. We know that petrol and diesel are heavily taxed and this is fuelling inflation in the country thereby making the life of a common man tough in such times. The union government’s unresponsive attitude over such development is deplorable. Civil society must rise against such bullish attitude.”Parambir Singh, teacher, Malwa Khalsa Senior Secondary School, said, “Instead of providing employment to people, the government is only earning profit. It is also becoming very difficult for us to maintain our families. The means of transport are proving to be expensive, while our salaries aren’t increasing at all. It seems the government wants the common people to be forced to travel on foot.”Narinder Kaur Grewal, a resident of Lalton Kalan, said, “Rising fuel prices increase rates of other commodities as well and therefore disturb the entire household budget. We have to shell out more daily to buy necessary items. It will also delay the recovery of our economy as it directly impacts the consumption levels of the common people.”Meera Nagpal assistant professor at PU Regional Centre, said, “The hike will affect everyone, especially the salaried class, as the income doesn’t seem to be increasing even as the expenses are on a rise. The officials should also ensure that prices of fuels do not vary from state to state and are stabilized at the national level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/surge-in-fuel-prices-ludhiana-transporters-observe-black-day-residents-also-express-resentment-101624910357227.html

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||PAU appeals public to donate artefacts for its rural life museum||The College of Community Science at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has made an appeal to the public to donate traditional Punjabi kitchen utensils, agricultural implements, handicrafts, furnishings and textiles, musical instruments, equipment and decorative pieces for display at its Museum of Rural Life of Punjab. The appeal comes almost two months after thieves had struck at the museum and decamped with 141 items of 39 various types. Among the stolen items were 12 brass bells of three different sizes, brass utensils and traditional jewellery. Police said the burglars had stolen 52 items from Room number 1, 47 items from Room 2, 12 items from Room 5, four items from Room 6 and 26 items from the Phulkari section.The theft had taken place when the varsity was closed for outsiders and entry was allowed only from Gate Number 4. PAU officials had found out about the theft on April 19 when the varsity reopened. They, however, waited for two days before filing a complaint on April 21. On April 26, the police had apprehended a youth, who was said to be the son of a Class-4 employee working at the varsity. They had recovered two brass plates from him, but the authorities said the recovered articles that did not belong to the museum. According to the university, the stolen items were antique and some of those were centuries-old artwork depicting life in rural Punjab. The police had questioned the staff and the lone security guard who was deployed at the museum when the theft had come to the light. The cops had also quizzed PAU officials over the “poor” security measures and absence of CCTV cameras at the museum. However, even after two months, cops have failed to make any headway in the case. Sandeep Bains, dean, College of Community Science, said the museum is built in an “old-style architecture to look like a respectable house of the 18th Century”. “PAU is the only university in India to have a museum like this,” she added. However, she maintained that they usually ask people to donate traditional valuables and artefacts and the latest request has nothing to do with the theft. Bains said the museum has a collection of old farmsteads, cottages and mills portraying the living conditions. Stating that the museum showcases the rich cultural heritage of Punjab, she said the university will highly acknowledge the contribution people make in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pau-appeals-public-to-donate-artefacts-for-its-rural-life-museum-101624910295034.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Commuters bear the brunt as roadways contractual staffers go on strike||Commuters at Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal were a harried lot after Punjab Roadways (Punbus) contractual employees went on a three-day strike across the state starting Monday, slamming brakes on the movement of over 200 roadways and PRTC buses. Protesting against the state government over its ‘failure’ in regularising them, the contractual staffers also closed the bus stand for around two hours and staged a demonstration against the government. Meanwhile, commuters were seen looking for alternative mode of transport to reach their respective destinations. Jasmeet Singh, one of the passengers, who was supposed to travel to Dhuri, said, “I have been waiting for a bus for the last around half an hour. Roadways buses are not running and private buses are not available at present. One of the private operators has assured that one bus will depart for Dhuri in 15 minutes and I have been left with no other option than to wait for it.” Chaotic scenes were witnessed outside the bus stand as private bus operators continued their services from there for the time period when the bus stand was closed. Some of the commuters also complained that they charged extra fare from them. Another commuter waiting for a bus to Patiala, Gurjit Singh, said, “The employees should protest for their rights, but they should ensure that public does not face any harassment. We are forced to travel in private buses and their operators charge extra ₹10- ₹20 when the public bus services are suspended.” Meanwhile, authorities said that 25 buses were run by the department on Chandigarh, Amritsar, Barnala and a few other routes through the permanent staff of roadways, but the services at most of the routes remained suspended due to strike.Station supervisor Kuljit Singh Sodhi said, “We have permanent staff to run only 25 buses, while rest of the buses were put to halt due to the strike announced by contractual employees. The government is in talks with the union to end the strike.”Women passengers wait for free serviceMany women passengers were seen waiting for the public bus service to resume to travel free of cost. One of the residents of Sangrur, Manjit Kaur, said, “We had planned to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple and seven of us, including five women, took a roadways bus to Ludhiana from Sangrur in the morning. We had to change our bus from Ludhiana, but we are stuck here due to the strike. If we opt for a private bus now, we will have to pay the fare for all seven of us, which will cost us around ₹1,000 extra. We are waiting for roadways services to resume towards Amritsar, otherwise we will have to go back.” ‘Will protest outside CM’s residence today’Slamming the state government for not paying heed to their demands, state vice-president of Roadways/Punbus Contractual Employees Union Satnam Singh and district vice-president Gurpreet Singh said the three day strike will continue till June 30.They added that the union will stage a protest outside of the residence of Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in Patiala on June 29. The employees said that many of them have been working with the department for over a decade, but the government has failed to regularise their services despite making promises during the last assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-commuters-bear-the-brunt-as-roadways-contractual-staffers-go-on-strike-101624910234984.html

The apex court had observed that the accused has a right to hearing of his application for bail and the denial of the same is an infringement of his rights and liberty. According to Gaba, his bail plea is pending since February 28, 2020, and the request for an hearing was not entertained by the high court in view of restricted functioning of courts owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. During the hearing on Tuesday, the high court bench of Justice Rajan Gupta observed that the court was informed on February 26 about the precarious medical condition of Gaba and a query was put up before the state’s counsel who sought more time to apprise the court even on the next date of hearing on March 25. The counsel even sought time on Monday stating that he has no information regarding Gaba’s present medical condition.The high court has now posted the matter for July 9 and directed that a short affidavit be filed about the businessman’s medical condition. The state’s counsel told the court that it would also be apprised whether Gaba remained incarcerated on the jail premises or was in a hospital during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhola-drug-racket-hc-seeks-details-on-goraya-businessman-s-health-condition-101624910114533.html

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Derogatory posters at Bargari: SIT sends dera man’s handwriting sample to forensic lab again||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the sacrilege cases has resent the handwriting sample of an accused Dera Sacha Sauda follower to match it with the writings on derogatory posters pasted at Faridkot district’s Bargari village in September 2015 after the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh, returned it with objections. The SIT had again collected samples of Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, the accused, in the first week of June. The derogatory posters were against Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. “There are some standard guidelines for collecting the samples, as was conveyed by the forensic lab. The SIT is careful enough to avoid any legal issue as small technicalities can be challenged in court at a later stage,” said an officer privy to the development. The SIT-led by inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar has arrested four dera followers, claiming the posters were pasted by them at the behest of the sect’s three national committee members. The six persons, including the four, arrested for the Bargari sacrilege were produced in court through video conferencing on Monday. Their judicial custody was extended to July 8. In the three posters that appeared at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages on September 24-25, 2015, it was threatened that the ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1 that year would be torn if the dera chief (now jailed) Gurmeet Ram Rahim-starrer film Messenger of God (MSG)-2 was not allowed to be released in Punjab. The SIT-led then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018 claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers had matched with the one on the posters. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 had said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/derogatory-posters-at-bargari-sit-sends-dera-man-s-handwriting-sample-to-forensic-lab-again-101624909275606.html

The bus services across the state remained affected, causing inconvenience to commuters. As per reports, at least 40% of state-owned buses remained off road. The protesting employees held dharnas at bus stands and raised slogans against the state government. The protesters said they did not allow plying of buses in the state, except for a few operated by regular employees. Meanwhile, the state transport department directed its officials posted at different depots to put their regular staff on the job so as to minimise impact of the strike. Inderjit Singh, member of the outsourced and contractual employees’ action committee, said the government had promised to bring a policy for their regularisation in 2017, but nothing has been done to date.“The employees are being exploited financially as they have no choice that to work on meagre salaries. Not only conductors and drivers, even contractual staff on administrative duties are observing complete pen-down strike,” he said.Another activist Sehajpal Singh said most of the employees are working on contract for past 15 years but the government is not paying heed to their demands.“We are also demanding a stringent check on the transport mafia, implementation of equal work, equal pay and to stop harassment of employees,” he said.PRTC managing director Bhupinder Singh said they are yet to access the financial and services loss due to the strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bus-services-hit-in-punjab-as-contractual-employees-go-on-3-day-strike-101624909274594.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal promises free power if AAP forms govt in Punjab||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday promised free electricity in Punjab if his party wins next year’s assembly polls in the state. Kejriwal, who is scheduled to address a press conference in Chandigarh on Tuesday, made the announcement on Twitter. “In Delhi, we provide 200 units of free electricity to every family. The women are quite happy. Women in Punjab are also quite unhappy with inflation. The AAP government will also provide free electricity in Punjab. See you tomorrow in Chandigarh,” he tweeted in Punjabi. Minutes later, a controversy erupted over the venue of his press conference as the party leaders accused the Congress government in Punjab of denying permission for Kejriwal’s press conference at Punjab Bhawan, a charge that was denied by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. AAP’s media coordinator Digvijay Dhanju said the party had planned the press conference at the state guest house, but the chief minister’s office (CMO) denied permission. AAP spokesperson and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha also slammed the state government, attributing the refusal to Amarinder’s fear of the Delhi CM. “@capt_amarinder’s fear of Kejriwal has reached a point where his office has denied us permission to hold press conference at the pre-decided venue. Nevertheless, @ArvindKejriwal will make a mega announcement tomorrow in Chandigarh which will send 440volt current to Capt and his party (sic),” he tweeted. Amarinder immediately dismissed the allegation, accusing the AAP, the principal opposition party in Punjab, of indulging in drama. He also asked why the state government would stop Kejriwal from holding a press conference when he was allowed to hold a party programme a few days ago, offering to arrange lunch for him. The AAP national convener’s visit on Tuesday will be his second this month as he was in Amritsar on June 21 and had inducted former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh into the party. “Totally not true. We let @ArvindKejriwal address a rally here just few days back so why should we stop him now having a press conference? If he wants I’d be happy to arrange his lunch too. @AamAadmiParty just wants to do drama even if it means lying: Capt Amarinder,” read a tweet posted by the Punjab CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral. A senior CMO official also said there was no question of denying permission as no request was received from the opposition party. AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said that Kejriwal will address the media at the Chandigarh Press Club and make “big announcements”, including free power, on the lines of unlimited facilities being provided to the people of Delhi. He also demanded scrapping of the “faulty” power purchase agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers that are a drain on the state exchequer. Last week, the Congress high command also took stock of the progress made on the promises made by the party in the 2017 poll manifesto and set an 18-point agenda, including 200 units of free electricity for all households, for the chief minister. State officials feel additional subsidy burden on account of free electricity to domestic consumers will not be tenable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-promises-free-power-if-aap-forms-govt-in-punjab-101624909214437.html

A former president of the district Congress committee, the accused, Rajiv Bhagat, joined the AAP two months ago. The protesters alleged that Bhagat was given the responsibility of overseeing Amritsar-West constituency at the behest of Kunwar Vijay.The police detained some Akali workers for a while to disperse to crowd. YAD leaders Gurpartap Singh Tikka and Jodh Singh Samra said, “The accused, Rajiv Bhagat, used the then IG’s official vehicle to transport drugs from one place to another. Chief minister Amarinder Singh must take action in the matter or it would be presumed that he is protecting the former IG as part of a pact with AAP,” they said.Also, the Aam Aadmi Party volunteers led by leader of opposition in assembly Harpal Singh Cheema also held a protest at Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka’s house in support of sanitation workers and sewermen for their regularisation.

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu to meet Rahul, Priyanka on Tuesday||Amid uncertainty over the Congress high command’s peace formula for the faction-ridden Punjab unit, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu will meet former party president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday. Sidhu, who has been targeting chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh over delay in justice in sacrilege cases and other unkept promises, will meet the two leaders in Delhi, an aide of the former minister said on Monday. His meeting with Rahul and Priyanka comes at a time when the party high command is making efforts to end factionalism ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. Rahul and Priyanka, general secretary in-charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh, are likely to discuss with the former minister his role in the organisational set up or the government. A three-member committee constituted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to resolve the rift had, in its report on June 10, suggested that Sidhu should be suitably accommodated to end the factionalism in the state unit. While Sidhu is said to be keen on heading the state Congress despite his statements to the contrary, Amarinder is not amenable to having him in the position. The Amritsar East MLA, who quit the state cabinet over his differences with the CM two years ago, upped the ante about a week with a spate of interviews in which he accused Amarinder of colluding with Badals. Meanwhile, Sidhu, in a series of tweets on Monday in support of protesting farmers, suggested transforming social movement of unions into a sustainable economic power by influencing political decision makers with progressive agenda, beyond mere repealing of black laws. “Farmers can be game-changers in 2022 for resurrection of Punjab. Unions can transform their power into an economic force via cooperatives,” he tweeted, reiterating his demand that Punjab should give MSP on pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-to-meet-rahul-priyanka-on-tuesday-101624908914432.html

According to officials, these people had been stranded in Pakistan due to Covid-19 restrictions.Some of the returnees included no obligation to return to India (NORI) visa holders, who had gone to the neighbouring country to meet their relatives, and some were students from Kashmir. The Indian government issues NORI visas to Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who leave their home country and live in India or are married in India but have not yet obtained Indian citizenship. Similarly, many students from Kashmir pursue professional courses in Pakistan institutions.“There had been information that 461 people would come to India, but only 117 could make it on Monday. Those who failed to cross will come in the coming days,” said Arun Pal, Punjab Police’s protocol officer at Attari border. He said those who returned underwent Covid-19 test at the integrated check post (ICP), Attari, and no one tested positive.Durafshan Yousuf, 26, who is pursuing MBBS in Pakistan, said she had been in Pakistan for the past one year. “There should be proper coordination between both the countries to allow the stranded people to return to their countries in a time-bound manner in Covid-like situations,” she said.Meanwhile, the Indian government repatriated four Pakistani prisoners, including three fishermen, through the transit route on Monday. The fishermen—Jumma Muhammad, Mumad Hassan and Vatu Muhammad of Thatta district in Pakistan—were caught in Gujarat after they had entered in Indian water in Arabian Sea in December 2016.Arun Pal said these fishermen completed their 3.5-year sentence in Palara jail of Gujarat. They were released after their nationality was confirmed by the Pakistan government.The fourth Pakistani, who was released from Amritsar Central jail, is Muhammad Ramjan, 22 of Lahore.

This is an act of cowardice & perpetrators of violence will be brought to justice very soon. My deepest condolences to the family of martyr & prayers for the recovery of injured,” tweeted Sinha.“No words are strong enough to condemn the cowardly attack in Awantipora that claimed the lives of a JKP officer Fayaz Ahmad, his wife & daughter. May Allah Ta’ala grant them maghfirat & their loved ones the fortitude to bear this loss,” tweeted PDP president, Mehbooba Mufti.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah also condemned the attack in a tweet and said: “I unreservedly condemn the dastardly and cowardly militant attack on the J&K police SPO Fayaz Ahmed, his wife and his young daughter at their home last night. I pray they receive their place in Jannat and their loved ones find strength during this terrible time.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Altaf Thakur,too, termed it barbaric “Barging into the house of a cop and killing him and his family members is nothing but a pure form of terrorism,” he said.“What was the fault of the innocent wife and daughter of policeman Fayaz Ahmed? Killing women is [not] bravery but a purely cowardly attack which deserves the highest form of condemnation,” Thakur added.This is the latest in a series of attacks on locals in the Union territory.On June 23, a shop owner was killed when gunmen opened fire on him in Srinagar.Police had said that militants fired upon a mobile phone shop owner Umar Nazir Bhat of Kelashpora, inside his shop at Main Chowk Habba Kadal in Old City.On June 22, a police officer was killed in a suspected militant attack on Srinagar outskirts.Officials said that Inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) wing of the police, was fired upon near his home at Nowgam.He was rushed to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in the Old City, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/suspected-jaish-terrorists-killed-spo-kin-in-pulwama-say-police-101624908555792.html

However, they shared no specific details in the case of the latter.National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti asked the authorities to properly investigate the issue.“Any move to drive a wedge between Sikhs and Muslims in Kashmir will cause irreparable harm to J&K. The two communities have supported each other through thick and thin, having withstood countless attempts to damage age-old relationships,” said Abdullah.“Hope the investigative agencies swiftly get to the bottom of this issue,” said Mehbooba.Protests by Sikh community were triggered on Sunday after reports spread that a young woman from the community was allegedly kidnapped by a man from another community. Police said they have arrested the person, 29, and the girl, 18, was presented before a court on Saturday, and later returned to her family.Amit Shah assures returnUnion home minister Amit Shah has assured the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) of the safe return of the Sikh woman to their families, said DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Monday.Addressing the media, the DSGMC president said Shah will soon meet the J&K Sikh delegation to discuss the concerns of the minority.Sirsa, who is camping in Srinagar for the past two days said, “DSGMC is making all efforts to bring both the girls back into the Sikh fold. Both the girls are from poor families, and we have rescued one of them and efforts are on to rescue the other.”Manjit Singh GK, former president of DSGMC, who held a demonstration in New Delhi on Monday, demanded anti-conversion law in J&K. In a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, GK said that inspite of the fact that Article 370 has been annulled, Sikhs in J&K were discriminated against.Bibi Jagir Kaur, president of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, said the SGPC is giving all support to the family. “I have asked families to bring both the girls to Darbar Sahib for counselling and moral support. I also plan to visit Srinagar to be in touch with the families,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abduction-of-sikh-women-valley-leaders-urge-admn-to-conduct-thorough-probe-101624908505641.html

We never attack anyone. Our objective has never been to achieve victory against anyone. India has neither attacked any country nor occupied an inch. Our intention is very clear,” said Singh, while addressing soldiers in a forward location on the second day of his visit to eastern Ladakh.Singh also paid rich tributes to the soldiers killed during the Galwan Valley clash last year, saying that the country will never forget their sacrifice.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades, and pushed the bilateral relationship to breaking point. It left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead. Since then, the two armies have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-rank officers, but the negotiations have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers from friction points.“We had to face a big challenge along the Northern border last year. But our armed forces displayed their courage and dedication to deal with it... Our Army has the capability to give a befitting reply to every challenge,” he said. “Our neighbours should think that we have been neighbours for ages, we will remain neighbours for ages. Can we not find permanent solutions to the disputed issues through talks...”Inaugurates strategic bridgesDuring the visit, Singh also dedicated to the nation 63 bridges built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO).Besides inaugurating a 50-metre-long bridge constructed on the Leh-Loma road in Ladakh, Singh virtually inaugurated 62 more bridges -- 11 in Ladakh, four in Jammu and Kashmir, three in Himachal Pradesh, six in Uttarakhand, eight in Sikkim, one each in Nagaland and Manipur and 29 in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-believe-in-dialogue-but-can-retaliate-says-rajnath-singh-on-indo-china-row-101624908498187.html

On the morning of June 26, Sagar Jadhav was standing beside his agency’s cylinder carrier truck while his colleague made a delivery near Ambernath railway station, when Tushar Bhamre, 35, a media professional spotted him. Bhamre, also an Ambernath resident, was seated in his car, while his wife was buying groceries. “Jadhav was leaning against the truck, lost in thought, and I thought it made for a very nice picture. So I clicked a few photos and posted one on Facebook, with a caption saying that this could be a still out of a web series. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but by afternoon, the post had received scores of comments and shares,” said Bhamre. Bhamre’s post received 351 likes, 151 comments and 71 shares. The morning after he posted it, several other social media users had obtained the picture from Bhamre and posted it on their own social media pages. Artists made Jadhav’s caricature and posted it on Instagram, with someone coming up with #cylinderman. By Monday, Instagram fitness accounts like Six Pack Abs India had also picked up the picture. “I came home from work on June 26 and went off to sleep, not knowing what was brewing. I only learned about it later after a friend called me up. Honestly, I couldn’t believe it at first,” Jadhav recalled. Using Facebook, Bhamre found a few users mutual friends and got in touch with Jadhav on Sunday. “The first thing I did was to apologise to him for posting the picture without his consent. We both expressed the desire to meet each other and that same evening, he visited my house. We spoke for a long time,” said Bhamre. Orphaned at childhood, Jadhav is a shy personality and protective of his personal life. His elder brother also works for the same liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) retail agency. Jadhav got married two-and-a-half years ago. Jadhav has been working for a gas retail agency since his teenage years. When he started working, he was a skinny young man with scant interest in fitness. However, as years progressed, he started feeling the need to increase his strength and stamina to suit the demands of his job. “An empty LPG cylinder weighs 15 kilogrammes (kg), while a fully-filled one weighs 30kg. When I started my job, my weight used to be 45kg, and not all the buildings where we deliver cylinders have lifts, which means sometimes we have to climb three-four storeys with the cylinder on our shoulders. This drove me to visit a newly opened gym in my locality four years ago,” said Jadhav. That one visit to the gym changed Jadhav’s life forever. He started working out regularly, and makes it a point now to hit the gym six days a week for at least an hour daily. “I can’t afford supplements or fancy diet plans. My diet consists entirely of home-cooked food. I don’t even have a personal trainer. I only perform the basic exercises that I had learned when I first joined the gym. The change that exercising has brought about in my strength and stamina is all the motivation I need to keep going on,” he said. Social media users are already hoping that Jadhav, with his looks and physique, lands a role in a movie or a web series. On Monday, Jadhav’s picture was posted by Marathi actor Kushal Badrike on his Facebook page. “I have assured Jadhav that I will guide him to the best of my capabilities if he gets an offer. I have worked in the media industry for several years now and would be happy if my experience is of some use to him,” said Bhamre. Jadhav, on his part, said he will take each day as it comes. “For now, I am going to stick to my workout regimen and advice everyone to work out. It is never a bad idea to start working out and get in shape. Apart from a good physique and stamina, it also helps build immunity, which has become all the more important amid the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cylinderman-how-gas-agency-employee-from-maharashtra-s-ambernath-set-internet-on-fire-101624907533816.html

Of six covid patients, with comorbidities, who were administered this line of treatment, at the hospital, five have fully recovered; one patient is still on oxygen support, but is showing encouraging immune response. All six patients were admitted in June.Technically called Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, drug trials of this treatment is being carried out the supervision of a three-member team comprising Dr Rajesh Mahajan, Dr Bishav Mohan and Dr Pawan Kumar. Dr Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid Task Force of the state, said, “Monoclonal antibodies are artificial antibodies that act in a manner, similar to the activity of the human immune system.”Dr Kumar said the six patients volunteered to be given the monoclonal antibody therapy. The antibody cocktail administered to patients is a combination of two drugs, Casirivimab and Imdevimab, he added. “The treatment is showing encouraging results. All six patients came to us in June. Five have been discharged. The sixth, who was offered this cocktail of medicines on June 21 is showing good response. We hope to discharge him in two-three days,” Dr Kumar added. “These medicines are given to Covid patients when symptoms have just manifested. This helps stop the spread of virus in the lungs. The therapy also reduces the risk of worsening of the ailment and cuts down on hospital stay of patients with weak immune system response.”The results hold significance, with two patients in the state found to be carrying the Delta Plus variant of Covid. Besides, increased transmissibility, the Delta Plus variant has stronger binding to receptors of lung cells and potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response, which these cocktail of medicines can help treat, Dr Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antibody-therapy-against-covid-shows-positive-results-in-dmch-ludhiana-101624907474388.html

Special judge Prashant Sitre extended the NIA custody of the duo after the federal agency informed the court that it needs to probe the source of the huge sums of cash recovered from them. Meanwhile, three other accused – Santosh Shelar, Anand Jadhav and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma – have been remanded in judicial custody till July 12, as the NIA did not seek their further custody. According to NIA, Mothukari – also known as Tanni or Vicky Baba – Soni, Shelar and Jadhav had smothered Hiran in a red car along Ghodbunder Road in Thane on March 4 and dumped his body in a creek near Mumbra. The 48-year-old auto parts dealer was allegedly killed at the behest of Sharma and former Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze. Mothukari and Soni were produced before the special court as their earlier NIA custody ended on Monday. The agency sought their five-day remand for “finding out certain missing links in the conspiracy.” NIA prosecutor informed the court that after murdering Hiran, the duo had travelled to various places in India and also went abroad. The agency wants to find out who funded their travel. The prosecutor added that their further custody was also required to trace the objects used to allegedly smother Hiran as well as Hiran’s missing belongings –a mobile phone, watch, wallet and credit and debit cards. Soni’s lawyer, advocate Rahul Arote, opposed the plea for the extension of the NIA custody, contending that there was no change in the grounds for additional custody. Arote pointed out that Soni runs a garment business and frequently travels abroad, and the NIA can check his passport to verify which foreign places he had visited. He argued that it cannot be a ground for extending Soni’s custody. Sharma’s lawyer urged the court to direct the jail authorities to send him to Thane prison for security reasons, claiming that the former encounter specialist apprehended threats to his life. He will, however, be lodged in Taloja jail. But the special court has directed the jail superintendent to take appropriate care to ensure Sharma’s security. On February 25, an SUV was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home Antilia with 20 lose gelatin sticks and a threatening note. On March 5, Hiran – the owner of the SUV – was found dead in a creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who had reported the SUV stolen on February 17. NIA had arrested Vaze on March 13, claiming that he was the mastermind behind the explosives scare and Hiran’s murder. NIA investigators said that Vaze had planned the Antilia explosives scare in a bid to “regain lost glory” in the police force as he had been suspended in March 2004 for his involvement in a custodial killing case, and reinstated a year later. NIA further alleged that Hiran was killed after he refused to take the blame for planting the SUV and getting arrested in the case. Vaze, who is currently in custody, has denied the charges to the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-explosives-scare-mansukh-hiran-murder-custody-of-2-more-accused-extended-till-july-1-101624907413855.html

The Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG) filed an application in July 2004 in the courts for the eviction of the encroachment.Debi Goenka, a member of the BEAG and executive trustee of non-profit organisation Conservation Action Trust (CAT), on Sunday wrote to Nitin Kakodkar, chief wildlife warden, Maharashtra; Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), wildlife, Mumbai; and to G Mallikarjuna, field director and chief conservator of forests, Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP).“I had visited TWLS on June 26. I was shocked to discover that the road from Parol to the Sadanand Baba ashram is still being used by vehicles carrying devotees to the ashram. It is also evident that the road is being maintained to facilitate the passage of these vehicles,” said Goenka, pointing out that the entry register at Parol chowky is not being assiduously maintained.“This is obvious because none of the vehicles that I saw yesterday had been recorded in the register,” he wrote. Moreover, it is alleged that two sheds within the ashram premises have been built some time following the demolition.“As I didn’t enter the ashram premises, I am not able to comment on other work that may have been carried out within the premises,” Goenka’s letter stated.In a statement to the press on Monday, Goenka wrote, “It seems that the Sadanand baba ashram is slowly being allowed to rebuild and restart all the activities that they were carrying out prior to the demolition.”In response, environmentalists have demanded that the newly constructed structures be speedily demolished, and the entry of vehicles from Parol chowky be halted. Goenka has also asked if a CCTV camera be installed at the chowky, which should be manned by uniformed forest guards, in addition to regular patrols by the range forest officers (RFOs), assistant conservator of forests (ACF), deputy conservator of forests (DCFs) and other higher-ranked officials.In a message to HT on Monday, Mallikarjuna said, “Our officials, including the district forest office, ACF and RFO will visit the site. If at all any encroachment has come up then the same would be demolished.”The Balayogi Shree Sadanand Maharaj Ashram had occupied forest land in the 1970s, before the area was declared a protected sanctuary. Forest officials and environmentalists pointed out that the structure continued to grow in size by encroaching into the surrounding forest even after it was declared a protected area in 2003.Tungareshwar, which is around 85.70 sq km in area, is connected to other protected natural areas like the Nagla block of SGNP and Tansa Wildlife Sanctuary.The sanctuary’s diverse habitats including littoral forests and hills, which are home to leopards, wild boars, barking deer, langurs, bonnet and rhesus macaques, among other animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-activist-flags-illegal-work-at-tungareshwar-wildlife-sanctuary-101624907234977.html

The single-judge bench of justice AS Gadkari was hearing Choksi’s applications challenging ED’s plea before PMLA court to declare him an FEO, and to cross-examine the investigation officer based on whose statement the agency wanted to declare him a fugitive offender. Choksi has sought the quashing of ED’s application in the special PMLA court. Choksi’s advocate Vijay Aggarwal said they needed time to file a brief rejoinder in the case. The court accepted the request and allowed Agarwal to file it within two weeks and posted the further hearing after three weeks. ED had applied before the special PMLA court to declare Choksi an FEO under the FEO Act, 2018, which stipulates that a person can be declared FEO if a warrant has been issued against him for an offence involving an amount of ₹100 crore or more, and if the person has left the country and refuses to return.Choksi had challenged the proceedings through a bunch of petitions in which his counsel argued that he cannot be declared an FEO as ED was relying on the statements recorded under PMLA to build a case against him. He had also sought to cross-examine at least 21 witnesses cited by ED. Both the applications were rejected by the special court in December 2019. Agarwal had argued that the complaint under FEO Act should be dismissed as the affidavit filed by ED’s deputy director is not as per law. Citing anomalies on ED’s part, Choksi’s side argued that the agency did not file the FEO complaint in a prescribed format according to rule 3 of the declaration of Fugitive Economic Offenders (Forms and Manners of Filing Application) Rules, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-extends-stay-on-declaring-mehul-choksi-fugitive-economic-offender-101624907173826.html

Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra legislative Council Pravin Darekar is the chairman of the co-operative bank and accused in the case. Darekar did not respond to HT’s phone calls and messages. A C-Summary is filed when a criminal case was filed due to mistake in facts or the offences in the complaint are of a civil nature. The case was first registered by MRA Marg police in March 2015 and later EOW took over its investigation. Darekar and other office-bearers were accused in the case for allegedly causing a loss of ₹123 crore to the bank since 1998 by fraud and embezzlement of funds.The first information report (FIR) was registered on the complaint of an advocate, Vivekanand Gupta, who is also Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Mumbai secretary, alleging that Darekar and others have misused their positions in the bank. The complaint accused the bank officials of making risky investments and carrying out many illegal activities that resulted in the loss to the bank and the money was routed for the benefits of the accused. The police had initially booked the accused under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged 1[document or electronic record]) and 120 (B) (punishment of criminal conspiracy). EOW officers had carried out an investigation in the case and had closed it in 2019 by filing an application for C-Summary, claiming it to be a civil matter. When the court informed Gupta about the C-summary application, he personally said that he has no objection. However, another complainant, Pankaj Kotecha, who also had levelled similar allegations, moved an application before the court opposing the C-summary. Kotecha informed the court that there should be an audit to detect the irregularities and enlighten on the transactions of the bank, but the investigation officer has not produced an audit report of the relevant period. In its order passed on June 16, the court observed, “In the complaint, serious allegations are levelled against office bearers of the Mumbai District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. As per their allegations, there is a misappropriation of a huge amount. It is a public fund. Therefore, a detailed investigation is required. Considering the report submitted by the investigation officer, it does not reflect detailed investigation regarding the allegations made in the FIR.” Subsequently, the court rejected EOW’s application for C-summary and directed the investigating officer to further probe the case and submit the report in the court. The EOW will now record Kotecha’s statement in detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eow-starts-reinvestigation-of-mumbai-co-op-bank-fraud-case-oppn-leader-an-accused-101624907113742.html

Listing its probe findings after the family complained to it, the SGPC states in the letter that the Akal Takht recognises no Satkar committee, nor does it permit anyone to take away the holy bir from any house forcibly by barging into it.“The Sikh family adorned the bir with Sikh Rehat Maryada (Sikh Code of Conduct), yet the bir was taken away from the house. The accused claim they had the consent of the area SHO,” their letter adds.The letter adds, “Police interference into personal religious matters is equal to an offence. A case should be registered against those who took away the bir forcibly under Section 441 (criminal trespass, house trespass) and charges of abetment should also be framed against the SHO.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sacrilege-in-sangrur-sgpc-delegation-to-meet-ssp-today-101624907054338.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||BMC sero survey: 51.18% kids have antibodies||In a first, a ward-wise sero-prevalence survey among children undertaken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revealed that more than 50% of the paediatric populace in Mumbai has antibodies against Covid-19. Following the sudden spike in the infection rate among children in the second wave, the BMC decided to conduct a sero survey among the 1-18 years age group to gauge the prevalence of the virus among the young population. The overall seropositivity rate is 51.18%. It was conducted in association with the BYL Nair Hospital and the civic-run Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory. As per data provided by the BMC, the seropositivity rate between the 1-4 age group is 51.04%. Children in the 5-9 age group showed 47.33% positivity rate. The highest positivity rate is between 10 and 14 years which stands at 53.43%. In the fourth category, teenagers between 15 and 18 years had a 51.39% positivity rate. Seropositivity is the highest in the 10-14 age group. Doctors said the results of the survey can help lessen the impact of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, among children during the anticipated third wave. Serological survey examines how many people in a population have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered from it, which helps gauge prevalence of the virus in a particular area. The blood serum of a group of individuals is tested using an antibody test, also known as a serology test.Medical practitioners said high prevalence of antibodies is a good sign and indicates that children are naturally developing antibodies as a protective shield against Covid-19. “As this age group hasn’t been included in the mass immunisation programme, antibodies have developed naturally after getting exposed to the virus. The results are indicative of development of herd immunity among children. With this, we assume they would be all protected against Covid-19 in the third wave,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair hospital. Blood samples were acquired from public and civic-run laboratories. Across 24 civic wards of Mumbai, a total of 2,176 blood samples have been analysed for the survey, of which 1,283 samples were collected from Aapli Chikitsa Network and BYL Nair Hospital. The remaining 893 samples were collected from two private laboratories.In April, when the pandemic curve was at its peak, a total of 4,351 children between the 0-9 age group contracted Covid-19 in Mumbai. In the same month, 12,277 teenagers in the 10-19 age group were diagnosed with the infection. “It is a good sign because we haven’t witnessed a remarkable rise in hospitalisation or severe Covid-19 infections in children. It means these children are probably protected against the infection. Moreover, as adults achieve immunity through vaccination or by natural means, the infection rate in children will automatically decrease,” said Dr Tushar Maniar, head of paediatric department, Nanavati Max Super Speciality hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-sero-survey-51-18-kids-have-antibodies-101624906993812.html

The organisers of the seven places did not verify the accused’s claims of affiliation with Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, or question the open vials of vaccine. Police further said that the complainants also did not question when the accused requested to switch off CCTVs of the venue and refrain from clicking photos saying it was not allowed by the government. The accused also did not register the beneficiaries online at the venue.“These were basic things that raised red flags and the organisers should have taken note of it. The negligence could have endangered lives,” said a police officer. Borivli police registered statements of the organisers of Aditya College and Shimpoli-based share broker to find out whether they were negligent in verifying the authenticity of the accused.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Vishal Thakur said, “This is a part of investigation. The investigation is moving in the right direction.” Officers said that they are now investigating to find out the modus of the gang since more first information reports (FIRs) could be filed.Meanwhile, the accused were presented before the court and have been remanded in police custody for two days. Dindoshi sessions court on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Dr Manish Tripathi, and asked him to surrender.The vaccination scam came to light when Hiranandani Heritage society members approached Kandivli police saying they were duped by Mahendra Singh and four others who gave them fake vaccine on May 30.The society members claimed they got vaccination certificates, but they had names of different hospitals and different dates. When the residents checked the CoWin portal, their status was shown as “yet to receive first dose.”Apart from the case filed by Hiranandani Heritage, six more cases have been filed at Versova, Borivli and Khar police stations against the same group. So far, the police have arrested eight accused and are on a lookout for two more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-scam-cops-probe-complainants-for-not-checking-authenticity-101624906933826.html

29-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC adds supplier of faulty ventilators as respondent||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the inclusion of the Rajkot company, which supplied faulty ventilators, as a respondent in the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) initiated after it was informed that nearly 34 of the 250 ventilators supplied to Marathwada region were faulty and dysfunctional. The directions were issued after the court was informed that despite court orders, the company has failed to repair or replace the dysfunctional ventilators. The company has been asked to respond by July 5. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Avinash Gharote was hearing the suo motu PIL which was filed based on news reports pointing to mismanagement of the second wave of Covid and other issues faced by citizens while getting treated for Covid-19 and mucormycosis among other issues including the faulty ventilators which had been supplied to Marathwada region through the Union ministry of home and family welfare. In earlier hearings, the court was informed by the amicus curiae and state counsels that 117 of the 150 ventilators distributed to hospitals in Marathwada region after March had malfunctioned and that doctors were not willing to use them on patients. An expert committee of doctors and technicians had submitted a report stating that the ventilators were not safe for use, following which the court had directed the Union government to ensure that the company, which provided the ventilators, repaired or replaced the faulty machines. The court had also chided the Union government for taking a soft stand against the company — Jyoti CNC, which is based in Rajkot. On Monday, the court was informed that earlier in January this year, Marathwada had also received 100 more ventilators manufactured by the same company and 27 ventilators from that batch were dysfunctional. A total of 34 ventilators — 27 ventilators from the previous batch and seven ventilators from second batch — were faulty. Chief public prosecutor DR Kale told the bench that after the court ordered repair or replacement of the machines, the company had taken back 41 ventilators from the batch of 150 and had repaired them. However, as the court had not passed any orders regarding the faulty ventilators from the earlier batch, the company had not repaired or replaced them. Following the submissions, amicus curiae SS Bora suggested that as the company was not conducting itself properly, it should be impleaded as a party to the suo motu PIL. The court agreed and directed issuance of notice to the company. The company is the 44th respondent to be added in the PIL. The court has posted hearing of the petition to July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-adds-supplier-of-faulty-ventilators-as-respondent-101624906873793.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||NMMC steps up testing to delay third wave||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has increased Covid-19 testing with more than 20,000 tests done on Saturday and Sunday. NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar said, “The idea is to detect all positive cases and start the treatment soon so that the third wave is delayed. The later the third wave, the smaller the danger because by then the number of people who got vaccinated would increase.” Along with random testing, targeted testing has also been increased. Random tests are conducted at railway stations and malls. “The malls are closed now so the random testing might decrease. The random testing positivity rate was very less,” Bangar added. In targeted testing, the whole family or, in some cases, the whole floor of an affected person is tested. “Even if cases go up a little due to the increase in targeted testing, it will help us in controlling the spread,” he added. On Sunday, the corporation had conducted around 12,000 tests while the number stood at around 9,000 on Saturday. The civic body plans to maintain this pace of testing till the number of positive cases drop to a two-digit figure.Meanwhile, after thousands had gathered on Palm Beach Road over naming of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, NMMC officials said the after effects of this protest in terms of increase in Covid cases can be seen after 10 days. “There would be effects that will reflect later,” an official said.NMMC inoculates 250 pharmacistsThe Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has vaccinated more than 250 pharmacists – 169 men and 81 women –in their initiative to reach out to people who are at risk and contain the spread of virus. The initiative began on Sunday at Sanpada Chemist Bhavan. The civic body has also begun vaccination for quarry workers and the homeless.NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar said, “We have 78 vaccination centres to ensure that the residents get the facility closer to their homes.We want to make sure that no one is left out of the drive, and hence started vaccinating the quarry workers and also the homeless. Mobile vans have been deployed at several locations to reach out to these categories.” G Mohiuddin Jeddy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmc-steps-up-testing-to-delay-third-wave-101624906813744.html

29-06-2021||Mumbai||BJP says will restore OBC quota in 4 months if in power; Sena, Congress hits back||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ruling parties in the state are at loggerheads again over the political reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBC). The BJP has blamed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for quashing of the reservation by the Apex court, and said if the party comes to power it will restore the same in four months. The Congress and Shiv Sena have taken a dig at the BJP, reminding it of the failed promises of reservation to Dhangar community. During its statewide chakka jam protest on Saturday, BJP leaders said MVA failed to provide empirical data to safeguard the political reservation to the OBC community. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had said he would take sanyas if his party failed to reinstate the reservation. “If power is given back to us, we will restore OBC reservation in just four months. If I fail to do so, I will take political sanyas,” he had said on Saturday. Sena mouthpiece Saamana took pot shot at Fadnavis and questioned if his intention was pure. “Why do they [the BJP] want the power back if they really want to restore OBC reservation? Real politicians do not wait for power to work in the interest of the community. Ahead of 2014 Assembly polls, Fadnavis had assured the Dhangar community of reservation in the first cabinet meeting, but could not fulfil the assurance in five years of the power,” the editorial read. Sena MP Sanjay Raut taunted Fadnavis and said he would not need to take political sanyas and the Indian politics needs a talented leader like him. “We would not allow him to take this extreme step as Maharashtra needs him. We would not allow him become a fakir especially when there is dearth of talented political leaders like him. It would be injustice to BJP if Fadnavis takes sanyas,” he said, adding, “The state government under Uddhav Thackeray is taking every step to ensure that the OBC reservation was restored. The government will ensure that Fadnavis does not need to leave politics.” The Congress too has slammed Fadnavis, calling his claim a sham. “The people of Maharashtra would not fall prey to the tall claims by Fadnavis and his party. OBC reservation has been struck down because the Central government failed to submit the empirical data in the Supreme Court. It was a deliberate attempt of the BJP government at the Centre. This is nothing but the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) hidden agenda of scrapping reservation in the country. Maratha community, too, was misled over reservation by the BJP,” said Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole. He also took a dig at former rural development (RDD) minister and BJP leader Pankaja Munde, who has announced to not allow local body elections until OBC reservation was restored. Patole said it was the RDD led by her which had issued an ordinance related to the local body polls, endangering the reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-says-will-restore-obc-quota-in-4-months-if-in-power-sena-congress-hits-back-101624906756151.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Nobody can promise zero flooding in Mumbai: BMC additional chief||Tackling the issue of waterlogging is a gradual and long-term process, and with a focused approach towards tackling individual spots the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has managed to mitigate or completely prevent flooding at various spots across the city, civic authorities said on Monday, in response to HT’s annual audit about Mumbai’s monsoon preparedness. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner incharge of the storm water drains department in BMC, said, “When we factor in variables such as very heavy rain in a short duration, we have to be ready that some time will be taken for water to completely drain out from waterlogged spots in the city. Nobody can promise zero waterlogging in the city.” Over the years, the BMC has worked towards bringing down the number of spots. For example, the waterlogging problem at Dahisar subway has almost been solved, Velrasu said. In some instances, water receding time has reduced drastically following civic work, Velrasu added. “This year, the stormwater drains department has cleaned nullahs thoroughly as part of pre-monsoon preparedness. Cleaning a nullah involves removing of muck [silt], as well as floating garbage. But once the nullah has been cleaned, nearby residents throw garbage back into the channel within days. Visible floating garbage does not indicate that the nullah has not been desilted.” “Besides, the BMC has a pre-decided quantity of how much silt needs to be removed from nullah. We never scrape the very bottom of nullah beds to remove silt while doing pre-monsoon desilting work. Hence after the work is satisfactorily completed, some amount of silt is likely to stay in the nullah,” he added. HT’s annual monsoon audit On June 23, Hindustan Times conducted its annual monsoon audit with the help of three experts. HT visited seven spots — three nullahs in the western suburbs, two nullahs in the eastern suburbs, and two chronic waterlogging spots in the island city. The panel of experts comprised Rohit Shinkre, senior urban planner and architect; Dilip Kamlakar Pathak, retired deputy engineer of the storm water drains department, BMC; and Udaykumar Shiroorkar, retired assistant engineer, BMC. In a three-part series on Friday and Saturday, HT reported the panel’s verdict post the audit. The three experts on HT’s panel concluded that Mumbai is not ready to handle the monsoon this year, again. While the BMC’s effort to stay ahead of its pre-monsoon work cannot be denied, not enough has been done on ground to prepare the city for the rains, as nullahs are filled with floating garbage, and silt as well, the experts said. The BMC has claimed it completed 104% of nullah desilting work across the city. 30-35 chronic waterlogging spotsThe BMC has chalked out a list of 30-35 chronic waterlogging spots with help from the civic disaster management cell, where there are waterlogging-related complaints every monsoon. “We have decided to address every area specifically. We are working on tackling these spots with a focused approach,” Velrasu said. The BMC is now focusing on tackling waterlogging at points that choke rail and road traffic on major roads across the city. “Hindmata and Gandhi market areas are waterlogged every monsoon, and affect traffic on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road for several hours at a stretch. We have found dedicated solutions to tackle waterlogging in these two points. Work will be completed within the next 15 to 20 days. The next year, these two spots will not flood, and traffic will remain unaffected,” Velrasu said. Rainfall intensity has increased “I have said this in the past also that we have to factor in climate change when it comes to rainfall. Now, for example, on June 9 this year, we had almost around 250mm of rainfall in five-six hours. We need to understand that the situation becomes difficult in such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nobody-can-promise-zero-flooding-in-mumbai-bmc-additional-chief-101624906753792.html

Her husband, who works as a peon with the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), alerted the local corporator, following which the civic body provided support and monitored his wife’s health. Meanwhile, TMC has claimed no such incident took place. However, they have set up a team to inquire further on the complaint. The man (name withheld on request), a resident of Brahmand, said, “My wife visited the centre on Friday afternoon and was taken for vaccination. It was her first dose and she was not really aware of the procedure. She was given the first shot and taken to the observation room. However, soon after, she was called again and given another shot. Within a few minutes they gave her the third shot thinking she was waiting for it. She had fever, which subsided the next morning. TMC doctors and officers visited our residence to ensure her health remained good. We are not keen on taking up this issue and creating politics out of it.” A senior official from the TMC said, “The woman might have had some local reaction on her arm where the vaccine was administered. She was not given three doses. We have set up a team to inquire further on this. Preliminary investigation indicates that no such incident has happened.” 22,042 get jabs on Monday Vaccination centres in Thane, including civic-run and private centres, vaccinated 22,042 beneficiaries on Monday. TMC has initiated a massive vaccination drive with 53 government centres. The civic body has completed 5.5 lakh vaccinations till now. However, on Tuesday both TMC and Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation will not have any vaccination centres open due to unavailability of vaccine. However, for the convenience of students travelling abroad, TMC’s vaccination centre at the post-Covid care at Majiwada will continue to remain functional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-woman-claims-she-was-vaccinated-thrice-101624906693777.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||OBC quota: Maharashtra files petition in SC against zilla parishad bypolls||The Maharashtra government on Monday filed a petition in the Supreme Court against bypolls declared by the state elections commission (SEC) in five zilla parishads — Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur. The state has demanded that the elections be deferred by six months in the wake of the potential third wave of the pandemic and threat of rapid spread of virus after delta plus variant was found in a few districts of the state.Advocate Sachin Patil, standing counsel for Maharashtra government in the Supreme Court, confirmed the development but refused to share details of the petition.SEC has, on June 22, declared bypoll on the seats that got vacated following the Apex court’s verdict against 27% political reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in all local bodies across the state. The state government had requested SEC to postpone the bypoll last week.The state approached the Supreme Court after SEC denied their request saying they were bound by Apex court’s directives.“The Central government has warned of a possible third wave hitting us in the next few weeks. Cases of delta plus variants have also been found in the state, which has raised our concern for public health. Considering this, the state has reduced relaxations and all cities and districts have been brought under level 3 of the five-level relaxation declared by the state earlier,” said a senior official privy to the development.The state had declared a five-level plan under which cities and districts falling under level 1 and 2 were getting maximum relaxations. However, both the levels were removed by the state on June 25.“Following the Apex court’s decision, Palghar zilla parishad seats also got vacated but SEC didn’t declare a bypoll there as Palghar falls under level 3 category. In our petition, we have pointed out that most of the areas are under level 3 restrictions (after the fresh notification issued on June 25) and some also fall under level 4 and 5. This needs to be considered, as the polls may lead to crowding and rise in Covid cases,” he said.All political parties have opposed the bypoll as no seat can be reserved for OBC category candidates following the Supreme Court’s verdict in which it directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation of the community is to be fixed. It means no seat is going to be reserved for the community in local bodies until the state completes the process.Many OBC outfits and political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have staged protests demanding restoration of the reservation last week. Ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, have held protests against the Central government, accusing it of not providing empirical data of the community which led to the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-quota-maharashtra-files-petition-in-sc-against-zilla-parishad-bypolls-101624906634720.html
29-06-2021||Other||Nearly 40% students in K’taka lack devices for online classes: Minister||Bengaluru: Around 40% of students in Karnataka do not have access to mobile phone and other devices to take online classes, Karnataka’s education minister S Suresh Kumar said on Monday, leaving a significant number of children at a disadvantage in the state. Kumar added, “61% students have some connection devices and 39% do not have any access.” Most of these students, according to Kumar, are in rural or backward regions of the state and are deprived of the benefit of school, which their counterparts in urban areas or affluent households benefit from. The poor access to devices emphasises the stark contrast of fortunes of residents of Karnataka, a state known for its prowess in technology and those who live in abject poverty. The minister’s statements come at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the suspension of physical classrooms and increased dependence on online courses to help children cope with their syllabus and not lose a year. Kumar said the education department was setting up android mobile banks in taluka headquarters where donors can give their unused or additional smartphones to help these children. He added that around 45,000 phones have been collected so far. “No children should be kept away from learning,” Kumar said. The minister said the department will contact parents of students who are unable to attend online classes and also request their neighbours to allow access to their televisions to these students so that they could learn from the audio-visual content created by the education department. An expert committee led by cardiologist Dr Devi Prasad Shetty on June 22 submitted a 91-page interim report to the Karnataka government, recommending the reopening of schools and colleges in the state despite the looming threat of a third wave of Covid-19 infections. The government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, argued that education is the fundamental right of the child and stated that reopening physical schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health as well as for nutritional aspects of children. “Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, child trafficking, begging etc., making their condition further worse,” according to the TAC report. The government has decided to resume online classes from July 1 and is awaiting another report by the TAC on the third wave to reopen physical classes. However, the government seems to lack concrete plans on how it proposes to bridge the gap between students who have access to mobile phones and those who don’t, in order to provide education to all sections of society. The higher education department is conducting vaccination drives for students above the age of 18 to help resume physical classes. Last Wednesday, the Karnataka government launched its ambitious ₹195-crore ‘Digi-learning’ initiative for higher education, which it hopes will bridge the gap between urban and rural geographies faced by students pursuing collegiate education. The state government has also distributed 155,000 tablet PCs to students from across the state, amounting to ₹163 crore. The government said it had developed 2,500 smart classrooms at a cost of ₹27.77 crore and a Learning Management System (LMS) for ₹4.04 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-40-students-in-k-taka-lack-devices-for-online-classes-minister-101624906633737.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||CM inaugurates 3 key infra works in Mumbai||In the run-up to the polls to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) scheduled early next year, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated three key infrastructure projects for Mumbai – an arm of Kalanagar flyover connecting Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL) with Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), presided over a function in which a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the BMC and an Israel-based firm for city’s first desalination project at Manori in Malad, and chaired a function of handing over of a 2,170-bed Covid hospital in Mulund by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to the BMC. The Thackeray-led party — Shiv Sena — has been ruling the civic body in the city for more than two decades. The BMC, richest civic body in India with an annual budget of over ₹39,000 crore, is considered to be the Sena’s political strength. With snapped political ties between the Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), retaining the power in the BMC is assumed to be a Herculean task for the Sena. In the 2017 civic polls, the BJP emerged the second-largest party with 82 seats, after the Sena winning 84 seats in the 227-member body. The chief minister said his family has been residing in the area since 1966 and he has a lot of memories. “The area is much populated now and BKC has also developed, which is leading to traffic snarls. The arm of the flyover will help in easing the traffic at Kalanagar junction,” Thackeray said, after inaugurating one of the arms of the project. Thackeray inaugurated the second 804-m-long and 7.5-m-wide arm, which is the longest arm of the three-direction flyover at Kalanagar. The first 653.5-m long arm, which connects BKC with BWSL, was opened on February 21. The third arm with a length of 340-m having two lanes will connect Dharavi T-junction with BWSL. The three-arm project criss-crossing over the Kala Nagar flyover will help in decongesting the Kalanagar junction at Bandra and smoothen the commute between the island city and western suburbs. The cost of the project is ₹103.73 crore. An MoU was signed between the BMC and Israel-based firm — IDE Water Technologies Limited – for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the desalination project. The chief minister said it is like a dream coming true. “The desalination is not just important, but a revolutionary step for Mumbai. I’m happy to see it happening. It’s like a dream comes true,” Thackeray said. Coming up at a 30-acre plot at Manori, Malad, the project will cost ₹1,600 crore and is expected to be completed by 2025. It was approved by the state cabinet in November last year. While handing over the hospital, the CM said they have to be very careful in the backdrop of warnings of a possible third wave hitting the state. “The spread of the Delta Plus variant is rising and we will have to strictly follow all Covid rules despite the daily cases going down,” Thackeray said. Considering the third wave a reality, four more Covid centres are planned in the city to ramp up health infrastructure to deal with any shortage of hospital beds, in case the possible third wave is bigger than the second one. It has 1,536 oxygen beds, 190 ICU beds, 200 paediatric oxygen beds and 50 paediatric ICU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cminaugurates-3-key-infra-works-in-mumbai-101624906394799.html

The sub-divisional magistrate is the swearing-in-officer of the council, and as per rule the president of the council is to be chosen immediately after the taking of the oath. SBS Nagar deputy commissioner Sheena Aggarwal issued orders to conduct the polls for the president’s post in the council on April 9.  In the 15-member Banga council, the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have won five seats each, while the SAD won seats. BJP and Independent have one seat each. Jatinder Kaur Monga, a three-time Congress councillor, said, she had approached Banga SDM Viraj Tidke to conduct the election, but he asked her to take up the issue with the DC. “It is shameful that even after four months, we are still being made to take oath,” said Kaur, adding the office-bearers’ election had already been postponed twice. An AAP councillor alleged that the administration didn’t conduct polls due to fear that ruling Congress party may lose in the election for president. First-time councillor and AAP leader Sarabjit Singh Sabi said, “Till the time we take oath, we are not officially councillors and have no authority to work for our ward.” Banga Shiromani Akali Dal MLA, Sukhwinder Sukhi, said, “The delay is deliberate as the administration fears that the Akali Dal will get the president’s seat.” Banga SDM Viraj Tidke said, “Elections had be called-off twice. The first time, I got ill. Later, three councillors tested positive for Covid-19. Elections and the swearing-in will be conducted in the next 10-15 days. There is no political pressure related to these polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-months-after-polls-newly-elected-banga-councillors-await-swearing-in-101624906394351.html
29-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Three of cloth trader’s family shot dead in Loni||A 65-year-old cloth trader and his two sons were shot dead, while his wife suffered critical gunshot wounds after unidentified men opened fire at them in their home in Ghaziabad’s Loni town early Monday morning.The incident took place between 2.30am and 3am in Toli Mohalla of Loni, the police said.The deceased were identified as Haji Raisuddin, the trader, and his two sons, Azhar, 30, and Imran, 25.Raisuddin’s wife, Fatima, sustained gunshot wounds to her face and is undergoing treatment at a hospital, the police said, adding that all the four victims sustained about seven gunshot wounds each.“It is still not known who fired at them as the main entrance to the house was found locked from inside. As of now, we have not found any motive for the robbery and murder. Of the five members in the house at the time of the incident, only Azhar’s wife Afsana was found with zero injuries,” Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), said on Monday morning.Alimuddin, another son of the trader who lives separately nearby, said he gave a complaint to the police at 3pm on Monday.“I have mentioned that ₹20-25 lakh cash, and some gold and silver jewellery were taken away. I gave my complaint to police at 3pm and thereafter I went for the formalities of postmortem and the burial,” he said.But police maintained that they did not receive a complaint from the family till Monday evening.Police said they took leads from the statements made by Afsana, the only one of the five occupants of the house to be found unharmed.OP Singh, station house officer of Loni police station, said Monday evening, “We have not received any complaint in the case. We are speaking to the two women to get more clues.”Later in the day, inspector general (Meerut range) Praveen Kumar visited Loni to take stock of the situation.“We have some vital clues and the investigation is on. We will examine the complaint which, I am told, was received,” the Meerut IG told reporters.Raja said, “We have formed three teams to investigate the case. Prima facie, there was no sign of forced entry. It seems that the assailants were already inside the house, or that they were allowed entry later. It could also be an insider’s job. We are investigating all possibilities.”Since Toli Mohalla is a congested locality, the police are also trying to probe if the assailants entered the house by jumping over the terraces of nearby houses.In the evening, however, senior officials of the Ghaziabad police could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.The public relation officer of the Ghaziabad police responded to a call on SSP Amit Pathak’s official number and said he will revert about the query made for the FIR copy.However, he did not respond to HT’s calls later.The other relatives of the family who live nearby said that they heard a number of shots being fired around 2.30am and rushed to the victim’s house.“I saw two assailants fleeing after the incident. They were firing shots in the air. I heard about 15 gunshots. I was sleeping on terrace of my house nearby and rushed to my uncle’s house where I found that my uncle, his wife and my brothers were lying injured,” said Mehraj ali, a relative of the family.“Imran is unmarried. Azhar’s wife, who is three months pregnant, sustained no gunshot injuries but she fell unconscious during the shooting incident,” said Ali.He added that his aunt who sustained gunshot wounds, opened the main door when he rushed to her house.“The family has five shops.

29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Water supply troubles persist in Chandigarh’s southern sectors||Despite talks of providing 24/7 water supply in the city, residents of various sectors continue to face problems.While some residents alleged that water supply was not enough and it was difficult to get supply in the first and second floors of their houses, some residents were troubled by muddy supply.Speaking about this, chairman of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri said, “While the number of complaints have decreased this year, we continue to receive complaints especially from southern sectors regarding water pressure. A permanent solution is needed for this problem.”Jyoti Bhardwaj of Sector 47 said that the situation continued to worsen in the city. “In Sector 47, residents have had to install two water tanks for each house, one on the ground floor and one at the top because it’s impossible to fill the one at the top with the dismal water pressure we get.”Many residents are also complaining about muddy water supply in the city. President of the Sector 38 (West) resident welfare association (RWA) and Federation of Sector Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chief spokesperson Pankaj Gupta said, “Every year in the summers we get muddy water in the morning and the problem goes unchecked despite numerous complaints. Will the MC take responsibility if a resident falls sick?”In Sector 51, Dr KS Johar, a resident here, said, “Though it doesn’t happen every morning, some days we get muddy water and we have to fill a bucket of water and discard it before it can be used. It happens year-round for us and we have approached the authorities on many occasions but to no avail.”Speaking about this, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “I am not aware whether the department has received any such complaint, but I urge people to come forward. There are no problems from our side, usually these are local faults that lead to problems in supply. MC officials will get the faults checked wherever we receive complaints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/water-supply-troubles-persist-in-chandigarh-s-southern-sectors-101624905674299.html

Utkarsh Dwivedi, a sixth semester student of mechanical engineering at University Institute of Engineering and Technology said, “We were able to download the paper and submit it on time. Some leeway was also given in case of any connectivity issues.”While there was no surveillance, an engineering student confirmed that the paper had been set in such a way to discourage cheating. “The questions weren’t straightforward and a little different from what we were taught. Those who didn’t study would have had trouble solving it,” the student said.Vice-chancellor Raj Kumar inquired and remained connected with Bhushan for the smooth conduct of the online exams. Around 2.3 lakh students will be taking the even semester exams over 34 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-online-semester-exams-begin-42-850-students-appear-on-day-1-101624905494746.html
29-06-2021||Chandigarh||Anti-rabies vaccine still out of stock at govt clinics in Chandigarh||Already concerned over the increasing cases of dog bite, the residents of Chandigarh are even struggling to get anti-rabies shots at the city’s government clinics as the injections have been out of stock for over a week now.Due to unavailability of the drug at the clinics in Sectors 19 and 38, and at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16, the victims are being asked to purchase the injection from private chemist shops, which cost over ₹300 per injection. As per the UT health department, around 150 anti-rabies injections are used per day at the three clinics.Dinesh Kumar, a Sector-10 resident, said, “A dog had bitten me on May 31 and my fourth anti-rabies vaccine dose was due on Monday. I reached the Sector 19 centre at 9am, the in-charge reached at 9.15am. By the time the centre opened, a huge rush of victims was witnessed and no social distancing was followed. After filling the details on my card, the doctor told me that the vaccine was unavailable at the centre.”“The doctor then told me to buy an injection from a nearby chemist shop. One injection bottle cost ₹330 and since it contains two doses, I had to ask someone else to share,” Kumar added.A woman in her late 40s told the Hindustan Times that she visited the Sector-19 centre last week, but the vaccine was still unavailable. Meanwhile, a similar situation was noticed in the Sector 38 clinic.Dr Paramjyoti, in-charge of the Sector-19 dispensary, said, “Not only the city residents but people from neighbouring states also visit the centre to get the anti-rabies vaccine. Also, when vaccines get dried up at Sector-38 and 16 hospitals, people visit our centre. On an average, Sector 19 centre reports 45-50 dog bite cases every day. We had placed the order for vaccine stock, but due to Covid-19, the supply from Mumbai got delayed.”When contacted, Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, said, “We had placed a purchase order for the vaccines with a firm, who were supposed to deliver the stock a few days ago, but it got delayed. We bought emergency stock on Monday and vaccines have been made available in all the centres. We are expecting to receive more doses in a day or two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/antirabies-vaccine-still-out-of-stock-govt-clinics-in-chandigarh-101624905321411.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Central Delhi second most rain deficient district in Delhi||Central Delhi has received only 8.5mm of rain since June 1 this year, making it the driest place in the National Capital so far this season and the second-most rain-deficient district in the country, data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed. Met officials, however, said that this is not unusual since the monsoon is yet to arrive in the national capital.Central Delhi comprises areas like Chandni Chowk, Daryaganj, Paharganj, Karol Bagh, and Pragati Maidan, and has received less than 15% of its normal rainfall of 55.2 mm since June 1 – a deficiency of nearly 85%. The region falls in the “large deficient” category. Of the nine districts in Delhi, four are in the “large deficient” and “deficient” categories while only one falls in the “normal” category.With a shortfall of 93%, Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar is the country’s most rain-deficient district, showed Met department data, and recorded just 5mm of rain till Monday, against the normal of 68.4mm.Besides Central Delhi, East Delhi, North-east Delhi and South Delhi also fall in the “large deficient” category. While East Delhi has received 19.2mm rainfall against the normal of 55.2mm – a shortfall of 65%, North-east Delhi has recorded 20.7mm rainfall, 63% below normal. Meanwhile, South Delhi got 22.2mm — nearly 60% less than normal.South-west Delhi and New Delhi have recorded 29.6mm and 27.7mm rainfall so far – nearly 52% below their respective normal rainfall. North Delhi has received 37.7mm rainfall — 34% less than normal – while North-west Delhi got 29.8 mm rainfall — 30% below the average precipitation. Only West Delhi has received normal rainfall so far — 53.5mm against the average of 55.5mm.IMD officials did not share district-wise data of rainfall in Delhi last year.The weather office uses separate categories such as “large excess”, “excess”, “normal”, “deficient”, “large deficient” rainfall to describe realised rainfall averaged over various time periods — daily, weekly, monthly — for districts and states. As per the IMD classification, when the realised rainfall is -99% to -60% of long-period average (LPA), the rainfall is categorized as large deficient. LPA of rainfall is the rainfall recorded over a particular region for a given interval (like month or season) average over a long period of years.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that since the monsoon is yet to hit the city, such a deficit is not unusual.“Generally during June, thunderstorm activity takes place, which contributes to rain. So far, Delhi has not seen much rain this time. The city mostly witnesses rain during the last week of June but we have not seen significant weather activity so far,” said Srivastava.He said that Delhi’s weather is likely to be dry over the next four-five days. “We will have to wait till the first week of July [for monsoon],” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/central-delhi-second-most-rain-deficient-district-in-delhi-101624905193588.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi University likely to ask if candidates are vaccinated or not||The Delhi University (DU) is likely to seek details of candidates’ vaccination status at the time of the online registration for admission to various undergraduate, postgraduate, and research programmes across its colleges and departments this year, said officials, adding that it will not affect the eligibility of students and is just to help create a database of students’ vaccination status before the university reopens physically. The varsity is also planning to get the vaccination status of its existing students.The online registration process for admission to DU -- similar to last year -- is likely to begin in mid-July. The admission process got delayed this year due to the cancellation of Class 12 exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The university is likely to add a column in the registration form asking candidates if they are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, or yet to be vaccinated. This has nothing to do with their admission. It will be collected only to create a database for the university so that it can prepare well for the future. At the time of reopening, the colleges and departments can directly contact students who were not vaccinated during admission and help them get the shots,” said a senior DU official.To be sure, DU is yet to take a final call on the matter. The official said that, if included, the registration form will give three options to candidates -- partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and not vaccinated.Colleges across DU have been shut since March last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The university reopened briefly in November last year for laboratory work of final year research students but it was again closed in April when the second wave of the pandemic hit the country.Meanwhile, DU is also planning to collect data on the vaccination status of all students already enrolled across its colleges. DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi said, “I will soon be writing to all the principals to collect information from all students and teachers on their status of vaccination. We will help those students who could not get vaccinated as of now. We want our entire university to be vaccinated before we reopen and re-start physical classes.”The union ministry of education is yet to issue guidelines for the reopening of education institutions after the second wave of the pandemic.Manoj Sinha, secretary of DU Principals Association (DUPA) and principal of Aryabhatta College, said that it would be helpful for the colleges also to keep a record of vaccinated or unvaccinated students. “The university should go ahead with this idea since this will be excellent for the colleges. It won’t be possible to reopen colleges before our students and teachers are fully vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-likely-to-ask-if-candidates-are-vaccinated-or-not-101624905137456.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Customs arrest two men with heroin worth ₹125 crore at Delhi airport||Two passengers travelling from South Africa, who landed at the Delhi international airport on Sunday, were arrested with 18kg heroin worth ₹125 crore, the Delhi customs said on Monday.The customs said that the two passengers boarded the plane at Johannesberg to reach Delhi via Doha on June 26. The arrived in India on Sunday(June 27). The two were stopped on the basis of profiling after they crossed the green channel and were on their way to the exit gate, customs officials said.The officials checked their bags found 18kg of the contraband. “The drugs were concealed inside their checked-in trolley bags. On testing the sample of the drugs, it was found to be heroine. We have registered a case under the NDPS Act and arrested both of them,” said Shaukat Ali Nurvi, joint commissioner of Customs, IGI airport.Preliminary investigation has shown that though one of the passengers had come to India once, the second was travelling to the country for the first time. The two men in their documents said they came to India for “tourism and business”.“We are following the leads and are tracing the supply chain. The investigation is on,” said NurviAccording to investigating agencies heroin is one of the most common and expensive drugs smuggled into the country. The drug is concealed in bags, clothes, shoes and also items like iron, shampoo bottles to ensure to escape authorities.About two months ago, the Customs had seized 14kg heroin from two passengers from Zambia. Earlier this month, two Afghans were arrested with nearly 20kg of heroin, which was concealed in shampoo and hair colour bottles.Officials said they calculated the price of heroin based on the rates on the website of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Officials said that while the price of one kilogram of heroin is around ₹40 lakh in its raw form, the drug passes through multiple channels because of which the price increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/customs-arrest-two-men-with-heroin-worth-125-crore-at-delhi-airport-101624905133657.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||NDMC sets up Delhi’s first free public toilet for transpersons||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Monday inaugurated the Capital’s first free public toilet exclusively for transpersons at Raisina Road, said officials, the first in a line of facilities that will be set up across the Lutyens’ Delhi area in the coming months.The facility, built in the parking lot of the Press Club of India complex, was inaugurated by transpersons and civic body officials, and has installed a device that allows users to register complaints.NDMC’s annual 2021-22 budget, tabled in January, laid out plans to build such toilets in the locality.“The facility is Delhi’s first free public toilet service for transpersons. The toilet will remain open between 6am and 10pm every day. The NDMC is also planning to construct more such toilets in the near future after observing challenges and issues with this first one,” said an official who asked not to be named.“The users can give reviews and file complaints using the touchscreen interface there as well as at a register. Whatever issues we will encounter there will be rectified when new such toilets are constructed,” the official added.The Delhi government in February this year made it mandatory for all its departments, offices, district authorities, municipal corporations, state-run companies, as well as the Delhi Police to have separate and exclusive washrooms for transpersons.Transpersons welcomed the initiative.Twenty-year-old Manpreet said, “It has been a big challenge for transpersons to use public toilets. We encounter so many issues, including personal slurs. More such toilets should be constructed across the city. In fact, at all toilet complexes in Delhi, one toilet should be designated for the trans community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmc-sets-up-delhi-s-first-free-public-toilet-for-transpersons-101624905074752.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt begins course to train 5,000 health assistants||As part of its preparation for a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi government, in collaboration with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU) or IP University, on Monday began a certificate course to train 5,000 health assistants in Covid-related care to assist doctors and nurses in hospitals and also support communities in case of medical emergencies.According to the official data, as many as 150,000 people had applied for the 5,000 posts which were open for anyone above 18 years of age and completed schooling. The project was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on June 16 to build a force of 5,000 “community nursing assistants” in the Capital to help medical professionals.The two-week course was launched by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday. “We want to create a model youth force in Delhi that will be equipped with all the basic skills and knowledge to fight any medical crisis. Not only will our youth be prepared to fight any crisis, but they will also be able to provide medical assistance to their family and people in their community,” he said“Within a matter of four days, 1.5 lakh people applied to be a part of this training programme. This indicates that people are enthusiastic to be a part of this course and learn. While we have inducted 5,000 trainees in the first batch, we plan on scaling this and making it a long-term, ongoing initiative,” Sisodia added.Officials from nine Delhi government hospitals, including Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, Chacha Nehru Child clinic, Sanjay Gandhi hospital, Ambedkar Medical college, ESIC Hospital Basaidarapur, Hindu Rao hospital, and Vardhaman Mahavir hospital, will train the selected applicants.The Delhi government has disbursed an amount of ₹5 crore for this initiative.The two-week-long programme has been divided into two stages – the first week will include didactic and demonstrative training, while trainees will receive practical experience in the second week. IP University vice-chancellor (VC) Mahesh Verma said the initiative is being taken because of shortage of medical staff witnessed during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Under this programme, these health assistants will be trained in basic nursing, paramedical, lifesaving, first aid home care, sample collection, and operating oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and other such tasks. After the successful completion of the training programme, they will be awarded a certificate and a medical kit, consisting of a BP measuring machine, pulse oximeter, digital thermometer, etc, by the university,” he said.Health minister Satyendar Jain said that the certificate course will be extremely important to tackle any future medical crises. “This course will be able to provide individuals with employment opportunities, considering there is an increasing need of health assistants in hospitals who will be able to assist nurses and doctors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-begins-course-to-train-5-000-health-assistants-101624905073652.html
29-06-2021||Delhi||Temporary design changes make Delhi Gate crossing safer for pedestrians: Study||Officials from the Delhi Traffic Police said the intersection at the Delhi Gate has become more convenient, safe and pedestrian-friendly, two months after they started a trial run at the intersection, in collaboration with World Resources Institute (WRI), India, by introducing road design changes. The Delhi traffic police is in the process of finalising the findings of the trial run and propose necessary infrastructure changes needed at the intersection.Veenu Bansal, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said, “The trial run has shown promising results. The street design interventions have helped in making the intersection more convenient and safe for pedestrians. The trial run has also shown that with the proposed changes, the vehicular traffic load can get cleared very easily. We will submit the observations in the report and the decision regarding implementation of infrastructure changes will be taken at the competent level.”The Delhi Gate intersection in central Delhi is one of the busiest intersections in the Capital with high pedestrian footfall due to its proximity to residential neighbourhoods located in the Walled City areas, commercial centres and offices, sports stadium, educational institutions and two major hospitals on Asaf Ali road. The pedestrian footfall is also high as the Delhi Gate metro station on the violet line-- an important pedestrian node for the surrounding areas--is also nearby.In April, the traffic police and the WRI India, which is helping analyse the major blackspots in Delhi, started the trial run at the Delhi Gate intersection. WRI India recently submitted the draft report to Delhi traffic police.The intersection is crucial as it connects the Old Delhi area with New Delhi. It also connects the New Delhi Railway station with the Ring Road. It is surrounded by major arterial roads such as Asaf Ali Road, Jawahar Lal Nehru Marg (west- east), Netaji Subash Marg, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg (north -south).Explaining the problems at the intersection, Amit Bhatt, director transport at WRI India, said, “The pedestrian movement is high at the intersection due to the type of developments around it. As per our assessment, 99% of the people living in the vicinity prefer to walk and access various modes of public transport near this intersection. The intersection has become dangerous for pedestrians due to unequal road width and alignment, no dedicated space for pedestrians to stand while manoeuvring the traffic at the intersection. The increase in width of the carriageways near the intersections makes it difficult for pedestrians to cross it in the limited time available.”During the trial, some basic design changes were introduced to create more and safe space for pedestrians.Bhatt said, “Earlier, the intersection was very wide. We have made it more compact by reworking on the turning radius of the road at the intersection. We also reworked on the carriageways by rebalancing the lane width and numbers. This streamlining is helping in faster clearing of traffic load at the intersection at a safe speed. The uneven road width used to result in traffic bottlenecks earlier.”As per the study done by WRI India, nearly 51% people either walk or use public transport. Bhatt added, “We have provided huge corner Islands and efficient median islands. As part of the trial, we had painted the pedestrian zones and put bollards to demarcate lands. The study in the past few months has shown that pedestrians find the crossing much safer now. If these design changes are made permanent, then it will solve the problem to a large extent. The tactical to permanent approach is something that Delhi can adopt for all such road projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/temporary-design-changes-make-delhi-gate-crossing-safer-for-pedestrians-wri-study-101624905015664.html
29-06-2021||Other||2 men, minor on way to dispose woman’s body held||Two men were arrested and a minor boy apprehended when they were travelling in an autorickshaw with the body of a homeless woman wrapped in a bedsheet, after allegedly strangling her to death at a flat in outer Delhi’s Balbir Vihar near Aman Vihar on June 23, said police.The three allegedly killed the woman following a dispute over ₹1,000 and were looking for an isolated spot to dump the body, when three constables patrolling the streets caught them in Begampur, said police.Around 3.30am last Wednesday, an autorickshaw being driven with its headlights off in the dark raised the suspicion of the three constables. When the constables signalled the auto driver to stop, the driver tried to speed away. One of the constables chased the autorickshaw and intercepted it after 200 to 300 metres, said a police officer, who asked not to be named.“The driver escaped on foot, while the two persons in the passenger seat were seen holding on to a wrapped bundle. When the constable asked what that was, the suspects untied the bedsheet and to reveal a woman’s body. The suspects were immediately arrested,” said the officer adding that the driver, identified as Rajan Gupta (25), was caught later in the day.Of the two passengers, one was a 16-year-old boy while the other was a man identified as Mahendra Nath (18). The two men were arrested and the juvenile apprehended after the three allegedly admitted to killing the 24-year-old woman, identified by her first name as Shivani. A case of murder and destruction of evidence was registered at Aman Vihar police station.Police said Shivani lived on the streets after her husband left her around a year ago; her family members had disowned her as she was a substance user. For the past few days, she was in the company of the suspects as they too allegedly consumed drugs.Another police officer associated with the case said, “Gupta told police that on June 22, Shivani, Nath and the boy were at his first floor flat in Balbir Nagar and were consuming alcohol and taking drugs. Around midnight, she started demanding ₹1,000 from Gupta.”“When he refused, she became violent and slapped and abused him. This infuriated the suspects and when she tried to scream, Gupta strangled her. The teenager held her mouth shut with his hands and Nath held on to her legs. After she died, they panicked and planned to dispose of the body,” said the second officer, quoting the confession of the three suspects.Police said the suspects wrapped the woman’s body in a bedsheet and put it in the autorickshaw owned by Gupta’s father. They were nearly three kilometers away from the crime scene when the policemen stopped the auto and discovered the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-men-minor-on-way-to-dispose-woman-s-body-held-101624905014915.html
29-06-2021||Other||Woman, friend held for failed robbery bid at sister’s house||New Delhi: To fund her drinking habit, a 21-year-old woman allegedly planned a failed robbery attempt at her sister’s house in Nilothi Extension in outer Delhi along with two of her friends who executed it on Saturday afternoon, police said on Monday. While the woman, Jyoti alias Pari, and one of friends, Sunny (24), have been arrested, the police are now looking for the third suspect, identified as Saif. Police said the woman had become friends with the two men last year while playing PUBG Mobile, one of the most popular mobile games that was banned in India last September along with 176 other Chinese apps. Police said both Jyoti, who previously worked with a businessman dealing in used cars, and Sunny, who worked in a printing press, had lost their jobs during the lockdown.Jyoti needed money to sustain her drinking habit so she planned a robbery at her sister’s house and included her two friends who were also in need of money. She had told them that her brother-in-law kept ₹50,000- ₹60,000 at home,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.On Saturday, after Jyoti’s brother-in-law Brijesh, who is into the house painting business, left home, she alerted her two friends. Around 1 pm, the two men knocked at the door and introduced themselves as Brijesh’s friends to his wife, Shashi, who opened the door, the DCP said.“The duo pushed her inside and one of them pointed a pistol at her head. The other man shut her mouth and pinned her on the floor. They searched the house but could not find the money. They fled after locking the house from outside. Shashi raised an alarm and was rescued by her neighbours. She informed the police about the crime,” said DCP Singh, adding that a case was registered and investigation was taken up.During the probe, the police said, investigators scanned the CCTV cameras installed in the neighbourhood and found that the suspects had arrived on a scooter that they had parked some 250 metres away from the complainant’s home. When police noticed that the accused had left the scooter behind, they positioned two police personnel in plan clothes in the area to keep a vigil.The personnel caught Sunny when he came by to take away the scooter after a few hours. During questioning, he also allegedly spilled the beans on Jyoti, who was also subsequently arrested. Police also seized a toy pistol used in the crime from Sunny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-friend-held-for-failed-robbery-bid-at-sister-s-house-101624905013670.html

In Maharashtra, the total area for sowing kharif seeds is 14.118 million hectares. As of date, sowing has been completed across 2.275 million hectares. The State agriculture department claims that Maharashtra has received, in the first 21 days of June, 145.3mm rainfall. This is lower than the rainfall received over the same duration last year (175.70 mm).“In the first two weeks of June, most places in Maharashtra received rains with thundershowers and it does not help sowing activity. To collect moisture, soil needs continuous moderate rain for a longer duration, which has not happened until now,” said an official from the state agriculture department, requesting anonymity.With western Maharashtra receiving a few good spells of rain last week, sowing activity is expected to improve in the coming days.“Pune district has received 131.7mm rainfall till now and for sowing, soil becomes favourable after receiving 100 mm rainfall. Farming activities will increase as we go into the second week of July,” the official added.So far in Pune, of 0.867 million hectares available for sowing of the Kharif crop, 0.141 million hectares have been sowed.“Nandurbar, Dhule, Akola and Nashik have still not started as those districts have received very less rainfall,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sowing-of-kharif-crop-in-maharashtra-currently-at-16-2-lower-than-2020-101624904234692.html
29-06-2021||Patna||JD-U to fight UP polls, with or without NDA||The Janata Dal (United), which heads the ruling alliance in Bihar, has decided to contest assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh scheduled next year as part of the National Democratic Alliance or alone, its general secretary KC Tyagi said on Monday.“Our first choice will be to contest as part of the BJP-led NDA and we hope it works out. We have had old presence in UP since the days of the erstwhile Samata Party, though we did not contest in 2017. We had MLAs in the UP and we also had ministers in the government. The objective is to revive the party beyond Bihar,” Tyagi said.In the last Delhi assembly elections in 2020, the JD-U, to which Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar belongs, had contested two seats as part of the NDA, pinning its hopes on the migrant Bihari population, but could not win any seat in the AAP sweep. In Jharkhand, it contested 46 of the 81 seats on its own in 2019, but drew a blank.JD-U’s decision to enter the UP fray is significant. In UP, BJP under Yogi Adityanath is unlikely to leave much space for smaller parties even as the Opposition is trying to cobble up a united front to stop it from retaining power. In Bihar, strains are unmistakable in the alliance between the two parties.Tyagi said JD-U was part of the NDA, but at the same time it also wanted to expand its footprint in other states where it has had good organisation in the past.Last year, the party suffered at the hands of its ally in Arunachal Pradesh when six of its seven MLAs there joined the BJP. JD-U had contested 15 seats in Arunachal and won seven in 2019.A senior party leader said that JD-U would continue with its expansion plan to get the required percentage of votes to be registered as a national party. “It may not have won many seats, but it did make its presence felt in several states. The effort is to reach out to more states like Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Kerala, Tamil Nadu etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-to-fight-up-polls-with-or-without-nda-101624898833231.html
29-06-2021||Pune||Curbs return; businesses struggle for survival, some shut shop in Pune||Pune: It is been a tough decision for Sagar Abnawe who runs a footwear shop in Dhankawadi area. After repeated struggle to run his business for the past few months, he has finally given up owing to the Covid situation and financial unviability. In his 30s, Abnawe closed down his shop this month and is hunting for a job that will guarantee monthly income. “Since the Covid-19 pandemic stuck, we were hardly able to do any business due to many lockdowns. While the number of customers fell, most of the months either went into complete lockdown or restriction of timings which is as good as a lockdown for us,” said Abnawe. Many like Abnawe have decided to move from existing business given the uncertainties that the pandemic-induced lockdowns have brought. In Pune, curbs returned from Monday with timings for non-essential shops revised till 4 pm, from earlier 7 pm. The malls were shut barely two weeks after they resumed activities and restaurants are now allowed to operate for dine-in only till 4pm. The latest restrictions have majorly impacted the business of non-essential traders and shop owners along with hoteliers. Throughout the city, there are several big showrooms, shops and traders who have closed down their business due to losses. Another trader Mahesh Kasat, who owns a wholesale shop in Ravivar peth, said, “We are in the business of steel, aluminium, copper and other household utensils. Customers either come in the morning or after the office hours end by 5.30pm. The revised restrictions will hit our business. I have already been going through losses of over ₹20 lakh due to the pandemic. If the situation continues, I will be left with no alternative but to shut shop.” Many shop owners fear of manpower shortage. “As the state government’s restriction norms keep on changing every month, the labour workers and staff who mostly come from outside the state are not willing to return from home town. We are already facing a crisis of getting workers for the shop and now this timing restrictions have added up to our worries,” said Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi road Ganpati chowk traders association. Those running shops inside malls are reeling under heavy loss. They were allowed to reopen only at 50% capacity and now had to close down after two weeks. Fatehchand Ranka, president, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) said, “We strongly oppose the decision taken by the state government to shift Pune district in Level 3 and reduce business timings. The rise in Covid cases is always blamed on shop owners and traders. We have always been supportive to all the government decisions, but now the state should immediately change the orders and allow us to keep shops open till 8 pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curbs-return-pune-businesses-relive-worst-struggle-for-survival-101624892892870.html

29-06-2021||Dehradun||HC stays U’khand govt Char Dham yatra move||The Uttarakhand high court on Monday stayed the state Cabinet’s decision to allow Char Dham yatra from July 1 for the locals of the three districts of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi. The Kedarnath shrine is located in Chamoli district, Badrinath shrine in Chamoli district, Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines are in Uttarkashi district. The division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Verma, while expressing dissatisfaction over the affidavit filed by the state government amid fears of a third wave and the Delta plus variant, said the yatra should not be allowed. The bench said it was not satisfied with the preparedness of the government, especially regarding the healthcare facilities and status of Covid-19 inoculation in these three districts. The high court directed the state government to livestream the daily prayers and ritual ceremonies held at these shrines instead. The state Cabinet had allowed the Char Dham yatra for the locals in the three districts after a meeting chaired by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday. On June 23, high court had lashed out at the state government for having announced Char Dham yatra from July 1 amid fears of the third wave and delta plus variant. The court had directed the state government to review its decision in the Cabinet meeting and inform it about the same on June 28. The state government had said that it would be issuing guidelines for the pilgrimage for people from three districts. The high court gave these directions while hearing a bunch of PILs filed by petitioners Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, Anu Pant and Rajendra Arya related to various issues regarding the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic in the state. Mainali said the high court was dissatisfied with the affidavit submitted by the state government. “The court remarked that it seemed the state government had copied the SOP it had prepared for Mahakumbh as there are references about arrangements in Haridwar and Dehradun in it,” he said Mainali said regarding the issue of livestreaming, the advocate general of Uttarakhand SN Babulkar, who represents the state government, raised concerns about security,since these shrines are in districts bordering China. “The high court responded by saying that livestreaming is already happening at noted shrines of the country like Mahakal in Indore. The court also pointed out that it is not asking to livestream the location of the shrines but prayers being offered inside the sanctum sanctorum of these shrines,” he said.  On June 23, the high court stressed that “Perhaps the Char Dham Yatra needs to be postponed or cancelled, as already the Amarnath Yatra has been cancelled by the Jammu & Kashmir administration.” The high court in its June 23 order had also remarked that considering the fact that a large gathering invariably leads to a spike in the Covid-19 pandemic, “This Court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe like Covid-19 pandemic should not be re-invited by holding and permitting large gathering at religious shrines, and by permitting the Char Dham yatra by the State government. Therefore, this court directs the state government to review its decision to commence the Char Dham Yatra on July 1.” The high court had also pointed out that “Already holding of Kumbh Mela, and permitting a large congregation of lakhs of people on Ganga Dussehra at Har-ki-Pauri at Haridwar, are clear cut proof of the failure of the civil administration, to administer the precautionary SOPs.” On June 20, the state government had announced the opening of Char Dham yatra in two phases, the first phase would commence from July 1 for locals from three districts. Earlier on April 29, the state government had postponed Char Dham yatra, which was scheduled to start on May 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-stays-cabinet-decision-of-allowing-char-dham-yatra-from-july-1-101624876632948.html
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai University students mount campaign to fight Covid vaccine hesitancy||Around 2,000 students from colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai have recently reached out to over 22,500 people through WhatsApp and posted 1,200 messages on various social media websites to help in India’s fight against vaccine hesitancy, proving to be a significant hurdle in several pockets of the country.The students were trained to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour and the importance of vaccines in sessions conducted by United Way Mumbai-- an NGO involved in Covid relief-- in partnership with UNICEF or the United Nations Children’s Fund and the National Service Scheme (NSS) wing of the university.“This training helped bust myths such as the one claiming menstruating women should not be vaccinated. I shared this with my own mother who finally got the vaccine without any hesitation,” said Nishtha Bansal, from VES College Chembur.Several such myths were responsible for a large section of the population staying away from vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too asked people on Sunday to shed vaccine hesitancy, dispel rumours and deepen their faith in science and scientists, who have toiled to develop the life-saving shots in the year of the pandemic. The NGO said the students are a big help in carrying the government’s message to the doorstep of people.“Vaccination is the silver bullet to fight the pandemic but we have noticed immense vaccine hesitancy among the middle and low income communities.Majority of the students we are working with come from the very same communities. Not only are these students advocating the use of vaccines but also helping people register and get appointments online,” said Sahej Mantri, senior manager for campaigns run by United Way in Mumbai.Mantri said students thoroughly enjoyed the training sessions as it allowed them to pick up social media skills while doing social work. “Social media today is a key professional skill set and students get excited when they can learn new skills and at the same time follow their passion for social work,’’ said Sudhir Puranik, incharge director, NSS wing, MU.India has so far administered 371.8 million doses to 265.4 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 209 million people have received one dose, while 56.4 million people have been fully vaccinated till Sunday morning, according to government data.While the threat of the third wave of the disease hovers around, experts say that the pace of India’s immunisation drive still needs to pick up, because even at this rate (of six millions jabs per day), it would take India until February 2022 to vaccinate its entire adult population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-students-mount-campaign-to-fight-covid-vaccine-hesitancy-101624860911632.html
