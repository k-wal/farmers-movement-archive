The video went “viral” on Sunday. Superintendent of police (Sant Kabirnagar) Dr Kaustubh said after taking cognizance of the video, an inquiry had been ordered into the incident. In the video, the trio was seen carrying the body to the field in an excavator along with the cot on which their father had died. They used the excavator to dig up field to bury the body and the cot. The station house officer (SHO) of Dharamsinghwa police station has been directed to submit a report. Action will be taken against those who flouted the state government’s order to cremate or bury the bodies of Covid -19 patients according to the Covid protocol, the SP said. A district administration officer said Ram Lalit, 62, resident of Parsa Shukla village, complained of breathing difficulty on May 22. His sons took him to a private hospital in Gorakhpur. The hospital admitted him and he tested positive for Covid-19. Nevertheless, the sons got their father discharged from the hospital on May 23 to take him to their village. Ram Lalit died after reaching the village. Instead of using a hearse, the sons hired an excavator to transport the body and the cot on which their father died. The three sons, Buddhi Ram, Anil and Mohan, said when the villagers and neighbours came to know that their father was Covid positive, they closed their doors. “With no support from the villagers or the family members, we decided to hire a JCB machine to bury the body,” they said. Countering the sons’ statement, the village pradhan’s representative Triyuga Nand Gautam said the village panchayat members offered assistance to Ram Lalit’s sons in cremating of the body, but they turned down the offer. A medical practitioner Dr AK Singh said the district administration should ensure that the body of a Covid-19 patient was buried or cremated according to the protocol in order to check the spread of infection. Dumping a body in a field was in violation of the protocol, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-men-bury-covid-19-positive-father-s-body-in-up-village-field-probe-ordered-101622486809557.html

June 10 is now the last date for the bids.“Yes, we are extending the last date for the submission of bids by 10 days,” said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad.This is the second such extension. It comes a day before the launch of vaccination for all above 18 years of age in all 75 districts of the state. A senior officer of the state government said sufficient quantity of vaccine was available in Uttar Pradesh. The officer also said the state government proposed to administer one crore doses in June following the directives of chief minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard.The state government had earlier fixed May 21 as the last date and then extended it by 10 days to May 31 on the request of the vaccine manufacturers.A decision to further extend the last date was taken after briefing the state cabinet (by circulation method) about the demand and the availability of the vaccine for the 18-45 year age group.Prasad said the last date was extended again on the request of the vaccine manufacturing companies that were keen to participate in the global tender. The representatives of the various companies again sought the extension on the same issues as earlier, including regulatory approval from the central government, Prasad said. Others said that they needed time to maintain the vaccine stock as, according to the bid conditions, the companies would have to supply the second dose after the first one, he added. The representative of another company said that they needed time for obtaining approval for the vaccine rate, the additional chief secretary said.Even as foreign vaccine manufacturing companies Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson have said that they have a policy to enter into agreements only with national governments, Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the UP government had opened channels with the foreign companies. In the pre-bid meeting held on May 13, top vaccine manufacturing companies — Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech and a Korean company — had raised the issues of storage and transportation of the vaccines and bid security. The state government on May 17 had revised the supply conditions, bid security and eligibility terms for the bidders to pave the way for the participation of maximum companies. In the revised tender, the state government stated that the manufacturers of vaccines requiring storage or transportation at temperatures like -20 degrees Celsius, -70 degrees Celsius or -80 degrees Celsius can participate in the tender, thereby paving the way for the entry of foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson in the global tender.The vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer are stored at low temperatures, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-again-extends-deadline-for-submission-of-vaccine-bids-101622486569569.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC pulls up Chandigarh admn for ‘undue hurry’ in power privatisation||The Punjab and Haryana high court has come down heavily on the Chandigarh administration for showing “undue hurry” in pushing for power privatisation amid a raging pandemic. “... we are unable to reconcile with the fact that when the whole world is grappling with the deadly virus, when there is no oxygen, no ICUs, a long queue at the cremation grounds and no place in the hospitals, the undue hurry on the part of the administration to hand over the profit-making department to a private entity at this stage of the history and in this situation of crisis faced by the entire mankind, seems to be misplaced,” the bench of justice Jitendra Chauhan and justice Vivek Puri recorded. Justice Chauhan retired on Friday, the day the bench stayed the UT’s move to privatise the power department. The order, which came on a plea of the UT Powermen Union, was released on Monday. Earlier, on December 1 too, the HC had applied brakes on the process. However, the UT approached the Supreme Court, which had stayed the HC order but also remanded back the case to it.‘A profit-making entity’ The bench said that it is not clear as to what was the intended purpose of setting up the engineering wing — the power distributor in the city — and whether it has failed to achieve the same. The court also wondered that when the department is a profit-making entity, how it is covered under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self -Reliant India Mission). “If the argument on behalf of the respondents is to make India ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, we are at a loss to understand that what can be more ‘Atmanirbhar’ than an institution made in India, by Indians, operationalised by Indians, creating jobs for Indians and enriching the Indian State with its profits,” it remarked. ‘Protect such institutions’The bench further said that such institutions (departments) should be protected, as they provide a security net for the society to fall back upon, for the poorest of the poor to dream of a better future and for the person at the end of the line to be aspirational, so that he too can be part of the Indian dream. “The proposed action of privatisation is in direct conflict with the nation’s agenda ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” the bench asserted. The bench said that at a time when the functioning of the courts is curtailed and the petition could not be decided, the cause of “justice and humanity” will be better served by putting the process in abeyance. “We feel that privatisation is not a panacea for all the ills and privatisation with blind motive of so-called efficiency falls flat as this department is not only a profitable one but also time and again matched the high standards of customer satisfaction and has a big role in maintaining the City Beautiful,” it recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-pulls-up-chandigarh-admn-for-undue-hurry-in-power-privatisation-101622486270663.html

He directed that school fees of all such children be exempted. Also, if any child needs accommodation in the administration’s welfare home, it should be provided for free, he said. He also directed Nitika Pawar, secretary, social welfare, to prepare a comprehensive scheme in consultation with the sub-committee of administrator’s advisory council so that the affected children could be fully rehabilitated.Last week, the UT education department had asked all cluster heads to collect information of students in government schools who have lost at least one parent to Covid. Over 40 such cases have been identified. Senior officials of the department confirmed that these details have been sought from private schools as well.Mini Covid centres to continue till June endThe administrator expressed satisfaction over the availability of oxygen and medicines at all medical facilities. He directed that the civil hospital in Sector 45 be converted into an exclusive paediatric hospital for children who suffer from Covid.Also, mini Covid care centres have been allowed to continue till June end.

In the video, a Covid-19 patient is seen lying under a washbasin, near the toilet while another is lying naked on the floor.The video was allegedly shared by the attendant of a Covid-19 patient who died at the hospital on May 23.Bibhudutta Dash, who lives in Baripada town of Myurbhanj, said he admitted his relative to the Covid-19 hospital in Baripada on May 22.“As his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to another Covid hospital at Bankisole, about 10 kilometres from Baripada town. On May 23 at noon, I was informed about the death of my relative,” said Dash, who got the video clip on Saturday.“In the video, I saw my relative sitting on the bed on which there was no bed sheet and pillow. He was wearing just a towel. Some of them are also seen sleeping in front of the toilet. There were some oxygen cylinders in the ward. But there was no one to operate them. There are no staff nurses and doctors to attend to the patients. The government is spending a huge amount on the treatment of the Covid patients but where is all the money going and to whom?” he asked.BJP MLA from Baripada, Prakash Soren, also alleged negligence in the treatment of patients at the Covid hospital at Bankisole. “Several patients are dying in the facility in the absence of oxygen support. The doctors do not understand what the patients want and the nurses do not come close to them fearing infection. The situation is such that patients do not even get food on time,” he alleged.Mayurbhanj district collector Vineet Bhardwaj said efforts are on to install CCTVs in the hospital to monitor the activities and fill the gaps.The hospital was set up last year after the Mayurbhanj administration signed an MoU with the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS). It was closed in March after cases of Covid-19 dipped in the district.This month, the National Human Rights Commission issued summons to the Odisha health secretary to appear before it on June 30 over the death of a Covid-19 patient at the verandah of the district headquarters hospital of Dhenkanal due to the alleged negligence of medical staff.In the second wave of Covid, at least 830 patients in Odisha have succumbed to the disease since April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patients-sleeping-near-toilets-video-of-odisha-s-covid-19-hospital-goes-viral-101622485850036.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi likely to get Sputnik shots only after June 20, says Kejriwal||The Capital is likely to receive its first consignment of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines after June 20, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday, even as the Capital’s government-run vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group continue to remain shut after having run out of the two India-made vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, the doses of which will only be available by June 10, according to health officials.“Sputnik will probably offer vaccines only after June 20. They (Indian manufacturer of Sputnik) will start vaccine production in August. As of now, Sputnik V vaccines are being imported to our country. A portion of these imported vaccines will also be allotted to the Delhi government,” Kejriwal told reporters after opening a vaccine centre for journalists and their families at ITO.The chief minister reiterated that the central government should procure vaccines through a single global tender and distribute them to states. “It has become apparent that states are not able to procure vaccines on their own and the Centre has to do it. States should be held responsible if and when they are not able to make proper arrangements to administer the vaccines after the Centre has procured, produced and supplied vaccines to us,” Kejriwal said.Also read: Covid orphaned 1,700 children, another 7,400 lost one parent, Supreme Court toldThe government vaccination centres for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years have been closed for over a week after Delhi ran out of its allocated vaccine doses for the month. Next month, the city will receive even fewer doses. Only 550,000 vaccine doses will be available in June as compared to over 817,000 doses that it got in the month of May.“In Delhi, government vaccination centres have been completely closed for the 18-plus age group for more than a week. Only private hospitals are vaccinating the young, but at expensive rates. We urge the central government to make available vaccines for the youth soon because the lockdown in Delhi will slowly be eased and youngsters will move out of homes once the process begins,” said AAP MLA Atishi.Although vaccine doses were available with only three major hospital chains in Delhi – Max, Fortis, and Apollo – at the beginning of the month, at least 14 others have started inoculating people between the ages of 18 and 45 years.The vaccine doses have been procured by individual hospitals. Of the 14 hospitals, with several branches and sites, Covaxin is being administered at five and Covishield at the rest, according to Co-WIN portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-likely-to-get-sputnik-vaccines-only-after-june-20-kejriwal-101622485609452.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||BJP trying to stop CM efforts to give Covid jabs to all: Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday accused Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and ministers of criticising chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for his “relentless efforts” towards vaccinating every adult in the national Capital, instead of extending their support.“It is the prerogative of the Delhi government to ensure each and every citizen gets vaccinated at once. Every time CM Kejriwal begins his work towards helping people and managing the Covid crisis, BJP leaders, instead of following his lead, start attacking him and try to stop his efforts,” Sisodia said in a digital press conference.Delhi BJP leaders dismissed the charges, and said the turnout at vaccinations centres in Delhi was low.Sisodia’s statement came hours after Haryana CM ML Khattar accused Kejriwal of playing politics over Covid vaccines, saying Delhi is exhausting its supply too soon while his state is stretching it over a longer period.Kejriwal also responded to this through a tweet in Hindi: “Khattar sahab, it is only with vaccines that we can save the lives of people. The sooner vaccines are administered, more people will be protected (from the virus). My goal is not to save vaccines, but to save people’s lives.”At the press conference, Sisodia reiterated that “the mission of the Delhi government is to save people, not vaccines”.Also read| Delhi likely to get Sputnik vaccines only after June 20: KejriwalKhattar’s comment was also criticised by the Congress. “Deliberate delay in administering vaccines is also being termed as a strategy. He (CM) says the government has vaccines, but these will be administered to people in small numbers over several days. This is the reason why the people of Haryana are not able to get the vaccines...,” said Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet in Hindi.On Sunday, BJP national president JP Nadda, ostensibly alluding to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), had said it was creating “hindrances” in Delhi.Sisodia, on Monday, said BJP leaders make false statements to “hide their own failures”. “When the nation was reeling under Covid cases and needed immediate help, BJP government was more interested in managing their image and conducting elections. It seems like the only mission is to sell and save vaccines by playing dirty politics,” he said.In response, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta accused the AAP of resorting to politics over the issue.“Nobody is stopping them from demanding vaccines for Delhi... When it was time to talk to Indian vaccine manufacturers, AAP leaders were busy criticising the Centre and now when they failed to arrange vaccine, they are playing politics of confrontation with private hospitals by questioning their vaccine quota,” he said.The Delhi BJP further said there is low turnout in government vaccination centres.“It should be noted that Delhi has 180 vaccination centres where Covishield is being administered to people above 45 years of age. In all these places, the footfall is significantly dismal. In Rohini’s Sector 9 on May 30, the centre had 400 Covishield doses available, and only 55 people took the dose. Today (May 31), only 70 people visited the centre, while it had 400 Covishield doses available for 45+ group. At Prashant Vihar centre on May 29, 100 doses of Covishield were available and only one person got the jab,” claimed Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta.Speaking to reporters on Monday, chief minister Kejriwal said, “Procurement and distribution is the responsibility of the Centre, and administering the vaccines is the responsibility of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-leaders-trying-to-stop-cm-s-efforts-to-vaccine-at-delhi-residents-sisodia-101622485549526.html

Police said they kept watch to ensure unexempted businesses and individuals do not open up or move around.Amid a sharp fall in Covid-19 cases in the city, the Delhi government started easing the lockdown that has been in place in Delhi since April 20, and allowed construction and manufacturing units in approved industrial areas to function from Monday.“The movement on the city’s roads increased marginally.

The police were instructed to use their experience to distinguish genuine workers the rest,” said RP Meena, DCP(south-east), an area which has hundreds of factories in its jurisdiction.While police officers estimated a 5-10% increase in movement on the roads on Monday, not too many factories opened on the first day. “There were also factories that didn’t open due to lack of raw materials, or because opening up wouldn’t be profitable to them without most of their workers,” said Meena.As for compliance with the guidelines at workplaces, police said they held meetings with associations and owners of these factories and construction sites. “They were counselled and sensitised about the guidelines...

The number of deaths due to the aggressive infection, commonly known as black fungus, is higher than the recoveries so far — only 41 people who contracted the fungal infection in the national capital have recovered.There were 748 black fungus patients undergoing treatment for the infection in Delhi as on Monday, according to data received by the Delhi government from hospitals in the city.“There are nearly 300 cases of black fungus in central government hospitals, and around 650 in Delhi government hospitals. However, the supply of injections to treat the infection is not adequate. We received 1,000 injections two days ago (Saturday), but did not receive any on Sunday. It takes three or four injections per person per day to effectively treat the infection,” Kejriwal said on Monday. The CM included patients who have been discharged or have died, officials later clarified.Also read: Delhi’s Covid-19 positivity rate below 1% after 74 daysMucormycosis is a fungal infection that usually affects the mouth, nose, and eyes, and may then spread to the brain.The recovery of patients with the infection has been hit by the acute shortage of Amphotericin-B, the only effective last-line medicine for the fungus. The medicine, which is under the Centre’s control, is allocated based on the number of cases reported from each state. So far, Delhi has received only 4,670 vials of the drug; each patient needs 50 vials of the medicine per week on average, according to doctors.“Whenever we get the allocation from the Centre, we distribute them to hospitals in proportion to the number of infections in each facility. There is a huge shortage of the life-saving medicine,” said another senior official from Delhi’s health department, asking not to be named. The Delhi government has set up a four-member technical expert committee that approves or denies requests from hospitals for the drug.A doctor from a Delhi government hospital, requesting anonymity, said, “Although we are still getting higher than usual black fungus cases, they’re slowly decreasing. It’s because there is awareness about the infection and the use of steroids has gone down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/59-dead-of-black-fungus-while-only-41-have-recovered-so-far-shows-delhi-govt-data-101622485430268.html

You think you will get away with this kind of a false statement. Don’t we know what the situation on ground was like? One thing is very clear. You cannot take us for a ride. If you think we are gullible, so naive; we are not. We will give it back to you very, very hard...“There is a fundamental error of approach. The manner in which you have conducted the investigation is questionable…We reject the report ...this is trash. What investigation is this? There is no legal basis for it. We reject it here. If your drug controller is not interested in doing the job, then we will ask that he be removed and let somebody else take over,” the bench said.It, however, accepted the clean chit given to AAP MLA Preeti Tomar.A senior official from Delhi’s health department said, “The court has asked for a detailed report, which will be submitted in three days.” The head of Delhi’s drug control office, AK Nasa, declined to comment.In its report, the drug controller said the Gautam Gambhir Foundation’s (GGF) distribution of Fabiflu strips appeared to be covered by an exception mentioned in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, since the drugs were given away during an event that was being treated as a medical camp organised under the supervision of a doctor from Garg Hospital in the city.“You better do your job. If you can’t do your job, tell us, we will have you suspended and let someone else do your job,” the court said directing the drug controller to file a fresh report with better enquiry by Thursday.The court came down heavily on the drug controller for not examining how large quantities of drug were given out when the doctor had not sought it.“Here is a man who is hoarding thousands of strips of medicine. He is interrupting the flow of medicines... place before us the relevant rules that govern the dealer and sale. This is the inquiry we wanted you to conduct and not say that so many lives have been saved,” the court said.The high court was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians are able to procure in huge quantities and distribute COVID-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them.An application was also filed in the pending petition making allegations against Tomar and Kumar.Advocate Nandita Rao, representing the drug controller, said Gambhir through his foundation organised a medical camp from 22 April to May 7 with the help of Garg Hospital and that while there was no prescription, a request letter by the hospital was sent to the foundation. She said based on the letter of April 19, Gambhir made a purchase order from a licensed dealer.Gambhir, Kumar and Tomar did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-slams-delhi-s-drug-department-for-clean-chit-to-gambhir-101622485310071.html

Many said in the absence of doses even in private hospitals, which were offering them at a premium, they have begun keeping an eye out for slots in Noida, Gurugram and other NCR cities.While the advised gap between two doses of Covishield was recently revised to 12-16 weeks, that between Covaxin doses remains 4-6 weeks.Nishtha Arora, 31, who works in a start-up and is due for her second dose of Covaxin on June 2, has been trying to book a slot for the past five days. “Why is the vaccination not being managed in a manner where the second slot is automatically scheduled ahead of the due date? If there is a time limit, it is important to prioritise the doses,” said Arora.Arora is also considering booking a slot outside Delhi so she doesn’t miss out on the dose within the stipulated window. “I have checked Gurugram and Faridabad for slots. Some of my friends are also suggesting Meerut as a possible option, where I could get the dose. I am yet to decide,” said Arora.When he was asked by reporters about the shortage of vaccines, especially Covaxin, on Monday, CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “We’ll start giving people the second dose as soon as Covaxin is made available to us.”Arun Tayal, a software professional, is trying to book a slot for his wife who can receive her second dose after June 4. “A private hospital in Shalimar Bagh is charging ₹1,250 for the vaccine. Besides that, most private places are also not showing any slots... In Gurugram, Fortis is offering the second dose but the slots are completely filled till 11 June. In Noida, there are 2-3 centres at far-flung locations. I don’t know how we will manage,” said Tayal.A 30-year-old lawyer, who did not wish to be named, said her window for the second dose had started on Monday: “It will get over by June 14.

01-06-2021||Pune||Pune city gets its first drive-in vaccination centre at Hadapsar auditorium||On Monday, Pune saw its first drive-in vaccination centre inaugurated at an auditorium in Hadapsar. Five months after Pune saw the first person in the state to be vaccinated against Covid-19, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started its first drive-in vaccination centre where 64 people got the jab on the first day. The centre is the first of its kind in the city which prioritises senior citizens and the disabled to get the vaccine first.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Chetan Tupe from the area, who inaugurated the centre, said, “The auditorium which was vacant since the pandemic and is not likely to start soon has a large parking space. We thought of starting the first of its kind centre in the city at the parking space. Eligible beneficiaries can either register or walk-in as per the government guidelines to get vaccinated. It takes about three minutes for a person to get vaccinated after all the verification process is done. So, in this centre, a family member who accommodates the beneficiary can complete the registration process and then once the vaccine is ready to be injected the beneficiary can drive in, get the shot, wait for the mandatory 30 minutes observation period and drive out. We have separate entry and exit points to avoid congestion at the parking area.”On the first day, 64 beneficiaries got the jab, including four disabled and one with learning difficulty. Also, four senior citizens who are on bed rest received the jab. As of now, only those above 45 years can get the vaccine at government centres. However, those with special needs would get priority at the centre, a civic official said.Mumbai saw the first such drive-in vaccination centre in the state which was started on May 5 at the multi-storey Kohinoor parking lot near Shivaji park in Dadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-city-gets-its-first-drive-in-vax-centre-at-hadapsar-auditorium-101622469228635.html
