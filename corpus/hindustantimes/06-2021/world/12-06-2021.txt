12-06-2021||World||US rolls out major bills to clip Big Tech’s wings||US lawmakers unveiled sweeping antitrust measures Friday aimed at tempering the dominance of Big Tech firms including Apple and Facebook, in what may be the most ambitious effort in decades to break corporate monopolies.A bipartisan group of House members introduced five separate bills that propose changes so comprehensive they could reshape the largest US technology and entertainment companies and force an overhaul of their business practices.In a bid to ward off corporate consolidation, the measures would make it harder for mega-companies like Amazon and Google to buy out smaller competitors, and facilitate the breakup of firms that use their dominant position in their core business to make deep inroads into another."Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy," the House Judiciary's Antitrust Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Democrat, said in introducing the measures."They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work."The goal, he said, is to "level the playing field" and ensure that powerful tech companies follow the same rules as other businesses.The bills follow a 16-month investigation by the Antitrust Subcommittee into the state of competition in the digital marketplace, and particularly the unregulated power wielded by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.Silicon Valley giants have come under increasing fire in Europe and the United States due to concerns about monopoly-like power.And US President Joe Biden and other G7 countries are keen to set a global tax rate of at least 15 percent on multinational firms, in a bid to optimize tax revenue from tech behemoths.'Power over innovation'The antitrust bills need to be debated and voted favorably out of the Judiciary Committee before receiving a vote by the full House of Representatives.They would also need approval from the Senate before they could be signed into law by Biden.One of the bills increases the fees for mergers so that regulators have more funds to police corporations and enforce antitrust laws."Big Tech has abused its dominance in the marketplace to crush competitors, censor speech, and control how we see and understand the world," said House Republican Ken Buck, who took direct aim at some of the largest players."Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process."The reform effort comes amid heightened scrutiny of large tech platforms which have increased their dominance during the coronavirus pandemic.US state and federal antitrust enforcers last year filed suits targeting Facebook and Google alleging illegal dominance of their respective markets.And last month Amazon was hit with an antitrust suit from the capital Washington, which claimed the tech giant abuses its dominant position in online retail sales, harming consumers.The Computer & Communications Industry Association, of which Google, Amazon and Facebook are members, warned that the latest legislation is too "interventionist" and could mark the biggest departure from US antitrust policy in a century."At a time when consumers are frustrated with higher prices and fewer options in other segments of the economy, it's perplexing that the Committee would not prioritize broad reform" rather than narrow action against a few companies, CCIA President Matthew Schruers said in a statement."Writing regulations for a handful of businesses will skew competition and leave consumers worse off."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rolls-out-major-bills-to-clip-big-tech-s-wings-101623521482084.html

The steps include slashing the time taken to develop and license vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for future disease to under 100 days.The G7 - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will publish the pact on Sunday, alongside its final communique containing further details on the B3W.“The #CarbisBayDeclaration marks a proud and historic moment for us all,” British PM Boris Johnson tweeted. “The world’s leading democracies will commit to preventing a pandemic from happening again, ensuring the devastation caused by Covid-19 is never repeated.”World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the health pact, saying the UN agency will examine a British proposal to create a “Global Pandemic Radar” to send early warnings of future outbreaks.Boris warns EU over post-Brexit tradeBritain will do “whatever it takes” to protect its territorial integrity in a trade dispute with the EU, Johnson said, threatening emergency measures if no solution was found. The threat seemed to break a temporary truce in a war of words over part of the Brexit deal that covers border issues with Northern Ireland, the focus for tensions since Britain left the EU last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-pact-on-pandemics-pledge-to-contain-china-101623520986672.html

The video which was shared by news agency ABC has gone viral spreading cheers all across the world.A post shared by ABC News (@abcnews)The Queen, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge were present at the event which was organised for prime ministers, presidents and their partners. When one of the organisers told the Queen that there is a knife, the Queen promptly replied, “I know there is.” Following this, the Queen went on to cut the cake with a sword moving the guests present at the event to laughter.This was, however, not the only moment where the Queen’s actions led to hilarious reactions. Earlier on Friday, when the G7 summit leaders posed for a photo at an evening reception, the Queen joked with the world leaders.“Are you supposed to be looking as if you’re enjoying yourself?” the Queen was heard saying in a video shared by the Guardian. UK PM Boris Johnson who was next to the Queen replied, “Yes, definitely. We have been enjoying ourselves in spite of appearances.”Queen Elizabeth II’s official birthday was also celebrated on Saturday with a flyover by the Royal Air Force’s acrobatic team, news agency Bloomberg reported.

The bidding closed seven minutes after the auction began. The identity of the winner - presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado - was not immediately disclosed.The July 20 launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard booster from West Texas would be a landmark moment as U.S. firms strive toward a new era of private commercial space travel.Blue Origin's founder and Amazon.com Inc executive Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and a lifelong space enthusiast, has been racing against fellow aspiring billionaire aeronauts Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere."To see the earth from space, changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity," Bezos said in a video before the final bidding took place, adding that his brother Mark will join him on the trip.As the month-long bidding process leading up to the live auction closed on Thursday, the winning figure stood at $4.8 million, fueled by entries from more than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries, Blue Origin said."Putting the world's richest man and one of the most recognized figures in business into space is a massive advertisement for space as a domain for exploration, industrialization and investment," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told clients earlier this month.While the funds raised from the event are earmarked for charity, Blue Origin is hoping to galvanize enthusiasm for its nascent suborbital tourism business.However, Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc , may attempt to steal Bezos' thunder by joining a possible test flight to the edge of space over the July 4 weekend aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane, one person familiar with the matter said.The race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall, fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, as well as Musk's SpaceX, have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities. UBS says that long-haul travel market could be worth more than $20 billion, though several barriers such as air-safety certification could derail the plans.Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips.Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rocket-trip-to-space-with-jeff-bezos-sells-at-auction-for-28-million-101623519427190.html

According to a CNN report, the G7 leaders aired serious differences over the approach and the disagreements reportedly became so sensitive at one point that all internet was shut off to the room.“There was some interesting discussion, and a little bit of differentiation of opinion on, not whether this threat is there but on how strong, from an action perspective, I think different G7 members are willing to take things,” CNN quoted the official as saying.While the G7 leaders unveiled an infrastructure plan for the developing world to counter China’s Belt and Road program, reports suggest that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses. Several leaked documents have revealed China’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority group in Xinjiang, in which they have called it a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism.”Also Read | G7 leaders to sign Carbis Bay Declaration to prevent pandemic in 100 daysUS President Joe Biden has reportedly taken a more hawkish stance but some other leaders are wary of the risk of being seen as an outright anti-China bloc. During Saturday's first session of the G7 summit, Canada, Britain and France largely endorsed Biden's position, while Germany, Italy and the European Union showed more hesitancy, reported The Associated Press.The G7 leaders also discussed setting up a task force on issues related to China. German chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the idea, however, she didn’t want to frame the move as an anti-China effort. “This is not about being against something, but for something,” Merkel told reporters.The G7 Leaders’ Summit formally began on Friday evening at Carbis Bay, a seaside resort and village in Cornwall, UK.

Nearly half the new cases were in Moscow — 6,701 compared with 2,936 a week ago.Faced with the spiking figures, Moscow authorities said enforcement of mask- and glove-wearing on mass transit, in stores and in other public places would be strengthened and that violators could face fines of up to 5,000 rubles (USD 70).For the entire pandemic period, the task force has reported nearly 5.2 million infections in the country of about 146 million people, and 126,000 deaths.However, a report from the state statistics agency Rosstat on Friday found more than 144,000 virus-related deaths last year alone.The statistics agency, unlike the taskforce, counts fatalities in which coronavirus infection was present or suspected but is not the main cause of death.The agency's report found about 340,000 more people died in 2020 than in 2019; it did not give details of the causes of the higher year-on-year death toll.The higher death toll and a lower number of births combined to make an overall population decline of 702,000, about twice the decline in 2019, Rosstat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-covid-19-cases-spike-by-nearly-50-in-a-week-101623516124484.html

Here is the reason||A town in northern Croatia is selling its abandoned houses for one kuna which is 11.83 in Indian rupees as the population of the town has been falling steadily, Reuters reported. The town will also pay one for repairing after a house is purchased. However, the unbelievable price does not come without any conditions. The buyers will have to be below the age of 40 and they will have to commit to staying at Legrad, the Croatian town, for at least 15 years, the report said. "We turned into a border town with few transport connections to other places. Since then the population has been gradually falling," said the town's mayor, Ivan Sabolic.Where is the town?The town is near the border with Hungary and has around 2,250 inhabitants. About 70 years ago, the number was double. How did its population come down?Legrad was once the second-biggest population centre in Croatian territory, but then it suffered from the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire a century ago when new borders left it sidelined, the report said. So far, the town has been able to sell 17 properties have been sold. Since these houses would require repair works, the municipality says it will pay 25,000 kuna towards any refurbishments needed, and for new residents wishing to buy a privately-owned home, the town will cover 20% of the price or up to 35,000 kuna, the mayor said."After some media reports about our action we got enquiries about houses from very distant places like Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina or Colombia," the mayor said. But as immigration rules are complex in Croatia, the municipality is keeping it local. Here are the conditionsIndividuals or couples who want to settle in Legrad include that they must be financially solvent and under the age of 40.They also need to commit to staying at least 15 years.The town offers employment opportunities in food production, wood processing and metal processing industries.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-croatian-town-is-selling-houses-at-rs-12-here-is-the-reason-101623513749714.html

"It’s great to have a US president who’s part of the club and very willing to cooperate.""What you demonstrate is that leadership is partnership," Macron told Biden as they sat on an outdoor terrace with a sweeping view of the turquoise sea behind them.Biden agreed."The United States, I've said before, we're back," Biden said. "Things are going, I think, well, and we’re, as we say back in the States, we’re on the same page."Biden added that the United States felt very strongly about the cohesion of the NATO military alliance and expressed support for the European Union - the target of much criticism from Trump during his 2017-2021 presidency."I for one think that the European Union is an incredibly strong and vibrant entity, that has a lot to do with the ability of Western Europe not only to handle its economic issues but provide the backbone and support for NATO," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-is-back-with-joe-biden-france-s-macron-says-101623510248729.html

"To stop the growth of infections and to save people's lives, today I signed a decree providing for non-working days between June 15-19."The order affects all employees in the Russian capital, a city of 12 million, except for essential workers.Non-essential workers are not required to work from home during the period, but will still retain their salaries.Together with the weekends and a public holiday on June 14, it means most Moscow workers will not return to their offices until June 20.The mayor also announced the closure of food courts and playgrounds while restaurants, bars and clubs will be baned from serving customers between 23:00 and 06:00.Sobyanin also called on employers to transfer at least 30 percent of non-vaccinated employees to working from home after the week-long shutdown.- Slow vaccination - Cases have been on the rise across the country in recent weeks as Russia struggles to innoculate its citizens despite domestic vaccines being widely available to the public.A spike in cases has also been reported in Russia's second city Saint Petersburg, which is co-hosting the Euro 2020 football championship.Earlier this week, Sobyanin said Moscow would be opening several field hospitals to accomodate the influx of patients.Russia has been among the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with the sixth-highest number of cases in the world, according to an AFP tally.Kremlin critics have accused authorities of downplaying the severity of the pandemic by only counting fatalities where the coronavirus was found to be the primary cause of death after autopsy.On Saturday, Russia registered 13,510 new coronavirus cases and 399 deaths, according to a government tally.Russia imposed a strict lockdown when the pandemic first swept across the country last spring.But within months authorities had lifted most measures, opting to protect the struggling economy and pinning their hopes on curbing the outbreak with vaccines.Officials have registered four homegrown vaccines -- Sputnik V, its single-dose version Sputnik Light, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac.Russia's domestic vaccination campaign started in early December, ahead of most countries, but Russians have been hesitant to sign up.Polls show that more than half of respondents do not intend to get vaccinated.So far 18 million Russians - or 12 percent of the population -- have received at least one dose of a vaccine.Putin -- who the Kremlin said was vaccinated in private with one of Russia's jabs -- has repeatedly called on Russians to get immunised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-announces-non-working-week-as-covid-19-cases-hit-a-six-month-high-101623507195931.html

Speaking to Sky News at the G7 Leaders’ Summit 2021, Johnson said the Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2, first identified in India, is more transmissible and the cases, along with the levels of hospitalisation, are increasing.“Now, we don’t know exactly to what extent that is going to feed through into extra mortality, but clearly it’s a matter of serious, serious concern,” the UK PM told Sky News on Sunday.The final step of the United Kingdom’s planned four-step roadmap out of lockdown has seemingly been thrown in doubt with the rise of the Delta variant.

The street was barricaded to keep out vehicle traffic at the time of the shooting, Chacon said.It was unclear what sparked the shooting.Eleven of the injured people were taken to one local hospital, another person was taken to a different hospital, and the other person went to an urgent care facility with gunshot wounds, Chacon said.“Our officers responded very quickly,” the interim chief said. “They were able to immediately begin life-saving measures for many of these patients, including applications of tourniquets; applications of chest seals.”Chacon also said some officers transported patients to hospitals in their police cruisers due to the nature of the scene, where it was hard to contain the crowd and get ambulances to those who were injured.The shooter was not immediately arrested. Chacon said the description that police had of the suspect was “not very detailed,” but said the person was believed to be a man.Investigators were reviewing surveillance video and other evidence from the area, Chacon said.

According to Blue Origin, the current high bid for a seat on New Shepard is at $4.8 million, which means the winner of the live auction will probably need to pay more than $5 million.The US-based space company said that the winning bid amount will be donated to its foundation, Club for the Future, to “inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM and help invent the future of life in space.”Also Read | Jeff Bezos going into space on July 20, beating ‘space barons’ Musk, Branson to itEarlier on Monday, Jeff Bezos, in an Instagram post, announced that he will travel to space along with his brother, a dream he had since was five years old.

Domestic vaccination rates have shot up in recent weeks.Over 845.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered across China as of Thursday, the national health commission (NHC) said in an update on Friday.Also on Friday, a health official with the NHC said a total of 622 million people in China had been vaccinated in China by Thursday. However, it wasn’t clear how many people in China had been fully vaccinated against the infection.In China’s Covid-19 vaccination programmes, out of seven shots, five require two doses, one requires a single dose, and one needs three injections.A Covid-19 vaccine from a Sinopharm unit, Beijing Institute of Biological Products, has also obtained approval to be used on people aged between three and 17 in China, CDC’s Shao said.In China, 21 Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials at various stages, Zeng Yixin, NHC deputy director said earlier this month.By the end of 2021, China is expected to vaccinate at least 70% of “target groups”, Zeng said.China has set a target for 40% of the population to be fully vaccinated by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducting-clinical-trials-on-covid-19-nasal-spray-vaccines-101623498691248.html

All you need to know||The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are on Saturday expected to sign the ‘Carbis Bay Declaration’, a landmark global health declaration aimed at preventing future pandemics, according to a Downing Street statement. The UK government said the G7 leaders will commit to using all their resources to prevent a pandemic from ever happening again.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has claimed more than 3.7 million lives so far, according to Johns Hopkins University, and caused economic devastation owing to the restrictions placed by governments around the world to contain the virus. Talking about the Carbis Bay Declaration, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said though the world developed and manufactured Covid-19 vaccines at an unprecedented pace, it needs to prevent a pandemic like this from ever happening again.“That means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around...I am proud that for the first time today the world’s leading democracies have come together to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares,” he said, according to Downing Street.Also Read | G7 mulls reallocating $100 billion from IMF funds to Covid-hit nationsG7 nations comprise the US, UK, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan.

Together we need to build on the significant scientific and collaborative response to the Covid-19 pandemic and find common solutions to address many of the gaps identified,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization.G7 leaders have gathered at Carbis Bay, a seaside resort and village in Cornwall, UK, for the three-day summit.

Michael Packard, 56, wrote on Facebook that he was in the humpback whale’s closed mouth for about 30-40 seconds before the large rorqual species rose to the surface and spit him out."A humpback whale tried to eat me...I am very bruised up but have no broken bones," wrote Packard.Speaking to CBS affiliate WBZ-TV, Packard, whose job is to pluck lobsters off the sandy bottom, said that he was about 45 deep in waters off Provincetown he suddenly “ felt this huge bump, and everything went dark”. At first, the diver feared that he was attacked by a shark but lack of teeth made him reconsider.“And then I realised, ‘Oh my God I’m in a whale’s mouth...and he’s trying to swallow me',” he told WBZ-TV after being released from the hospital.Packard said he thought about his kids and wife and told himself, “[t]his is it, I’m gonna die.”Also Read | 3 held for smuggling whale vomit worth ₹7 crore in GujaratAs soon as the lobsterman began to struggle, the humpback whale, he said, went up to the surface and started shaking his head. “I just got thrown in the air and landed in the water,” Packard recalled. “I was free and I just floated there. I couldn’t believe. . . I’m here to tell it.”Captain Joe Francis, who was heading a fishing charter nearby, told the local news channel that he had a front to witness the escape as he saw Packard come flying out of the water “feet first with his flippers on and land back in the water.” “We got him up, got his tank off. Got him on the deck and calmed him down and he goes, ‘Joe, I was in the mouth of a whale’ he goes ‘I can’t believe it, I was in the mouth of a whale Joe!’,” said Francis.Jooke Robbins, director of humpback whale studies at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, told news agency AFP that she had no reason to doubt the story. "I didn't think it was a hoax because I knew the people involved... So I have every reason to believe that what they say is true," she said, adding that whales have large mouths but throats so narrow that they wouldn’t be able to swallow a human.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humpback-whale-swallows-us-lobsterman-alive-then-spits-him-out-101623489755898.html
12-06-2021||World||No more negotiations: France asks UK to 'keep its word' on Brexit deal||France's president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday told British prime minister Boris Johnson that the United Kingdom should "keep its word" to Europe and uphold the Brexit divorce deal framework that it had signed, news agency AFP reported citing people familiar with the matter in Macron's office. The agency, citing its sources, further added that Macron had explained to Johnson in no uncertain terms that Britain needs to uphold the Brexit deal it signed. The development comes amid tumultuous relations in Europe, a looming threat of a trade war between the European Union (EU) and Britain over the Northern Ireland Protocol.On the sidelines of the G7 summit in Cornwall, French president Emmanuel Macron had reportedly warned Johnson a day ago that not a single clause in the Brexit divorce deal is up for negotiation now, six months after it was signed. However, Macron is also looking for a 'reset' of France-UK relations, news agencies reported, since months of tension between the two countries over the Brexit deal has left bilateral relations strained.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, stepping up his attacks on the European Union, told BBC radio that there ought to be a more "pragmatic" solution t the Northern Ireland dispute. "They can be more pragmatic about the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that is win-win or they can be bloody-minded and purist about it, in which case I am afraid we will not allow the integrity of the UK to be threatened," news agency Bloomberg quoted Raab as saying.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is playing host to fellow Group of Seven leaders along the English coast, with all eyes on how the leaders discuss a path out of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as other economic plans. French president Macron has pointed out that both France and the UK have a common vision for international and transatlantic relations, including on arms control, according to an official in the G-7 delegation.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-more-negotiations-france-asks-uk-to-keep-its-word-on-brexit-deal-101623489038477.html
12-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to urge G-7 leaders to call out, compete with China||The United States plans to push democratic allies on Saturday to publicly call out China for forced labor practices as the Group of Seven leaders gather at a summit where they will also unveil an infrastructure plan meant to compete with Beijing’s efforts in the developing world.The provocative proposal is part of President Joe Biden’s escalating campaign to get fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with China in the century ahead, according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans for the seaside summit publicly.The officials said Biden wanted G-7 leaders to speak out in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. Biden hopes the denunciation will be part of the joint communique released at the summit’s end, but some European allies have been reluctant to so forcefully split with Beijing. It may not be clear until the three-day summit ends on Sunday whether the leaders will take that step.The wealthy nations’ leaders were all smiles and unity as they were welcomed to the summit on Friday by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the freshly raked sand of Carbis Bay in southwest England for their first gathering since 2019.Last year’s gathering was canceled because of COVID-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with members of the wealthy democracies' club expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries.China also loomed large over the meeting on the craggy coast of Cornwall. Biden's proposed critique of China's labor practices was to be raised as the allies unveil an infrastructure proposal dubbed “Build Back Better for the World,” a name that echoes the slogan of the American president's election campaign.The plan calls for spending hundreds of millions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector. It's designed to compete with China’s trillion-dollar “Belt and Road Initiative,” which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that already snake around large portions of the world, primarily Asia and Africa. Critics say the projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by Beijing.Britain also wants the world’s democracies to become less reliant on economic giant China. The U.K. government says Saturday’s discussions will tackle “how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values,” including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on China.Not every European power has viewed China in as harsh a light as Biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition for the 21st century. But there are signs that Europe is willing to put greater scrutiny on Beijing.Weeks before Biden took office last year, the European Commission announced it had come to terms with Beijing on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, a deal meant to provide Europe and China greater access to each other’s markets. The Biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact.But the deal has been put on hold, and the European Union in March announced sanctions targeting four Chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing responded by imposing sanctions on several members of the European Parliament and other Europeans critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Biden administration officials see the moment as an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against China’s reliance on forced labor as an “affront to human dignity."While calling out China in the communique wouldn't create any immediate penalties for Beijing, one senior administration official said the action was meant to send a message that the G-7 was serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labor.An estimated 1 million people or more — most of them Uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in China’s western Xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers. Chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents.Beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes.The leaders of the G-7 — which also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — also hope the meeting at the seaside resort will energize the global economy.Opening three days of talks, Johnson on Friday warned that world leaders must not repeat errors made over the past 18 months — or those made during the recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis. If not, he said the pandemic “risks being a lasting scar” that entrenched inequalities.He said the G-7 will announce a package of health measures aimed at reducing the chances of another pandemic. The “Carbis Bay Declaration” will aim for a 100-day goal to develop vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for future diseases and to bolster surveillance for new illnesses.Johnson said the goal of the measures was “to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares.”Brexit will also cast a shadow on the summit Saturday, as Johnson meets one-on-one with European leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron amid tensions over Britain's implementation of U.K.-EU divorce terms.Macron will also hold talks with Biden — a meeting between allies who recalibrated their relationship during the four years of President Donald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy.Macron’s preference for multilateralism was out of step with Trump’s isolationist tendencies. But the Trump era was often framed by Macron as a clarifying moment — one in which Europe had to step forward as America drifted away from alliances and toward Trumpism.Biden will end his eight-day European trip with a summit in Geneva with Russia's Vladimir Putin. Putin, in an interview with NBC News that aired Friday, said the Russian relationship with the U.S. has “deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years.”But he added that while Trump was a “talented” and “colorful” person, Biden was a “career man” in politics, which has “some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements” by the U.S. president.To cap the day Friday, Queen Elizabeth II — Britain’s biggest global star — traveled from Windsor Castle near London for a reception with the G-7 leaders and their spouses at the Eden Project, a futuristic botanical garden housed inside domes that features the world’s largest indoor rainforest.Senior royals — including heir to the throne Prince Charles, his son Prince William and William’s wife, Kate — joined the leaders for the reception and a dinner of roasted turbot, Cornish new potatoes and greens with wild garlic pesto, cooked by a local chef.The choice of an ecologically themed venue was deliberate. Climate change is also a top issue on the agenda, and hundreds of protesters gathered in Cornwall to urge the leaders to act, some dressed as sea creatures such as jellyfish. Demonstrators deployed a barge off the coast with two large inflatable figures depicting Biden and Johnson on board.___Lemire reported from Plymouth, England.

The Correctional Services Department said it would not comment on individual cases.Chow was released from the Tai Lam Correctional Institution in Tuen Mun, in Hong Kong's New Territories district, at about 10am local time.She did not speak to the media before she was ushered into a car with friends and fellow democracy activists.Supporters shouted "Agnes Chow add oil", a Cantonese-language expression of encouragement that was widely used at the protests that roiled the city.Some supporters wore black T-shirts and yellow masks and one held a yellow umbrella, a symbol of protests in the former British colony dating back to 2014.Chow, along with Wong and Nathan Law, who has since been given asylum in Britain, came to prominence as teenage activists during the 2014 protests to demand universal suffrage.The three founded the democracy group Demosisto in 2016, which dissolved hours after Beijing passed a contentious national security law for the city last year amid fears it could be targeted under the legislation.The law has stifled the pro-democracy movement and raised concern about prospects for the autonomy Hong Kong was promised under a "one country, two systems" formula when it was handed over to China in 1997.Chow was also arrested last year on suspicion of "colluding with foreign forces" under the security law but has not faced any charges related to that.Fluent in Japanese, Chow has a sizable following in Japan, particularly on social media, and had travelled to the country frequently before her arrest. She often posted on Twitter in Japanese and Japanese media has dubbed her a "goddess of democracy".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/agnes-chow-hong-kong-activist-freed-from-prison-after-serving-six-months-101623481172739.html

However, in a statement released on Friday, Health Canada said these were being withheld and “will only be released for distribution” once it “is satisfied that they meet the department’s high standards for quality, safety and efficacy”. This move came after Health Canada learnt that a drug substance was produced at the Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore, Maryland, inspected by the FDA which flagged multiple areas of concerns.Health Canada noted the substance is an “active ingredient that undergoes further processing before becoming the final product”, the vaccine. “The final Janssen vaccines were manufactured at a different site located outside of the US,” it said.It added, “We will continue to ensure that products coming from the Emergent facility, or any other facility, will only be imported and distributed in Canada if they are of high quality and safe for use.”It said the department is currently working with Janssen and the FDA to obtain all information it needs to complete its “assessment, prior to releasing the Janssen vaccines for distribution”.Canada has also received 1.5 million doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine made at the same facility and Health Canada said it is also working with them “to ensure the facility meets manufacturing standards, and that all vaccine are of high quality”.However, the AZ vaccines have already been distributed and administered across the country. Health Canada asserted that it “remains confident that the 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine imported from this facility meet quality specifications”.On April 25, Health Canada had stated that the Janssen vaccines expected to arrive did not originate from the Emergent facility. The information about the active ingredient came to the department since that statement was issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-halts-distribution-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101623479189893.html

Off-beat stories ranged from speculations about the North Korean leader losing weight -- as evidenced by his latest Swiss watch -- to him branding Korean pop (K-pop) music as "vicious cancer".

12-06-2021||World||Docs complain of burnout, consider leaving profession: Canadian study||More than two-thirds of doctors have complained of feeling burnout with over 20% considering leaving the medical profession due to the stress brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new Canadian study.The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that “burnout was prevalent among 68% of physicians and noted over 20% of surveyed physicians were considering quitting the profession, or had already quit a position”, according to the University of British Columbia (UBC). “During the Covid-19 pandemic, although most of our respondents feel a sense of personal accomplishment, burnout and emotional exhaustion are high,” the study said.The study’s lead researcher Dr Nadia Khan, professor of general internal medicine at UBC, said, “I think that this issue is not unique to just these two hospitals. It is widespread. I would say global. It’s also not just amongst physicians but likely affecting other healthcare workers.”She also noted that the coronavirus crisis had increased physician burnout, a phenomenon that was rising even before the pandemic struck.The study was based on survey responses from 302 internal medicine physicians who worked for Vancouver General Hospital and St Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia between August and October 2020.Burnout was defined as “an occupational syndrome characterised by emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation - which is a lack of care about the work. It also affects workers’ sense of personal accomplishment”.Women and younger doctors were more likely to feel the impact, as burnout “was prevalent among 71% of women compared to 64% of men”. It was also found to be highest, at 74%, among younger physicians, aged between 36 and 50. Meanwhile, visible minority physicians had 1.8 times higher odds of feeling low personal accomplishment in comparison to white respondents.Among other survey findings, 63% of respondents reported emotional exhaustion, 39% reported a lack of care towards the job, or depersonalisation, and 22% reported feeling low personal accomplishment.The study pointed out the “prevalence of burnout and its components in the current study are generally higher than those reported prior to the pandemic”. A systematic review of 176 studies from 2018 reported a prevalence of overall burnout of 48.7%, while a recent meta-analysis of 22,778 medical and surgical residents identified a 51% aggregate prevalence prior to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/docs-complain-of-burnout-consider-leaving-profession-canadian-study-101623476609824.html
12-06-2021||World||Biden administration closes Trump-era office for victims of immigrant crime||The Biden administration said Friday it has dismantled a Trump-era government office to help victims of crimes committed by immigrants, a move that symbolizes President Joe Biden's rejection of former President Donald Trump's repeated efforts to link immigrants to crime.Trump created the Victim Of Immigration Crime Engagement Office, known by its acronym VOICE, by executive order during his first week in office in January 2017.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was replacing VOICE with a "more comprehensive and inclusive victim support system.”VOICE will be replaced by The Victims Engagement and Services Line, which will combine longstanding existing services, such as methods for people to report abuse and mistreatment in immigration detention centers and a notification system for lawyers and others with a vested interest in immigration cases.The new office will add a service for potential recipients of visas designated for victims of human trafficking or violent crimes in the United States.“Providing assistance to society’s most vulnerable is a core American value. All people, regardless of their immigration status, should be able to access victim services without fear,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump’s immigration policies, called the decision to close VOICE a “moral stain on the conscience of our nation."He likened the new office to the Drug Enforcement Administration opening “a call center to help drug dealers get lawyers and amnesty for their crimes."The Department of Homeland Security “is a law enforcement agency, not a legal help center for criminals and lawbreakers," Miller said.Jon Feere, an ICE official during the Trump administration, said he referred a man to VOICE whose sister was killed by an intoxicated driver and that the office helped families understand the status of immigration cases.The change of tone regarding immigration has been striking between the two administrations.While studies suggest immigrants are less likely to commit crime than native-born, Trump relentlessly sought to establish a link. He launched his 2016 presidential campaign by portraying Mexicans in the country illegally as violent criminals and frequently highlighted the MS-13 gang, which was started by Salvadoran immigrants.To advance his immigration agenda, Trump invited “angel families” — people whose loved ones had been victims of crimes by immigrants — to campaign rallies and high-profile speeches.Trump's office for victims of violent crimes appears to have had little impact.Its most recent quarterly report posted online for the last three months of 2018 said it fielded 781 calls during the three-month period — and that just 256 of the calls pertained to services it offered. About half were requests on the status of immigration cases, and many of the rest were referrals for assistance, such as social services to help cope with impacts of domestic violence or assault.The office was used as a platform by the Trump administration to promote a link between immigrants and crime.“I’ve had to hold the hand of too many mothers who lost a child to a DUI or somebody else who’s been raped by an illegal alien or someone with a nexus to immigration,” Barbara Gonzalez, the then-director of VOICE, told reporters in October 2019. “It is a problem we cannot ignore as a country.In April, the Biden administration ordered US officials to avoid using terms like “illegal alien” and instead use the phrase “undocumented noncitizen.”Vice President Kamala Harris drew strong criticism from some of the administration's pro-immigration allies for telling would-be migrants during a visit to Guatemala on Monday, “Do not come ... Do not come," and that they would be denied entry at the US border with Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-closes-trump-era-office-for-victims-of-immigrant-crime-101623473953756.html

12-06-2021||World||Two Indian-Americans win coveted US journalism honour||Two Indian-Americans were among winners of the top American awards for journalism announced on Friday.BuzzFeed News’ Megha Rajagopalan won a Pulitzer for international reporting, with contributors Alison Killing, a licensed architect and Christo Buschek, a programmer, for a series exposing the scale of internment of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province. This was the first Pulitzer for BuzzFeed News, a digital news publication founded in 2014.Tampa Bay Times’ Neil Bedi won the Pulitzer for local reporting with Kathleen McGrory, for their investigative series on a Florida county police’s use of computer modelling to identify potential crime suspects, including children who either performed badly at school or were victims of abuse at home. Bedi has since moved to ProPublica, a non-profit publication focusing on investigative news.“I’m completely shocked! I’m very grateful to my team and the many people and organisations from inside and outside BuzzFeed News who supported this project,” Rajagopalan wrote in an email in response to a request for comments. “Most of all I am grateful to the former detainees who took risks to share details of what they experienced inside Xinjiang’s camps. The public owes them a great debt, as do I.”BuzzFeed said in a report that Rajagopalan was the first reporter to visit an internment camp used to hold Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province at a time - in 2017 - when the Chinese government was denying their existence. She was shortly ejected from the country and the Chinese government refused to renew her visa.Ben Smith, the then BuzzFeed editor who has since joined the New York Times, recalled that episode in a tweet, as his tribute to an erstwhile colleague. After the Chinese government refused to renew her visa, he wrote, he and a senior editor at BuzzFeed, “met with government officials. They said we were welcome to send literally any other reporter - just not Megha”.It wasn’t known whether or not BuzzFeed sent another reporter instead, but Rajagopalan persisted, and continued reporting on the camps from London, along with the two contributors, Killing, an architect who specialises in forensic analysis of architecture and satellite images of buildings, and Christo Buschek, a programmer who makes tools for data journalism.Born to parents from India, Rajagopalan was raised in Maryland, a state abutting the national capital Washington DC, and went to the University of Maryland. “I’m deeply grateful to them for their support,” Rajagopalan said of her parents. “Nobody in my family has ever worked in media, but they have always supported my career in journalism, and have been my biggest cheerleaders since I was a student.”Celebrations broke out in the tiny, but increasingly vocal, minority community of Indian-Americans. “Congrats @meghara (Rajagopalan’s twitter handle)!” wrote Indiaspora, a leading advocacy for the community, on twitter. “We are lucky to have leaders like you taking the Indian diaspora community to new heights!” It wished Bedi in a separate tweet.“Winning this prize is an incredible honour. I’m proud of the Tampa Bay Times team for this work and I’m grateful to all the families who spoke to us for this story,” Bedi wrote in an email. Bedi was born and raised in New Jersey. His parents moved to the United States from New Delhi in the 1990s. “I owe all of my success to my parents. They taught me to be ambitious and caring, two of the most important things in journalism.”In other categories - Pulitzers are awarded for a wide range of areas, from journalism to drama to fiction - teenager Daniella Frazier was awarded an honorary Pulitzer for her chilling but unwavering video of George Floyd’s killing that served as an irrefutable evidence in the conviction of his killer, a white police officer, and went viral around as a stark reminder of persisting racism in America.The New York Times was honoured with a Pulitzer for public service journalism, for its coverage of the Covid-19 epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-americans-win-coveted-us-journalism-honour-101623473790195.html
12-06-2021||World||Mouse sperm survives in space for nearly six years, births healthy pups||The most well-travelled mouse sperm in history left Earth in 2013, its destination being the International Space Station (ISS). After almost six years of soaking high levels of cosmic radiation in space, the free-dried sperm was brought back to the planet in a SpaceX shuttle and used to breed litters here on Earth to assess how it held up over time in outer space. The result was astonishing, to say the least. The study, conducted by a group of Japanese researchers, found that despite being stored in space for years, the mouse sperm remained viable and produced a number of "healthy, normal" pups.The results of the study, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, showed that the freeze-fried mouse sperm had resulted in the birth of 168 health pups, free of any genetic defects whatsoever. In fact, there was seen to exist little difference between mice fertilized by space sperm and sperm that remained confined here on Earth, said developmental biologist and lead author of the study Teruhiko Wakayama to news agency AFP. He added that all the pups had a normal appearance and lacked any abnormalities.The viability of freeze-dried mouse sperm in space might not sound like a macher in scientific advances, but it shows a way or two about humanity's hopes for long-term intergalactic travel. If mankind ever hopes to travel to other planets solar systems or perhaps galaxies away, they will need to seriously think about long-term space colonies, which will require researchers to come up with viable ways of ensuring mammalian reproduction, not just of humans but of other animals too, survives the onslaught of cosmic radiation in outer space.Wakayama, the lead researcher for the said study, seems to have been inspired by the science fiction of Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov himself. Although he originally wanted to be an astronaut, he later settled on becoming a scientist, always amazed by the sense of wonder over space exploration, he told AFP.Wakayama and his colleagues at the University of Yamanashi in Japan had launched the three boxloads of mouse sperm, each containing 48 ampules of the freeze-fried material, to the ISS back in 2013 for long-term study. Now the director for Advanced Biotechnology Center at the University of Yamanashi, Wakayama is quite satisfied with the results and said that in the future, humans will need to maintain the diversity of genetic resources, not only for humans but also for pets and domestic animals, for long-term space travel and also as a failsafe in case of a disaster on Earth. The freeze-dried sperm used in the study could be stored for up to 200 years on board the orbital outpost, the team's calculations revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mouse-sperm-survives-in-space-for-almost-six-years-births-healthy-pups-101623470356732.html

In an interview with American media outlet NBC News, Putin hardly concealed his admiration for ex-president Trump, calling him an "extraordinary" and "talented" individual, while he referred to Biden as a career politician disparate with such traits.Also Read: 'Can't get away with making threats': Putin likens US behaviour to Soviet UnionPutin's statements regarding US-Russia relations come just ahead of his meeting with Biden at Geneva next week. "We have a bilateral relationship that has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years," news agency Reuters quoted Putin as saying, citing transcripts of the interview put out by NBC News. The Russian president also took his time to refute allegations against his regime on a host of issues, ranging from alleged ransomware attacks against the US emanating from Russia, aggression against Ukraine, jailing of dissidents, and questionable foreign policies in the Middle East.The deaths of several dissidents of Putin's regime, including that of ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned in 2006, have over the years been directly blamed on Moscow. When asked about these incidents, Putin simply dismissed the question as "verbal indigestion", adding that some of those accused in the murder cases are already in prison.Also Read: Biden says will stand with European allies ahead of Putin summitIn the context of recent ransomware attacks that Washington says have been traced back to Russia, Putin blatantly denied any knowledge of the hackings and said that he will, in turn, seek to establish a cyberspace agreement with Biden.Finally, when asked about a recent report in the Washington Post report which accused Russia of supplying Iran with an advanced satellite to track military targets across the Middle East, Putin dismissed it as "fake news". "At the very least, I don't know anything about this kind of thing," Putin was quoted as saying at the interview with NBC News.Joe Biden, for his part, has said that the United States desires to establish a "stable and predictable relationship" with Russia. However, America will not hesitate to respond in "a robust and meaningful way" if the Russian government continues to engage in detrimental activities, Biden added. It remains to be seen what the future lies for US-Russia relations ahead of Biden's eight-day visit to Europe this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-putin-says-ties-with-us-at-all-time-low-recalls-trump-as-talented-extraordinary-man-101623466474786.html

Now, well into the second year of global lockdowns, school closures, economic disruptions, and shrinking national budgets, families are forced to make heartbreaking choices," Unicef's executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.Also read | Child labour rises 1st time in 20 years, Nobel laureate demands actionWorld Day Against Child Labour is being observed on Saturday and the UN has made 2021 the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, calling urgent action needed to meet a goal of ending the practice by 2025.Here's what the report on child labour said:1. There has been a significant rise in the number of children aged 5 to 11 years in child labour, who now account for just over half of the total global figure.2. The number of children aged 5 to 17 years in hazardous work has risen by 6.5 million to 79 million since 2016.3. In sub-Saharan Africa, population growth, recurrent crises, extreme poverty, and inadequate social protection measures have led to an additional 16.6 million children in child labour over the past four years.3. Covid-19 is endangering that progress even in regions where there has been some headway since 2016, such as Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.4. Globally, nine million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.5. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.6. Children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions because of additional economic shocks and school closures caused by Covid-19.7. Many more may be forced into the worst forms of child labour due to job and income losses among vulnerable families.8. The agriculture sector accounts for 70 per cent of children in child labour (112 million) followed by 20 per cent in services (31.4 million) and 10 per cent in the industry (16.5 million).9. Nearly 28 per cent of children aged 5 to 11 years and 35 per cent of children aged 12 to 14 years in child labour are out of school.10. Child labour is more prevalent among boys than girls at every age. When household chores performed for 21 hours or more each week are taken into account, the gender gap in child labour narrows.11. The prevalence of child labour in rural areas (14 per cent) is close to three times higher than in urban areas (5 per cent).To reverse the upward trend in child labour, the ILO and Unicef are calling for adequate social protection for all, including universal child benefits. They have also called for increased spending on free and good-quality schooling and getting all children back into school, including those who dropped out before Covid-19.The global bodies there should be a promotion of decent work for adults so that families don’t have to resort to children helping to generate income. The ILO and Unicef said there should be an end to harmful gender norms and discrimination that influence child labour. Investment in child protection systems, agricultural development, rural public services, infrastructure and livelihoods should also come through, they said.Source: International Labour Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-world-day-against-child-labour-key-points-on-the-practice-101623465166507.html
12-06-2021||World||World Day Against Child Labour 2021: What is it? Why is it observed?||World Day Against Child Labour, which aims to spread awareness about the illegal employment practice and also talk about the ways to eradicate it completely, will be observed on Saturday by people across the globe. It was launched by the International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, in 2002. This year’s theme is ‘Act now: End child labour’.Child labour exists across the globe and children, mostly from poor families, are forced to work in hazardous conditions which leads to unending physical, mental and social exploitation and suffering from the employers. Children are deprived of living their childhood to their fullest and also miss the opportunity of attending schools.According to the latest report by the ILO and Unicef, child labour has soared to 160 million worldwide, the first increase in 20 years.There also has been a significant rise in the number of children between 5-11 years in child labour, who account for over half of the global figure. “The number of children in child labour has risen to 160 million worldwide -- an increase of 8.4 million children in the last four years -- with millions more at risk due to the impacts of Covid-19,” the report added.Also Read| Child labour rises 1st time in 20 years, Nobel laureate demands actionDeveloping countries like India contribute maximum towards child labour. According to the census of 2011, 259.64 million children belonged to the age group of 5-14 years of which 10.1 million were child labourers. Be it manufacturing of firecrackers in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi, the country’s bangle making industry, roadside eateries and restaurants, construction sites or even the house help, children from unfortunate sections have always been the soft target.Unicef India representative Dr Yasmin Ali Haque told news agency PTI on Thursday the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has aggravated the risk of child labour in the country as more families have been pushed to poverty. “Children in poor and disadvantaged households in India are now at a greater risk of negative coping mechanisms such as dropping out of school and being forced into labour, marriage, and even falling victim to trafficking,” Haque added.In recent years, reports have emerged that several consumer brands of global prominence including Forever 21, Cadbury, H&M, GAP etc- were caught employing children in their manufacturing units to save up on additional costs. Many activists and non-governmental organisations (NGO) have raised their voices against this and have also urged people to not buy products from such brands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-day-against-child-labour-2021-what-is-it-why-is-it-observed-101623460905243.html

Earlier, Bilawal met Sharif at his chamber in the assembly and they decided both parties would jointly oppose the PTI's budget.During the last three years, the government faced several economic challenges.Tarin said PM Imran Khan's government does not hesitate from taking difficult decisions. He said the incumbent government had, through its sound economic policies, turned around the current account deficit into a surplus in 2021.As he spoke, Opposition members continued to bang desks and shouted slogans of "Go Niazi Go!".The minister announced that for FY22, the government had set the GDP growth target at 4.8 percent.The total expenditure budgeted for next year stood at Pakistani ₹8,487 billion which is almost 19 per cent higher than the last year's budget size of ₹7,136 billion.Total allocations for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) have been budgeted at ₹2,135 billion for FY22, up 37 per cent from R1,324 billion last year.For the upcoming fiscal year, the government targets to keep inflation at 8.2per cent, which is significantly higher than the 6.5per cent targeted for FY21.The government has also allocated a budget of 1.1 billion US dollars to purchase COVID-19 vaccines to meet the target of 100 million people's vaccination by June next year, said the minister, adding that another amount of 100 billion rupees will also be spent as a COVID-19 emergency fund.Tarin said that the government has allocated special funds for hydropower projects, anti-carbon emission projects, tourism, special technology zones, public housing loans, agriculture development and power distribution.Starting from June 14, 2021, the house will start a debate on the proposed budget for the next 10 working days, after which the house is likely to conduct voting to approve the budget on June 28.Following the approval, the budget will be presented before the Senate or the upper house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-govt-unveils-rs-8-5-trillion-budget-defence-allocated-rs-1-370-billion-101623456627013.html

12-06-2021||World||US Justice dept opens probe into Trump's seizures of Democrats, journalists data||The Justice Department's internal watchdog launched an investigation Friday after revelations that former President Donald Trump's administration secretly seized phone data from at least two House Democrats as part of an aggressive leaks probe. Democrats called the seizures “harrowing” and an abuse of power.The announcement by Inspector General Michael Horowitz came shortly after Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco made the request for an internal investigation. Horowitz said he would examine whether the data subpoenaed by the Justice Department and turned over by Apple followed department policy and “whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.”Horowitz said he would also investigate similar Trump-era seizures of journalists' phone records.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, said Apple notified them last month that their metadata had been subpoenaed and turned over to the Justice Department in 2018, as their committee was investigating the former president's ties to Russia. Schiff was then the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.While the Justice Department routinely investigates leaked information, including classified intelligence, subpoenaing the private information of members of Congress is extraordinarily rare. The disclosures, first reported by The New York Times, raise questions about what the Justice Department's justification was for spying on another branch of government and whether it was done for political reasons.In a statement, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said the Trump administration's conduct is “shocking” and “clearly fits within an appalling trend that represents the opposite of how authority should be used.”Bates said one of President Joe Biden's top reasons for seeking the presidency was “his predecessor’s unjustifiable abuses of power, including the repugnant ways he tried to force his political interests upon the Department of Justice.”The Trump administration’s secretive move to gain access to the data came as the president was fuming publicly and privately over investigations — in Congress and by then-special counsel Robert Mueller — into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump called the probes a “witch hunt,” regularly criticized Democrats and Mueller on Twitter and dismissed as “fake news” leaks he found harmful to his agenda. As the investigations swirled around him, he demanded loyalty from a Justice Department he often regarded as his personal law firm.Swalwell and Schiff were two of the most visible Democrats on the committee during the Russia probe, making frequent appearances on cable news. Trump watched those channels closely, if not obsessively, and seethed over the coverage.Schiff said the seizures suggest “the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president" and urged the Justice Department to do “a full damage assessment of the conduct of the department over the last four years.”Senate Democratic leaders immediately demanded that former Attorneys General Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions, who both oversaw Trump's leak probes, testify about the secret subpoenas. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said in a statement that “this appalling politicization of the Department of Justice by Donald Trump and his sycophants” must be investigated. They said Barr and Sessions are subject to a subpoena if they refuse.Prosecutors from Trump’s Justice Department had subpoenaed Apple for the data, according to a committee official and two other people familiar with the matter. The records of at least 12 people connected to the intelligence panel were eventually shared by the company, including aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.Apple informed the committee last month that the records had been shared and that the investigation had been closed, but did not give extensive detail. The committee official and the two others with knowledge of the data seizures were granted anonymity to discuss them.The Justice Department obtained the metadata — often records of calls, texts and locations — but not other content from the devices, like photos, messages or emails, according to one of the people. Another said that Apple complied with the subpoena, providing the information to the Justice Department, but did not immediately notify the members of Congress or the committee about the disclosure.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that the data seizures "appear to be yet another egregious assault on our democracy” by the former president.“The news about the politicization of the Trump Administration Justice Department is harrowing," she said.The committee official said the House intelligence panel will ask Apple to look into whether additional lawmakers were targeted. The Justice Department has not been forthcoming on questions such as whether the investigation was properly predicated and whether it only focused on Democrats, the official said.It is unclear why Trump's Justice Department would have targeted a minor as part of the probe. Swalwell, confirming that he was told his records were seized, told CNN on Thursday night that he was aware a minor was involved and believed that person was "targeted punitively and not for any reason in law.”The Senate Intelligence Committee was not similarly targeted, according to a fourth person who was aware of the probe and granted anonymity to discuss it.There's no indication that the Justice Department used the records to prosecute anyone. After some information related to the Russia investigation was declassified and made public during the later years of the Trump administration, some of the prosecutors were concerned that even if they could bring a leak case, conviction would be unlikely, one of the people said.Federal agents questioned at least one former committee staff member in 2020, the person said, and ultimately, prosecutors weren’t able to substantiate a case.The news follows revelations that the Justice Department had secretly seized phone records belonging to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN as part of criminal leak investigations. Following an outcry from press freedom organizations, the Justice Department announced last week that it would cease the practice of going after journalists’ sourcing information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-dept-opens-probe-into-trump-s-seizures-of-democrats-journalists-data-101623446005213.html

Member states can loan or donate their SDR reserves to other countries for their use.The United States, which has targeted the SDR allocation to be distributed around the "late (northern) summer," on Friday said: "We strongly support the effort to recycle SDRs to further support health needs."The IMF had no immediate comment.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who will speak virtually with G7 leaders this weekend, on Wednesday told a separate event that she expected the fund's governors to approve a $650 billion boost in SDRs in mid-August.The global lender is continuing to study how best richer countries could donate or loan their reserves to benefit poorer nations. Details are expected in early autumn.French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday called on the other G7 nations to find an agreement on reallocating $100 billion in SDRs to African states.World finance chiefs agreed in April to issue new SDRs and extend a debt-servicing freeze to help developing countries deal with the pandemic, although only $34 billion of the $650 billion in new reserves will be allocated to Africa, since SDRs are issued according to the size of a member's holding in the IMF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-mulls-reallocating-100-billion-from-imf-funds-to-covid-hit-nations-101623439000587.html
12-06-2021||World||US Law enforcement struggles to hire since Floyd killing by cop||Law enforcement agencies across the country experienced a wave of retirements and departures and are struggling to recruit the next generation of police officers in the year since George Floyd was killed by a cop.And amid the national reckoning on policing, communities are questioning who should become a police officer today.Mass protests and calls for reforming or defunding the police, as well as the coronavirus pandemic, took their toll on officer morale. The rate of retirements at some departments rose 45% compared with the previous year, according to new research on nearly 200 law enforcement agencies conducted by the Washington-based Police Executive Research Forum and provided to The Associated Press. At the same time, hiring slowed by 5%, the group found.The wave comes as local lawmakers have pledged to enact reforms — such as ending the policies that give officers immunity for their actions while on-duty — and say they’re committed to reshaping policing in the 21st century. And recruiters are increasingly looking for a different kind of recruit to join embattled departments.Years ago, a candidate’s qualifications might be centered around his — yes, his — brawn. Now, police departments say they are seeking recruits who can use their brain. And they want those future officers to represent their communities.“Days of old, you wanted someone who actually had the strength to be more physical,” Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said. “Today’s police officers, that’s not what we’re looking for. We’re looking for someone who can actually relate to the community but also think like the community thinks.”But the climate today, coupled with increases in crime in some cities, is creating what Chuck Wexler, the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, called a “combustible mixture.”It’s creating “a crisis on the horizon for police chiefs when they look at the resources they need, especially during a period when we’re seeing an increase in murders and shootings,” Wexler said. “It’s a wake-up call.”The data from Wexler's organization represents a fraction of the more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide and is not representative of all departments. But it’s one of the few efforts to examine police hiring and retention and compare it with the time before Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Former officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed behind his back, was convicted of murder and is awaiting sentencing.Researchers heard from 194 police departments last month about their hires, resignations and retirements between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, and the same categories from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020.By comparison, the changing public attitude on policing is well documented. In the past year, as many as half of American adults believed police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, according to one poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.“It’s hard to recruit the very people who see police as an opposition,” said Lynda R. Williams, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, who previously worked on recruitment efforts for the Secret Service.Bryant knows firsthand. In the weeks after Floyd’s death, a white officer, Garrett Rolfe, shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, in the parking lot of a Wendy’s.In quick succession, Rolfe was fired, the chief resigned and the local district attorney announced charges, including felony murder, against Rolfe — a rare step in police shootings. Some cops left the force, which currently has about 1,560 officers — about 63% of the force is Black, 29% white and 5% Latino.Then came the “Blue Flu” — when a high number of police officers called out sick in protest. Bryant, then the department’s interim chief, acknowledged that it had occurred in Atlanta after Rolfe was charged.“Some are angry. Some are fearful. Some are confused on what we do in this space. Some may feel a bit abandoned,” Bryant said last summer in an interview at the height of the crisis.But it hasn't shaken the resolve of some, like Kaley Garced, a hairdresser-turned-police officer in Baltimore who graduated from the academy last August. Despite the protests and attitudes toward law enforcement, she stayed with her career choice with a plan to interact with residents.“Earning their trust” leads to better policing, she said. Citizens who trust officers will not be afraid to “call upon you on their worst day” and ask for help.Williams said she believes the next generation of law enforcement will bring a new outlook and move the profession forward by making departments more diverse and inclusive.“They are the change that they want to see,” Williams said.Recruitment is still a challenge. In some cities like Philadelphia, departments are spending more time scouring a candidate’s social media to hunt for possible biases. In others, pay disparities — a longtime problem — still exist, making it difficult to attract would-be officers and keep newly trained recruits when a neighboring jurisdiction offers more money and benefits.In Dallas, city leaders spent much of the last decade struggling to draw candidates and stem the outflow of officers frustrated by low pay and the near collapse of their pension fund.Despite those efforts, the force now stands at about 3,100 officers — down from more than 3,300 in 2015 — a loss at a time when the city’s population has grown to more than 1.3 million. The force is about 44% white, 26% Black and 26% Latino. This means officers handle more calls and detectives more cases, all amid increased racial tension.In 2016, five officers were killed in Dallas by a sniper who was seeking revenge for police shootings elsewhere that killed or wounded Black men. Two years later, an off-duty officer fatally shot her neighbor in his home. She was fired and later was sentenced to a decade in prison for murder.Mike Mata, president of the Dallas Police Association, said the national political climate and local pay and pension issues have been compounding challenges to hiring in Dallas.In 2019, however, a consulting firm Dallas hired to review its department found that it needed not simply more officers but also a “realignment of strategy, goals, mission, and tactics.” That finding rings true to Changa Higgins, a longtime community organizer.“You don’t need to focus on hiring more officers,” Higgins said. “You need to focus on how you got these guys allocated.”In Los Angeles, the department is fighting against a decade-long image of scandal and racial strife from the Watts riots in 1965 to the bloodshed in 1992 after a Simi Valley jury's acquittal of officers who brutally beat motorist Rodney King.Capt. Aaron McCraney, head of the Recruitment and Employment Division, and Chief Michel Moore ticked off the issues facing the 48 new recruits — more than half of whom were women — last year, noting that the pandemic, civil unrest and economic uncertainty were just some of the challenges the new officers would face.“Even though these are tough times, these are difficult times, these are interesting times,” McCraney said, “these times will pass, and we’ll get on to things better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-law-enforcement-struggles-to-hire-since-floyd-killing-by-cop-101623438799338.html

It’s not clear if the heart inflammation is caused by the shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The UK government said on Friday the Delta variant of the virus is 60% more transmissible in households compared to the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, southeast England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-calls-upon-china-to-allow-new-covid-origin-probe-101623437400703.html

This organisation, wearing tinted glasses, has been misleading the public and spreading lies and rumours about Xinjiang. Its so-called report is like adding one more page to its record of lies,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.“We urge the relevant organisation to abandon its persistent prejudice against China, stop fabricating and spreading disinformation and look at relevant issues from an objective and just perspective,” Wang added.Sleep deprivation, beatings, and the use of “tiger chairs” - iron chairs with iron buckles to restrain those being questioned - were recorded, the report said, adding that detainees could be hooded and shackled during questioning.“It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive number of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” Callamard added.Hong Kong to censor filmsHong Kong censors are to vet all films for national security breaches under newly expanded powers. The government said the Film Censorship Ordinance has been expanded to include “any act or activity which may amount to an offence endangering national security”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amnesty-calls-xinjiang-a-dystopian-hellscape-101623436949143.html
12-06-2021||World||G7 talks open with elbow bumps||G7 leaders on Friday opened their first in-person talks in nearly two years, with an expected pledge to donate a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses to poor countries on the agenda in a show of Western democratic cohesion.The club of leading economies - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and United States - says a joint approach is the world’s best chance for recovering from the global health crisis, and tackling climate change.Welcomed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the beachside summit venue in Carbis Bay, southwest England, the leaders posed for a family photo before opening their first session of talks on “building back better” after the pandemic.Johnson opened the G7 summit with a message for the world leaders to “learn lessons” from the pandemic and warned that it was vital not to repeat mistakes of the “the last big economic recession of 2008”.The meeting presented a “huge opportunity” for global pandemic recovery, Johnson told his fellow leaders in opening remarks, as they sat socially distanced and without masks at a round-table. The focus was on, he said, “building back greener, building back fairer and building back more equal”.The UK announced it would provide £430mn ($606mn) to support the worst affected by being out of school, most of them girls, and called on its G7 allies to follow suit. The money will go to the Global Partnership for Education.US president points to multilateralismUS President Joe Biden ditched Donald Trump’s isolationist stance to ram home a message of resolve by the G7 and NATO against both Beijing and Moscow, as he heads into his first sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week.“I’m looking forward to reinforcing our commitment to multilateralism and working with our allies and partners to build a more fair and inclusive global economy,” Biden tweeted from the G7 in Cornwall.Campaigners say the G7’s vaccine donations pledge for this year and next - including 500 million US doses - is far too little, too late to end a pandemic that has claimed over 3.7 million lives worldwide.“If the best G7 leaders can manage is to donate one billion vaccine doses then this summit will have been a failure,” Oxfam said, insisting the world needs 11 billion doses.But the G7 wants to rise to competing “vaccine diplomacy” efforts launched by China and Russia, with the Biden administration stressing it expects nothing in return for its donated jabs.The leaders are also expected to outline more help for developing nations to build up infrastructure, as a counterpoint to the debt-fuelled spending by China in Africa, Asia and Latin America.The initiative “will embrace a high standards, transparent, climate friendly, non-corrupt mechanism” for infrastructure investment in the developing world, a senior US official said.‘Indestructible’ relationsUnderpinning the US-led diplomatic revival, Biden and Johnson on Thursday adopted a new “Atlantic Charter”, modelled on the pact signed by their World War II predecessors to help build a new world order.Johnson dislikes the decades-old phrase “special relationship”, arguing it makes Britain look subservient to Washington, telling the BBC that it should be viewed as “indestructible”.He also played down any differences with Biden over the restive British province of Northern Ireland, ahead of showdown talks between Johnson and EU chiefs on Saturday to tackle deep fissures opened up by Brexit.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab hit back on Friday after French President Emmanuel Macron launched a broadside over the UK back-pedalling regarding post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.Raab told Sky News “change must come from the European Commission side” and that “we are not negotiating or haggling the integrity of the UK”.Johnson will hope to lighten the mood at a beach barbecue on Saturday, joined by his new wife Carrie and other G7 spouses, with a sea shanty band and toasted marshmallows around fire pits.That will follow a reception for the G7 leaders on Friday evening hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Cornwall’s Eden Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-talks-open-with-elbow-bumps-101623436210628.html
