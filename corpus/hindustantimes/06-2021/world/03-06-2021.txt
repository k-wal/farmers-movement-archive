03-06-2021||World||Biden announces Covid vaccine sharing plan, says securing favours not the aim | Full statement||The United States will allocate 75 per cent of its unused Covid-19 vaccines through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme, the White House announced on Thursday. The rest 25 per cent will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the US to share directly will allies and partners. Biden issued a statement saying that the US is not sharing these doses to secure favours or extract concessions. "We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values," Biden said.Here is the full statementAs the United States continues our efforts to get every eligible American vaccinated and fight COVID-19 here at home, we also recognize that ending this pandemic means ending it everywhere. As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable. And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.Already the United States has committed $4 billion to support COVAX, and we have launched partnerships to boost global capacity to manufacture more vaccines. My administration supports efforts to temporarily waive intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines because, over time, we need more companies producing life-saving doses of proven vaccines that are shared equitably. We have already shared more than 4 million doses of vaccine with Canada and Mexico, and last month, I announced that, by the end of June, the United States will share 80 million doses of our vaccine supply with the world.Today, we’re providing more detail on how we will allocate the first 25 million of those vaccines to lay the ground for increased global coverage and to address real and potential surges, high burdens of disease, and the needs of the most vulnerable countries. At least 75 percent of these doses—nearly 19 million—will be shared through COVAX, including approximately 6 million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 7 million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately 5 million for Africa, working in coordination with the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The remaining doses, just over 6 million, will be shared directly with countries experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners and neighbors, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.We are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions. We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values. And we will continue to follow the science and to work in close cooperation with our democratic partners to coordinate a multilateral effort, including through the G7.Strong American leadership is essential to ending this pandemic now, and to strengthening global health security for tomorrow—to better prevent, detect, and respond to the next threat. The United States will be the world’s arsenal of vaccines in our shared fight against this virus. In the days to come, as we draw on the experience of distributing the vaccine doses announced today, we will have more details to provide about how future doses will be shared. And we will continue to do all we can to build a world that is safer and more secure against the threat of infectious disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-announces-vaccine-sharing-plan-says-securing-favours-not-the-aim-101622734903867.html

Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have achieved 50 per cent of adults being fully vaccinated in their jurisdictions.Biden said his administration will continue encouraging people to get vaccinated with incentives and fun rewards.The NBA, the NHL, NASCAR — NASCAR tracks — they’re offering vaccine — vaccines outside playoff games and at races. Major League Baseball will be offering free tickets to people who get vaccinated at the ballpark, he said."And to top it off, Anheuser-Busch announced that beer is on them on July the 4th. That’s right, get a shot and have a beer. Free beer for everyone 21 years or over to celebrate the independence from the virus," the teetotaler president said.The Biden administration has also said that it is teaming up with several organisations -- the Black Coalition Against Covid, the University of Maryland Center for Health Equity and the SheaMoisture company -- to launch an initiative called "Shots at the Shop" to engage Black-owned barber shops and beauty salons nationwide in efforts to promote vaccine education and outreach on a local level.The White House said throughout the month of June, each participating shop will help share information about vaccines with customers, display educational materials, and some will even host on-site vaccination events in partnership with local providers."The more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have in our fight against this virus," Biden said.Since January 20, the average daily cases in the US are down from 184,000 to 19,000, below 20,000 for the first time since March of 2020. Average hospitalisations also is down from 117,000 to 21,000. Death rates are down over 85 per cent, he pointed out."I promised you we’d marshal a wartime effort to defeat this virus, and that’s just what we’ve been doing."And now, tens of millions of Americans have been vaccinated. They’re able to return to closer to a — closer-to-normal life," the president added.Biden has made ending the pandemic the core project of his administration and hopes to ride into midterm elections next year by telling Americans that he has delivered, CNN noted.But the seven-day average of new vaccines administered tumbled from more than 3 million per day in early April to just over 1 million per day before the Memorial Day weekend, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.According to scientists, at least 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the population need to be immunised to achieve "herd immunity" - when enough of a population has protection against an infection that it stops being able to spread.But there are fears that some groups - especially some of the youngsters - may be more hesitant about getting a jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-a-shot-and-have-a-beer-president-biden-to-americans-101622732300807.html

03-06-2021||World||China plans Covid jabs for its nationals in India||China is planning to launch its global Covid-19 vaccination campaign “Spring Sprout” to inoculate its nationals in India, state media reported on Thursday even as the number of doses it has administered domestically crossed the 700mn mark until June 2.The Chinese embassy in New Delhi has put up an online questionnaire to collect information about administering the vaccine to Chinese nationals currently in India, the Global Times reported.The report said the questionnaire is part of the Chinese government’s preparation to launch the “Spring Sprout” free vaccine programme in India.But, it wasn’t clear when it would be ready for launch. The survey said it is “…to better grasp the specific situation of Chinese citizens in India and provide you with more epidemic prevention and safety services”.China’s “Spring Sprout” programme was launched in March and more than 500,000 Chinese nationals in over 120 countries have benefited from it as of May 19, the news report said.Chinese nationals in dozens of countries including Thailand, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Sudan, Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Syria, and Montenegro have been vaccinated under the programme.VACCINATION IN CHINA CROSSES 700MNMeanwhile, China administered about 22.9 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines on June 2, bringing the total number of doses administered to 704.83 million, data from the national health commission (NHC) showed on Thursday.Despite the fastest rate of vaccination in the world, and only 1 death from Covid-19 in months, China is not taking any risk. “As long as outbreaks remain uncontrolled outside of our borders, it’s possible to have them anywhere in China, no matter how long there have been no local cases,” Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing in May.China’s sense of caution showed when new local cases were diagnosed recently in a southern province. When new virus cases surfaced in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong in the past one week, said to be driven by variants first identified in India and Britain, local authorities implemented tactics polished since the first lockdown in the central Chinese city of Wuhan - stay-at-home orders for affected neighbourhoods and mass testing of residents.The cluster, which has grown to more than 50 cases in a city of 18.7 million, also caused the cancellation of half the flights out of Baiyun airport, the world’s busiest airport in 2020.The pace of vaccination in capital Beijing, meanwhile, has accelerated with the inoculation rate of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine for Beijing residents surpassing 80% at the end of last month.As of last Sunday, the capital city, with a population of more than 21 million, had administered 30.95 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, with about 16.88 million residents fully inoculated, according to Beijing Daily.The vaccination rate of the first shot of the coronavirus vaccine had reached 86.7% for people aged 18 and older. Around 14.13 million residents aged 18 and above had been fully vaccinated by Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plans-covid-jabs-for-its-nationals-in-india-101622719871225.html

It also acknowledged the fact that some of its food products will “never be healthy”.The company is on a damage control mode now and said that it is updating its nutrition and health strategy. The global food brand said it was looking at its entire portfolio to make sure that its products meet nutritional needs.The food company said that the sodium and sugar content in its product saw a reduction by about at least 14-15% in the past seven years.Here’s a look at controversies that Nestle landed itself in around the worldMaggi noodles in India:Between June 5 and September 1, 2015, nearly 38,000 tonnes of Maggi Noodles were taken off the shelves of retail stores across the country and destroyed. Maggi's share in the Indian market went down from 80% to zero. It nearly threatened the existence of Nestle India as Maggi sales contributed to over 25% revenues of the Swiss company’s India unit.Boycott in the US:Nestle was accused of discouraging mothers from breastfeeding and suggesting that their baby formula is healthier, despite there being no proven evidence. This led to a boycott of its products in the United States in 1977 and subsequently spread into Europe. The boycott was officially suspended in the US in 1984, after Nestle agreed to follow an international marketing code endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-look-at-controversies-nestle-was-involved-in-101622709607739.html
03-06-2021||World||World food price index surges in May to highest level since 2011: UN food agency||World food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade, posting a 12th consecutive monthly increase to hit their highest level since September 2011, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.FAO also issued its first forecast for world cereal production in 2021, predicting output of nearly 2.821 billion tonnes -- a new record and 1.9% up on 2020 levels.The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 127.1 points last month versus a revised 121.3 in April.The April figure was previously given as 120.9.On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 39.7% in May.FAO's cereal price index rose 6.0% in May month-on-month and 36.6% year-on-year. Maize prices led the surge and are now 89.9% above their year-earlier value, however FAO said they fell back at the end of the month, lifted by an improved production outlook in the United States.The vegetable oil price index jumped 7.8% in May, lifted primarily by rising palm, soy and rapeseed oil quotations. Palm oil prices were boosted by slow production growth in southeast Asia, while prospects of robust global demand, especially from the biodiesel sector, drove up soyoil prices.The sugar index posted a 6.8% month-on-month gain, due largely to harvest delays and concerns over reduced crop yields in Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter, FAO said.The meat index rose 2.2% from April, with quotations for all meat types buoyed by a faster pace of import purchases by east Asian countries, mainly China.Dairy prices rose 1.8% on a monthly basis and were up 28% on a year earlier. The increase was led by "solid import demand" for skim and whole milk powders, while butter prices fell for the first time in almost a year on increased export supplies from New Zealand.FAO said its forecast for record world cereal production this year was underpinned by a projected 3.7% annual growth in maize output. Global wheat production was seen rising 1.4% year-on-year, while rice production was forecast to grow 1.0%.World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was seen increasing by 1.7% to a new peak of 2.826 billion tonnes, just above production levels. "Total cereal food consumption is forecast to rise in tandem with world population," FAO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-price-index-surges-in-may-to-highest-level-since-2011-un-food-agency-101622709010670.html

The centrist-left leader, Herzog won the presidency after defeating rival candidate Miriam Peretz by 87 votes.Herzog will assume the office next month and will succeed Reuven Rivlin.He was first elected to the Parliament in 2003 and went on to lead the Labour Party and held several portfolios in the coalition government. His most recent public post was as head of the Jewish Agency for Israel, which encourages immigration.Harzog was defeated by Netanyahu in the 2015 parliamentary elections. He was picked as President as his former nemesis faces a toppling by a cross-partisan alliance of challengers.The President's role in Israel is largely ceremonial and mostly meant to promote unity among ethnic and religious groups of the country. This comes days after Israel was engaged in a deadly fight with Palestinian militants in Gaza. It touched off rare mob violence among the Jewish majority and Arab minority within Israeli cities and claimed the lives of hundreds of people including children."It is essential, really essential, to tend to the open wounds that have been opened in our society recently," Herzog said in parliament while giving an acceptance speech.ALSO READ: Red Cross chief urges Israel, Palestine to end cycle of violenceSpeaking in the Parliament, Herzog also promised to defend "Israel's international standing and its good name in the family of nations, battle anti-semitism and hatred of Israel, and preserve the pillars of our democracy."A lawyer by profession, Herzog is the son of the late Israeli president Chaim Herzog, who also served as his country's ambassador to the United Nations.He is popularly known by his childhood nickname "Bougie", a combination of the Hebrew word for doll "buba" and a word for toy used by French children, "joujou".Israel-Palestine conflictIn May, the conflict between Israel and Palestine flared after the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, demanded Israeli security forces leave the al-Aqsa mosque compound in East Jerusalem following confrontations there with Palestinians.The conflict snowballed into a larger battle between the arch-rivals as Hamas claimed that several of its top commanders were killed in Israeli airstrikes, including its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa.During the 11 days of fighting, Gaza militants launched more than a thousand rockets, according to Israel’s army. In retaliation, the Israeli Army also carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Islamist groups in Gaza. In one of the airstrikes, a 12-story al-Jalaa tower in Gaza that housed major international media offices was also destroyed. This sparked worldwide criticism while news organisations demanded an explanation from Israel.This killed at least 253 Palestinians, news agency Reuters reported citing Gaza Medical officials. While in Israel, at least 13 people lost their lives.The violence eventually paused after Egypt mediated a ceasefire between Palestine and Israel.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tension-with-palestine-israel-appoints-isaac-herzog-as-new-president-101622699729740.html

However, following the court order to present himself, Choksi appeared at the magistrate’s court at 4pm local time and was represented by a battery of eight lawyers.The judge, Bernie Stephenson, ordered that the court documents should be served immediately at the Dominica China Friendship Hospital where Choksi is being treated.Politician-businessman nexusMeanwhile, amid rumours of alleged connection between fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi's brother and Dominica's opposition leader Lennox Linton was spotted inside the courtroom with Chetan Chinubhai Choksi during the hearing of Mehul Choksi in the High Court of Justice, confirmed Associates Times.Choksi’s lawyers raised the allegation that he was kidnapped and was brought to Dominica against his will. However, the judge heard the arguments of the defence and satisfied herself that Choksi was getting proper medical treatment in the Dominica China Friendship hospital and took the attested briefs with exhibits on record.Legal battleMeanwhile, the prosecution lawyers appearing on behalf of the Dominican government pressed upon the issues of Choksi being a flight risk, having an Interpol Red Notice against him, and highlighted that he is an economic fugitive wanted by India and that he has no significant ties with Dominica.“This is unheard in history that designated leader of the opposition is having a keen interest in a case which is about an international fugitive as he himself reached inside the courtroom to amplify the voice of Choksi against extradition and stood by his cousin Chetan Choksi,” the Associated Times reported.Wait not over for ChoksiThe defence lawyers offered to pay $10,000 as security bond and pressed upon Choksi's Antiguan citizenship while pleading for bail. However, the court ordered his remand in custody till Friday and posted the hearing on bail for the same day while the charge on illegal entry to Dominica will be heard on June 14.ALSO READ: Explained: As Dominican top court hears Choksi’s extradition case, India faces legal issues in bringing fugitive homeThe Indian government has been pushing to deport Choksi, wanted on ₹13,500-crore bank fraud case, to India because he doesn’t enjoy citizenship privileges in Dominica.

UPP accused Browne of disregarding the law and Choksi’s constitutional and legal protection in Antigua.In Dominica, leader of opposition Lennox Linton said his party sought a probe and alleged that Choksi was abducted at the behest of PM Roosevelt Skerrit. A day later, local media alleged that Linton had received a bribe from Choksi’s brother Chetan, a charge denied by the Opposition leader on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominican-court-denies-bail-to-choksi-to-hear-illegal-entry-charge-on-june-14-101622691932728.html

Jason Miller, a senior aide to Trump, confirmed the development on Twitter and said that it will not be returning. "It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on," Miller said in a CNBC report.This comes less than a month after the platform titled, From the Desk of Donald J Trump, was launched in May for Trump to speak directly to his supporters. It was launched after Facebook and Twitter banned him from their platform for inciting violence in January which led to thousands of American storming of the US Capitol during the formal counting of electoral votes.Those who attempt to visit the page are now greeted with a message asking them to sign up for alerts from Donald J Trump via email or text message. There is also a form, where the user will add their personal details to register.Responding to a query on the micro-blogging site, Miller also said that it was a precursor to him joining another social media platform. According to several local media reports, Trump will launch a new platform for which the team is yet to announce a date.Yes, actually, it is. Stay tuned! https://t.co/USKGvVXe2fEarlier in May, Trump downplayed the blog post's purpose as the Washington Post reported that it was attracting fewer visitors and failed to gain traction on the internet over the days. "This is meant to be a temporary way of getting my thoughts and ideas out to the public without the Fake News spin, but the website is not a ‘platform,'" Trump said in a statement in May."It is merely a way of communicating until I decide on what the future will be for the choice or establishment of a platform," the former US President also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-permanently-shuts-down-his-blogpost-amid-lower-readership-reports-101622690330978.html
03-06-2021||World||UN says Covid-19 pandemic created an 'unparalleled' employment crisis||The Covid-19 pandemic has created an “unparalleled” global labor market crisis that will affect the employment market for years, the International Labor Organization said in a report Wednesday.The U.N. agency said that “all countries have suffered a sharp deterioration in employment and national income, which has aggravated existing inequalities and risks inflicting longer-term `scarring’ effects on workers and enterprises.”The 164-page World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021 report said the crisis has hit vulnerable workers, including 2 billion in the informal sector, women and young people the hardest.During 2020, an estimated 8.8% of total working hours were lost -- “the equivalent of the hours worked in one year by 255 million full-time workers,” the agency said. By contrast, it said, if there had not been a pandemic, the world would have created an estimated 30 million new jobs in 2020.The Geneva-based agency said recurring waves of the pandemic around the world have caused working hour losses to remain high, with a 4.4% loss corresponding to 140 million full-time jobs in the first quarter of 2021 and a 4.4% loss in the second quarter equivalent to 127 million full-time jobs.“The crisis is far from over,” the agency added, pointing to Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia as the worst affected regions in the first half of this year.The report said an uneven economic recovery is expected to begin in the second half of 2021, driven by progress in vaccinations and large-scale fiscal spending. It projects that the recovery will create 100 million jobs this year and an additional 80 million in 2022, but says that is still far short of pre-pandemic levels.“To make matters worse, many of the newly created jobs are expected to be of low productivity and poor quality,” the report said.The agency predicts employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered as a result of the pandemic until at least 2023.It said that many businesses — especially micro and small enterprises — “have already gone bankrupt or are facing a highly uncertain future.” A survey of 4,520 businesses in 45 countries worldwide in the second quarter of 2020 found that 80% of micro-enterprises and 70% of small firms “were facing significant financial difficulties,” the report said.“Recovery from Covid-19 is not just a health issue,” said the agency's director, Guy Ryder. “The serious damage to economies and societies needs to be overcome too."Without accelerated efforts to create decent jobs and support for the world’s most vulnerable people and hardest-hit economic sectors, “the lingering effects of the pandemic could be with us for years in the form of lost human and economic potential and higher poverty and inequality,” Ryder said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-covid-19-pandemic-created-an-unparalleled-employment-crisis-101622684775922.html

03-06-2021||World||Canada minister says lack of papal apology in indigenous school abuse 'shameful'||Canada's indigenous services minister said Wednesday it is "shameful" that the Pope has never formally apologized for abuses at the country's Catholic-run indigenous residential schools, which he termed "labor camps."Marc Miller's comments followed the recent discovery of unmarked graves of 215 children in Kamloops at one of 139 boarding schools set up a century ago to forcibly assimilate Canada's indigenous peoples."I do, I do," the minister told a news conference when asked if he supports growing indigenous calls for a papal apology that date back to a 2015 truth and reconciliation commission report, and before."I think it is shameful that they haven't done it, that it hasn't been done to date," he said. "It should be done. There is a responsibility that lies squarely on the shoulders of the Council of Bishops in Canada."Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett also said a papal apology is needed to "unlock the healing" in indigenous communities."They want to hear the Pope apologize," she said, urging Catholics across Canada to "ask their church to do better."A few hours after Miller's comments, Vancouver Archbishop J Michael Miller offered an apology on social media."In light of the heartbreaking disclosure of the remains of 215 children at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, I am writing to express my deep apology and profound condolences to the families and communities that have been devastated by this horrific news," he said in a statement."If words of apology for such unspeakable deeds are to bring life and healing, they must be accompanied by tangible actions that foster the full disclosure of the truth," he said, pledging to make church records about the schools available."The church was unquestionably wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for children, families and communities," he said.- 'Labor camps' -The Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, where the unmarked graves were discovered last week using ground-penetrating radar, was operated by the Catholic church on behalf of Ottawa from 1890 to 1969.Some 150,000 Indian, Inuit and Metis youngsters in total were forcibly enrolled in these schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language.Today those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in indigenous communities.Miller recalled an anecdote shared by an indigenous faithkeeper about one such school where students -- who were often malnourished -- were "punished" for eating apples from its orchard or eggs that were destined for market."These were labor camps," he said. "So calling (them) a school is probably a euphemism."A delegation of indigenous leaders had in 2009 met privately with Pope Benedict who "expressed his sorrow" over the school harms to indigenous peoples.Although the statement of regret was welcomed by the group as "significant," they said it fell short of an official apology.The truth and reconciliation commission later noted that it was "disappointing to survivors and others that the Pope (had) not yet made a clear and emphatic public apology in Canada for the abuses."Pope Francis's subsequent refusal in 2018 -- after Canada's parliament passed a motion again asking the pontiff to apologize -- drew a polite rebuke from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying he was "disappointed" with the church's decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-minister-says-lack-of-papal-apology-in-indigenous-school-abuse-shameful-101622680672168.html
03-06-2021||World||US science chief Eric Lander wants next pandemic vaccine ready in 100 days||The new White House science adviser wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in just about 100 days after recognizing a potential viral outbreak.In his first interview after being sworn in Wednesday, Eric Lander painted a rosy near future where a renewed American emphasis on science not only better prepares the world for the next pandemic with plug-and-play vaccines, but also changes how medicine fights disease and treats patients, curbs climate change and further explores space. He even threw in a “Star Trek” reference.“This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas,” Lander told The Associated Press.Lander took his oath of office on a 500-year-old fragment of the Mishnah, an ancient Jewish text documenting oral traditions and laws. He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level.Lander said President Joe Biden’s elevation of the science post is a symbolic show “that science should have a seat at the table” but also allows him to have higher-level talks with different agency chiefs about making policy.Lander is a mathematician and geneticist by training who was part of the human genome mapping project and directed the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard. He said he is particularly focused not so much on this pandemic, but the lessons learned from this one to prepare for the next one.“It was amazing at one level that we were able to produce highly effective vaccines in less than a year, but from another point of view you’d say, ‘Boy, a year’s a long time,’” even though in the past it would take three years or four years, Lander said. “To really make a difference we want to get this done in 100 days. And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.”“It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.”Scientists were working on so-called all-purpose ready-to-go platform technologies for vaccines long before the pandemic. They’re considered “plug-and-play.” Instead of using the germ itself to make a vaccine, they use messenger RNA and add the genetic code for the germ. That’s what happened with the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 shots.Beyond being optimistic about confronting future pandemics, Lander wonders about the implications for preventing cancer."Maybe the same sort of experience about moving so much faster than we thought is applicable to cancer,” said Lander, who during the Obama administration was co-chair of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. A company already has been working on that.For that matter, the pandemic and telehealth brought the doctor to patients in some ways. Lander said he is reimagining “a world where we rearrange a lot of things” to get more patient-centered health care, including community health workers checking up every few weeks on people about their blood pressure, blood sugar and other chronic problems.Two of Lander’s predecessor praised him. Neal Lane, President Bill Clinton’s science adviser, said Lander is “perfect” for the pandemic because of the need for a strategy and international agreements. Obama's science chief, John Holden, called him “a Renaissance man.”Lander's nomination had been delayed for months as senators sought more information about meetings he had with the late Jeffrey Epstein, a financier who was charged with sex trafficking before his apparent suicide. Lander said he only met with Epstein twice, in 2012, and never requested or received funds from Epstein or his foundation. At his confirmation hearing, Lander also apologized for a 2016 article he wrote that downplayed the work of two Nobel Prize-winning female scientists.Lander, who has visited Greenland on a balmy 72-degree day, told the AP he sees climate change as “an incredibly serious threat to this planet in many, many ways.”Still, Lander said he was more optimistic now than he and others were a decade ago because “I see a path to doing something about it.”Lander pointed to a drop of about in 90% in solar and energy wind costs, making them now as cheap as fossil fuels that cause climate change. But he said what’s also needed is “an explosion of ideas” to improve battery life and provide carbon-free energy that is not weather-dependent. Those innovations need federal incentives that are part of Biden’s jobs package, he said.Reducing methane is key to fighting climate change, Lander added, but first improvements are needed in technology to determine where methane is leaking from.As for space, Lander said he was too new to comment on whether heading to the moon or Mars should be the goal. The Obama administration redirected NASA away from the Bush-era plan to send astronauts back to the moon and was more aimed for Mars or an asteroid. The Trump administration not only focused back on the moon but set a 2024 goal for a new moon landing.“Are we going to go to the moon and are we going to go to Mars and are we going to moons of Jupiter? Sure. The exact order I think is great to think about or great to talk about,” Lander said.He quoted “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,” when Captain James T. Kirk’s love interest asked if he was from outer space. He responded: “I’m from Iowa, I only work in outer space.”Adds Lander: “That was a fun line in ‘Star Trek IV,’ but folks in Iowa are really going to say that."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-science-chief-eric-lander-wants-next-pandemic-vaccine-ready-in-100-days-101622680313522.html
03-06-2021||World||Iran's main issues with US on 2015 nuclear deal, 'resolved': Hassan Rouhani||Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday a breakthrough in talks in Vienna to revive a nuclear deal before he leaves office in August required a "will" beyond his power.Rouhani is Iran's main architect of the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, which was torpedoed by former US president Donald Trump in 2018.Under its terms, international sanctions against Iran were eased in return for a commitment from Tehran that it would not seek to develop nuclear weapons.But the final decision regarding the ongoing Vienna negotiations rests with the Islamic republic's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei."Our main issues with the United States in these negotiations have been resolved, and there are only a few minor issues left, on which we will negotiate and produce results," Rouhani said, at a televised cabinet meeting."If there is the will that this be done in the current administration, then this administration has finished the work," he added.Iranians vote on June 18 for a new president, Rouhani having served the maximum two consecutive terms allowed under the constitution. He will hand over power in August.Negotiations have been underway since April in the Austrian capital between Iran and the remaining members to the accord, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.Talks resume next week Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian envoy at the talks, tweeted they had reached a point where the different countries needed to consult with their respective capitals.The talks have been halted on Wednesday but are due to resume at the end of next week, he added.EU negotiator Enrique Mora, who is chairing the talks in Vienna, told journalists Wednesday he hoped that it would be the last round of negotiations."But we are going to keep working and I am sure that at the next round next week we will finally have an agreement," he added.In Washington, US State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter spoke of progress, while cautioning that reaching an agreement would be neither a fast nor an easy process.The United States is participating indirectly in the talks.Trump's successor, US President Joe Biden, has signalled his readiness to revive the nuclear deal.For this to happen, the US would need to return to the accord and lift the sanctions reinstated by Trump, while Tehran would have to re-commit to full compliance with nuclear obligations it progressively withdrew from since 2019 in retaliation.Sanctions reimposed by Trump deprived Iran of the economic benefits the deal had promised, especially by blocking its vital oil export lifeline and access to its funds abroad, sparking an economic crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-main-issues-with-us-on-2015-nuclear-deal-resolved-hassan-rouhani-101622678177612.html
03-06-2021||World||Israel oppon declares new govt under Lapid-Bennett, set to unseat Netanyahu||Israel's opposition leader moved closer to unseating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he officially told the country's president that he has reached agreements with political allies to form a new government.About 35 minutes before a Wednesday midnight deadline, the centrist Yair Lapid told President Reuven Rivlin in an email: "I am honored to inform you that I have succeeded in forming a government."Rivlin, attending Israel's soccer cup final at the time, congratulated Lapid by phone, according to his office.Lapid's main partner is nationalist Naftali Bennett, who would serve as prime minister first under a rotation between the two men. Lapid, 57, a former TV host and finance minister, would take over after about two years.Their coalition government would comprise a patchwork of small and medium parties from across the political spectrum, including for the first time in Israel's history a party that represents Israel's 21% Arab minority - the United Arab List.It would also include Bennett's Yamina (Rightward), centre-left Blue and White, headed by Defence Minister Benny Gantz, the left-wing Meretz and Labour parties, former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman's nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party and New Hope, a right-wing party headed by former education minister Gideon Saar, who broke away from Netanyahu's Likud.But the fragile new government, which would command a razor-thin majority in parliament, was only expected to be sworn in about 10-12 days from now, leaving slight room for Netanyahu's camp to try and abort it by turning lawmakers over to their side and vote against it.Israeli political analysts widely expected Netanyahu to try every possible political manoeuvre to make this happen, seizing upon Yamina members who are unhappy about joining forces with Arab and leftist lawmakers."Calm down. Netanyahu’s still prime minister for a few more days until the confidence vote and he's going to fight every inch of the way to deny the new government its wafer-thin majority. This is still very far from over," Anshel Pfeffer, political analyst for the liberal Haaretz newspaper, wrote on Twitter.Netanyahu, who has yet to respond to Lapid's announcement, controls 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset, almost twice as many as Lapid's Yesh Atid party, and he is allied with at least three other religious and nationalist parties.'GREAT HOPE'During a 12-year run in top office, Israel's longest serving leader has been an often polarising figure at home and abroad.Netanyahu, 71, has sought to discredit the Bennett-Lapid alliance, saying it would endanger Israel's security - an allusion to efforts to curb Iran's nuclear programme and manage ever-fraught Palestinian ties.Lapid, a centrist, was given the task of forming a governing coalition after right-wing Netanyahu failed to do so in the wake of a March 23 election. He campaigned under a pledge to "return sanity" to Israel, focusing on Netanyahu's corruption trial on charges which he denies."This government will work for all Israel's citizens, those who voted for it and those who did not. It will respect its opponents and do all it can to unites and connect all parts of Israeli society," Lapid said on Twitter.The new government, if it is sworn in, will face considerable diplomatic, security and economic challenges: Iran, the moribund peace process with the Palestinians, a war crimes probe by the International Criminal Court and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.A source involved in the coalition talks said the proposed new government would try to retain consensus by avoiding hot-button ideological issues such as whether to annex or cede occupied West Bank territory that Palestinians want for a state.Bennett has said that both sides would have to compromise on such ideological issues in order to get the country back on track, with government debt at 72.4% in 2020, up from 60% in 2019 and the deficit jumping to 11.6% in 2020 from 3.7% in 2019."This is a night of great hope," Gantz, who will remain in office under the coalition agreements, said on Twitter as he set out on a trip to Washington in the aftermath of 11 days of fierce fighting with militants in Gaza last month and as world powers press on in reviving a nuclear deal with Iran.An end to Netanyahu's tenure may bring reprieve from unprecedented domestic political turmoil, Israel has held four elections in two years - but major shifts in Israel's foreign policy appear less likely.After Lapid's announcement, a few dozen activists from the protest movement against Netanyahu broke out in cheers. "He's finished, he's finished, yalla Bibi, go," they chanted outside a bar in Tel Aviv, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname."We're hopeful for this change for a better future for this wonderful state," said 27-year-old student Eran Margalit.(Additional reporting by Dan Williams and Stephen Farrell in Jerusalem and Rami Amichay in Tel Aviv; Writing by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Grant McCool)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-oppon-declares-new-govt-under-lapid-bennett-set-to-unseat-netanyahu-101622679660108.html
03-06-2021||World||Analysis: Hacks force Biden into more aggressive stance on Russia||A ransomware attack on JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, by a criminal group likely based in Russia has strengthened the Biden administration's resolve to hold Moscow responsible for costly cyber assaults - even if they are not directly linked to the Kremlin.U.S. President Joe Biden has launched a review of the threat posed by ransomware attacks and he will discuss the issue of harboring such hackers with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month, the White House said on Wednesday."President Biden certainly thinks that President Putin and the Russian government has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.The JBS hack is the third major cyberattack linked to hackers from Russia since Biden took office in January, following attacks aimed at Colonial Pipeline Co and software made by SolarWinds Corp. JBS is a Brazilian company with extensive U.S. operations."Biden has indicated his willingness to hold Russia accountable in some way for the pipeline attack, even though it was carried out by a criminal organization," said Tom Bossert, a top homeland security adviser to former President Donald Trump. "That's a big leap forward."The White House plans to use a June 16 summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials said. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say.Biden has launched a review of the threat posed by ransomware attacks and he will discuss the issue of harboring such hackers with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month, the White House said on Wednesday.Russia joined U.N. member states in endorsing a March report agreeing to voluntary norms around cyber crime, including a pledge to not conduct or knowingly support cyberattacks in violation of international law that intentionally damage or impairs critical infrastructure.Biden, who has repeatedly taken aim at Russia for its jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and a military buildup near Ukraine, will urge NATO allies, EU leaders and the Group of Seven rich countries to back a strong, unified stance on Russia at separate summits before he meets Putin, U.S. officials say.Consensus is growing among Western allies that stronger action is needed, they say.The White House said Tuesday it was engaging directly with the Russian government. The statement marks a clear shift toward a new and more assertive U.S. policy against Russia on hacking, say former and current U.S. security officials and analysts.The White House response came after Senator Lindsey Graham and other Republicans criticized the Biden administration for a "weak" response to last month's ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, by DarkSide, a group with ties to Russia.U.S. officials said they sprang into action after both incidents. The White House also started a review of ransomware attacks, including a push to work with allies to "hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable."James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said people who brief Biden had told him they expect strong language from Biden at the meeting."Biden is tough. He's going to tell Putin, 'This is enough. You've got to stop or we'll do something back,'" Lewis said.DISABLING HACKER INFRASTRUCTUREThe U.S. intelligence and military community has long had the capability to damage computer servers used by private hackers in other countries, but largely refrained, given diplomatic concerns about the consequences.The JBS hack could signal a turning point.Lewis said a surge in ransomware attacks had overshadowed diplomatic concerns in recent months."The Russians don't see any reason to stop. Until we do something, this is going to keep happening," he said. Biden's experts are working on a new doctrine.Bossert said Russian-based hackers could well increase their attacks on U.S. companies in response to any foreign policy decisions taken at the upcoming G7, NATO and EU summits. That would give the United States more reasons to take down the infrastructure used to launch such attacks."The U.S. government should be prepared to use its capabilities to directly take down the infrastructure that would be used - whether belonging to a government or a proxy group - should cyber attacks escalate," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysis-hacks-force-biden-into-more-aggressive-stance-on-russia-101622679137034.html
03-06-2021||World||Robert Mueller to teach law school class on his Trump-Russia investigation||Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller will be his own subject when he teaches a course on his eponymous investigation of president Donald Trump, the University of Virginia Law School announced Wednesday.The school said the notably reticent former FBI chief and federal prosecutor, 76, will teach a class on special counsel investigations alongside three other members of his nearly two-year probe into connections between Russia and Trump's 2016 election campaign."I was fortunate to attend UVA Law School after the Marine Corps, and I'm fortunate to be returning there now," Mueller said in the announcement. "I look forward to engaging with the students this fall."Since submitting the investigation's final 448-page report in March 2019, Mueller has commented very little on it nor on how the controversial investigation operated.The probe suggested repeated instances of collusion or attempted collusion between the campaign and Russian to interfere with the 2016 election.It also made a strong case that Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation on multiple occasions.It issued indictments for more than two dozen Russians and several Trump advisors.But when it was presented to Trump-appointed attorney general Bill Barr, he immediately dismissed its conclusions as not enough to support any criminal complaints for conspiracy to work with Russia in election interference, or for obstruction.Trump and his supporters branded the investigations as an unjustified and illegal witch hunt, while opponents of the president criticized Mueller for approaching the case too conservatively and allowing his cautious conclusions to be distorted by Trump and Barr.Mueller defended his report, saying he was not tasked with charging Trump himself, and that it was up to Congress to decide whether to impeach the president.He later testified before Congress about the investigation, but declined to say more than the report itself said.He did indicate that he believed that Trump was not fully truthful in his answers to questions from the investigation, but he never challenged the answers.And he said Trump "was not exculpated" by the report."It's not a witch hunt," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-mueller-to-teach-law-school-class-on-his-trump-russia-investigation-101622678186472.html

Figures show 75.2% of people 18 and over have received a shot, and 49.5% received both doses.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that the infectious Covid-19 variant first detected in India “threatens” to rapidly spread in the Asia-Pacific region, including among refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-soon-unveil-plans-to-distribute-80mn-jabs-101622677129994.html
03-06-2021||World||Europe sees progress in latest rounds of Iran nuclear talks||European diplomats say the latest round of talks over Iran’s nuclear program has made progress, expressing hope that agreement could soon be reached for Tehran to comply with a 2015 deal aimed at curbing its atomic ambitions and also see the United States rejoin the accord.Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired Wednesday's talks in Vienna, said delegations from Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain, Iran and the US would return home to brief their governments and then meet again in the Austrian capital next week.“I’m sure that the next round will be the one in which we will finally get the deal," Mora told reporters after the meeting.“There are a few political issues (and) there are a number of technical issues, again rather complex," he added. "But I can say that they are fewer than they were one week ago. So we are (on) a good track.”“I think every capital has to give a green light to their respective delegations to get the agreement, and I think that will be the case next week,” said Mora.Other European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity as they weren’t authorized to be quoted by name, described the talks in Vienna as “intense and productive,” but cautioned that they would become more difficult as delegates tackle harder issues.While progress had been made and important aspects of a future deal had been hammered out, the diplomats said that tough decisions lie ahead and nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed.Asked about the United Nations’ atomic watchdog this week stating that it hasn’t been able to access data important to monitoring Iran’s nuclear program since late February, Mora said delegations had “taken note” of the report.Iran started limiting inspections in a bid to put pressure on the government of US President Joe Biden to lift crippling sanctions reimposed after then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, in 2018.“It’s something that is not directly related to the negotiations of the JCPOA,” Mora said, referring to the U.N. atomic energy agency's report that it had not had access to the monitoring data since Feb. 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-sees-progress-in-latest-rounds-of-iran-nuclear-talks-101622665033657.html
03-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Airlines urge G7 to adopt data-driven approach to reopening travel||Global airlines urged the G7 rich nations on Wednesday to replace blanket Covid-19 travel curbs with more flexible restrictions informed by data, artificial intelligence and risk analysis.Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), also said during an online event that airlines and passengers should be allowed to assess travel risks based on increasingly abundant health data.The former British Airways head said he was confident Europe could begin to return to normal travel in the second half of the year as vaccination rates rise."With sensible testing and screening methods in place we can safely open our borders to regain the freedom that has been taken from us," he said.Ministers and officials from G7 countries are meeting in London on June 4-5 ahead of a leaders' summit next week.Airlines weakened by 15 months of lockdowns are facing a slower than expected recovery, as lingering travel restrictions overshadow the peak northern summer season. Concern over the spread of more transmissible coronavirus variants also threatens to slow reopening plans.IATA drew on UK testing data that showed a low incidence of Covid-19 in arriving passengers, during the joint presentation with Airbus and Boeing representatives, who demonstrated digital travel risk models."These data tell us we can do better," Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the National Health Service - or 1.46% excluding higher-risk "red list" countries.Walsh also singled out Greece, which has largely reopened to foreign tourists, for its use of testing data and artificial intelligence to monitor risk in real time."We're seeing more and more countries questioning whether they have the appropriate measures in place," he said.But David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, sounded a note of caution."What's really set off governments is the variants, and the fear they will escape the protection offered by vaccines," he said during the same event."No matter what you show in terms of models they're still going to be concerned about the variants."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-airlines-urge-g7-to-adopt-data-driven-approach-to-reopening-travel-101622663506952.html
03-06-2021||World||US President Biden, top GOP senator meet as infrastructure deadline looms||Deadline looming, President Joe Biden is meeting Wednesday with the top Senate Republican negotiator on infrastructure as the administration signals time is running out to strike a bipartisan deal on the White House's big investment proposal and top legislative priority.The closed-door talk was billed as more of a conversation with West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, rather than a formal negotiation, the White House said. No new offers are expected to be presented. More than anything, the private conference is being seen through the political lens of two sides trying to show progress ahead of the June. 7 the administration set for a deal.“The fact that the president is having Sen. Capito here today and has been having ongoing discussions with Republicans in the Senate and that he’s eager to find a path forward on bipartisanship work certainly tells you I think what you need to know about what he thinks about working with people even when there’s disagreement,” said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.Privately, however, the president has sized up the GOP's latest $928 billion offer as unworkable, in large part because it taps unused Covid-19 funds to pay for it. Biden wants to hike the corporate tax rate to generate revenue, a nonstarter for Senate Republicans. Publicly the administration is making it clear it views next week as a make-or-break moment for the president's push toward a deal with Republicans.Capito in the meeting is expected to reup the GOP's push to repurpose the coronavirus relief fund to pay for infrastructure investments, said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has tasked her to lead the discussions.“That’s the key to getting a bipartisan agreement,” McConnell said at a press conference in Kentucky. He said he particularly wants to halt unemployment assistance that he says is preventing Americans from returning to work.“The coronavirus is behind us. We need to get back to work,” McConnell said.Together, the president and the Republicans both have political incentives to negotiate a bipartisan accord over his sweeping investment package, even if no deal is within sight. For Biden, reaching across the aisle and cutting deals in Congress is central to his brand of politics. Republicans can also score political gains by trying to work with a popular president.Yet an initial Memorial Day deadline came and went without results and in the latest round of talks, Biden and a core group of GOP senators appear to have pulled farther apart. Democrats, who hold slim majorities in the House and Senate, are watching warily as the White House and Republicans try to narrow the gap between the president's initial ideas for a massive investment in not just roads and bridges but the “human” infrastructure of hospitals and child and senior care facilities, and a GOP approach that is more focused approach on traditional infrastructure projects.The White House has pared back the president’s initial $2.3 trillion bid, now tallied at $1.7 trillion, with Biden proposing to fund the investment by raising the corporate tax rate, from 21% to 28%.Without a bipartisan agreement with Republicans, Biden will be faced with trying to muscle support from Democrats alone. That approach also poses political challenges in the narrowly divided House and Senate where the administration has few votes to spare if the president tries to push the package to passage under budget rules that allow for a majority vote.Psaki downplayed the comments Biden had made Tuesday that were seen as critical of two Democrats, presumably Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Krysten Sinema of Arizona. In remarks at a Tulsa, Okla., he noted those Democrats who don't always vote with the party, blaming them for stalling his agenda.Psaki said the president considers both Manchin and Sinema “good working partners" and pointed to the Capito meeting as an example of his willingness to broach the divide to hash out issues. "He believes that in democracy, we don’t have to see eye to eye on every detail of every single issue in order to work together.”Biden's own thinking is that the Republican proposal, while improved from an earlier $568 billion opening bid, is unworkable because the Republicans want to tap unspent Covid-19 funds to pay for the spending, according to a White House official granted anonymity to discuss the private deliberations.The president, in meetings with his team, has zeroed in on the questions the GOP proposal raises — namely, which coronavirus relief funds to possibly shelve. Biden’s view is that tapping the Covid funds would unduly burden the middle class, including small business owners, who are receiving the virus aid during the pandemic crisis.For Republicans, the corporate tax hikes are a red line they will not cross, and instead want to pay for the infrastructure investment with virus aid money as well as typical gas taxes and other fees on consumers.“I think we can get to real compromise, absolutely, because we’re both still in the game,” Capito said over the weekend. “I think the president told me himself that let’s get this done.”Congress is away for a weeklong Memorial Day break, but faces a deadline when lawmakers return next week.The White House said the president is also eyeing action in the House that week when the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is set to begin debating a big highway reauthorization bill that is being closely watched as a potential building block toward the broader package.White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had noted the panel's June 9 hearing as “a relevant date in terms of the overall time frame."That week, she said, "will be incredibly critical.”A similar bipartisan highway bill is underway in the Senate and those bills, along with others being negotiated over water resources and other public works could make up the foundations for a broader package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-top-gop-senator-meet-as-infrastructure-deadline-looms-101622662563900.html

Today’s actions provide time for those negotiations to continue to make progress while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs under Section 301 if warranted in the future.”The United States launched a comprehensive Section investigation into digital services taxes adopted by nine countries and one jurisdiction in June 2020: India, Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the European Union,In January 2021, the USTR concluded that the DSTs in India, Austria, Turkey, UK, Italy and Spain, “discriminated against US digital companies, were inconsistent with principles of international taxation, and burdened US companies”.In March, the USTR announced trade actions against these six entities and kicked of a public-notice and comment period, with hearings.In public notice issued in April inviting comments and announcing a hearing into the investigation related to India, the USTR had called into question a 2% tax adopted by India on revenue generated from a broad range of digital services including digital platform services, digital content sales, digital sales of a company’s own goods, data-related services, software-as-a-service, and others. The DSTs, it had noted, only applied to “non-resident” companies.And the trade representative had said in the same announcement that the retaliatory trade action it is proposing is an additional tariff of up to 25%t “ad valorem on an aggregate level of trade that would collect duties on goods of India in the range of the amount of DSTs that India is expected to collect from US companies”, which, it added, would be up to approximately $55 million per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-suspended-additional-tariffs-against-india-five-others-101622653686438.html
