New Delhi has been clear that while the US drawdown was inevitable, it doesn’t want to see the gains of the last 20 years squandered in the aftermath.Those gains remain a priority for the Biden administration as well, as it has said and reiterated it once again in the Sunday announcement of the visit. “The visit by President Ghani and Dr Abdullah will highlight the enduring partnership between the US and Afghanistan as the military drawdown continues,” the White House said, adding, “The US is committed to supporting the Afghan people by providing diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance to support the Afghan people, including women, girls and minorities.”There have been concerns that US withdrawal could lead to the return of the Taliban and their repressive practices and support of al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, many of whom never left Afghanistan.The Biden administration has said it plans to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan before September 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that brought them to the country, along with international partners, in search of al-Qaeda.The White House added: “We will remain deeply engaged with the Government of Afghanistan to ensure the country never again becomes a safe haven for terrorist groups who pose a threat to the US homeland.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-meet-afghanistan-s-ghani-abdullah-101624211013804.html
20-06-2021||World||9 children among 10 killed in Alabama crash caused 'likely' by storm||Tropical Depression Claudette claimed 12 lives in Alabama as the storm swept across the southeastern U.S., causing flash flooding and spurring tornadoes that destroyed dozens of homes.Ten people, including nine children, were killed Saturday in a 15-vehicle crash about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Montgomery on Interstate 65, according to Butler County Coroner Wayne Garlock.He said the vehicles likely hydroplaned on wet roads, with eight children, ages 4 to 17, killed in a van belonging to a youth ranch operated by the Alabama Sheriffs Association for abused or neglected children. A man and a 9-month-old baby died in a separate vehicle. Multiple people were also injured.Meanwhile, a 24-year-old man and a 3-year-old boy were killed when a tree fell on their house just outside the Tuscaloosa city limits Saturday, Capt. Marty Sellers of the Tuscaloosa Violent Crimes Unit told The Tuscaloosa News.The deaths occurred as drenching rains pelted northern Alabama and Georgia late Saturday. As much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain was reported earlier from Claudette along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.Flash flood watches were posted Sunday for northern Georgia, most of South Carolina, the North Carolina coast and parts of southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. A tropical storm warning was in effect in North Carolina from the Little River Inlet to the town of Duck on the Outer Banks. A tropical storm watch was issued from South Santee River, South Carolina, to the Little River Inlet, forecasters said.The eight girls killed in the van were returning to a youth ranch operated by the Alabama Sheriffs Association near Camp Hill, northeast of Montgomery, from a week at the beach in Gulf Shores, youth ranches CEO Michael Smith told The Associated Press. He said the director of the Tallapoosa County ranch survived the crash and was hospitalized in Montgomery. At least one of the dead was a child of the director, Smith said.“This is the worst tragedy I've been a part of in my life,” said Smith, who was driving Sunday to Camp Hill to talk to the remaining residents, who had returned from Gulf Shores in a separate van and did not see the wreck.“Words cannot explain what I saw,” Smith said of the accident site, which he visited Saturday. “We love these girls like they're our own children.”Garlock said the location of the wreck is “notorious" for hydroplaning, as the northbound highway curves down a hill to a small creek. Traffic on that stretch of I-65 is usually filled with vacationers driving to and from Gulf of Mexico beaches on summer weekends.“Butler County has had one of the most terrible traffic accidents," county Sheriff Danny Bond wrote on Facebook, adding: “I believe is the worst ever in our county."The Tallapoosa County school system said counselors would be available Sunday at Reeltown High School, where some of the ranch residents were students. Smith said the ranch, which is Christian-based, would likely have a memorial service later, asking for prayers as he began to cry.Top winds remained near 30 mph (45 kph) on Sunday. National Hurricane Center forecasters predicted Claudette would strengthen back to tropical storm status Monday over eastern North Carolina before heading out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean.More than 20 people were rescued Saturday by boat due to flooding in Northport, Alabama, WVUA-TV reported. The Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency tweeted that local Red Cross volunteers were on hand to help those who were affected. A shelter was opened in Northport.The center of Claudette's disorganized circulation was located about 15 miles (20 kilometers) east-northeast of Atlanta on Sunday morning. It was moving east-northeast at 17 mph (28 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.Claudette was declared organized enough to qualify as a named tropical storm early Saturday morning, after the storm’s center of circulation had come ashore southwest of New Orleans.Shortly after landfall, a suspected tornado spurred by the storm demolished or badly damaged at least 50 homes in a small town in Alabama, just north of the Florida border.Sheriff Heath Jackson in Escambia County said a suspected tornado “pretty much leveled” a mobile home park, toppled trees onto houses and ripped the roof off of a high school gym. Most of the damage was done in or near the towns of Brewton and East Brewton, about 48 miles (77 kilometers) north of Pensacola, Florida.“It kind of affected everybody,” Jackson said. “But with those mobile homes being built so close together it can take a toll on them a lot more than it can on houses that are spread apart.”Tornadoes were also reported in southwest Georgia.Damage from the storm was also felt in north Florida, where winds — in some cases reaching 85 mph (137 kph) — caused an 18-wheeler to flip on its side.The storm also dumped flooding rains north of Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast, inundating streets and, in some areas, pushing water into homes. Later, the storm was drenching the Florida Panhandle and, well inland, a broad expanse of Alabama.Forecasters said the system could still dump 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain in the region, with isolated accumulations of 8 inches (20 centimeters) possible.Separately, Tropical Storm Dolores made landfall on Mexico’s west coast with near-hurricane force. As of Sunday morning, it had dissipated over Mexico. Its remnants had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (35 kph), and it was centered about 170 miles (275 kilometers) east of Mazatlan, Mexico.Heavy rainfall totals up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) were expected across the southwest and western coastal areas of Mexico throughout the weekend. Forecasters were warning of the potential for flash flooding and mudslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-children-among-10-killed-in-alabama-crash-caused-likely-by-storm-101624205812136.html
20-06-2021||World||South African 'diamond rush' unearths only quartz crystals, officials say||Unidentified stones that lured thousands of fortune seekers to a rural South African village to mine the land with picks and shovels were not diamonds as hoped, officials said on Sunday, but quartz stones with relatively low, if any, value.People from across South Africa travelled to KwaHlathi in the country's eastern KwaZulu-Natal province where villagers had been digging since June 12 after a herder discovered the first stone in an open field and put out the word.Provincial executive council member for economic development and tourism, Ravi Pillay, told a media briefing on Sunday he had counted some 3,000 there during a visit to the site, where samples were taken to identify the stones."The tests conducted conclusively revealed that the stones discovered in the area are not diamonds as some had hoped," he said, adding they were in fact quartz crystals."The value, if any, of the quartz crystals is yet to be established but it must be mentioned that the value of quartz crystals is very low compared to that of diamonds."The event had highlighted the socio-economic challenges faced by local people, he continued. Like many areas in South Africa, high levels of unemployment and poverty have left communities living hand to mouth.People in the area had also raised concerns specifically around roads and water during the visit, which officials at the briefing said they would address.Meanwhile, the number of people mining the land had dwindled to less than 500, Pillay continued, though significant damage had already been done with an area of around 50 hectares covered in holes of up to one metre, posing a danger to cattle.He said those that continue to mine in the area, a situation that also risks the spread of Covid-19, would be encouraged to leave, though law enforcement could be drawn upon if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-diamond-rush-unearths-only-quartz-crystals-officials-say-101624204371146.html

The troop withdrawal started on May 1.Since the United States announced plans in April to pull out all of troops, at least 30 districts have been seized by the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-meet-with-afghanistan-s-ghani-and-abdullah-abdullah-101624203478983.html
20-06-2021||World||Biden admin sees North Korea’s Kim Jong Un comments as ‘interesting signal'||The United States on Sunday said that it regards North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s “dialogue and confrontation” remark as an “interesting signal” but would wait for direct communication from Pyongyang for any potential talks."His comments this week we regard as an interesting signal and we will wait to see whether they are followed up with any kind of more direct communication to us about a potential path forward," US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News.North Korea’s state media reported on Friday that Kim ordered his government to prepare for both “dialogue and confrontation” with Washington, in his first reaction to the Biden administration’s new policy for Pyongyang. Kim also stressed the need to get “fully prepared for confrontation” to guarantee the “peaceful environment” and security of North Korea."What President Biden has communicated is that the United States is prepared to engage in principled negotiations with North Korea to deal with the challenge of North Korea's nuclear program towards the ultimate objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," Sullivan said in the interview.Also Read | ‘Even North Korea is not this nuts’: Defector after graduating from American universityLast month, US President Joe Biden rejected his predecessor’s approach to North Korea and its nuclear program, saying he would not give Kim Jong Un any “international recognition”. Former US president Donald Trump met the North Korean leader in June 2018 during the Singapore summit but no mutually acceptable term for nuclear negotiations have been achieved so far.“If he made any commitment, then I would meet with him,” said Biden during a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.“But what I would not do is..what had been done in the recent past. I would not give him all that he’s looking for - international recognition...and give [North Korea] what allowed [Kim Jong Un] to move in the direction of appearing to be more...serious about what he wasn’t at all serious about,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-sees-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-comments-as-interesting-signal-101624202594907.html
20-06-2021||World||Pakistan NSA rules out meeting with Indian counterpart on margins of SCO meeting||Pakistan National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf has ruled out the possibility of a meeting with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval on the margins of a meeting of top security officials of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) states in Tajikistan this week. Doval and Yusuf are set to attend the in-person meeting of the secretaries of the security council of the eight SCO member states in Dushanbe during June 22-23, and this had triggered speculation about a meeting between the two officials against the backdrop of back-channel contacts between India and Pakistan. “There is absolutely no possibility of any bilateral meeting with Indian counterpart at SCO,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper. At the last virtual meeting of NSAs of SCO member states in September 2020, Doval walked out after Yusuf projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries and included several Indian regions within Pakistan. At the time, Yusuf was special adviser to Pakistan’s prime minister on national security. He was formally appointed the NSA earlier this year. Yusuf said he would meet his counterparts from Russia, China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Dushanbe. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi have been in the same country at the same time twice in recent months, including the Heart of Asia conference on Afghanistan in Dushanbe in March, but did not hold a bilateral meeting. In April, Jaishankar and Qureshi had visited the United Arab Emirates at the same time. Following a series of back-channel contacts between Indian and Pakistani security officials, the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. The truce has largely held, helping to ease bilateral tensions, though recent reports have suggested the back-channel contacts have stalled. The SCO meet in Dushanbe will conclude a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned meeting with political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir on June 24 – the first such gathering since the government scrapped the region’s special status in August 2019. Pakistan has also issued several strong statements in recent weeks about what it claims were the Indian government’s plans to carry out more changes in Jammu and Kashmir. India has rejected these statements, noting that Kashmir is an integral part of the country and Pakistan’s comments amounted to interference in internal affairs. There was no official word on the possibility of a meeting between the Indian and Chinese NSAs at Dushanbe. The military standoff between the two countries at the Line of Actual Control has continued for more than a year despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks. The meeting of the NSAs of SCO states is expected to focus on the rapidly evolving security situation in Afghanistan ahead of the drawdown of US forces and cooperation under the Regional Anti-Terror Structure (RATS). Besides India, Pakistan and China, SCO includes Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-nsa-rules-out-meeting-with-indian-counterpart-on-margins-of-sco-meeting-101624201473588.html
20-06-2021||World||Covid vaccinations in China cross 1bn mark||More than one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered across China by the weekend, making it a major milestone for a country that continues to roll out the world’s largest inoculation drive against the deadly disease.China’s vaccination programme has picked up speed in recent months as it tries to protect itself from new variants of the infection coming from abroad.The country’s national health commission (NHC) announced the milestone on Sunday, saying the last 100 million doses were given in just five days. The NHC, however, did not say how many people had been fully vaccinated, with most of the vaccines given in two doses.“China accelerated its pace of free Covid-19 vaccinations for the whole nation since late March. It took China 25 days to climb from 100 million doses to 200 million doses, 16 days to increase from 200 million to 300 million, and six days from 800 million to 900 million,” Xinhua news agency reported, quoting updates from the NHC.China’s state media called the government’s effort the largest “vaccination drive in the history of New China”, referring to the start of the Communist Party of China’s governance in 1949.Globally, more than 2.59 billion doses have been administered across 180 countries, according to data collected by Bloomberg. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry had said that more than 200,000 foreigners in the country have been vaccinated.At least 70% of the target population in China is expected to be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of this year, said Zeng Yixin, deputy head of the NHC. The large-scale vaccination campaign carried out across China has also shown that Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccines are safe, Zeng claimed. A total of 21 Covid-19 vaccines entered clinical trials in China since last year.“So far, four vaccines have been granted conditional marketing approval and three have been authorised for emergency use within the country,” the Xinhua report said. Chinese regulators haven’t approved any non-Chinese vaccines so far.Also, China has given vaccine aid to nearly 90 countries and four international organisations besides exporting jabs to at least 40 countries. China has already provided more than 350 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccines overseas, according to Mao Junfeng, an official from the industry and IT ministry had said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccinations-in-china-cross-1bn-mark-101624193913785.html
20-06-2021||World||Australia accused of becoming one of world’s most secretive democracies||Australia’s suppression of information seen as pivotal to a free and open media is at the center of accusations that the country has become one of the world’s most secretive democracies.Last week, a former Australian spy was convicted over his unconfirmed role as a whistleblower who revealed an espionage operation against the government of East Timor.It’s the latest high-profile case in a national system in which secrecy laws, some dating back to the colonial era, are routinely used to suppress information. Police have also threatened to charge journalists who exposed war crime allegations against Australian special forces in Afghanistan, or bureaucrats’ plan to allow an intelligence agency to spy on Australian citizens.Australians don’t even know the name of the former spy convicted Friday. The Canberra court registry listed him as “Witness K.” His lawyer referred to him more respectfully as “Mr. K” in court.K spent the two-day hearing in a box constructed from black screens to hide his identity. The public and media were sent out of the courtroom when classified evidence was discussed, which was about half the time.The only sign that anyone was actually inside the box was when a voice said “guilty” after K was asked how he pleaded.The Australian government has refused to comment on allegations that K led an Australian Secret Intelligence Service operation that bugged government offices in the East Timorese capital in 2004, during negotiations on the sharing of oil and gas revenue from the seabed that separates the two countries.The government canceled K’s passport before he was to testify at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2014 in support of the East Timorese, who argued the treaty was invalid because Australia failed to negotiate in good faith by engaging in espionage.There was no evidence heard in open court of a bugging operation, which media reported was conducted under the guise of a foreign aid program.K was given a three-month suspended sentence. If he’d been sent to prison, there were court orders designed to conceal his former espionage career by restricting what he could tell friends and associates to explain his predicament.He had faced up to two years in prison. Since his offense, Australia has continued to tighten controls on secrecy, increasing the maximum sentence to 10 years.As lacking in transparency as K’s prosecution was, it was a vast improvement on Australia’s treatment of another rogue intelligence officer known as Witness J.J has been described by the media as possibly the only person in Australian history to be tried, sentenced and imprisoned in secret. But no one seems to know for sure.As with K, it is illegal to reveal J’s identity.J pleaded guilty in a closed courtroom in the same Canberra court complex in 2018 to charges related to mishandling classified information and potentially revealing the identities of Australian agents. He spent 15 months in prison.The secret court hearing and imprisonment only became public in late 2019 because J took court action against the Australian Capital Territory government, claiming his human rights were violated by police who raided his prison cell in search of a memoir he was writing.Outraged lawyers then called for the first major review of the nation’s secrecy laws since 2010. Whistleblowers as well as journalists currently are under threat from more than 70 counterterrorism and security laws passed by Parliament since the 9/11 attacks in the U.S.Andrew Wilkie, a former government intelligence analyst whistleblower who’s now an independent federal lawmaker, is a vocal critic of national security being used as an excuse to pander to paranoia and shield embarrassment.Wilkie opposed the prosecution of K and his former lawyer Bernard Collaery. Collaery is fighting a charge that he conspired with K to reveal secrets to East Timor, and wants his trial to be open.“I am in no doubt that one of the reasons for the secrecy around the K and Collaery matter is the enormous political embarrassment that we were spying on one of the poorest countries in the world to get an upper hand in a business negotiation,” Wilkie said.Wilkie quit his intelligence job in the Office of National Assessments days before Australian troops joined U.S. and British forces in the 2003 Iraq invasion. He publicly argued that Iraq didn’t pose sufficient threat to warrant invasion and that there was no evidence linking Iraq’s government to al-Qaida.“I basically accused the government of lying,” Wilkie said.Although the government attempted to discredit him, Wilkie said he was never threatened with prosecution for revealing classified information.For many, Australian authorities took a step too far in June 2019 in their bid to chase down whistleblowers, intimidate journalists and protect government secrets.Police raided the home of News Corp. journalist Annika Smethurst, and the next day the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Both media outlets had used leaked government documents as the basis of public interest journalism.The search warrants were issued under Section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which prohibited a government employee from sharing information without a supervisor’s permission.That section has since been replaced under national security legislation that expanded the crime to include a government employee sharing opinions or reporting conversations between others.Media law experts Johan Lidberg and Denis Muller said Australia is the only country within the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance – which includes the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand – that gives its security agencies the power to issue search warrants against journalists in the hunt for public interest whistleblowers in the name of national security.Police decided in May last year that they had insufficient evidence to charge Smethurst, the journalist, over an article published in April 2018. She had reported that two government department bosses planned to create new espionage powers that would allow an intelligence agency to legally spy on Australian citizens.Prosecutors also decided in October last year that the “public interest does not require a prosecution” of ABC reporter Dan Oakes over a television investigation broadcast in July 2017 that alleged Australian troops killed unarmed men and children in Afghanistan in potential war crimes.But David McBride, a former Australian army lawyer who admits leaking classified documents to the ABC, is fighting multiple charges. He calculates he faces up to 50 years in prison for being a whistleblower.There have been two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom since the police raids, but progress toward change has been criticized as slow and weak.The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which has rubber-stamped many of the problem security laws, said many submissions for change warned that "the balance in legislation and culture within the Australian government has tipped away from transparency and engagement to excessive and unnecessary secrecy.”A Senate committee inquiry into press freedom last month made several recommendations, mostly for more government investigation. The committee asked whether secret information offenses should be amended to include a harm requirement, and whether journalists should still have to prove that an unauthorized disclosure was in the public interest.Wilkie, the lawmaker, argues Australia has drifted into becoming a “pre-police state” through its embrace of secrecy.“It’s now unremarkable when a government cloaks something in a national security need for secrecy,” Wilkie said. “We don’t bat an eyelid anymore. We should be outraged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-accused-of-becoming-one-of-world-s-most-secretive-democracies-101624191153930.html
20-06-2021||World||Nuclear talks to be adjourned for consultations in capitals, says Iran||Negotiators for Iran and six world powers will on Sunday adjourn talks on reviving their 2015 nuclear deal and return to respective capitals for consultations as remaining differences cannot be easily overcome, Tehran's delegation chief said."We are now closer than ever to an agreement but the distance that exists between us and an agreement remains and bridging it is not an easy job," Abbas Araqchi told Iranian state TV from Vienna. "We will return to Tehran tonight."Parties to the pact were holding a formal meeting in Vienna on Sunday from 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), the European Union said on Saturday.A hardliner, Ebrahim Raisi, won Iran's presidential election on Friday and will take office in early August, replacing pragmatist Hassan Rouhani. But this is unlikely to disrupt Iran's effort under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all major policy, to restore the nuclear pact and be rid of tough US oil and financial sanctions.Negotiations have been going on in Vienna since April to work out the nature and sequencing of steps Iran and the United States must take on nuclear activities and sanctions to return to full compliance with the nuclear pact.Washington under then-President Donald Trump left the deal in 2018, branding it too flawed to remove the risk of Iran developing nuclear weapons capability, and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Iran has since breached the deal's strict limits on uranium enrichment. It has said its moves would be reversed if the United States rescinded all sanctions."Bridging the gaps requires decisions that mainly the other party (Washington) has to take. I hope in the next round we will travel this short distance albeit a difficult one," Araqchi said.Israel: Don't Negotiate With 'Brutal' New GovernmentThe Islamic Republic's arch-enemy, Israel, on Sunday condemned Raisi's election. New Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said it would be a "regime of brutal hangmen" with which world powers should not negotiate a new nuclear accord."(His) election is, I would say, the last chance for world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement, and understand who they are doing business with," Bennett said in a statement.Raisi has never publicly addressed allegations around his role in what the United States and human rights groups have called the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.Bennett, a nationalist atop a cross-partisan coalition, has hewed to the opposition of conservative predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu to the nuclear deal, whose caps on projects with atomic bomb-making potential Israel deemed too lax.Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons.Credit For A DealRaisi, like Khamenei, has supported the nuclear talks as a route to cancelling US sanctions that have laid waste to the Islamic Republic's oil-based economy and dramatically worsened economic hardships, stirring widespread discontent.The new government will hope to claim credit for any economic benefits arising from the revival of the accord, something the outgoing administration might clinch before Raisi takes office."If the deal is finalised when Rouhani is (still) president, Raisi cannot be criticised by hardline supporters for giving concessions to the West," a government official who is close to the talks told Reuters. "Also Rouhani, not Raisi, will be blamed for any future problems regarding the deal."Several Iranian officials told Reuters that the country's current negotiating team would remain intact at least for a few months under Raisi's presidency."Who Raisi picks as his foreign minister will reveal the new government's foreign policy approach," said another official. "But the establishment's nuclear policy is not decided by the government" but by Khamenei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-talks-to-be-adjourned-for-consultations-in-capitals-says-iran-101624190322090.html

The United Kingdom is witnessing another surge in infections, which many deem as the country's third Covid wave, and, according to Public Health England, the Delta variant accounts for 99% of the total active cases.The UK government has been targeting to vaccinate the maximum number of individuals in the shortest possible time to avoid another wave. A senior Public Health England (PHE) said that it should be possible for 70 per cent of the adult population to receive both doses of the Covid vaccine before July 19, the date of the final stage of lockdown lifting.“We are definitely seeing some signs of slowing down…We are seeing rises and falls as people really go out and get tested and I think we are seeing the impact of vaccination and that is good news,” Dr Susan Hopkins, strategy director for Covid-19 at PHE, told the BBC.Also Read | Third wave of Covid-19 arrives in UK, says expert as Delta variant wreaks havocWhile the government officials have emphasised the need for maximum vaccination coverage among adults to avoid another deadly Covid wave, virologist Julian Tang, of Leicester University, has reportedly sounded a note of caution. Recent data on Covid-19 indicates that people under-30s, who have not been extensively vaccinated, were the ones largely infected by the virus and Tang suggested that the vaccination programme would drive the virus into under-18s, reported The Observer.“As a result, the virus will concentrate in school-age populations, which will eventually become a reservoir and driver of any ensuing Delta variant epidemic, as well as being a hotspot in which new mutations may arise,” the British weekly quoted Tang as saying.Such developments could pressurise the government to administer Covid vaccines to children and teenagers, a move strongly criticised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Global health leaders have discouraged the vaccination of children at this stage when all healthcare workers and high-risk individuals in low and lower-middle-income countries are yet to be inoculated against Covid-19. In May, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had criticised the move by rich countries to vaccinate lower risk groups, calling it a “moral catastrophe.”“In January, I spoke about the potential unfolding of a moral catastrophe. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing this play out,” the WHO chief told a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under18s-could-be-delta-variant-driver-uk-virologist-on-vaccination-program-101624187769456.html
20-06-2021||World||‘Scale up, implement measures rigorously to prevent another Covid surge’: WHO||As more countries confirmed the prevalence of highly transmissible variants of Covid-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Sunday issued an advisory for countries in the South-East Asia region to scale up and rigorously implement public health and social measures, along with efforts to accelerate vaccination for the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), to prevent another surge.“We need to continuously strengthen our efforts to test, trace and isolate. Societal interventions such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and proper wearing of masks need to be stringently implemented. These measures should be in full force and for longer periods in areas reporting more transmissible variants of concerns,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia.Earlier this week, Maldives and Myanmar confirmed transmission of ‘variants of concern’ that have already been confirmed in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste so far.The ‘variants of concern’, along with the opening of economies and societies, contributed to the recent surge in cases globally.The public health and social measures are a wide range of nonpharmaceutical interventions, both individual and societal, and are cost-effective measures to reduce the spread of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and save lives.In addition to personal protective measures, they include cleaning, disinfection, ventilation, surveillance, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, according to the UN body.Physical distancing measures, such as limiting the size of gatherings, maintaining distance in public or workplaces, domestic movement restrictions; and international travel-related measures, should also be adhered to.“These measures are critical for preventing infections, reducing transmission and saving lives,” she said, adding that even as countries scale up vaccination against Covid-19, they would need to implement public health and social measures in a tailored and agile way.According to the UN body, a risk-based approach is needed for public health and social measures that should be implemented by the lowest administrative level and continuously adjusted to the intensity of transmission and the capacity of health systems.“The risk assessment should measure both the actual ability to deliver services and the performance of those services… Where more transmissible ‘variants of concern’ are spreading, these measures need to be applied more stringently and for longer periods,” said the regional director.“We must not forget that the pandemic is still around. We must guard against complacency, at any level. We must continue to implement combinations of public health and social measures until globally there is high Covid-19 vaccine coverage among health workers, and high-risk and vulnerable groups,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scale-up-implement-measures-rigorously-to-prevent-another-covid-surge-who-101624184013395.html
20-06-2021||World||Taliban insists ‘genuine Islamic system’ only way to women rights. What does it mean?||The Taliban on Sunday insisted that a “genuine Islamic system” was the only way to end the decades-long war in Afghanistan and ensure women’s rights in line with cultural traditions and religious rules. Under the Taliban’s harsh version of Islamic law, girls were banned from school and women accused of crimes such as adultery were stoned to death in stadiums."We understand that the world and Afghans have queries and questions about the form of the system to be established following withdrawal of foreign troops," Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the head of the Taliban's political office, said in the statement."A genuine Islamic system is the best means for the solution of all issues of the Afghans," he added.The government officials have said that the hardline Islamic group is yet to submit a written peace proposal that could be used as a starting point for substantive peace talks. Amid slow progress on intra-Afghan negotiations in Qatar and withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, many fear that the Taliban’s interpretation of rights will clash with changes that have happened in the country since 2001.Also Read | ‘Ignorant or accomplice’: Afghan NSA hits out at Pak FM over ties with Taliban; Islamabad repliesWhile Baradar assured the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities, would be protected according to "the glorious religion of Islam" and Afghan traditions, it was not clear whether women would be allowed to carry out public roles and no gender-based segregation would be enforced at workplaces and schools."We take it on ourselves as a commitment to accommodate all rights of citizens of our country, whether they are male or female, in the light of the rules of the glorious religion of Islam and the noble traditions of the Afghan society," Baradar said, adding that 'facilities would be provided' for women to work and be educated.In May, a US intelligence report said if the Taliban were again Afghanistan’s dominant power, it “would roll back much” of the progress made on the women's rights front in the country. The report cautioned that though some Taliban officials publicly say that the group will respect women’s rights, they caveat that these protections must align with Taliban interpretations of sharia. According to the report, the Taliban “remains broadly consistent in its restrictive approach” to women’s rights and enforces strict social constraints in areas that it already controls.“Since the current peace process started in 2019, Taliban officials have issued statements opposing “alien-culture clothes worn by women” and have accused women’s rights advocates of promoting immorality, indecency, and non-Islamic culture,” the report highlighted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-insists-islamic-system-only-way-to-women-rights-what-does-it-mean-101624181875381.html
20-06-2021||World||Afghanistan violence: Pakistan defends Taliban, blames ISIS instead||As the Taliban resumes attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians, Pakistan extended support to the terrorist group, saying it would be an "exaggeration" to hold them responsible for violence in Afghanistan.Islamabad has been accused of aiding the Taliban and using them as proxies for its own benefit.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the Taliban for an increase in violence in Afghanistan and shifted the blame on Daesh, another word for ISIS (another word for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria).Talking to Tolo News in an exclusive interview at his office in Islamabad last week, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said, "If you try and create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration. Why do I say that? Aren't there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler?""Daesh. Like forces within Afghanistan - who came from the war economy. Who want to perpetuate their power, who are not seeing beyond their nose and just want to hang on to power."Qureshi rejected Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan and said most of their leaders "are in Afghanistan".Asked whether Taliban are "funded in Pakistan", Qureshi said: "These are very--those many things that have been going on for years. You're stuck in the old groove. Get of out that groove, please. Get out of that groove. Now, listen, if you remain stuck in this, believe me, you will not be able to travel far. And we want you to travel far. We want reconciliation and peace."Qureshi, seemingly skeptical about further progress in the peace process under the current circumstances, said President Ghani has "a very important responsibility on his shoulders" and he must "show the leadership and the flexibility" necessary to achieve progress in the peace process.Qureshi mentioned Doha as the best place for engaging in talks with the Taliban--even between the leaders of both sides--but said this will not happen unless there is willingness from both sides.According to Qureshi, the world's approach has changed as it does not hold the view that peace can be achieved through a military solution.In response to a question on what type of a government Pakistan would favour as an outcome of the peace process, Qureshi said it is a decision to be made by Afghans."That's for the people of Afghanistan to decide--who governs them and what kind of a political dispensation Afghanistan wants," he said. "What we're saying is you are all Afghans. Peace can only come to Afghanistan if you sit and reconcile. When you sit and reconcile, when you sit and talk, you will determine what kind of constitution we want, what kind of, you know, the system should be in place."When asked about the status of the Afghan peace process and progress in this respect, Qureshi said it should be asked of Afghans."The peace process has to come to its logical conclusion through an intra-Afghan negotiation. We're not sitting at the table with them. Wherever required, we've facilitated. We cannot decide for you. It's the Afghans that will sit and decide what they want," he said.Referring to Taliban leaders, he said, they're in Afghanistan and the Afghans "need to engage with them.""We're only engaging with them to facilitate the peace process. We're trying to be helpful. We're trying to be constructive."The minister said that violence has to go down and the process of peace and negotiations has to accelerate.In response to a question about whether the country is moving toward civil war, Qureshi said it depends on the Afghan leadership."It depends on you, depends on the Afghan leadership, depends on the ability of the Afghan leadership to carve a way forward. If you fail, if the Afghan leadership fail, then yes, we are heading for a civil war," he added.Reacting to Qureshi's remarks, Afghan National Security Adviser Hamadullah Mohib accused Islamabad of enabling a violent offensive by the terror group in Afghanistan.The Afghan NSA had tweeted that Qureshi's interview "comes as Taliban launches violent offensives against Afghan people across the country, we know how & why they continue to be enabled to do this. Quraishi is either uninformed, ignorant, or accomplice. Maybe he also rejects that, Osama was found next to Pakistani Military HQ."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-violence-pakistan-defends-taliban-blames-isis-instead-101624178949958.html
20-06-2021||World||With a hardline president in Iran, ties with Saudi may hinge on nuclear pact||Gulf Arab states are unlikely to be deterred from dialogue to improve ties with Iran after a hardline judge won the presidency but their talks with Tehran might become tougher, analysts said.Prospects for better relations between Muslim Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Gulf Arab monarchies could ultimately hinge on progress to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, they said, after Ebrahim Raisi won Friday's election.The Iranian judge and cleric, who is subject to US sanctions, takes office in August, while nuclear talks in Vienna under outgoing President Hassan Rouhani, a more pragmatic cleric, are ongoing.Saudi Arabia and Iran, longtime foes, began direct talks in April to contain tensions at the same time as global powers have been embroiled in nuclear negotiations."Iran has now sent a clear message that they are tilting to a more radical, more conservative position," said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a UAE political analyst, adding that Raisi's election might make improving Gulf ties a tougher challenge."Nevertheless, Iran is not in a position to become more radical ... because the region is becoming very difficult and very dangerous," he added.The United Arab Emirates, whose commercial hub Dubai has been a trade gateway for Iran, and Oman, which has often played a regional mediation role, were swift to congratulate Raisi.Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are the only Gulf states yet to comment."The faces may change but the leader is (Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei," columnist Khaled al-Suleiman wrote in Saudi newspaper Okaz.Raisi, an implacable critic of the West and an ally of Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran, has voiced support for continuing the nuclear negotiations."If the Vienna talks succeed and there is a better situation with America, then (with) hardliners in power, who are close to the supreme leader, the situation may improve," said Abdulaziz Sager, chairman of Gulf Research Center.LeverageA revived nuclear deal and the lifting of US sanctions on the Islamic Republic would boost Raisi, easing Iran's economic crisis and offering leverage in Gulf talks, said Jean-Marc Rickli, an analyst at Geneva Centre for Security Policy.Neither Iran nor Gulf Arabs want a return to tensions of 2019 which saw attacks on tankers in Gulf waters and on Saudi oil installations, then the 2020 US killing, under former President Donald Trump, of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.A perception that Washington was now disengaging militarily from the area under US President Joe Biden has prompted a more pragmatic Gulf approach, analysts said.Nevertheless, Biden has demanded Iran rein in its missile programme and end its support for proxies in the region including in Yemen, which are key demands of Gulf Arab nations."The Saudis have realised they can no longer rely on the Americans for their security ... and have seen that Iran has the means to really put pressure on the kingdom through direct attacks and also with the quagmire of Yemen," Rickli said.Saudi-Iran talks have focused mainly on Yemen, where a military campaign led by Riyadh against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement for over six years no longer has US backing.The UAE has maintained contacts with Tehran since 2019, while also forging ties with Israel, Iran's arch regional foe.Sanam Vakil, an analyst at Britain's Chatham House, wrote last week that regional conversations, particularly on maritime security, were expected to continue but "can only gain momentum if Tehran demonstrates meaningful goodwill".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-a-hardline-president-in-iran-ties-with-saudi-may-hinge-on-nuclear-pact-101624168561441.html

The new statue, being loaned by a Paris museum to cement Franco-American friendship, will be a scaled-down replica of the original and will first be displayed on Ellis Island, later moving on to Washinton DC, where it will stay for ten years, reported news agency Reuters earlier last week.France will send the U.S. a smaller replica of the Statue of Liberty to celebrate the two countries’ shared history on the liberty of the people pic.twitter.com/LkDjAMAIHYThe 'second' Statue of Liberty, as it is being called, is currently on its way from Paris to New York City, retracing the steps of its "big sister", a colossal neoclassical sculpture that now stands guard on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, within the New York City. The new statue is expected to arrive ahead of the Fourth of July, Independence Day in the United States.The new replica of the Statue of Liberty measures 2.83 meters (or 9.3 feet) in height. It was gently lifted off its plinth on the back of a crane by workers in Paris two weeks ago and situated on the back of a truck, covered with plastic film for protection and wedged in with foam blocks. It was then embarked upon a ship, its destination being the United States of America.The replica was designed in 1878 by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the same person who - with help from engineer Gustave Eiffel - created the larger version now in New York. The larger version of the Statue of Liberty was given by France to the United States as a gift, and was completed and assembled in 1886.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-second-statue-of-liberty-is-on-its-way-to-us-courtesy-of-france-101624166512227.html

Authorities said they detained a person who had two women, apparently kidnapped, in the trunk of his car, and said they seized three vehicles.Reynosa Mayor Maki Esther Ortiz Domínguez sent a tweet demanding the attack be clarified and that the citizenry be protected.The area's criminal activity has long been dominated by the Gulf Cartel, but there have been fractures within the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-15-dead-in-multiple-gun-attacks-near-us-mexico-border-report-101624166184185.html

It was earlier reported that Nepal had had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the makers of China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine in order to gain access to doses amid questions about the legality of such an undertaking.Also Read | Nepal signed non-disclosure agreement for Sinopharm jabs: ReportAlthough a non-disclosure agreement was reportedly in place, an article published by The Kathmandu Post revealed the price of the Sinopharm vaccine dose that China was selling to Nepal to help the Himalayan nation tackle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report mentioned that Nepal was purchasing four million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine at an estimated cost of $10 or around ₹741 per dose. Although the report acknowledged that the final price is yet to be confirmed given the nature of the agreement, it could be around $10 per dose.After the article was published, multiple Chinese officials visibly communicated their displeasure with Nepal, reported ANI. Sinopharm had communicated its displeasure at the publicisation of vaccine procurement by the government of Nepal, officials told The Kathmandu Post. The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu had also reminded Nepal's ministry of foreign affairs of the nature of the deal, according to the officials.Nepal's officials, too, expressed concern over the media report. "The way the media quoted the price of the vaccine and other logistical issues were concerning because these are very sensitive issues," Dr Krishna Prasad Paudel, spokesperson for the health ministry, was quoted as saying.The Kathmandu Post backed its reportage, citing confirmation from two ministers and two government secretaries who were present at the cabinet meeting where the decision to procure four million vaccines from China was taken.The development comes as an awkward snag in diplomatic relations between the countries. Nepal has been desperately looking for alternate sources of vaccines after India temporarily halted the export of jabs in late March to cope with a devastating second wave. It was only after China agreed to sell its Sinopharm vaccines that Kathmandu saw a way to vaccinate the million-odd people who received the first dose of Covishield and were waiting for their second dose after the passage of more than two months. However, China's condition was that the imposition of a non-disclosure agreement, an unusual predicament for Nepal as the country's laws don’t have a provision for non-disclosure agreements in public procurement, according to reports.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fumes-after-nepal-s-media-exposes-sinopharm-vaccine-procurement-price-101624161782822.html

Wilton Manors is just north of Fort Lauderdale.One of the victims later succumbed to their injuries, Trantalis said.News outlets reported that the driver of the pickup truck was taken into custody. Authorities did not immediately give details about the victims or say whether they believe the crash was intentional.“This is a terrorist attack against the LGBT community,” Trantalis told reporters. “This is exactly what it is. Hardly an accident.”Photos and video from the scene showed Democratic US Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in tears while in a convertible at the parade. A spokesperson for Wasserman Schultz did not immediately return an email seeking comment.Spectator Christina Currie told the South Florida SunSentinel that she was with her family at the start of the parade.“All of a sudden there was a loud revving of a truck and a crash through a fence,” Currie said. "It was definitely an intentional act right across the lanes of traffic.”Wilton Manors police tweeted Saturday night that the public is not in danger.“A tragic incident occurred at today’s Stonewall event," Wilton Manors Mayor Scott Newton said in a statement, according to WPLG-TV. "Out of respect for everyone involved, the parade has been canceled and a thorough investigation is being conducted.”June is Pride Month, commemorating the June 1969 police raid targeting gay patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York that led to an uprising of LGBTQ Americans and served as a catalyst for the gay rights movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truck-driver-crashes-into-south-florida-pride-parade-mayor-says-1-killed-101624155290712.html

20-06-2021||World||French far-right tests voters' appetite in regional elections||French voters go to the polls on Sunday in regional elections that will test the appeal of far-right leader Marine Le Pen's softened image less than a year before the next presidential election.Coming after a gruelling year and a half of lockdowns, curfews and restrictions, Sunday's first round is likely to prove dire for President Emmanuel Macron, whose party is projected to win none of mainland France's 13 regions.Boosted by a resurgence of law-and-order issues during the campaign, despite the fact French regions have no police powers, Le Pen is hoping to capitalise on a rebrand that has seen her ditch promises of "Frexit" and inflammatory rhetoric."She appears less extreme in the eyes of the French, less dangerous for democracy, than she did a decade ago," Brice Teinturier, an analyst with pollster IPSOS told Reuters.Her best chance is in the south of France, the region around Marseille and Nice, where one of her lieutenants, a former conservative minister, is projected by one opinion poll as winning the race even if all parties rally against him.Gaining one region, for the first time ever, would give Le Pen a major boost less than a year before presidential elections, and would be a slap in the face for Macron, who has painted himself as a bulwark against the far-right.The far-right is also likely to do well in two other regions, around Calais in the north and in Burgundy, helped by low turnout in a country whose attention is shifting to summer holidays to forget the pandemic.In the deindustrialised north, the incumbent and frontrunner to become the conservatives' candidate in the presidential election, Xavier Bertrand, is facing Le Pen's party spokesman and Macron's justice minister.Whether Macron's party reaches the 10% threshold will determine if it can force Bertrand into an alliance to defeat the far-right, which would undermine his pitch as Macron's opponent-in-chief in 2022.However, a win for Bertrand would bolster his chances of becoming the conservatives' presidential candidate. Macron aides see the one-time health minister as a rival who would erode the president's centre-right voting base.Results of Sunday's first round will send parties into frantic backroom dealing for two days to strike alliances ahead of June 27's final round.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-far-right-tests-voters-appetite-in-regional-elections-101624151511488.html

Much of the future of renewed US-North Korea relations will depend on how president Joe Biden decides to walk the path of diplomacy. While several experts have suggested Biden is more likely to take the middle ground between his predecessor's direct aggression and Barack Obama's "strategic patience", others think the United States will not even consider any meaningful relief to sanctions against North Korea unless Kim Jong Un takes concrete denuclearisation steps first.Also Read | ‘Even North Korea is not this nuts’: Defector after graduating from American universityBiden's special representative for North Korea, Sung Kim, arrived in South Korea on Saturday to continue talks over the United States' stalled nuclear diplomacy with the North, reported the Associated Press.

Raisi is seen as close to 81-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate political power in Iran.Many voters chose to stay away after the field of some 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, had been winnowed down to seven candidates, all men, excluding an ex-president and a former parliament speaker.Three of the vetted candidates dropped out two days before Friday's vote.On the Iran nuclear accord, the State Department spokesperson said indirect talks in Vienna between the US and Iran had made "meaningful progress" and that Washington wanted to build on this."We will continue discussions along with our allies and partners on a mutual return to compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action," the spokesperson said.The discussions in Vienna, brokered by European diplomats, have been locked in dispute on which sanctions imposed on Iran would be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-regrets-iranians-denied-free-and-fair-electoral-process-in-raisi-win-101624147352095.html
20-06-2021||World||Joe Biden goes to church a day after challenge from bishops on abortion||President Joe Biden went to church Saturday in his hometown a day after US Roman Catholic bishops issued a challenge to him over his support for abortion rights.Biden and first lady Jill Biden spent time at St. Joseph on the Brandywine church in Wilmington. They also visited the church graveyard where the president's first wife Neilia, son Beau and infant daughter Naomi are buried.Biden, 78, is a devout Catholic who attends mass at least once a week, and he supports the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision affirming a woman's right to an abortion.On Friday US bishops agreed to draft a statement on the meaning of holy communion which could potentially be used to deny that sacrament to the American leader.The eucharist, also known as holy communion, is among the most sacred rituals in the Catholic Church and there have been calls from some conservative church leaders to deny the sacrament to politicians who support abortion rights.Biden on Friday seemed to dismiss the possibility that he could be denied communion."That's a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen," he told reporters.It is up to each local bishop to decide who receives communion in their diocese.In 2019, a priest at a Catholic church in South Carolina refused holy communion to Biden because of his stance on abortion.The Catholic News Service reported in May that the Vatican had warned US bishops to proceed cautiously with policies designed "to address the situation of Catholics in public office who support legislation allowing abortion, euthanasia or other moral evils."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-goes-to-church-a-day-after-challenge-from-bishops-on-abortion-101624146078477.html

Pharmaceutical maker Pfizer said it got no response to offers to sell vaccines to the government between August and November last year."We are protesting against the genocidal Bolsonaro government that did not buy vaccines and has done nothing to take care of its people in the last year," said 36-year-old Aline Rabelo, while protesting on the national mall in Brasilia.Bolsonaro's press office did not respond to request for comment. Only 11% of Brazilians are fully vaccinated and 29% have received a first dose, Health Ministry data shows.Brazilian media reported that protests had been held in all 26 states as well as the capital Brasilia.Many demonstrators called the 500,000 dead a form of genocide carried out by the government on the Brazilian people. They chanted, beat drums and held up signs demanding Bolsonaro be removed for office."Half a million reasons to oust Bolsonaro," read one protestor's sign in downtown Sao Paulo.While organizers promised the largest demonstrations yet in more than 300 cities, gatherings in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia on Saturday morning did not appear to be larger than the last major protests on May 29.Protests in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and financial center, blocked major downtown thoroughfares, where protesters unfurled a banner the size of a city block demanding "Life, Bread, Vaccines and Education." It was unclear how the crowd compared to May 29 protest there.A special Senate committee is probing the Bolsonaro administration's pandemic response, highlighting delayed efforts to acquire vaccines while prioritizing unproven treatments for Covid-19.Last month, a poll showed Bolsonaro's popularity has sunk to new lows with only 24% of Brazilians saying his administration is "good" or "great." The same poll showed Bolsonaro's left wing rival, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, would win in a run-off vote if the 2022 elections were held today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilians-protest-bolsonaro-s-role-in-half-a-million-covid-19-deaths-101624145429447.html
20-06-2021||World||UK's Sunak considers cap to annual pension rise: Report||British finance minister Rishi Sunak is considering blocking a near 6% rise in old-age pension payments as part of a wider effort to rein in the cost of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spending, the Sunday Times newspaper said.Under a pension promise in the Conservative Party's 2019 election campaign, state pensions are meant to rise each year by the highest of the annual inflation rate, wage growth or 2.5%.Due partly to distortions from the coronavirus pandemic, annual wages in the three months to April grew by an annual 5.6% - creating an extra 4 billion pound ($5.5 billion) annual cost for future pensions.The Sunday Times said the finance ministry wanted to break the link between pensions and wages for a year."Pensioners are going to be doing extremely well. It's not politically that difficult a thing to smooth it out for a year," the newspaper quoted an unnamed minister as saying.The Sunday Times said Sunak was worried too about a potential 5 billion pound annual cost for a plan on social care for the elderly due to be discussed later this week, plus extra for a new government yacht to promote British exports.An unnamed official was quoted as describing funding for the yacht as "a complete and utter shitshow".Asked about the report, a British government spokesperson said: "The Prime Minister and Chancellor work closely together, and have been in lockstep throughout the most challenging period any government has faced since the Second World War.""We always ensure that all government spending provides value for money for the taxpayer."Sunak said in a television interview on Wednesday that pensions would be reviewed later in the year.Britain's government borrowed 300 billion pounds last year - equivalent to 14% of gross domestic product and the most since World War Two.Sunak has repeatedly said he wants to put the public finances in a more sustainable position when the economy recovers, due to concerns about higher interest rates.The Sunday Times said Sunak opposed raising capital gains tax. The government has already promised not to raise the main rates of income tax, national insurance or value-added tax, limiting its ability to boost revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-sunak-considers-cap-to-annual-pension-rise-report-101624145451676.html

The soaring case count has caused alarm among officials, who have increased measures to obstruct the spread.Moscow, its outlying area and two other Russian regions this week ordered mandatory vaccinations for workers in retail, education and other service sectors. Moscow has closed food courts in shopping centers and restricted restaurants and bars in the capital to takeout orders from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.Russians are widely resistant to vaccinations and only about 12% of the population has received a shot. Nearly 5.3 million cases have been reported in the country of 146 million, with 128,911 deaths, but experts consider both numbers undercounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-batters-russia-as-daily-cases-soar-moscow-hard-hit-101624129863246.html

20-06-2021||World||On new 'Juneteenth' national holiday, US marks slavery's end||With marches, music and speeches, Americans on Saturday celebrated "Juneteenth", the newly declared national holiday that marks the end of slavery and which comes a year after George Floyd's murder sparked anti-racism protests.Hundreds of events were planned across the country, from New York to Los Angeles, and most notably in Galveston, Texas, the symbolic heart of the Juneteenth commemoration.For on June 19, 1865, it was in that Texas coastal area that the Union army -- victorious after the bitterly fought Civil War -- announced to African Americans that, even if some in Texas were trying to ignore it, enslaved people were now free.Slavery was formally abolished in December 1865, with the adoption of the 13th amendment to the US Constitution, but Juneteenth has remained the emblematic date marking the freeing of enslaved Americans.This year's Juneteenth celebrations will be all the more celebratory, coming just days after President Joe Biden signed legislation making it a national holiday, and also at a time when pandemic-imposed restrictions on public gatherings are steadily being eased."It was a long time coming," said 68-year-old Cheryl Green. She was attending the unveiling in Brooklyn of a bust of George Floyd, the Black man killed by a white policeman in Minneapolis in May 2020."It's good that people get to recognize what happened," said Green, an African-American resident of the Flatbush neighborhood. "Changes are being made slowly, but surely we'll get there."Floyd's killing touched off a sweeping protest movement, in the United States and around the globe, against racism and police violence toward minorities.That movement helped boost the visibility of Juneteenth -- a date that many Americans, including many African-Americans, had not heard of even two years ago.An opinion survey published Tuesday by the Gallup institute found that 28 percent of Americans knew "nothing at all" about the anniversary."I didn't learn about Juneteenth until I got to high school," said Farah Louis, a Black city official in New York, who was attending the Floyd unveiling in Brooklyn.She said Juneteenth should be used to "educate our young people" about the daunting conditions facing Black people through American history.- 'While the iron is hot' -Celebrating Juneteenth now seems "a bit surreal" at a time legislators in many Republican-led states are passing laws that will suppress the vote and "most acutely affect communities of color," tweeted Sharif Street, a Black state legislator from Pennsylvania.From January through May, 14 states, notably Georgia and Florida, passed laws limiting opportunities to vote -- measures seen as aimed at reducing the influence of minority voters, particularly African-Americans.To Sharif Street, it is "a reminder that our wins are not permanent, even with powerful symbols of progress," like the right to vote.Draft legislation to guarantee wider access to the vote is currently being debated in the US Senate, but with many Republicans opposing it, its fate appears uncertain.To Farah Louis, the proclamation of Juneteenth as a national holiday, coupled with the impetus created by the George Floyd movement, offer "an opportunity" for the Black community."You have to strike while the iron is hot," she said, citing among other issues the idea of government-paid reparations to compensate the descendants of enslaved people.On Friday, the mayors of 11 American cities, including Los Angeles and Denver, vowed to pursue the question of how best to carry out reparations. They invited the Congress and the US government to follow their example."We see change" in the country, said Terrence Floyd at the unveiling of the bust honoring his brother.Terrence Floyd, who lives in New York, recently created a group called "We Are Floyd" to help "keep the change going," he told AFP."Because right now, it's not a moment. It's a movement.tu/bbk/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-new-juneteenth-national-holiday-us-marks-slavery-s-end-101624127867534.html

He is committed to the regime's nuclear ambitions and to its campaign of global terror," Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on Twitter.A separate statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry said Raisi's election should "prompt grave concern among the international community."Israel's new government, sworn in on Sunday, has said it would object to the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and its arch-foe, Iran.Israel sees a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat. Tehran denies seeking nuclear weapons.Toeing the policy line set by the administration of Israel's former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the foreign ministry said: "More than ever, Iran’s nuclear program must be halted immediately, rolled back entirely and stopped indefinitely.""Iran’s ballistic missile program must be dismantled and its global terror campaign vigorously countered by a broad international coalition."Raisi, a hardline judge who is under US sanctions for human rights abuses, secured victory as expected on Saturday in Iran's presidential election after a contest marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and political restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-ebrahim-raisi-extreme-committed-to-nuclear-programme-says-israel-101624127215638.html
