Trump’s Facebook account will remain suspended till January 7, 2023. Facebook had also suspended Trump’s Instagram account then. “Facebook’s ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election,” Trump said in a statement repeating false claims the election was rigged. “They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our country can’t take this abuse anymore!”Announcing the decision, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs Nick Clegg said, “Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr Trump’s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols. We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.” Twitter, the other social media platform that Trump had used to great effect in projecting himself and his views, has terminated his account permanently.Facebook’s oversight board, comprised of outside legal experts picked by the social media platform, had upheld the suspension of Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts but had criticised the open-ended nature of the punitive action saying, “it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standard-less penalty of indefinite suspension”.A mob of Trump supporters had invaded the US Capitol on January 6 to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s election. Then vice-president Mike Pence, who was presiding over the session, had to flee to safety with lawmakers and returned after the complex was rid of the rioters and completed the certification process.Trump was impeached for inciting the insurrection making him the only American president impeached twice; the first time was in 2019.After January 2023, Facebook will ask experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded. “We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest,” Clegg said, adding, “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.”Shut out by Facebook and Twitter, Trump has used his email to issue tweet-length press statements, sometimes many times a day, just as he would have been posting on the social media platforms, multiple times a day. But his reach remains severely curtailed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-extends-trump-ban-till-jan-7-2023-101622829679419.html
04-06-2021||World||US adds over half-million jobs in May, Biden claims 'historic progress'||The United States added over half a million jobs in the month of May, a new report by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics stated on Friday, adding fuel to President Joe Biden's claims of a "historic progress" in job gains amid a ramped up vaccination campaign against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and hopes of post-pandemic economic recovery. “This is historic progress,” the New York Times quoted US President Joe Biden as saying, “Progress that’s pulling our economy out of the worst crisis it’s been in 100 years.”Also Read: UN says Covid-19 pandemic created an 'unparalleled' employment crisisThe employment report published by the US labour department showed that 559,000 jobs were added by American employers in May, which is twice that of April. Although employment is still far below pre-pandemic levels, data shows that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8% from the earlier 6.1% while online job postings, too, shot up 27% at the end of May from their level in February last year. The number of people who have been out of work for at least six months is also falling — the report shows that the number has dropped to 3.8 million, approximately 40% of the total.President Joe Biden took the opportunity to claim credit for what he calls "historic progress" in job gains, accounting for the success of his vaccination campaign and $1.9 trillion economic aid deployed in March. "None of this success is an accident, it isn't," Biden was quoted as saying. He lauded the American people for responding to Covid-19 related protocols and calls for vaccination. The "American rescue plan", he said, also played a major role in this success.Also Read: One in three US workers changed or lost jobs in past yearThe employment report, however, contains some less encouraging bits which have become cannon fodder for Republicans looking to train their guns on the Democratic regime. Even though job growth has seen some uneven patches over the past couple of months, the labour force participation rate has steadily caved in, which shows that several workers who dropped out of the workforce during the pandemic have still not returned.It also showed that although Americans across all race and gender were gradually gaining their jobs back, Black and Hispanic women especially found themselves lagging in these areas. Employment of Black women went on a 7% decline since February 2020, while that of Hispanic women was down 7.2%.With the US labour force participation rate falling to 61.6%, Republicans blamed Biden's aid package, alleging that lucrative unemployment benefits -- $300-per-week supplemental package -- are actually "discouraging" workers from returning to their jobs. Debunking these allegations, though, White House economists have said that there's currently no sufficient evidence to suggest that the supplement was discouraging workers from seeking back employment. This phenomenon, they said, could also be accounted to factors like school closures or child care issues which, for example, could theoretically have kept women with children from returning to work, but reiterated that further studies are needed to ascertain the legitimate causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-over-half-million-jobs-in-may-biden-claims-historic-progress-101622825371027.html
04-06-2021||World||US Senate Republicans reject Biden infrastructure plan, prep new offer||Senate Republicans on Friday panned President Joe Biden's latest infrastructure proposal and are expected to make a new offer as talks grind toward next week's deadline for progress on a bipartisan deal.Speaking after the release of a modest May jobs report, Biden made the case for his robust investment package to push the economy past the Covid-19 crisis and downturn, and into a new era.“Now is the time to build on the progress we’ve made,” Biden told reporters from Rehoboth Beach, Maryland. “We need to make those investments today to continue to succeed tomorrow."Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has indicated that Biden will look to act without Republican support if there is no consensus when Congress returns from its Memorial Day break.While Biden and the GOP senators have narrowed the price gap between his initial $2.3 trillion proposal and the GOP's $568 billion opening bid, they remain far apart on how to pay for what could be a compromise $1 trillion investment.Republicans are showing no interest in Biden's latest proposal for a 15% corporate minimum tax rate that would ensure all companies pay something in taxes, rather than allowing so many write-offs or deductions that they contribute zero to the treasury.A Republican familiar with the talks and granted anonymity to discuss the private assessment said the GOP senators view Biden's latest idea as an unnecessary tax hike.Instead, Republicans led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, are poised to submit a revised offer when she talks with Biden again Friday, the person said. They will insist on using untapped Covid-19 relief funds to pay for the infrastructure investments, the Republican said. Biden's team has rejected that approach.Still, neither Biden nor the GOP senators appear ready to call off talks, even as Democrats lay the groundwork to use budget rules to pass any big package on their own, without Republican votes.On Friday, House Democrats released a plan for spending $547 billion over the next five years on road, mass transit and rail projects, a blueprint of their priorities and a potential building block for Biden's broader package.The proposal from Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, continues existing programs set to expire and adds key pieces of the larger measure Biden is negotiating with Republicans.DeFazio’s legislation, a reauthorization of surface transportation programs set to expire Sept. 30, doesn’t address how to pay for the projects. He called the effort a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to move our transportation planning out of the 1950s and toward our clean energy future.”In addition to Biden's proposed a 15% minimum tax on corporations — there's no minimum tax now on corporate profits — he envisions additional revenues from increased IRS enforcement. He is seeking roughly $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending. Senate Republicans have countered with only $257 billion in additional spending.The House bill would authorize up to $343 billion for roads, bridges and safety improvements. Another $109 billion would go to public transit programs and $95 billion would go to freight and passenger rail system, including a tripling of funding for Amtrak.DeFazio’s bill is not expected to attract much GOP support, as Republicans unveiled their own legislation recently that would authorize about $400 billion over five years for road, bridge and transit programs.Republicans on the House panel panned the bill in a statement. “Instead of working with Republicans to find common ground on a bill that could earn strong bipartisan support – something our Senate counterparts did successfully last month – this bill moves even further to the left to appease the most progressive members in the Majority’s party."A Senate panel recently passed its version of the highway bill unanimously, but the lawmakers didn’t have to vote yet on how they would pay for it, a focal point of negotiations between GOP senators and the White House.Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have called on lawmakers to continue negotiations and work toward a bipartisan compromise.But some Democrats have questioned the merits of that approach and are already unhappy with some of the compromises that Biden has offered. They support using a process that would allow Democrats to pass an infrastructure boost with a simple majority, which they did through a Covid-19 relief measure that delivered $1,400 payments to most Americans.“Getting Republicans on board is not necessary. Getting the American people back on their feet is,” Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-republicans-reject-biden-infrastructure-plan-prep-new-offer-101622827415022.html

The community shares strong cultural and family bonds with India.The Opposition parties have filed a petition against Oli's move to dissolve the House in the Supreme Court.Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the 275-member House of Representatives on May 22 for the second time in five months and announced snap elections on November 12 and November 19 on the advice of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, heading a minority government.As many as 146 members of the dissolved House, including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who had staked a claim to form the new government under Article 76 (5) of the Constitution, have also filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement of the House.President Bhandari rejected the separate bids of both Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a new government, saying the “claims were insufficient.”Earlier on December 20, the president dissolved Parliament and called snap polls on April 30 and May 10. However, two months later, Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana-led Constitutional Bench on February 23 overturned the decision and reinstated the House of Representatives.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20, last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.

But it has also been criticized by those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates, who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.Trump's suspension was the first time Facebook had blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-suspends-donald-trump-s-account-for-two-years-101622825952153.html
04-06-2021||World||India likely to get largest share of US vaccines||India is expected to get possibly the largest share of the 25 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that the United States announced it will send to partner countries and those dealing with ongoing surges. India figures in two categories of prospective recipient countries.Out of the 25 million doses, 19 million will go through Covax, the WHO-led initiative for global equitable distribution, to countries earmarked by the US. Of this, 7 million will go to Asia, including India and 15 other countries, according to a factsheet issued by the White House.India also figures on a list of recipient countries described by the US as “regional partners and partner recipients”, which also include Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Georgia and Gaza - 7 million doses have been set aside for this group. India was not in this category in the first factsheet, leading to some confusion because it was included in that category in a statement issued by President Joe Biden. An updated factsheet has India in this category. No country-specific numbers have been released by the US.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US, told Hindustan Times, “The vaccine allocation announcement by US and the telephone call between Indian PM and VP Kamala Harris reflect the firm commitment of the leadership of both India and US to work in partnership on global issues.”US Vice-President Harris had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi and three other world leaders to personally notify them of the US allocation plan on Thursday, before the announcement. “I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing,” Modi had said in a tweet, adding, “I also thanked her for all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora.”President Biden has pledged to share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with countries that need them - 60 million of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which the US doesn’t intend to use and 20 million of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s - by the end of June.The Biden administration announced the allocation plan for 25 million of 80 million on Thursday, promising, as national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said, “the United States will not use its vaccines to secure favours from other countries”. It was a thinly disguised shot at Russia and China, who, the Americans say, have distributed vaccines seeking to advance their own interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-get-large-share-of-us-vaccines-101622825358194.html

But they warned it could be suspended if there is backtracking on progress made in human rights, especially those of women and girls.“As the United States withdraws military forces from Afghanistan, our enduring commitment is clear. We remain engaged through our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit to support the peaceful, stable future the Afghan people want and deserve,” the State Department said in a statement.  The $266 million in new assistance brings to nearly $3.9 billion the total amount of such aid provided by the United States since 2002, the statement said.The funds will help support some of the estimated 18 million Afghans in need, including more than 4.8 million who are internally displaced, 115,000 of whom have been driven from their homes by fighting this year alone, it said.The funds, it continued, will go to providing shelter, job opportunities, basic healthcare, emergency food, water, sanitation, and hygienic services in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.It also will support protection programs for “the most vulnerable Afghans,” including women and girls “facing particular risks, including gender-based violence,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-more-than-266-million-in-new-humanitarian-aid-for-afghanistan-101622824286232.html

04-06-2021||World||Covid origin: What do we know about Wuhan CDC cave expedition in search of viruses?||A video, meant to promote China’s world-leading viral research, was aired in December 2019 by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and was widely circulated on social media. The video titled ‘Youth In the Wild - Invisible Defender’ shows researchers scaling cavern walls in search of unknown viruses and the basis of new vaccines. Tian Junhua, one of the bat hunters, boasts about the extreme efforts taken to discover new viruses, calling the caves their “main battlefields.”“Among all the known creatures, the bats are rich in various viruses inside. You can find most viruses responsible for human diseases like Rabies, Sars, and Ebola. Accordingly, the caves frequented by bats became our main battlefields,” says Tian, a researcher at Wuhan Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the over seven-minute-long video.“If our skin is exposed, it can easily come in contact with bat excrement and contaminated matter, which means this is quite risky,” he continues, as background music enhances the dramatic effect.While the researcher was shown in the video handling sample vials without wearing full protective equipment, he underscores the need for caution during such expedition, saying, “It is while discovering new viruses that we are most at risk of infection.” The high-quality video was aired around the time when Wuhan residents started turning up at hospitals with pneumonia-like symptoms.Also Read | Anthony Fauci calls on China to release medical records of Wuhan lab workersWhat do we know about the expedition?According to a Washington Post report, Wuhan CDC, the health agency that oversaw China’s early pandemic response, has not disclosed to the world if they found any viruses in the caves, frequented by bats, during the particular expedition shown in the video. It is not even clear when that expedition took place.The hypothesis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident has gained credence in recent weeks, with a renewed demand for a new “transparent” investigation into the virus origin. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the Wuhan CDC, which moved a laboratory on December 2, 2019, denied disruptions or incidents caused by the move. It also denied any storage or laboratory activities involving bat viruses before the coronavirus outbreak.“[A] stance hard to reconcile with Tian’s boasts in the video about having visited dozens of bat caves and studied 300 types of virus vectors,” the Post said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-origin-what-do-we-know-about-wuhan-cdc-expedition-in-search-of-viruses-101622819353984.html

On Friday, the demonstrators held candlelight vigils and shouted slogans outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mukarram Mosque. One of the banners used during the candlelight visit read “Genocide Day”.On June 4, 1989, hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers suppressed student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing in a bloody crackdown, now remembered as the Tiananmen Square massacre. Since then, China has not allowed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody crackdown. With increased powers under China’s draconian national security law, Hong Kong, a former British colony, has also extended the ban on any discussion or commemoration of the massacre.US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Thursday honoured the "sacrifices of those killed 32 years ago, and the brave activists who carry on their efforts today in the face of ongoing government repression." "Named after the nearby Gate of Heavenly Peace, the square is instead synonymous with the brutal actions by the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1989 to silence tens of thousands of individuals advocating to have a say in their government and exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," Blinken said in a statement.Also Read | China uses coercive policies in Xinjiang to drive down Uyghur birth rates: ReportThe Bangladeshi demonstrators were also seen wearing blue masks to highlight gross human rights violations, including suppression of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region.Several leaked documents have revealed China’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghurs in which they have called it a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”.

Many got scared," Lang Khan Khai from the Zomi Care and Development aid group told Reuters from the town of Tonzang, just over 20 km (13 miles) from the border with India. "People rarely go out."Reuters was unable to reach the health ministry for comment.Medics are concerned that few cases are being detected. The ratio of confirmed infections to tests rose to over 11% on Thursday - the highest since just before the last big peak in cases.Coronavirus testing collapsed after the coup as many health workers joined a civil disobedience movement to protest against the junta that ousted elected ruler Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government had brought two waves of infection under control.Tests averaged just over 1,500 a day in the seven days to Friday compared with well over 17,000 in the week before the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-spike-in-myanmar-after-outbreak-near-indian-border-101622821934680.html
04-06-2021||World||WHO warns of June-July Covax doses shortfall||The World Health Organization said Friday a shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine doses going through the Covax programme in June and July could undermine the efficiency of the roll-out.Covax was set up to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to low-income countries, and has already delivered more than 80 million doses to 129 territories.But that is "about 200 million doses behind where we want to be", Bruce Aylward, the WHO's Covax frontman, told reporters in Geneva.So while wealthy countries had pledged to give some 150 million doses so far -- on top of the doses Covax procures with donated funds -- that would not resolve the problem."We are setting up for failure if we don't get early doses. We are not on track yet: we don't have enough doses from enough countries early enough to get the world on track to get out of this," Aylward said.While the pledges to donate 150 million doses through Covax was a "great start", Aylward said there were "two big problems"."Number one, very little is committed to the June-July period, which means we're going to still have this gap," Aylward said."The other problem is just the volume. If we are going to get on track to get at least 30-40 percent of the world population vaccinated this year we got to get another 250 million people vaccinated between now and the end of September."- Supply problems -Covax is an international scheme co-led by the WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.It intends to procure enough vaccines for 30 percent of the population in 92 of the poorest participating territories -- 20 percent in India -- with donors covering the cost.Covax has been hit by inequalities in the global vaccine roll-out, but also delivery delays.AstraZeneca shots making up 97 percent of doses supplied so far -- the rest being Pfizer-BioNTech.The Serum Institute of India, producing AstraZeneca doses, was to have been the backbone of Covax's supply chain. However, New Delhi restricted vaccine exports to combat a devastating domestic surge.SII said Wednesday that it hoped to resume supplies to Covax over the next few months.Covax was set up to combat the likelihood of rich countries buying up most available vaccine doses -- which occurred as predicted.On Thursday, the world hit the milestone of two billion Covid-19 vaccines having been injected around the world, according to an AFP count.But of those doses, 37 percent have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.3 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world's people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-june-july-covax-doses-shortfall-101622815901574.html

Compensation could be kept to a minimum to ensure affordable prices.Medical humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said the EU proposal was pushing only voluntary action by companies rather than the concrete legal solution a waiver would offer.It added the existing "compulsory licensing" had critical shortcomings and that the EU plan was limited to vaccines.(Reporting by Philip BlenkinsopEditing by Mark Heinrich and Andrew Heavens)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-resists-patent-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccines-submits-three-part-plan-to-wto-101622814139996.html
04-06-2021||World||US yet to fix country-specific vaccine allocation, FDA nod for AstraZeneca jabs likely soon||The US is yet to decide country-specific allocations for the first tranche of 25 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines it will donate though figures will be determined in consultation with governments and the WHO-backed COVAX facility, a top American official said on Friday. Gayle Smith, the state department coordinator for the global Covid-19 response, told a virtual news briefing that the US will match donations from its surplus stock of vaccines to doses used by countries in their national immunisation programmes. Smith declined to set a timeframe for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) giving its approval for the 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine the US plans to donate, but said the American side is hopeful the clearance will come soon. President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled US plans for sharing the first tranche of 25 million doses out of a total of 80 million doses around the world, with 75% or 19 million doses to be rolled out through COVAX. This includes seven million doses for Asia, six million for South and Central America and five million for Africa. The US will share another six million doses directly with partners, and India is the only country expected to get doses both directly and through COVAX. Smith said, “In terms of the actual number of doses, we’ve done some notional planning but the refinement of the actual dose numbers will be determined in consultation with governments and their health experts, the state of their vaccine plans and delivery, and with COVAX. “So we want to be careful about putting a number out there out because we want to work all of those pieces to make sure we’ve got the numbers right. But I think they will be substantial numbers.” With the first tranche comprising Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, Smith said the US “will be trying to match vaccines to [national] vaccine programmes where we can” so that the doses can be effectively deployed. The US will also take into account factors such as regulatory approvals and cold chain facilities, she said. Smith said the US’s ability to roll out its surplus stocks of AstraZeneca vaccines will depend on clearance from the FDA. Since the FDA is an autonomous regulatory public health agency, the administration cannot interfere in its work, she noted. “So we are hopeful we will get a clearance soon. We are not in a position to say when that will come through because that’s the purview of the FDA,” she said. In response to a question from a journalist from Bhutan, which carried out the first round of its vaccination programme with AstraZeneca jabs donated by India but now has no vaccines for its second round, Smith said the US is aware of this issue and the AstraZeneca doses will be key to addressing the matter. “Many countries are in urgent need of vaccines, this is only the beginning. We have in excess of 60 million doses to deploy,” she said. Jeremy Konyndyk, the executive director of the USAID Covid-19 task force, who also addressed the briefing, said the donation of 25 million doses will play an important role in helping COVAX manage some of its supply gaps and tide over a shortage of jabs. COVAX is a key partner in the equitable distribution of doses because of its logistics for global distribution and legal regulatory agreements with various countries, he said. He, however, acknowledged it will take “quite a while to vaccinate the world” and said the US, in the interim, will help countries tackle surges through funding for diagnostics to detect and manage transmissions and for bolstering health systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-yet-to-fix-country-specific-vaccine-allocation-fda-nod-for-astrazeneca-jabs-likely-soon-101622814677428.html
04-06-2021||World||Putin invites foreign nationals to visit Russia for Covid shot||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday praised his country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and called for a stronger global response to global warming.Putin's speech at an economic forum in St. Petersburg came less than two weeks before his summit with United States President Joe Biden. U.S. and Russian officials said the agenda of the June 16 meeting in Geneva will likely include climate change and efforts to counter the coronavirus among other issues.Addressing the forum, Putin lauded the efficiency of Russian-designed vaccines and bemoaned what he described as “politically-motivated bans” in some countries on their purchase.Last year, Russia boasted of being the first in the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, but it has since moved slowly in getting its population immunized. The slack pace of vaccination has been partly attributed to public skepticism about the vaccines amid controversial signals from the authorities.Experts have questioned whether Russia will be able to meet the government’s target of vaccinating more than 30 million of the country’s 146 million people by mid-June, and nearly 69 million by August.Putin on Friday again urged the Russians to move more quickly to get the shots, noting that the Russia-designed vaccines have been “proven to be the safest and most efficient” and emphasizing that there have been no fatalities linked to their use.Putin invited foreign nationals to visit Russia to get the coronavirus shots, saying he would instruct the government to move quickly to facilitate that.In his speech, Putin also emphasized the need to strengthen the international response to climate change, noting that melting permafrost has mounted a major challenge to Russia's Arctic regions.“We have entire cities built on permafrost,” he said. “What will happen if it all starts melting?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-invites-foreign-nationals-to-visit-russia-for-covid-shot-101622812339918.html

"Suddenly, [they] disappeared and none of them answered my phone...They didn't message me at all. I tried to send a message. None of them responded," he told Al Jazeera.Hussein believes that his 85-year-old father, mother and siblings have been transferred to what he describes as a "concentration camp" - large-scale detention centres that have reportedly detained over one million Uyghur Muslims.The president of the Uyghur Association of Victoria, Alim Osman, said at a recent parliamentary inquiry there were about 5,000 Uyghurs living in Australia, with about 1,500 of them thought to be in Adelaide, a city of 1.3 million people on the south coast. Out of these, many Uyghurs living in Australia have similar stories of loved ones being detained or disappearing together.Mayila Yakufu, the elder sister of Marhaba Yakub Salay, another Australian citizen of Uyghur ethnicity, is also currently imprisoned in Xinjiang for the second time, reported Al Jazeera.Yakufu was was first detained for 10 months in 2017, though she did not say where she had been."She didn't say anything, but she said, 'Don't worry about us - the Chinese Communist Party is looking after us very well," Salay said, adding that he believed she was calling from another location under government supervision.That was the last time they spoke and in May 2019, Yakufu was arrested again. She was arrested "on suspicion of financing terrorist activities", according to an email from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) - which Al Jazeera has seen.This money, Salay said, was not for terrorism, but to buy a home. "It's black and white evidence - but the Chinese government still accuses my sister of supporting terrorism overseas," he said.Salay further believed that such charges have been invented by the Chinese government for the purposes of detaining her Uighur sister, with the DFAT email stating her sister was likely to be held "in a traditional prison, rather than a re-education camp".Almas Nizanidin, another resident in Australia, said his wife Buzainafu Abudourexiti was sentenced to seven years to prison in 2017 on what he says is "no charge" and with "no evidence".Nizanidin had planned to return to China to help his wife emigrate to Australia, where he has been living since 2009, but she was interned before he could do so, and he has no knowledge of her whereabouts, Al Jazeera reported.He also said that his mother - a 55-year-old high school maths teacher - was also arrested and sent to a detention centre for more than two years. Though she was eventually released last year, Nizanidin maintained that his mother would not say anything about her experience.Hussein, Salay and Nizanidin all said that the Australian federal government has provided support for investigations into what has happened to their loved ones.Amid the backdrop of China's gross human rights violations against ethnic minorities, relations between Beijing and Canberra have also spiralled downwards.Tensions between China and Australia have escalated over a slew of issues which have now led to a point where the Chinese state-media threatened ballistic missile strikes if Canberra gets involved in a potential military conflict over Taiwan.Meanwhile, China has also been globally rebuked for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities, and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-uyghurs-in-despair-over-disappearance-of-relatives-in-china-101622802285828.html
04-06-2021||World||Explained: What is 'ranked-choice voting,' the new system for New York's mayoral election?||When New York City voters go to the polls on June 22 to select their party's mayoral nominee, they will fill out a new kind of ballot that allows them to pick up to five candidates in order of preference in a system known as ranked-choice voting.What is ranked-choice voting (RCV)?Most U.S. elections are "winner-take-all": the candidate with the most votes wins even if he or she falls short of 50%. Under RCV, voters can rank multiple contenders instead of choosing just one.Dozens of cities, including San Francisco, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City, use RCV for local elections. Maine began using it statewide in 2018, and Alaska will implement it for all state and federal general elections starting next year, including the 2024 presidential race.Countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Ireland use a form of RCV. Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have for more than a decade voted for the Best Picture Oscar using this preferential system.How will the system work in New York?RCV was approved in New York by voter referendum in 2019 and first used in special city council elections earlier this year.In New York's mayoral election, voters can list up to five names. That will allow more flexibility in particular for Democratic voters, who are choosing from a crowded field of more than a dozen candidates.Ballots are tabulated in what may best be described as a series of instant runoffs. In the first round, if any candidate receives 50% or the vote, he or she is declared the winner, and the election is over.If not, the candidate who finished in last place is eliminated, and any ballots that had him or her as the top choice are reallocated to the No. 2 candidate on each ballot. The votes are counted once again. If no candidate has yet reached 50%, the candidate in last place is eliminated, and his or her ballots reallocated, and so on, until someone exceeds 50%.RCV will be used in the primary elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough president and city council. Judicial contests and the race for Manhattan district attorney will use the traditional winner-take-all system.Though some preliminary results may be available on the night of June 22, the mayoral nominees likely won't be known for weeks. Absentee ballots, which are expected to be widely used, can legally arrive up to a week after Election Day, and voters are allowed to "cure" any errors until July 9, which could delay the tabulation of voters' ranked choices.What are the arguments in favor of RCV?First, voters can freely cast ballots for their favorite candidate, without worrying about "wasting" votes on someone who is unlikely to win."In a ranked-choice voting system, voters do not have to settle for the lesser of two evils," said Susan Lerner, the executive director of the good government group Common Cause New York. "You don't have to worry that the polls tell you this person has no chance."Some advocates say RCV encourages more diverse candidates, possibly because voters may be more willing to support them if they know they can include more choices. Research shows RCV elections feature more candidates of color, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that favors the system.RCV can have a positive effect on campaigns, Lerner said. Candidates may be less inclined to attack their opponents to avoid alienating any supporters who might be willing to rank them second, third or fourth.RCV also ensures the eventual winner must appear on a majority of ballots, providing an incentive for campaigns to reach out to voters across demographic and geographical lines for the broadest possible appeal, rather than relying on a political base that may only represent a plurality of voters, Lerner said.Are there any concerns?Some voters may find the new ballot confusing, said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University."I'm incredibly concerned, and I've been ringing the alarm for months now," she said.Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration announced a $15 million voter education initiative in April. Lerner is overseeing an education campaign, Rank the Vote NYC, that has reached tens of thousands of voters, she said.Some academics have noted that RCV can lead to "exhausted ballots," in which a voter's candidates are all eliminated before the last round of tabulation and thus are not included in the final tally. Others have argued that a more complicated process could decrease voter turnout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-ranked-choice-voting-the-new-system-for-new-york-s-mayoral-election-101622802261764.html

The team, led by researchers from the Francis Crick Institute in the UK, determined neutralising antibodies in the blood of 250 healthy individuals, who had received either one or two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, against five SARS-CoV-2 strains.Across all variants of concern, the researchers found lower levels of these antibodies with increasing age, while no correlation was observed for sex or body-mass index. They, however, also noted that the levels of antibodies alone do not predict vaccine efficacy against the variants and that prospective population studies are also needed.The research paper was published on the backdrop of the UK's decision to reduce the gap between two doses of vaccine to address the concerns about the spread of the B.1.617 variant, named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ‘Delta’. The study supports the UK's current vaccination plan since the researchers found that people are less likely to develop the level of neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant as high as those seen against B.1.1.7, or the Alpha variant, first found in Kent.Also Read | Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in UKHere are some of the key findings:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-jab-produces-less-antibodies-against-delta-variant-lancet-study-101622809201346.html
04-06-2021||World||German cardinal offers to quit over Church's 'mishandling' of sexual abuse cases||A leading German cardinal and confidante of Pope Francis, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, offered to resign Friday over the Catholic Church's mishandling of clergy sexual abuse cases, declaring in an extraordinary public gesture that the church had arrived at “a dead end."The archdiocese of Munich and Freising, where Marx serves as archbishop, published his resignation letter to the pope online, in multiple languages, and the cardinal said Francis had given him permission to make it public.“It is important to me to share the responsibility for the catastrophe of the sexual abuse by Church officials over the past decades," the 67-year-old Marx wrote in the letter. But he also issued a challenge of sorts for his fellow bishops to use the opportunity of the scandal to save the church and reform it.There was no immediate comment from the Vatican, where Marx sits on powerful financial and political bodies. A Vatican spokesman said that information about resignations is announced in a daily bulletin, and Friday's edition did not mention Marx. The German cardinal noted that Francis had told him to “keep performing my service as bishop until his decision is made."Marx, who led the German Bishops' Conference from 2014 until 2020, wrote that investigations during the last decade showed there had been “a lot of personal failures and administrative mistakes but also institutional or ‘systemic’ failure.”In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger when the abuse took place, and nearly a third of them were altar boys, according to the report.Earlier this year, another report came out about the church officials' handling of alleged sexual abuse in the country’s western Cologne diocese. The archbishop of Hamburg, a former Cologne church official who was faulted in that report, offered his resignation to the pope and was granted a “time out” of unspecified length.Marx himself has not been implicated in any of the investigative reports to date, but he said all members of the hierarchy shared blame for the failures. A report is expected this summer about the handling of sexual abuse cases in Marx’s archdiocese, German news agency dpa reported.In his letter to the pope, Marx said that his offer to resign could be seen as “a personal signal for a new beginning, for a new awakening of the Church, not only in Germany.”“I would like to show that not the ministry is in the foreground but the mission of the Gospel,” he added.Marx’s offer to resign was an extraordinary gesture and laid bare the credibility crisis that the sexual abuse scandal created in Germany, as it has in other countries. To try to recover that credibility, Marx has spearheaded a process of reform and debate with the powerful German laity to address the structural problems that contributed to abuse being allowed to fester unchecked for decades.But the so-called “Synodal Path” has sparked fierce resistance inside Germany and out, primarily from conservative bishops and priests opposed to opening any debate on issues such as priestly celibacy, women’s role in the church and homosexuality.Resistance has also come from the Vatican and bishops outside Germany, including culture warriors in the United States who have broken with church protocol to pen essays critical of the reform process under way in Germany.In his letter, Marx made no mention of his status as a member of Francis’ kitchen cabinet, a group of cardinal advisers who have been meeting regularly to draft a new reform of the Vatican hierarchy and who advise the pontiff on other matters.The head of a powerful laypersons' organization, the Central Committee of German Catholics, or ZdK, said he was “deeply shocked” by the cardinal's offer.“The wrong person is leaving," ZdK President Thomas Sternberg told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. “What Marx did for ecumenical Christianity, for the Synodal Path and also when it comes to the processing of sexual abuse (revelations) is very important.”The ZdK has participated in the Synodal Path meetings for more than a year with the German Bishops' Conference. The meetings. which are set to conclude in the fall, feature discussions about allowing priests to get married, the ordination of women and a different understanding of sexuality, among other reforms. The process was launched as part of the response to revelations of clergy sexual abuse.The head of the German Bishops' Conference, Limburg Bishop Georg Baetzing, expressed respect for Marx’s decision.“His resignation offer makes clear that the church in Germany needs to continue the Synodal Path,” Baetzing said in a written statement. “The Synodal Path was created to look for systemic answers to the crisis. The basic, theological discussions which determine the Synodal Path are therefore a significant and important part of this process.”Other top cardinals and bishops previously offered to resign for more direct involvement in abuse-related failings, only to see Francis sit on the decision for some time.French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin offered to resign in 2019 after a French court convicted him of failing to report a pedophile priest. Francis refused to accept the resignation pending the outcome of Barbarin’s appeal, though he eventually accepted it the following year, by which time Barbarin had been acquitted.Francis allowed Australian Cardinal George Pell, his economics minister, to take an extended leave of absence in 2017 to return home to face trial for old sexual abuse charges. Pell’s conviction was overturned by Australia’s High Court last year, but by that time, Pell was just a year shy of retirement age and Francis had already named a successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-cardinal-offers-to-quit-over-church-s-mishandling-of-sexual-abuse-cases-101622808460807.html

"These are the big manufacturers and it may be that we will start the first trials in Arab countries combining Sputnik with a number of Chinese vaccines," Kirill Dmitriev was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.A combination trial using the Sputnik V vaccine and the AstraZeneca jab has already been conducted and no negative side effects have been reported so far, Russian news agency Interfax reported.Dmitriev also said Russia expects the World Health Organization (WHO) to approve the Sputnik V vaccine within two months. He said the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which is also reviewing Sputnik V "was provided with all basic existing information, there is no critical remarks for now at all".RDIF helped finance the production of the Sputnik V vaccine and also markets the shot around the world, and so far it has been approved for use in over 60 countries worldwide. EMA, WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are yet to approve the jab.The Sputnik V vaccine is the first foreign-made vaccine to be approved in India and is currently being distributed in the country by Dr Reddy's Laboratories. On Thursday, the Serum Institute of India (SII) applied for a test license to manufacture Sputnik V in the country.RDIF claims that Sputnik V demonstrates the efficacy of 79.4 per cent when administered in a single dose and 91.6 per cent when administered in two doses. However, many US universities have asked students to get re-vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine if they have been administered Sputnik or India’s Covaxin, before colleges in the US open for the fall semester, news agency ANI reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-may-start-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-combining-sputnik-v-chinese-shots-rdif-chief-101622802826356.html

04-06-2021||World||US students who took Covaxin, Sputnik V, asked to get re-vaccinated||Since March, over 400 US colleges and universities have announced students get Covid-19 vaccinations, ahead of the Autumn semester but those who have been inoculated with India's indigenous Covaxin or the Russian-made Sputnik V are being asked to re-vaccinate as these vaccines have not yet been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).Rukmini Callimachi reports in the The New York Times that Milloni Doshi, a 25-year-old student from India, who is due to start her master's degree this fall at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, has been administered two doses of Covaxin. Now, Columbia has told her that she will need to be revaccinated with a different vaccine once she arrives on campus."I am just concerned about taking two different vaccines. They said the application process would be the toughest part of the cycle, but it's really been all of this that has been uncertain and anxiety-inducing," Doshi wrote via a messaging app.Campuses are proposing different measures, out of which the more complicated scenario is if students received a vaccine that has not been approved by the WHO, like Sputnik or Covaxin. Many colleges are proposing that those students will need to be revaccinated, which presents both medical and logistical conundrums.This is primarily because no data exists on whether combing vaccines from different companies is safe. "Since Covid-19 vaccines are not interchangeable, the safety and effectiveness of receiving two different Covid-19 vaccines have not been studied," said Kristen Nordlund, spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Nordlund also advised that people vaccinated outside the US with a vaccine not authorised by WHO should wait for a minimum of 28 days before taking the first dose of one of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-sanctioned vaccines.American students have access to the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, three of the eight doses authorised by the global health body. This disparity could hinder colleges that have made it a major priority to retain international students, who brought in close to USD 39 billion in tuition dollars in the year before the pandemic, according to an analysis."Universities want to enroll international students because they add diversity to the campus community -- and they bring money... It's why this has been a subject of intense discussion," said Terry W Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education.According to The New York Times, the situation is particularly challenging for students from India, which sends around 200,000 international students to American colleges every year. It is becoming increasingly hard to secure an appointment for a vaccine that will be accepted by American campuses."Every day, we get 10 to 15 messages and inquiries, saying 'What does this mean? How does this impact me?'" said Sudhanshu Kaushik, who runs the North American Association of Indian Students, which is working to help fellow students.Indiana University's vice president for international affairs, Hannah Buxbaum, said that the administrators of the institution are working overtime to answer the roughly 200 phone calls and 300 emails that are pouring in every day from the university's roughly 6,000 students overseas."Ringing off the hook doesn't begin to describe. There is no question that there is anxiety and concern among our international students," she said.Many universities are only accepting the students who have been vaccinated with a WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccine. At Columbia, where one-third of the student body is from overseas, international students will be asked to present either their WHO booklet or a letter from a physician confirming they have received the requisite doses of one of the vaccines vetted by the world body, said Donna Lynne, the chief operating officer of the university's medical centre.Callimachi writes for The New York Times that those who will not succeed in securing a vaccine before the start of the fall semester are facing a potentially problematic process.Many universities were vague on how they plan to deal with the logistical complexity of spacing out these unrelated vaccines, beyond saying that they planned to accommodate students undergoing this process, reports The New York Times.At least six regional governments in India have announced emergency clinics in the past week to vaccine students going to US universities, in wake of mounting pressure from confused and anxious students, wrote Callimachi.However, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech on Thursday said that biopharmaceutical company Ocugen Inc will have exclusive co-development, manufacturing, and commercialisation rights of its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin in Canada, in addition to its existing United States rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-students-who-took-covaxin-sputnik-v-asked-to-get-revaccinated-101622799821644.html

The agreement could revive supersonic passenger travel, which was wound down in 2003 with the retirement of the Anglo-French Concorde.Under the agreement, United Airlines will purchase 15 ‘Overture’ airliners, a supersonic aircraft with 65 to 88 seats, from Boom Supersonic once the aircraft meets safety, operating and sustainability requirements. The Chicago-based American airline will also have an option to buy an additional 35 aircraft.Overture airliners are slated to roll out in 2025, fly in 2026 and expected to carry passengers by 2029. The supersonic jet is expected to be the first large commercial aircraft to be net-zero carbon from day one.

DeJoy previously served as chief executive at North Carolina-based New Breed Logistics.The Washington Post first reported the investigation. FBI agents have interviewed current and former DeJoy and New Breed Logistics employees and have issued a subpoena to DeJoy, the Post reported.The Post reported last year that some New Breed Logistics employees said they were pressured by DeJoy or his aides to attend fundraisers or make political contributions to Republicans and then were repaid through bonuses. DeJoy in congressional testimony denied making such reimbursements, calling it an "outrageous claim." New Breed was sold to XPO Logistics Inc in 2014.Mark Corallo, a DeJoy spokesman, said in a statement that DeJoy "learned that the Department of Justice is investigating campaign contributions made by employees who worked for him when he was in the private sector. He has always been scrupulous in his adherence to the campaign contribution laws and has never knowingly violated them."Corallo said DeJoy "intends to work with DOJ toward swiftly resolving it."The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A USPS representative declined to comment.The chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee, Carolyn Maloney, said if the allegations are true DeJoy "must resign immediately." She called on the postal board "to immediately disclose what information it had about these allegations and whether it has reviewed them."Some Democrats last year accused DeJoy of making service changes with the intention of impeding the delivery of mail-in ballots for November's presidential election to help Trump, which DeJoy denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-postal-service-chief-faces-fbi-probe-over-campaign-fundraising-101622796569755.html
04-06-2021||World||UN agency for Palestinian refugees withdraws director from Gaza after threats||The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says it has recalled its Gaza director after he faced threats over remarks in which he appeared to praise Israel's “huge sophistication” in carrying out precision strikes during last month's Gaza war.UNRWA, which provides essential health, education and other services in the territory, said late Thursday that it was “seriously concerned” about the threats, including a “very large protest” outside its Gaza headquarters on Monday.It said Gaza director Matthias Schmale and his deputy have been recalled to UNRWA's headquarters in east Jerusalem for “consultations.” The agency cited media reports that “Palestinian factions” had declared Schmale and his deputy persona non grata in Gaza but said it received no formal notification to that effect.In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 TV last month, Schmale was asked about Israeli officials' assertions that airstrikes carried out during the 11-day war with the territory's militant Hamas rulers were "very precise."“I'm not a military expert but I would not dispute that," Schmale replied, adding that there was “huge sophistication” in how Israel struck targets. But he also said colleagues told him the strikes were “much more vicious in their impact” than in the 2014 Gaza war.Schmale later expressed regret over the remarks and said any civilian deaths were unacceptable.“Many people were killed or have been severely injured by direct strikes or collateral damage from strikes,” he tweeted. “In a place as densely populated as Gaza, any strike will have huge damaging effects on people and buildings."His original remarks were widely circulated in Israeli media and online, where they were seized upon by Israel's supporters as an endorsement of its conduct and provoked outrage among Palestinians.Israel carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza during the 11-day war, in which Hamas and other militant groups fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel. At least 254 people were killed in Gaza, including 67 children and 39 women. according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas has acknowledged the deaths of 80 militants. Twelve civilians, including two children, were killed in Israel, along with one soldier.UNRWA provides essential services to some 5.7 million refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. They include Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation and their descendants.It provides food aid and other vital services in Gaza, which has been under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Most of Gaza's population of 2 million are registered refugees. At the height of the war, some 70,000 Gazans sheltered in UNRWA schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-agency-withdraws-director-from-gaza-after-threats-101622796673759.html
04-06-2021||World||As Trump prepares to resume rallies, Republicans fear 'revenge tour'||Donald Trump will be back on stage this month with one mission at the top of his agenda -- seeking revenge against Republican incumbents who turned on him by backing their challengers in 2022 primaries.That worries some GOP leaders. As the former president prepares to resume his trademark rallies, they fear another round of grievances about the 2020 election results and championing untested candidates over incumbents could hurt the party more than it helps in next year’s midterm elections.Trump has been banned from social media for encouraging supporters who broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. He has issued statements on news topics that have generated little coverage. This week, he abandoned a blog he had started less than a month ago that had attracted relatively few readers.He is scheduled to be the keynote speaker on Saturday at the North Carolina Republican Party’s convention, which will be live-streamed.The schedule for the rallies hasn’t been released but they will likely begin this month or next, according to senior adviser Jason Miller. One of the first will be in Ohio for Max Miller, a former White House aide who’s challenging Republican Anthony Gonzalez, one of 10 House incumbents who voted to impeach Trump. The two Millers are no related.Jason Miller said there are also plans for an event in Alabama, where Trump has endorsed Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign to replace retiring Senator Richard Shelby. Brooks helped lead the Jan. 6 challenge to the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the Electoral College.Trump is also planning rallies in Florida and Georgia, where he is backing Representative Jody Hice against Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, though those events might not be for specific candidates, Miller said. The unusual event of a former U.S. president getting involved in a race for a state bureaucratic post follows Raffensperger’s high-profile opposition to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden in Georgia.Matt Schlapp, head of the Conservative Political Action Conference, announced on Twitter that Trump would be speaking to CPAC’s Texas meeting in July.Trump’s campaign against Republican incumbents could end with a slate of candidates who are weaker than an entrenched incumbent in a general-election matchup with a Democrat in the fall, diverting resources from other competitive races in 2022. Republicans need to flip only one seat in the Senate and five in the House to regain control and stymie Biden’s agenda for the remainder of his term.It’s unclear whether the rallies will draw the crowds that showed up when Trump was a presidential candidate or in the White House. But he remains the de facto head of the Republican Party and demands fealty from candidates and officeholders.“I’m tickled to death” Trump will be holding rallies, said Fred Beardsley, chairman of the Oswego County Republican Committee in upstate New York.Beardsley said he views Trump hitting the stump is good thing for the party, even if it hurts some GOP congressional candidates in 2022, including local Representative John Katko, who also voted to impeach the former president.Having Trump front and center would keep voters focused on 2020 and relitigating the election results at a time when prominent Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell want to focus the midterm messaging on Biden’s economic plans and electing a Republican-controlled Congress that could stop them.McConnell opposed plans for a bipartisan commission to examine the Jan. 6 riot because, he said, it would distract from the 2022 midterm message and focus too much on the past.“Politics is about the future, and as long as Trump looks forward and is focused on helping nominate candidates that can win in the fall, it’s a good use of time and it’s good for the party,” said Scott Reed, the former chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “If it just becomes a forum for re-litigating the past loss, it’ll have a negative impact on the party.”Trump’s fixation on settling scores doesn’t fit with the GOP’s aim to be unified, said Doug Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director and Trump critic.“What Donald Trump is saying is that he is not going to allow Republicans to do anything but look back, and that is something that will gum up the works potentially for 2022,” Heye said.Miller countered by noting that the former president is the party’s most popular figure, and cited the 74 million votes he received for re-election.“Everybody wants his endorsement, and he’s committed to helping elect America First conservatives who can help Republicans take back the House and Senate in 2022,” Miller said.Republicans must channel Trump’s energies into revving up the GOP base and uniting Republicans behind candidates the entire party supports, said Matt Gorman, a GOP strategist who used to be communications director for the National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP campaign arm.“If we talk about the future and we talk about Joe Biden, we will win,” Gorman said. “It’s when we re-litigate the past and issues that voters aren’t as concerned about that we get ourselves into trouble.”If his past rallies are any indication, Trump could draw much of the attention to himself and away from 2022 candidates as his unscripted speeches meander through a series of topics that rarely exhibit message discipline.“Republicans absolutely should be concerned that the Trump rallies will be problematic, depending on the outcome,” said Dan Eberhart, a longtime GOP donor. “I just worry that attacking other Republicans at this point in the cycle just has no benefit.”Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the House Republicans that Trump has targeted for their impeachment vote, said he hopes the rallies expose the former president’s weaknesses.“I do think that’s going to be fatiguing with people, and eventually folks besides the most hardcore are going to say, ‘OK, it’s time to move on,’” Kinzinger said in a Politico interview streamed online last week. “My hope is that actually in those rallies, people realize this is starting to get nuts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-trump-prepares-to-resume-rallies-republicans-fear-revenge-tour-101622790450290.html
04-06-2021||World||India, Canada resume talks on stalled trade pact||After languishing for nearly four years, India and Canadian negotiators have resumed discussions this week towards a possible trade pact.The discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They revisited the stalled Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh and then Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper.There is some optimism a deal may finally be possible, as Kendal Hembroff, director-general, Trade Negotiations for Global Affairs Canada, tweeted, “Great discussions this week towards a possible trade agreement with India. Canadian and Indian negotiators were hard at work!”India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria responded, “Great to see constructive engagement between trade teams this week on a trade pact and when done, should boost trade and investment in the bilateral economic corridor.”The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement or FIPA prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in concluding CEPA first. However, with relations declining following that disastrous visit, fresh talks were not scheduled outside of routine stocktaking.Relations have improved this year with Canada appreciative of India’s delivery of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine in March, followed by Canada’s generosity as India faced the destructive second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.However, a senior Indian official said the discussions are centred around a “CEPA-lite”, which will take into account areas of interest between the two nations.Interestingly, the last ministerial-level dialogue on CEPA was held in September 2016 by two leaders who are now both finance ministers in India and Canada - Nirmala Sitharaman, then commerce minister and Chrystia Freeland, then minister of international trade.Global Affairs Canada describes India as a “priority market”, and India is 9th largest export market, and 10th largest trading partner overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-canada-resume-talks-on-stalled-trade-pact-101622783535354.html

City spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie said a fist sculpture, which stands several feet tall, will remain. The city said the effort was led by a community group known as Agape and several city departments were involved.The intersection had been closed to traffic since Floyd's death in police custody on May 25, 2020, but some residents and businesses expressed frustration that it had been closed for so long.Traffic briefly flowed through the intersection Thursday morning after the concrete barriers were removed, but community members quickly erected new makeshift barriers. Dozens of people gathered near the intersection, singing, chanting Floyd’s name and giving speeches expressing frustration and urging people to continue organizing.Police were not seen at the intersection on Thursday morning and there was no visible police presence later in the day. Mayor Jacob Frey said avoiding clashes between activists and police was of utmost concern, and going forward, the police will patrol the area just like any other neighborhood in the city.Frey said a phased reopening of the intersection was necessary to promote healing, restore area businesses, and provide social and city services that have been lacking for a year. He said artwork from the memorial will be preserved, and that the city wants to ensure the location where Floyd died “never has tires run over it again.”“This intersection will forever be changed and we need to be investing in that transformation,” Frey said at a news conference. “This can be a critical location of gathering, not just for our city but the entire world.”City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins said she has talked with residents and business owners who have struggled with the loss of revenue and sleep, and some who feel trapped in their homes. “It’s time for us to begin a process of rebuilding this community,” she said.Frey acknowledged the reopening would not happen all at once and declined to say when the intersection would fully reopen to traffic.The square sprang up organically in the days after Floyd’s death. As people gathered to express their grief and anger, community members set up makeshift barricades to block traffic, which the city eventually replaced with concrete ones.Frey and other city leaders pledged to reopen the intersection, but activist leaders said they wouldn’t step aside unless the city met their 24 demands. Among them: recall the county prosecutor, fire the head of the state’s criminal investigative agency, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on programs to create jobs, combat racism and support affordable housing.Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the removal of the memorial was an attack on Floyd's legacy.“This space is a space that has now become a national memorial, a national memorial for victims of police violence all over this world,” Hussein said during a news conference.“We will not give up this space," he said. "We will save it for George Floyd.”Violent crime at the intersection and the blocks immediately surrounding it rose dramatically in 2020, though crime also increased citywide. There were 19 nonfatal and fatal shootings in the area in 2020, including 14 from May 1 through Aug. 31. That’s compared with three shootings in all of 2019 and none during the summer months.Shots were fired in the area last week, just hours before an event to mark the anniversary of Floyd’s death. One person was injured.McKenzie said Agape has a contract with Agape to reopen the intersection. The contract, which will have a maximum cost of $359,000 and runs from June to the fall, includes community building and health and safety services associated with the reopening. Most of the cost of the contract covers the hourly rate for Agape personnel. Several city departments are involved and coordinating with Agape, she said.Steve Floyd, one of Agape’s founders, said he admires the demonstrators’ efforts to maintain the square but that they had to engage the city in that process “instead of letting them come in here with bulldozers.”“As far as controlling this and maintaining it, that’s a noble job. We don’t disrespect the protesters, everything can stay the same,” said Floyd, who isn't related to George Floyd. “They can still do it. But we just let them in here to fix what we have and develop it.”Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for about 9 1/2 minutes as he pleaded for air.Chauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd’s civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest.The three other former Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd’s arrest and death were also charged with federal civil rights violations. They await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-barriers-put-up-at-george-floyd-square-in-minneapolis-soon-after-old-ones-removed-101622778257366.html

Did they really get sick, and if so, what did they get sick with?" the report https://on.ft.com/3igFTgU quoted Fauci as saying.The origin of the virus is hotly contested, with U.S. intelligence agencies still examining reports that researchers at a Chinese virology laboratory in Wuhan were seriously ill in 2019 a month before the first COVID-19 cases were reported.However, Chinese scientists and officials have consistently rejected the lab leak hypothesis, saying the virus could have been circulating in other regions before it hit Wuhan and might have even entered China through imported frozen food shipments or wildlife trading.Financial Times reported that Fauci continues to believe the virus was first transmitted to humans through animals, pointing out that even if the lab researchers did have COVID-19, they could have contracted the disease from the wider population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/anthony-fauci-calls-on-china-to-release-medical-records-of-wuhan-lab-workers-101622777151935.html
04-06-2021||World||‘Everyone, so-called enemy’ saying I was right about coronavirus’ origin in Wuhan: Donald Trump||Former US president Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated his stance that coronavirus originated from a laboratory in China’s Wuhan and called for imposing a fine on the Asian country for the "death and destruction" it has caused. "Now everyone, even so-called "enemy", are beginning to say that President Trump was right about China virus coming from Wuhan Lab,” Trump said in a statement, according to news agency ANI.Trump, since the beginning, blamed China for the pandemic and said Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, leaked from the Wuhan laboratory. In March 2020, he referred to the virus as the 'China virus' calling the country out for the global health crisis.Also read: Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in lab, new study claims“The correspondence between Dr Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore China should pay USD 10 trillion to America, and the world, for the death and destruction they have caused!” Trump also said in his statement as he referred to top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci.This comes after private emails of Fauci were released to the press that sparked off the claims of the virus originating from the Wuhan lab. More than 3,000 pages of emails, dated from January to June 2020, were obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN via the requests of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).The revealed emails detailed that the top US expert and his colleagues noted, in the initial days, that Covid-19 may have leaked from the lab in China.Also read | ‘Our society is totally nuts’: Fauci emails on public fascination with himLast week, President Joe Biden announced that he has given fresh orders for further US intelligence probe into the origin of Covid-19, the report of which should be submitted in 90 days.The virus leak from the lab theory has evolved from scepticism and entered mainstream conversations. Fauci has even demanded China release medical records of the Wuhan lab workers, who got sick in 2019. He said those records might aid in the in-depth exploration of the theory."I would like to see the medical records of the three people who are reported to have got sick in 2019.

04-06-2021||World||US govt finds no evidence that mysterious aerial sightings were alien UFO: Report||US intelligence officials have found no evidence that a series of unidentified aerial phenomena observed by Navy aviators in recent years were alien spacecraft, but the sightings remain unexplained in a highly anticipated government report, The New York Times reported on Thursday.The newspaper, citing senior Biden administration officials briefed ahead of the report's release to Congress later this month, also said the report found that the vast majority of incidents documented over the past two decades did not originate from any American military or other advanced US government technology.Many of the 120-plus sightings reviewed in the classified intelligence study were from US Navy personnel. But one unnamed senior US official briefed on the report told the Times there was concern among American intelligence and military officials that China or Russia could be experimenting with hypersonic technology, perhaps accounting for some of the aerial phenomena in question.An unclassified version of the report expected to be submitted to Congress by June 25 will present few other conclusions, the newspaper said.Senior US officials cited in the Times article said the report's ambiguity meant that the government was unable to definitively rule out theories that the unidentified phenomena might have been extraterrestrial in nature.Pentagon officials have publicly acknowledged that a special Defense Department body called the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force was established in the past few years to examine military reports of "incursions" into restricted airspace and training ranges.US defense officials have said such incidents are of a concern to Pentagon and intelligence agencies because of their national security implications.Responding to Reuters' questions about the forthcoming task force report requested by Congress, Pentagon spokeswoman Sue Gough said in an email reply earlier on Thursday: "We do not publicly discuss the details of the UAP observations, the task force or examinations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-finds-no-evidence-that-mysterious-aerial-sightings-were-alien-ufo-report-101622773476170.html
04-06-2021||World||Israel eyes end of an era after Netanyahu foes strike deal||Israel was approaching the end of an era after the last-minute formation of a motley coalition that could in the next few days oust veteran leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister.Opposition leader Yair Lapid announced the deal just minutes before a midnight Wednesday deadline, prompting celebrations into the early hours by the premier's opponents and a defiant show of support by his fans.On paper, the prospective coalition commands a slender majority in parliament but a confidence vote is not expected for several days, giving Netanyahu time to woo potential defectors among the unlikely bedfellows ranged against him.With the threat of possible jail time hanging over him in his ongoing trial on corruption charges, the 71-year-old is unlikely to allow his record 12 straight years to end without a messy fight, analysts warned.On Thursday, the master political operator was already on Twitter, seeking to play on any last-minute misgivings among right-wing lawmakers about allying with the left against him."All lawmakers who were elected with votes from the right must oppose this dangerous left-wing government," he said.On Twitter, Netanyahu's Likud party called on former right-wing allies to "immediately withdraw" their signatures.The new coalition would see the religious-nationalist Naftali Bennett serve as prime minister for two years before Lapid, a secular centrist, would take the helm.Should last-minute defections scupper the "change" alliance, Israel would likely have to hold yet another election, the fifth in just over two years."Opening the champagne right now is a bit hasty," said Tamar Hermann, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute.'I succeeded'Lapid, 57, a former TV presenter who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party, put his own prime ministerial ambitions on hold to broker the coalition deal."I succeeded," he proclaimed, less than an hour before the deadline."I promise that this government will work in the service of all of the citizens of Israel, those who voted for it and those who did not," he wrote on Facebook.The announcement capped four frenzied weeks of negotiations since President Reuven Rivlin tasked Lapid with trying to form a government after Netanyahu failed.Bennett, 49, an estranged former protege of Netanyahu, was the linchpin of the deal to unseat him.On Sunday, Bennett, head of the far-right Yamina bloc, announced he would join Lapid to end the "madness".On the right, the new coalition includes the hawkish New Hope party of Netanyahu's former ally Gideon Saar, and secular nationalist Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party.Also part of the alliance are the Labor party, the dovish Meretz party, and the centrist Blue and White party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz.For the first time in Israeli's history, the embryonic coalition also includes an Arab Israeli party, the Islamic conservative party Raam.It released pictures of its leader Mansour Abbas signing a coalition agreement alongside Bennett, a staunch supporter of the Jewish settler movement.Speaking on army radio Thursday, Abbas said: "We obtained the legitimacy to influence the Israeli political system and not just to be present there in the Knesset."Raam previously ran as part of the Arab-led Joint List but broke away over differences with its communist and Arab nationalist members. Joint List lawmaker Aida Touma-Sliman said she would oppose the new deal because "getting rid of Netanyahu and keeping his path is a political mistake."Emulate Trump?Allies of Netanyahu lashed out at the coalition.Far-right lawmaker Bezalel Smotrich, head of the Religious Zionism party, attacked the coalition's dependence on the votes of Arab lawmakers and accused Bennett of cooperating with "a terrorism supporter who identifies with Israel's enemies".Yamina member Matan Kahana hit back, telling public radio: "I'm convinced this government will be even more right-wing than the government of Netanyahu."Netanyahu's son Yair called Bennett "filth" in a tweet.Netanyahu biographer Ben Caspit predicted the incumbent would fight the new government tooth and nail, doing everything he could to block its formation and then battling it from the opposition benches if necessary.Caspit said Netanyahu could try to emulate his ally, former US president Donald Trump, who gave an incendiary address to supporters before they launched a deadly raid on the US Capitol."He is trying to burn it all," Caspit said of Netanyahu. "He still thinks he will succeed against all odds."Washington on Thursday assured it would remain a staunch ally of the Jewish state regardless of who is in power."Regardless of what happens, regardless of what government is in place, our stalwart support, our ironclad support for Israel will remain," State Department spokesman Ned Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-eyes-end-of-an-era-after-netanyahu-foes-strike-deal-101622773169074.html
04-06-2021||World||Australia's Victoria detects Delta Covid-19 variant in latest outbreak||Australia's Victoria state authorities said on Friday genomic sequencing has detected for the first time the Delta Covid-19 virus variant among infections in the latest virus outbreak in state capital, Melbourne."That variant is the Delta variant, it is now infamous in India and increasingly found in the United Kingdom. It is a variant of significant concern," Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne.Sutton said the new variant had not been linked to any sequenced Covid-19 infections cases across Australia from hotel quarantine or elsewhere.So far, two Victoria cases have the so-called 'Delta' variant of concern, which is likely the strain that caused the latest devastating wave of Covid-19 in India."It is a concern that it is not linked to other cases but we are chasing down all those primary-case contacts ... and looking into where it might have been acquired," Sutton said.Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, is battling to contain its latest outbreak - 65 cases since May 24 - after more than three months of no cases, placing tough restrictions on movement of people and shutting down large parts of its economy. The government has linked all the cases to a single traveler released from quarantine after testing negative.Melbourne is into a second week of hard lockdown after it was extended for another week until June 10, but some curbs elsewhere were eased in the state from Thursday night.Authorities blamed the extension of tough curbs in Melbourne on the Kappa variant, first detected in India, which they described as a highly infectious strain, although new cases have remained in single digits for eight days in a row.Four new locally acquired cases were reported on Friday, versus three a day earlier.Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have largely helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low at just over 30,100 cases and 910 deaths.More than 4.6 million vaccine doses have been administered as of Wednesday in Australia, which has an adult population of about 20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-detects-delta-covid-19-variant-in-latest-outbreak-101622772597602.html

Many are subsidiaries of companies already included.The sanctions target companies involved in Chinese surveillance technology used to "facilitate repression or serious human rights abuses," which "undermine the security or democratic values of the United States and our allies," according to a White House statement.The initial list published under Trump included major telecoms, construction and technology firms such as China Mobile, China Telecom, video surveillance firm Hikvision, and China Railway Construction Corp.China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) was added in January -- causing S&P to remove the company from its stock index -- and remains on Biden's list.The investment ban takes effect August 2 and current shareholders have a year to divest.Strained relationsThe move was among a series of measures by the White House aimed at the Asian power that have left ties between the two countries severely strained.Earlier in the day before the Biden order was released, Beijing repeated its outrage at the Trump-era blacklist and vowed to protect the rights of Chinese companies, saying the measure was "politically motivated" and "ignores the facts and actual situation" of the firms involved.The ban "severely undermines normal market rules and order" and "damages... the interests of global investors, including US investors," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine briefing.Previously, the sanctions and choice of targets were tied to a congressionally mandated Defense Department report but will be managed by the Treasury Department.While the Biden administration has pledged to take a more diplomatic approach with China following the upheaval of his predecessor, he has said he will keep to a tough line on several issues including defense and technology.Biden has lamented that the United States is falling behind, saying China is "eating our lunch."A tough line on China has rare cross-party support in Congress, with lawmakers determined to keep a lid on its growing global clout.Republican senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, alongside Democrats Gary Peters and Mark Kelly, published a bi-partisan letter earlier this week urging the administration to publish a new list."The US government must continue to act boldly in blocking the Chinese Communist Party's economic predation against our industrial base," they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-blacklists-more-chinese-firms-to-us-investors-over-military-links-101622772492348.html
04-06-2021||World||Trump and I may never see 'eye-to-eye' on Capitol riots: Mike Pence||Former Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that he wasn’t sure that he and former President Donald Trump would ever see “eye to eye” over what happened on Jan. 6 but that he would “always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years.”Pence, speaking at a Republican dinner in the early voting state of New Hampshire, gave his most extensive comments to date on the events of Jan. 6, when angry Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” after the vice president said he did not have the power to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory.“As I said that day, Jan. 6 was a dark day in history of the United States Capitol. But thanks to the swift action of the Capitol Police and federal law enforcement, violence was quelled. The Capitol was secured,” Pence said.“And that same day, we reconvened the Congress and did our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States," Pence continued. “You know, President Trump and I have spoken many times since we left office. And I don’t know if we’ll ever see to eye on that day."It was a rare departure for Pence, who spent four years standing loyally beside his boss amid controversy, investigation and impeachment. It comes as Pence considers his own potential 2024 White House run and as Republicans, some of whom were angry at Trump in the days after the Jan. 6 insurrection, have largely coalesced back around the former president.Pence praised Trump several times during his nearly 35-minute speech at the Hillsborough County Republican Committee’s annual Lincoln-Reagan Awards Dinner in Manchester. He tried to turn the events of Jan. 6 back around on Democrats, saying they wanted to keep the insurrection in the news to divert attention from President Joe Biden's liberal agenda.“I will not allow Democrats or their allies in the media to use one tragic day to discredit the aspirations of millions of Americans. Or allow Democrats or their allies in the media to distract our attention from a new administration intent on dividing our country to advance the radical agenda,” Pence said. "My fellow Republicans, for our country, for our future, for our children and our grandchildren, we must move forward, united.”He accused Biden of campaigning as a moderate but becoming the most liberal president since President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said the administration forced through Congress “a covid bill to fund massive expansion of the welfare state” and was pushing a “so-called infrastructure bill” that was really a “thinly-disguised climate change bill” funded with cuts in the military and historic tax increases.“I just say enough is enough,” he said, adding that “we’re going to stand strong for freedom.”Pence also hit upon several favorite themes of conservative Republicans, emphasizing the need for states to shore up voter integrity around the country. He also praised law enforcement as heroes, suggesting that “Black lives are not endangered by police. Black lives are saved by police every day.”He also pushed back against “critical race theory,” which seeks to reframe the narrative of American history.Its proponents argue that federal law has preserved the unequal treatment of people on the basis of race and that the country was founded on the theft of land and labor. But Republicans have said concepts suggesting that people are inherently racist or that America was founded on racial oppression are divisive and have no place in the classroom.“America is not a racist country,” he said, prompting one of several standing ovations and cheers during his speech.“It is past time for America to discard the left-wing myth of systemic racism,” Pence said. “I commend state legislators and governors across the country for banning critical race theory from our schools.”His choice of states, including that April appearance in South Carolina, is aimed at increasing his visibility as he considers whether to run for the White House in 2024.Trump is increasingly acting and talking like he plans to make a run as he sets out on a more public phase of his post-presidency, beginning with a speech on Saturday in North Carolina.Since leaving office in January, Pence has been doing work with the Heritage Foundation and Young America’s Foundation. His team said he plans more trips, including stops in Texas, California and Michigan.Along with his visits to South Carolina and New Hampshire, Pence has been hitting the fundraising circuit. He is set to speak next week at another fundraiser hosted by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, will travel to North Carolina for a Heritage Foundation donor event, and will then head to California, where he will take part in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute’s speakers’ series, a Republican National Committee donor retreat and a Young America’s Foundation event, according to aides.Among other prominent Republicans, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in April that she would stand down if Trump decided to run in 2024. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has undertaken an aggressive schedule, visiting states that will play a pivotal role in the 2024 primaries and signing a contract with Fox News Channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-and-i-may-never-see-eye-to-eye-on-capitol-riots-mike-pence-101622768142999.html

Tens of thousands defied the ban and rallied anyway in the park.Police later arrested some two dozen democracy figures who attended that rally, some of whom have been given prison sentences, including other members of the Hong Kong Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-detain-democracy-leader-on-tiananmen-anniversary-report-101622767593754.html

04-06-2021||World||After Trump ban, Facebook to end 'newsworthy exception' for politicians: Report||Facebook plans to eliminate an exemption for politicians that allows them to post content deemed deceptive or abusive, and will hold them to the same standards as other users, news website The Verge reported Thursday.The controversial exemption, given to politicians under the auspices of their posts being newsworthy, could end as soon as this week on the leading social network, the news site said.Facebook did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on the matter.The policy reversal would come after an independent oversight board said Facebook was right to oust former president Donald Trump for his comments regarding the deadly January 6 rampage at the US Capitol.Trump was suspended from Facebook and Instagram after posting a video during the attack by his fired-up supporters challenging his election loss, in which he told them: "We love you, you're very special."However, the panel gave Facebook six months to justify why his ban should be permanent -- putting the ball in company chief Mark Zuckerberg's court and spotlighting weaknesses in the platform's plan for self-regulation.Oversight panel co-chair Michael McConnell said in a May 9 interview on Fox News Sunday that Trump encouraged the Capitol rioters and so earned his Facebook ban, but the social media giant's rules are in "shambles" and need fixing.Zuckerberg has stressed his belief that private companies should not be the judges of truth when it comes to what people say.Democrats have slammed online platforms for failing to stem misinformation while Republicans have contended that social networks are biased against conservatives.Facebook is also planning to be more transparent about "strikes" issued to accounts for breaking content rules, according to the Verge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-trump-ban-facebook-to-end-newsworthy-exception-for-politicians-report-101622764699586.html
04-06-2021||World||Harris dials Modi as US gives details of first vaccine tranche||The US will donate six million of its unused coronavirus vaccine doses to India, Mexico, Canada and South Korea, President Joe Biden said on Thursday, after which Vice President Kamala Harris called up several world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the decision.Modi said he “deeply appreciated” the assurance of supplies to India and thanked Harris for the support and solidarity from the US government.The donations are part of a first tranche of 25 million doses, of which 19 million will go to the Covax Facility, a WHO-led vaccine distribution mechanism among low- and middle-income countries. The remaining six million will be shared directly with a clutch of countries, including India.India will also receive some of the Covax doses, of which six million will be sent to a list of 16 Asian nations including India.The White House also announced it was lifting restrictions invoked under the Defense Production Act that will allow sharing of raw materials needed for the AstraZeneca, as well as Sanofi and Novavax vaccines, which are also not authorised in the US.“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” President Joe Biden said, adding, “And the US is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.”Overall, the White House aims to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most of them through Covax.Although country-specific allocations are not available at present, India is expected to be the largest beneficiary from the dose given to Covax. This will be in addition to the $100 million worth of supplies such as oxygen converters, PPE and therapeutics already sent by the Biden administration, along with relief worth $400 mn more from private sector companies and individuals.Vice-President Kamala Harris called PM Modi, Mexico’s President Andres Manuel López Obrador, Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei, and Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley to personally convey to them the US decision to send them vaccines, along with other countries.“Spoke to @VP Kamala Harris a short while ago. I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing. I also thanked her for the all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora,” said Modi in a tweet after the phone call.“We also discussed ongoing efforts to further strengthen India-US vaccine cooperation, and the potential of our partnership to contribute to post-Covid global health and economic recovery,” he added.The ministry of external affairs in New Delhi later released a statement saying Modi “expressed the hope to welcome Vice President Harris in India” once the pandemic abatedBiden previously announced that the US will share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with the rest of the world, including 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India) vaccine, which America had ordered but has no plans of using, and 20 million shots of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.More than 50% of Americans and 60% of the eligible population of 12 years of order have received at least one dose.A White House official later said the AstraZeneca doses Biden promised to share have still not been cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration.Numbers in a factsheet issued separately by the White House on the vaccine donations were somewhat different from what Biden announced, but people familiar with these developments pointed to President Biden’s statement as the final word.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the allocation formula was shaped by “factors” that included the goal of achieving global coverage, “surges and other specific urgent situations” and public health needs, and the aim to help as many countries as possible that had requested vaccines, and neighbours.“This is only the beginning,” Sullivan said, pointing to the US president’s commitment to share 80 million doses in all by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-dials-modi-as-us-gives-details-of-first-vaccine-tranche-101622765736656.html
04-06-2021||World||UNSC to meet on June 8 to recommend next secretary-general||The U.N. Security Council will meet June 8 to make its recommendation for the next secretary-general and almost certainly approve current U.N. chief Antonio Guterres who is the only candidate.The recommendation from the 15-member council will then be sent to the president of the 193-member General Assembly, which must approve a resolution selecting the world’s top diplomat.The Security Council revised its program of work late Thursday to add a private meeting next Tuesday morning entitled “Recommendation for the appointment of the secretary-general of the United Nations.”Estonia’s Ambassador Sven Jurgenson, the council president for June, told a news conference Tuesday that even though there is only one candidate “the process is still the same.”Traditionally, candidates for the U.N.’s top job have been nominated by a U.N. member state, but that is not a requirement in the U.N. Charter or a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2015 that made the previously largely secretive selection of the secretary-general more open and transparent. It allowed the world body’s member states for the first time to see basic information about all candidates, including their resumes, and to meet and question them at open sessions.Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister and U.N. refugee chief, was elected by the assembly to succeed Ban Ki-moon after a hotly contested and transparent race in October 2016 that initially included 13 candidates -- seven women and six men. Guterres took office on Jan. 1, 2017.This year, seven individuals submitted applications to be secretary-general without backing from any government, including most recently former Ecuadorian President Rosalia Arteaga.Guterres, whose five-year term ends Dec. 31, was the only applicant nominated by a U.N. member state, his home country Portugal. He followed the 2015 process, holding a lengthy open question and answer session with U.N. diplomats in the General Assembly last month and then meeting privately with Security Council members.General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir told reporters last month “the rule” is that an applicant can only become a candidate when a letter signed jointly by the presidents of the assembly and the Security Council is sent to all member states.He said, “It looks like the Security Council has the opinion that, traditionally, only applicants supported by a country can become a candidate,” so the only joint letter has been sent on behalf of Guterres. Estonia’s Jurgenson confirmed the council’s position, noting the other applicants but telling reporters Tuesday that “legally and officially only states can present candidates.”Jurgenson said the Security Council will hold a private meeting and adopt a communique on the discussion and outcome. Then, a draft resolution will be circulated with the council’s selection, which hopefully will be adopted by acclamation though any member can call for a vote, he said.Jurgenson said he will then send the resolution to the assembly president with a letter, and Bozkir will then decide when to hold a General Assembly meeting to adopt the recommendation in a resolution. “Hopefully, it will all happen quite soon, inside one week or so,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-to-meet-next-week-to-recommend-next-secretarygeneral-101622764543323.html

The 62-year-old left his home to go for dinner at a restaurant, and was never seen again. A manhunt ensued amid swirling rumours that he fled to Cuba. Three days later, Choksi was apprehended in Dominica on the basis of an Interpol yellow notice, triggering frantic efforts by India to deport him.Choksi was put in jail and his lawyers, and wife Priti, alleged he was abducted with the help of a woman, brought to Dominica, and tortured in custody. Meanwhile, India sent a private jet and a team of investigators to convince Dominican authorities to repatriate the fugitive.He is now part of two legal cases: one in a Dominican court on charges of illegally entering the island and another at the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) on a habeas corpus petition filed by his lawyers.‘Illegal entry charge’On June 2, after Dominican authorities alleged that he entered the country illegally, justice Bernie Stephenson at ECSC ordered that Choksi will face “illegal entry” charges. Following ECSC’s order, Choksi was produced in court, where he pleaded “not guilty” and sought bail. A Dominican state attorney Sherma Dalrymple said Choksi entered the country illegally and deemed him a “flight risk”. The magistrate refused bail. adjourning the matter to June 14.India, not a party yetIndia is not a party to the ECSC proceedings in the habeas corpus, or writ that seeks to bring a prisoner or detainee before the court to determine if the detention is lawful. Legal experts said for India to seek Choksi’s deportation, a separate plea will have to be filed.Dominica’s positionThe island nation is yet to make it clear whether it is keen to repatriate Choksi to India. On May 27, Dominica issued a statement that it would repatriate Choksi to Antigua once details of his citizenship are ascertained.Vocal Antigua and Barbuda PM Gaston BrowneBrowne has said he will not accept Choksi back, and that Dominica should hand him over to India. He has denied allegations of Choksi’s lawyers and opposition that the fugitive was abducted by the country’s police and with Indian agents.The jet and India’s silenceAuthorities in New Delhi have been silent over reports of a private jet sent last Friday along with a team of 7-8 officials, and case files and documents to prove that Choksi is one of the top white-collar criminals wanted in India.The mystery womanBrowne claimed Choksi left the country with his “girlfriend”, who has not been traced. Choksi’s lawyer said the woman was friendly with the Choksi family, and invited him to her house the day he went missing.Wife fears for his lifePriti Choksi has alleged that her husband was abducted. She told HT that if he is sent to India, his life would be in danger.The citizenship questionOfficials said that Choksi’s Indian citizenship was not cancelled when he surrendered his passport, grounds on which it will oppose arguments that he is an Antiguan citizen and should be sent there.What next?After India submits documents in the court in Dominica seeking Choksi’s deportation, it will be heard in the court whether he should be sent to India or Antigua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-entry-charge-to-citizenship-question-decoding-the-cases-101622756290041.html
04-06-2021||World||IMF, World Bank ask G7 to release surplus Covid-19 shots, call vaccine makers to ramp up production||The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on Thursday urged the Group of Seven advanced economies to release any excess Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, and called on manufacturers to ramp up production.In a joint statement to the G7, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass also called on governments, pharmaceutical companies and groups involved in vaccine procurement to boost transparency about contracting, financing and deliveries."Distributing vaccines more widely is both an urgent economic necessity and a moral imperative," they said. "The coronavirus pandemic will not end until everyone has access to vaccines, including people in developing countries."Malpass and Georgieva will meet in person on Friday and Saturday with finance officials from the G7 countries - Britain, the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - with the Covid-19 pandemic set to be a central topic.Both organizations welcomed US plans to distribute the first 25 million of 80 million vaccine doses that Washington has pledged to share globally by the end of this month."It’s a good start, and I am hoping that more doses will be made available, especially for countries with deployment programs," Malpass told Reuters.The novel coronavirus has killed more than 3.7 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.While about half the population in the United States has received at least one dose of the vaccine, the percentage in developing countries is still in the single digits, said Mamta Murthi, vice president for human development at the World Bank.The World Bank, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization this week endorsed a $50 billion IMF plan to end the pandemic by expanding access to vaccines.Malpass and Georgieva said vaccines should be shared as soon as possible, in a transparent manner, with developing countries that have adequate distribution plans in place.They also called for a bigger push to increase transparency regarding vaccine contracts, options and agreements; vaccine financing and delivery agreements; and doses delivered and future delivery plans.Murthi told Reuters the World Bank had published data on the $2.4 billion it has already committed to help 25 developing countries buy vaccines, and was urging other multilateral banks to do the same, to improve planning and better target aid."It's like the blind man and the elephant," she said. "No one really knows how much capacity is out there, how much has been dedicated to whom, what is the remainder that can be ordered, when are the deliveries scheduled for, and so on."She said it was critical to ensure that countries receiving doses had logistics in place, noting that Malawi had actually destroyed some doses that were nearing expiration dates because it was unable to deliver the doses in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-world-bank-ask-g7-to-release-surplus-covid-19-shots-call-vaccine-makers-to-ramp-up-production-101622750325922.html

Work from home where you can, and practice ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ at all times.If you are eligible and have not already done so, please come forward to be vaccinated and make sure you get your second jab. It will save lives,” she said. According to the breakdown of official figures, this week 278 people with the Delta variant attended hospital in an emergency.Last week, 201 people attended hospital.“Once again, the majority of these had not been vaccinated,” PHE said.The areas most affected by the Delta variant remain in the north west of England with Bolton, where cases have risen by 795 to 2149, and Blackburn with Darwen which has seen 368 new cases, bringing it to 724 in total.PHE said there are “encouraging signs” that the transmission rate in Bolton has begun to fall and that the actions taken by residents and local authority teams have been successful in reducing spread.Experts continue to urge people to “remain cautious” as the country approaches the next stage of the roadmap, with June 21 scheduled as a date for an end of all lockdown restrictions.“Variant cases are on the increase in several areas and it is absolutely crucial that everyone plays their part in preventing their spread,” PHE said.In Bolton, local teams have gone door to door in targeted areas on consecutive weekends to distribute test kits, share vital safety messages and encourage people to get the vaccine at a local drop-in centre.Take up of both testing and the vaccine was described as "positive".Blackburn with Darwen has also seen local teams making door-to-door visits, and over 10,000 additional PCR tests have been given out.Mobile testing units have been deployed to the area and wastewater sampling continues, in order to track the spread of the variant.PHE said its health protection teams continue to work with local authorities and schools to carry out surveillance of Covid-19 cases in schools to understand and reduce transmission in these settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-now-dominant-in-uk-as-cases-rise-by-5-472-in-a-week-101622749767449.html
04-06-2021||World||'Unacceptable': Iran says as UN suspends country's voting rights||Iran on Thursday slammed the United Nations' decision to suspend its voting rights for failing to pay its dues as "fundamentally flawed, entirely unacceptable and completely unjustified".Tehran argues that the $16.2 million it owes to the UN is the result of Washington's crippling sanctions, imposed after former president Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from a nuclear deal with Iran.Iran's voting rights at the UN General Assembly were suspended in January under rules for countries whose arrears are equal to or exceed their contributions due for the past two years.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif expressed his "strong dismay" at the loss of voting rights, in a letter sent Thursday to UN chief Antonio Guterres."Iran's inability to fulfil its financial obligation toward the United Nations is directly caused by 'unlawful unilateral sanctions' imposed by the United States," Zarif wrote, according to the letter posted on his Twitter account.Zarif said Iran rejected the suspension of its voting privileges because Tehran's "incapacity to transfer its financial contribution has been entirely beyond its control".Guterres, in a May 28 letter to the UN General Assembly, said five nations were barred from voting due to their failure to pay arrears, but added the UN could permit them to vote if it were deemed to be "due to conditions beyond the control" of the member state.Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres, said there had been "very intense discussion" with Iran to find a solution."It is not from lack of trying, either on our side or their side... but the country falls under a number of bilateral sanctions which makes it a bit challenging," Dujarric told reporters."These discussions are continuing in good faith."Zarif urged the UN leadership to "remain true to the purposes and principles" of the UN charter, and to "refrain from any decision that betrays the spirit of sovereign equality of member states, and weakens multilateralism."The US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and re-imposition of sanctions led to Iran stepping up its nuclear activities.US President Joe Biden has signalled his readiness to revive the accord, and global powers have been meeting in Vienna since early April in a bid to do so, with a fresh round of talks slated to begin next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unacceptable-iran-says-as-un-suspends-country-s-voting-rights-101622749007597.html
04-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to tell Vladimir Putin to act against Russia's ransomware criminals||President Joe Biden will press President Vladimir Putin at their meeting this month to crack down on criminal hackers based in Russia, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.The US president’s message at the one-on-one meeting in Geneva on June 16 will be that “responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals, and responsible countries must take decisive action against those ransomware networks,” Psaki said.Hackers have disrupted critical US services in a series of attacks, demanding that companies pay a ransom to unfreeze data and computers. Victims have included Colonial Pipeline Co. and JBS SA, the world’s largest meat processor.Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday that Biden’s message needs to be clear and definitive: “You continue to do this, you will pay a price. Period,” Panetta said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” program.“President Biden has to make very clear that there are lines here that the Russians cannot cross,” Panetta, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he said. “Putin only understands very strong talk.”Although Panetta, a former Democratic congressman, didn’t specify what steps could be taken against Russia, he mentioned that the US has developed capabilities to mount offensive cyber operations.US officials have determined that criminal hacking groups behind the attacks were probably operating from Russia. The Russian government has denied knowing about or being involved in the attacks, a claim that Panetta said he doesn’t believe.“These criminal organizations are operating under the cover of the Russian government, and they’re basically doing what the Russian government supports, which is to undermine the United States of America,” Panetta said.The Biden administration also needs to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that involves working with the private sector and developing cutting-edge technologies, Panetta said.Panetta added that it’s “dangerous” for companies to keep paying ransoms to hackers. “If they pay off these ransoms, what they do is they send a signal to these criminal organizations to continue to do what they’re doing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-tell-vladimir-putin-to-act-against-russia-s-ransomware-criminals-101622748747675.html
04-06-2021||World||US lawmakers welcome announcement on global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines||Top American lawmakers on Thursday welcomed the decision of the Biden Administration to ship 25 million Covid-19 vaccines abroad, including India.“I welcome the news that the Biden Administration will be sending 25 million vaccine doses to our partners abroad to help them combat their COVID-19 outbreaks, but this is an unfortunately small step forward when drastic, rapid action is needed,” Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses - of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa as part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally by the end of June.Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and three other world leaders and informed them that the US will start sharing the first 25 million (2.5 crore) doses of Covid vaccines to their respective countries.Krishnamoorthi, 47, said US can put more efforts in the direction.“As coronavirus outbreaks continue to rage across the world, we’ve passed the time to talk about millions of doses —- we need to be talking about billions, and how we can distribute and administer them as soon as possible to save lives both abroad and in the United States,” he said.“That means dramatically expanding our vaccine production capacity into the billions, our rate of vaccine procurement, and the scale of our international partnerships to ensure that vaccines reach those who need them, and that we effectively protect ourselves in the process,” he added.Krishnamoorthi said that he will be introducing a legislation next week to address these challenges and to end the pandemic across the world to prevent new variants from sparking another Covid-19 outbreak in America.Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the founding Co-chair of the Caribbean American Caucus and a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, praised Biden and his administration for his announcement in this regard.“Let me be very clear: As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, we are all still vulnerable. I am proud the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated right here at home,” she said.“The allocation of approximately 6 million doses to the Caribbean and Latin America is a poignant step in the right direction that will dramatically stem the tide of COVID’s deadly progression in the region,” Clarke said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-welcome-announcement-on-global-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccines-101622747460077.html
04-06-2021||World||US announces plan to share Covid-19 vaccines with India, others||The United States on Thursday announced it will send 6 million of the first lot of 25 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to India, Mexico, Canada and South Korea, saying “it’s only the beginning”. The remaining 19 million doses will go to other countries through the World Health Organization-run Covax initiative for equitable global access to vaccines.India will also get vaccines from the tranche going through Covax, as 7 million doses are earmarked for distribution in Asia (India and 15 other countries and entities). Though country-specific allocations are not available at present, India is expected to be the largest beneficiary from this lot. This will be in addition to the $100 million worth of supplies such as oxygen converters, PPE and therapeutics already sent by the Biden administration, along with relief worth $400 million more from private sector companies and individuals.“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” President Joe Biden, said, adding, “And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.”US VICE-PRESIDENT CALLS INDIAN PMUS vice-president Kamala Harris called Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mexico’s President Andres Manuel López Obrador, Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei, and chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Keith Rowley to personally convey to them the US decision to send them vaccines, along with other countries.Calls had been growing over past weeks and days to send India a generous consignment of Covid-19 vaccines in view of the devastating second wave of the pandemic. “So far, the country of over 1.3 billion has delivered first doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 12% of its population, including 3% who are fully vaccinated,” Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the US Senate, wrote in a letter to the president on Tuesday, adding, “I urge you to send a robust allotment of Covid-19 vaccine doses to India to help bring a swift end to this global crisis.”THE SHARING FORMULAPresident Biden has said the United States will share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with the rest of the world, including 60 million doses of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which America had ordered but has no plans of using, and 20 million shots of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that it can spare, because of its own rising number of vaccinations (more than 50% of Americans and 60% of the eligible population of 12 years of order, have received at least one dose).At least 75% of these 25 million doses - nearly 19 million - will be shared through Covax, which is run jointly by WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, according to a statement issued by President Biden. It will include about 6 million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 7 million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately 5 million for African. The remaining doses, just over 6 million, will be shared directly with countries “experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners and neighbours”, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.Numbers in a factsheet issued separately by the White House were somewhat different, but people familiar with these developments pointed to President Biden’s statement as the final word. The factsheet said 19 million will be shared through Covax, and will go to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Haiti, and other CARICOM countries, as well as the Dominican Republic.Nearly 7 million will go to Asia for distribution among India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands.About 5 million were set aside for Africa, to be shared in coordination with the African Union, and approximately 6 million will be “targeted” towards regional priorities and partner recipients, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the allocation formula was shaped by “factors” that included the goal of achieving global coverage, “surges and other specific urgent situations” and public health needs, and the aim to help as many countries as possible, that had requested vaccines, and neighbours.“This is only the beginning,” Sullivan said, pointing to the US president’s commitment to share 80 million doses in all by the end of June. “This is a unique moment in history, and it requires American leadership, American science and ingenuity, American perseverance, and the world’s democracies to step up to the plate. Today, I’m proud to say that that effort is underway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-plan-to-share-covid-19-vaccines-with-india-others-101622744052689.html
