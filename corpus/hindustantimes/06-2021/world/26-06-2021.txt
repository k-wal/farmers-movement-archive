That has raised questions over whether lockdown restrictions will end as planned.Daily cases have risen fairly sharply over the past few weeks after fluctuating around the 2,000 mark earlier. The delta variant, which was first identified in India and is considered by government scientists to be between 40per cent to 80per cent more transmissible than the previous dominant strain, accounts for nearly all the new cases in the UK.Also Read| UK minister Matt Hancock, who broke Covid-19 rules by kissing aide, resignsMost of the new confirmed cases are among younger age groups which haven't yet received Covid-19 vaccines.The latest spike came as hundreds of walk-in vaccination sites, including at stadiums and shopping centers, opened in England over the weekend in a bid to boost vaccine numbers, particularly among those younger age groups."This is a phenomenal achievement and it's fantastic to see so many young people coming forward for their jabs, doing their bit to protect themselves and their loved ones," Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said.The spread of the variant upended the Conservative government's plans to lift all remaining restrictions on social contact in England this week.The plan is to lift those restrictions on July 19, but whether it will do so could largely depend on whether the vaccine rollout has created a firewall that protects the most vulnerable.The other parts of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are following similar plans.The hope is that the link between infections and those needing hospitalization and subsequently dying has broken because of the rapid rollout of vaccines. As of Saturday, nearly two-thirds of the UK population have received at least one vaccine dose while 48per cent have had two.Also Read| B'desh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variantRecent analysis from Public Health England showed that two doses of the main vaccines the UK is using are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant — 96per cent in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 92per cent for the AstraZeneca jab.Though the number of people in hospitals and dying have been edging up over the past couple of weeks, they haven't risen at the same rate as infections.On Saturday, the government said another 227 people have been hospitalized, taking the total to 1,505, nowhere near the 40,000 levels recorded earlier in the year during the peak of a second surge. Virus-related deaths also remained relatively low at 23, taking the death total to 128,089.Worries about the vaccines were heard as thousands of anti-lockdown protesters marched through central London on Saturday. Some even threw tennis balls into Downing Street, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has his office and residence. “Shame on you,” some chanted.Johnson meanwhile was facing widespread calls to fire Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has apologized for breaching social distancing rules after a newspaper ran pictures of him embracing aide Gina Coladangelo.She's a friend of Hancock's from their days together at Oxford University and was appointed to his department last year.The Sun tabloid also late Friday published a video of the embrace, which has prompted the main opposition Labour Party to deem his position “hopelessly untenable." Some Conservative lawmakers have also called on Hancock to quit because he wasn't practicing what he has been preaching during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-records-18-270-new-covid-19-cases-highest-single-day-spike-since-february-5-101624730183572.html

It said the settlement involved two prescription painkillers — developed by a subsidiary and accounting for less than 1% of the market — that are already no longer sold in the US.The settlement was “not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company," Johnson & Johnson said. It added that its actions “relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible.”The settlement was the latest development in the complicated universe of opioid-related lawsuits across the US that has drawn comparisons to the multistate litigation against tobacco companies in the 1990s. It reflects a path being taken by some big drug companies that see settling as in their best interests, in part because that route would likely not cost as much as losing in court repeatedly.Johnson & Johnson — along with distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — made public last year that they were offering a total of $26 billion over 18 years to settle all the cases they face, with the money going to abate the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-agrees-to-pay-230-million-to-new-york-to-settle-opioid-claim-101624729364098.html

The image was taken with a Hubble Space Telescope operated by Nasa and European Space Agency (ESA). The image shows two galaxies that are in the final stages of merging.The astronomers expect a powerful inflow of gas to ignite a frenzied burst of star formation in the resulting compact starburst galaxy, according to ESA. In 2008, The same interacting pair of galaxies, IC 1623, was captured by Hubble using two filters at optical and infrared wavelengths on the Advanced Camera for Surveys.The latest image of the interacting galaxy pair incorporates data from Wide Field Camera 3, Hubble's most technologically advanced instrument to take images in the visible spectrum, and combines observations taken in eight filters spanning infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths to reveal the finer details of IC 1623.Also Read | Mystery of ‘see-through’ galaxy deepens after new Hubble observation: NasaESA said that future observations of the galaxy pair using the James Webb Space Telescope, the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope targeted for the October 31 launch, will shed more light on the processes powering extreme star formation in environments such as IC 1623.Webb is Nasa’s next space science observatory, which will help in solving the mysteries of the solar system and probing the mystifying structures and origins of our universe. It is an international program led by Nasa, along with its partners ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.A team of scientists will train Webb on six of the most distant and luminous quasars, the active supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. The Webb telescope will actually look back in time as light from these distant quasars began its journey to Webb when the universe was very young and took billions of years to arrive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dazzling-dynamic-duo-hubble-captures-galaxy-pair-in-final-stages-of-merging-101624729136094.html

What will be the most unique part of this cruise is that nearly all - 99% - passengers aboard the ship will be vaccinated against the infectious coronavirus disease.Named Celebrity Edge, the cruise will depart from Florida's Fort Lauderdale at 6 pm on Saturday. The number of passengers on the ship has been limited to about 40% of the capacity. The cruise is meeting the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines which require at least 95% of the people to be vaccinated.On the Celebrity Edge, 99% of the passengers are vaccinated, according to Celebrity Cruises, a royal Caribbean cruise brand.In the set of restrictions for passengers on the Celebrity Edge, the authorities are asking for proof of vaccination, as prescribed by the CDC. A new Florida law also bans businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination.Those who wish to join the cruise will be asked to share their vaccination status and those who do not show proof of being vaccinated against the disease will face additional restrictions.The cruise lines are returning to business signalling cheer for the sector which will see Carnival vessels slated to depart from other ports next month.Marking another first, the ship will be led by Captain Kate McCue - the first American woman to captain the cruise ship. The $1 billion boat offers a giant spa and multi floor suites.“Words can't describe how excited we are to be a part of this historic sailing today,” Elizabeth Rosner told AP. The 28-year-old moved from Michigan to Orlando, Florida, in December 2019 with her fiance just to be close to the cruise industry's hub.Scarred by the memories of ships and cruises forced to be stranded after finding Covid-19 cases and isolated without much assistance from the outside world, the industry officials are keeping their fingers crossed. They are hoping to move past the episodes from last year which saw many ships getting rejected at ports and passengers getting isolated when the world was still coming to terms with the disease outbreak.While some passengers died of Covid-19 at sea, others fell so ill they had to be carried out of the vessels on stretchers.Witnessing the crisis unfold, the CDC put no-sail orders repeatedly last year as the pandemic raged, and came up with strict requirements for the industry that have already been contested in court by the state of Florida.On Saturday, officials at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale said only that the port lost more than $30 million in revenue in fiscal year 2020 from the cruise shutdown.During that hiatus, Carnival, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, the three largest cruise companies, have had to raise more than $40 billion in financing just to stay afloat. Collectively they lost $20 billion last year and another $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Couples are getting a second shot at designing special memories with vaccines playing the role of artillery. The pandemic forced Kurt and Carol Budde to cancel their beach celebration wedding aboard the world's largest ship, Symphony of the Seas, in March 2020. Covid-19 halted cruising six days before they were scheduled to tie the knot in St. Maarten. Kurt Budde's part-time gig as a travel agent also dried up.“It's a honeymoon make-up cruise,” said Kurt Budde, sporting matching shirts with the phrase “On Cruise Control."“We are living our best lives post Covid-19 today," he said.With inputs from AP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-1st-post-pandemic-cruise-to-set-sail-with-99-passengers-vaccinated-101624722305076.html

The authors in an article on The Wire said that the coronavirus left traces in the DNA of people in modern China, Japan and Vietnam.The research by Yassine Souilmi and Ray Tobler was published in Current Biology and found evidence of genetic adaptation to the coronavirus family of viruses in 42 genes in modern populations in the regions.Also read| Membrane proteins of bacteria and humans show surprising similarities: Research"Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations," the study said.It also said that by learning about the ancient viral foes, the research highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future.The authors in their article said that the coronavirus family also includes the related MERS and SARS viruses, both of which have caused significant deadly outbreaks in the past 20 years. The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far taken more than 3.8 million deaths and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide, they added."We have had pandemics before. In the 20th century alone, three variants of the influenza virus each resulted in wide-ranging outbreaks that killed millions: the “Spanish Flu” of 1918-20, the “Asian Flu” of 1957-58, and the “Hong Kong Flu” of 1968-69," their article in The Wire read.According to the authors, the historical records of an outbreak due to the virus and other pathogens goes back thousands of years and that the adaptations of our ancestors from Africa to across the world and their introduction to new pathogens and other challenges may have improved their resistance to infection and helped them survive.Souilmi and Tobler said they applied cutting-edge computational analyses to the genomes of more than 2,500 people from 26 populations around the world and found signatures of adaptions in 42 different human genes that encode virus-interacting proteins (VIP)s.Also read: Study suggests correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths"These VIP signals were present in only five populations, all of them from East Asia – the likely ancestral homeland of the coronavirus family. This suggests the ancestors of modern East Asians were initially exposed to coronaviruses around 25,000 years ago," Souilmi and Tobler said.They said more testing revealed that the 42 VIPs are primarily expressed in the lungs, which is the tissue most affected by Covid symptoms. They claimed to have confirmed that these VIPs interact directly with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the present pandemic.Further, they said that several VIP genes are either currently being used as drug targets for Covid treatments or are part of clinical trials as they said that independent studies have shown mutations in VIP genes may help mediate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the severity of Covid-19 symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-struck-east-asia-over-20-000-years-ago-study-101624723101286.html

While the majority of Republicans sided with Trump during his historic second impeachment, seven GOP senators and three House Republicans decided to vote against the party line, earning the wrath of the former president.Trump has decided to campaign against the Republicans who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting January 6 riots that left five dead including a Capitol Police officer. One of them is House Representative Anthony Gonzalez, seeking re-election in 2022 and former White House aide Max Miller has emerged as his challenger for the primaries after Trump endorsed him.“We’re giving tremendous endorsements,” Trump told the conservative Newsmax channel on Friday. “Fake Republicans, anybody that voted for the impeachment doesn’t get it.

The current resurgence could be worse than the second wave, the minister said.South Africa on Friday recorded another 18,000 infections with 215 deaths.While South Africa's second coronavirus surge was due to Beta variant, experts have said that the variant first found in India is a likely factor in the third wave. The continent's worst-affected nation in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths, accounts for roughly a third of confirmed infections and more than 40% of the deaths recorded across Africa.The South African government is expecting that the peak of the third wave would surpass that of the second wave in January, when more than 21,000 new daily cases were recorded.The Delta variant has been listed as 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Delta variant that’s been running rampant in South Africa is 30% to 60% more transmissible than other strains, including the Beta variant, first identified in the African nation last year, Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, said at the same briefing.At present, the Delta variant has been traced in other countries like France, Germany, Norway and Hawaii which are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases.The highly transmissible variant which the experts have termed to be more infectious than other variants is responsible for at least 9-10% of the total new confirmed cases in France, officials said. This is in sharp contrast to 2-4% of the cases seen last week in France."A new variant seems to be not only arising, but it seems to start dominating the infections in South Africa," Professor Tulio de Oliveira at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told a news conference."It completely took over," he said, adding that the Delta variant was more transmissible even than the Beta variant.De Oliveira said there appeared to be community transmission of the Delta variant in KwaZulu-Natal province and that scientists were analysing the data for Gauteng, the province where the biggest city Johannesburg is located.President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the country on Sunday evening on his planned response to curb the spread of the virus after a special cabinet meeting, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-india-delta-variant-driving-south-africa-s-covid-19-surge-scientists-101624715505430.html

Nasa engineer Vandi Verma explains||Nasa’s Perseverance rover captured the historic selfie beside the Ingenuity Mars helicopter on the Red Planet on April 6, which proved to be one of the most complex rover selfies ever taken. While selfies primarily allow engineers to check wear and tear on the rover, they can also inspire a new generation of space enthusiasts. Vandi Verma, Perseverance’s chief engineer for robotic operations at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, bears testimony of this.Verma said that a picture from Sojourner, Nasa’s first Mars rover, sparked her interest in the US space agency. Verma worked as a driver for Nasa’s Opportunity and Curiosity rovers and helped to create Curiosity’s first selfie, which was taken on October 31, 2012. “When we took that first selfie, we didn’t realize these would become so iconic and routine,” she said.Also Read | Astronomers find out when first stars shone, could be seen by Nasa’s Webb telescopeSo how does a rover take a selfie?In a video posted by Nasa’s JPL, Verma said that the way the rover takes a selfie is a “little more complex” than taking a selfie from our smartphones. The rover uses the WATSON (Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering) camera attached at the end of the robotic arm. But the WATSON camera was designed to take close-up images of rocks for scientific analysis and not wide-angle images.Since even the full extension of the arm can’t cover the entire rover in a single image, engineers had to command the rover to take dozens of individual images and then stitch them together to produce the selfie. To do that, the engineers try to hold the WATSON camera sensor in the same position to take different images.“The reason you don't see the robotic arm in the selfie is because it's moving between the different image frames that we are taking, and we include enough overlap between the images so that when we stitch them together, we don't have to include the arm,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-perseverance-rover-took-historic-selfie-with-ingenuity-nasa-engineer-vandi-verma-explains-101624715860337.html
26-06-2021||World||Bangladesh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variant||The rapid spread of a more virulent version of coronavirus, B.1.617.2, also known as the Delta variant, has forced several countries to rethink their roadmap out of lockdown and many of them have started imposing fresh restrictions fearing another wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday revealed that the variant, first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 countries, terming it the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far.” Britain has already extended the full reopening of businesses by four weeks after the country started reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases, with the Delta variant becoming the dominant strain.London mayor Sadiq Khan warned that the reopening scheduled for July 19 could be at risk unless enough people get vaccinated. “Unless sufficient numbers of Londoners have the jab it makes it more likely that we won’t be able to fully reopen on 19 July,” said Khan after attending a vaccine summit in London.Also Read | As Delta variant cases rise, WHO asks fully vaccinated to keep masks onHere’s the list of countries and territories that have announced fresh curbs:Taiwan: The self-governed island reported its first domestically transmitted case of Delta variant on Saturday. Six people in Pingtung county had been confirmed to have the Delta variant, of which one has been classified as a domestic infection, according to Taiwan health minister Chen Shih-Chung. The government will tighten border controls to keep out the Delta variant, requiring arrivals from five countries to be placed in centralised quarantine facilities.Australia: Australia’s New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced a two-week lockdown across all of Greater Sydney, including the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong. The stay-at-home order will remain in effect until July 9. According to health authorities, expansion of curbs was needed after more infections were recorded, with exposure sites increasing beyond the initial areas of concern.Bangladesh: India’s neighbouring country announced a tougher lockdown starting Monday due to a “dangerous and alarming” surge in Delta variant cases. As per the fresh guidelines, all offices, government and private, will be shut for a week. The government said in a statement that no one can step out of their homes except in emergency cases.“It is a dangerous and alarming situation. If we don’t contain it now, we will face an India-like situation,” health department spokesperson Robed Amin told news agency AFP, referring to the catastrophic second wave of Covid-19 in India.Also Read | Can Indians travel to Germany, South Korea, US?

More than 70% of coronavirus cases in the Lisbon area are from the Delta variant, which is said to be rapidly spreading to other parts of the country. Portugal is witnessing a surge in infections after the tourism-dependent nation opened to visitors from the European Union and Britain in mid-May. On Friday, the country reported 1,604 new cases, the biggest daily rise since February 19, when the country was still under lockdown.Indonesia: Indonesia on Thursday confirmed a daily high of 20,574 new Covid-19 cases, a jump of more than 5,000 from the previous day. The rise in cases prompted the government to announce the tightening of neighbourhood-level social restrictions in high-risk "red zones" for two weeks, starting last Tuesday. Offices, restaurants, cafes and malls have been allowed to operate at 25% capacity. Earlier this month, Indonesian officials revealed that more than 350 doctors and medical workers have been infected and dozens hospitalised despite being vaccinated with Sinovac, raising concerns about the vaccine against more infectious variants like Delta and Alpha.Russia: Moscow authorities have ordered bars and restaurants from Monday to serve people only if they can present a QR-code showing they have been vaccinated, had an infection indicating immunity or recently tested negative. Russia is facing a surge in coronavirus cases that authorities blame on the Delta variant and slow progress in vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-australia-list-of-countries-imposing-fresh-curbs-due-to-delta-variant-101624710650640.html

I have had love and respect from India [more] than any one because cricket is a big sport. It’s almost religion in both the countries,” the legendary former cricketer said.He expressed disappointment on being unable to normalise trade ties with India despite reaching out after assuming office, adding that a “civilised trading relationship” would be beneficial for both countries.“So when I assumed office, the first thing I did was I made this approach to Prime Minister Modi and said that, 'Look, my main objective for coming to power is to alleviate poverty in Pakistan.' And the best way would be if India and Pakistan had a normal, civilised trading relationship. It would benefit both the countries,” Khan said.“I think that it is a peculiar ideology of the RSS, which Narendra Modi belongs to, which just came up against a brick wall. And, therefore, the answer to your question is yes. Had there been another Indian leadership, I think we would have had a good relationship with them. And yes, we would have resolved all our differences through dialogue,” he added.Also Read: Pakistan fails to get out of FATF’s grey listKhan also spoke at length about the kind of foreign relation he envisions Pakistan having with the US after the process of withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan concludes, stating it is similar to the kind of relation the US shares with UK and India US. Which would be more “even handed” than the one both countries shared during the “war on terror”. During which the “US felt that they were giving aid to Pakistan, they felt that Pakistan then had to do US’s bidding,”"Now, after the US leaves Afghanistan, basically Pakistan would want a civilised relationship, which you have between nations, and we would like to improve our trading relationship with the US,” he said.Khan expressed uncertainty about the kind of military relationship that the two countries would share post US withdrawal from Afghanistan."Post the US withdrawal, I don’t know what sort of military relationship it will be. But right now, the relationship should be based on this common objective that there is a political solution in Afghanistan before the United States leaves," he said.On being asked if Pakistan will recognise a Taliban led government in Afghanistan Khan stated, “Pakistan will only recognize a government which is chosen by the people of Afghanistan, whichever government they choose."While pledging his full support to the President Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan, he asserted that Pakistan will not be taking “military action” against Taliban, and in case they try to take over Afghanistan then Pakistan “will seal the border, because now we can, because we have fenced our border (Durand line), which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict. Secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees."Khan said that the signing of the deal in Doha on February 29, 2020 between US and Afghanistan which would allow US troops to return home diminished Pakistan’s leverage over the Taliban because “the moment the United States gave a date of exit, Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel."Khan also commented on Kashmir during his interview stating "I think it’s a disaster for India because it will just mean that this conflict festers on and on … and (prevents) any relationship — normal relationship — between Pakistan and India."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/know-india-better-than-all-other-pakistanis-imran-khan-shares-his-vision-for-future-foreign-relations-101624706438515.html

Here’s what reports suggest||While Miami officials remain focussed on the search for dozens of people believed to be under the rubble of the residential building in South Florida, the speculations around the cause of the disaster have intensified. Referring to inputs from investigators, Miami-Dade fire rescue district chief Jason Richard told CNN that 12-storey Champlain Towers South, near southern Florida’s Atlantic coast, appears to have fallen in a “pancake collapse.”According to experts, the building experienced a “progressive collapse” which occurs due to the failure of the primary structural element and subsequently causes failure of adjoining members. In such cases, if one floor can’t support the floors above it, they collapse and “pancake” the floors below. However, evidence of other types of collapses is reportedly also present.Some reports suggest that the building was constructed on reclaimed wetlands and the unstable land could have caused damage to the foundations over time.Kenneth Direktor, an attorney for the building's condominium association, told CNN that “nothing like this was foreseeable”, but, according to a New York Times report, a consultant had sounded alarm over evidence of “major structural damage” to the concrete slab below the pool deck, almost three years before the deadly collapse.Photos: Families await news of survivors from Florida beachfront condo collapseThe engineer reportedly also highlighted “abundant” cracking and crumbling of the columns, beams and walls of the parking garage under the 12-storey building. “Though some of this damage is minor, most of the concrete deterioration needs to be repaired in a timely fashion,” Frank Morabito, the consultant engineer, wrote in his October 2018 report, as per NYT.Direktor said that extensive plans were drawn up for repair work which was just about to get started. But not before the deadly collapse that trapped sleeping residents in a massive heap of debris.Responding to the speculations over the cause of the collapse, Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said, “There’s no reason for this building to go down like that unless someone literally pulls out the supports from underneath or they get washed out or there’s a sinkhole or something like that, because it just went down.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-did-florida-beachfront-condo-collapse-here-s-what-reports-suggest-101624703747419.html

Her work, though received with unprecedented love, was called out for its problematic aspects by critics.Blyton wrote over 700 books and 4,500 short stories in her lifetime. Her works were translated into 90 languages and sold over 600 million copies, moulding the childhoods of many children across the world, and in the process, shaping their fragile minds. Stories of Noddy and Sambo were engraved on the hearts of those who grew up reading them and the mark that they left gave a direction to the children's thoughts.Why now?Charity English Heritage, an organisation that installs blue plaques at sites that were once the working or living quarters of Britain’s canonical literary figures, recently updated the information associated with Blyton’s plaque.“Blyton’s work has been criticised during her lifetime and after for its racism, xenophobia and lack of literary merit. A 1966 Guardian article noted the racism of The Little Black Doll (1966), in which the doll of the title, Sambo, is only accepted by his owner once his ‘ugly black face’ is washed ‘clean’ by rain. In 1960 the publisher Macmillan refused to publish her story The Mystery That Never Was for what it called its ‘faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia’…” the update read.However, the organisation has confirmed it has ‘no plans whatsoever’ to remove the blue plaque.Instances of racism, xenophobia and sexism in her workOne of Blyton's most famous works, the Famous Five series, has been criticised for dividing the world into the domains of the feminine and masculine. In the 21-novel-series, characters have very defined gender roles. While George's mother Fanny remains the epitome of maternal love and is idealised in her kind and easy-going demeanor, George's father Quentin is a world-famous scientist, who is shown to lack tolerance for the children on school holidays. Such a dichotomy between the feminine and masculine is represented throughout the series.Meanwhile, in almost all her books, gypsies and foreigners are often cast as dishonest, leaving bare the tinge of xenophobia in her writing. For example, in her very famous and well-received series Noddy, the antagonists are almost always golliwogs — doll-like racial caricatures. The fictional character was created by cartoonist and author Florence Kate Upton and first appeared in children's books in the late 19th century. Upton's The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwog describes the doll as “a horrid sight, the blackest gnome”.Acknowledgement of shortcomings vs rejectionEven as Blyton's body of work was submitted to scrutiny over the decades, she remains a favourite with children; the reason being her ability to capture their world, and through it, their hearts.While it is important to acknowledge the shortcomings of her works, it is equally significant to put her writing in context. Take the Golliwog character for example. The Golliwog gained popularity in the 20th century as a children’s toy, but the later decades started associating it with racism. It began to be recognised as a crude depiction of people with African roots. The character is considered offensive today, but we cannot ignore its existence in context of the time in which it originated.Same goes for Blyton's work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enid-blyton-why-seeing-sexism-racism-in-her-work-should-not-make-us-unsee-her-101624701380321.html

People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, hand hygiene ... the physical distance, avoid crowding,” Simao said during a news briefing from the agency’s Geneva headquarters, according to CNBC. "This still continues to be extremely important, even if you’re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing," she added.Also read | Delta Plus cases now in 12 states, Maharashtra has maximum: GovtAccording to CNBC, WHO officials said they are urging fully vaccinated people to continue to “play it safe” because highly contagious variants, like Delta, are spreading in many countries, triggering outbreaks and a large portion of the world are yet to be given the shots against the coronavirus disease or Covid-19.“Yes, you can reduce some measures and different countries have different recommendations in that regard. But there’s still the need for caution. As we are seeing, there are new variants emerging,” Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor to the WHO’s director-general, was quoted as saying by CNBC.Also read | Delta Plus variant: Health ministry writes to 8 states, alerts 10 districtsWHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the Delta variant, first seen in India, is “the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,” and warned it is now spreading in at least 85 countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the lack of vaccines in poor countries was exacerbating the delta variant's transmission.In India, Delta Plus, the more virulent version of the virus, has been reported from 12 states and there have been 51 cases and the maximum from Maharashtra. The government, however, has said their numbers are "very localised" and it cannot be said that it is showing an upward trend. Officials have said that the Delta variant has nearly 15-17 mutations and was first reported in October last year, and it was responsible for more than 60 per cent of cases in Maharashtra in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-delta-variant-cases-rise-who-asks-fully-vaccinated-to-keep-masks-on-101624687137709.html
26-06-2021||World||Canada eases Covid-19 restrictions||As Canada closes in on its targets to easing of restrictions in place since March last year due to the Covid-19, fully vaccinated individuals will be able to enjoy themselves in small groups outdoors and indoors without needing a mask or having to maintain social distancing. And, they’ll be able to share a hug, have dinner together or even play sports outdoors without those requirements.These were among the updates released by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) during a technical briefing that looked forward to a freer summer. But, the obstacle in getting there could be the Delta variant, which has health authorities calling for even higher vaccination targets to prevent a potential fourth wave of the pandemic later this year. “Our bottomline is that we just need to get as high as possible, as much as we can past that 75% goalpost for both first and second doses. We do know second dose is quite important in terms of strengthening your protection against that type of variant,” chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said during the briefing.PHAC’s targets for loosening restrictions were 75% of the population partially and 25% fully vaccinated. That appears to be imminent, as nearly 66% of Canadians have had at least one jab, including just over 19% with both doses.Earlier, in a statement, she warned Canadians to remain “vigilant” despite increase in vaccinations and get fully covered. “The second immune-boosting dose substantially lowers our personal risk of infection and serious harms, provides stronger protection against certain variants of concern, including the Delta variant, and may make immunity last longer,” she said.The new guidance released on Friday came in the form of an infographic. It noted that fully vaccinated persons could participate in small gatherings outdoors or indoors with others who are double-jabbed, without needing a mask or having to socially distance. They can even take part in outdoor activities like sports with those partially vaccinated or not at all, without those restrictions. However, it advised, “If you are at risk of more severe disease or outcomes, masking and physical distancing provide additional layers of protection that further reduce your risk in all settings. Your risk is always lower when outside.”PHAC said this advice was “based on the current state and will be updated as vaccination rates continue to increase and cases decrease”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-eases-covid-19-restrictions-101624684678445.html

He dismissed a US intelligence report that has forecast the fall of Kabul within six months of the departure of the last of US troops, scheduled for as early as July, saying such dire prediction “turned out false” in the past.Biden and Ghani, who was accompanied by Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation met at the White House amidst growing concerns about the fate of the current government, with continued escalation of violence by the Taliban, who have backed out of peace talks till the departure of US troops.SURGE IN VIOLENCEThe Biden administration has acknowledged being concerned by the violence but has shown no sign yet it might slow down the pace of withdrawal of troops or call it off. In the bluntest remarks on the issue yet, secretary of state Antony Blinken said in Paris on Thursday that the US is assessing the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and “whether the Taliban is, at all, serious about a peaceful resolution of the conflict”.But Biden gave no indication of a shift. “Our troops may be leaving but our support for Afghanistan is not ending in terms of support and maintenance of helping maintain their military as well as economic and political support,” President Biden said, seeking to assure the Afghan leaders.But, he added, “Afghans are going to have to decide their future, what they want, what they want”.Ghani welcomed Biden’s decision as “historic” but did signal unease saying, “It has made everybody recalculate and reconsider.”President Biden, who had run for White House one the promise, among others, of ending never-ending wars, did take the world by surprise when he announced that all US troops will be out of Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took US-led international forced to Afghanistan in search of al-Qaeda.The last of US troops are now expected to be out of the county as soon as July, way ahead of the schedule. And, there is growing concern that the Taliban are moving rapidly to take the country militarily and not through peaceful negotiations as envisaged under the deal they signed with the Trump administration in February 2020, which is backed by the Biden administration.NEW BEGINNING“We are entering into a new chapter of our relationship where the partnership with the United States would not be military, but comprehensive, regarding our mutual interest,” Ghani said. “And we’re very encouraged and satisfied that this partnership is taking place.”Ghani and Abdullah had a series of meetings starting with top Biden administration officials such as defence secretary Lloyd Austin, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, CIA director William Burns and several lawmakers.Ghani was asked about the US intelligence report forecasting the fall of Kabul in six to 12 months during his visit to the Pentagon to meet Austin. “There have been many such predictions, and they’ve all turned out false,” he said.Husain Haqqani, former Pakistan ambassador to the US and senior fellow at Hudson Institute, says both sides gained from the Friday meetings. Biden “wanted to signal that US military withdrawal is not abandonment of Afghanistan” and Ghani and Abdullah “wanted to show that Afghans are united against the Taliban and can defend their country with US economic support and military equipment. Both achieved their goal”.DETERIORATING SECURITY SITUATIONBut, Haqqani warned of the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, which he described as comparable to what happened in Iraq in 2011, after sudden withdrawal of US troops. Arming regional militias, CIA covert ops, and support for Iraqi forces changed things around and the same is possible in Afghanistan, he said, adding, “The Biden administration needs to recognise that the Taliban are not the partners in peace they were made out to be and that it is delusional to think that they will break from al-Qaeda.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tells-afghan-leaders-your-country-s-fate-in-your-hands-now-101624682458487.html
26-06-2021||World||British health secretary Matt Hancock seen kissing top aide, flouting Covid-19 rules. Boris Johnson says 'matter closed'||United Kingdom health secretary Matt Hancock apologised on Friday for violating coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related national restrictions after a British newspaper recently exposed photos of him 'kissing' his top aide. Even though the case raised a huge public outcry in the country, demanding the health secretary's resignation, UK prime minister Boris Johnson later accepted Hancock's apology and said that the matter was now "closed".British newspaper 'The Sun', known for its often explosive reveals, published photographs on its front page on Friday that showed Hancock kissing the woman - a friend hired for a taxpayer-funded role - in his office. The newspaper added that the photos, screengrabs from CCTV footage, were taken on May 6, that is, 11 days before the Covid-19 lockdown rules were relaxed."I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances," Hancock said in a statement. He added, "I have let people down and am very sorry. I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."Although British prime minister Boris Johnson stands in "full confidence" of Hancock, the opposing Labour Party said the health secretary should be removed from office for violating social distancing rules and demanded an investigation into whether he breached the ministerial code.The development comes as a hit to the 42-year-old Hancock's prestige, especially since the British health secretary has been at the forefront of the Boris Johnson-led UK government's fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He was there in the promotional materials all along, often appearing on television to tell the public to follow strict rules and to defend his department against criticism of its response to the crisis."Matt Hancock appears to have been caught breaking the laws he created while having a secret relationship with an aide he appointed to a taxpayer-funded job," said Anneliese Dodds, Chair of the Labour Party.Notably, Hancock was found in February to have acted unlawfully by not revealing details of contracts signed during the crisis. The health ministry said it had needed to move within very short timescales and against unparalleled global demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-health-secretary-matt-hancock-seen-kissing-top-aide-flouting-covid-19-rules-boris-johnson-says-matter-closed-101624680449781.html
26-06-2021||World||George Floyd death: Killer cop sentenced to over 22 years in jail||A US court on Friday sentenced Derek Chauvin, a former police officer, to 22 and a half years in jail for murdering George Floyd, whose death in May 2020 sparked the largest civil rights movement in America in decades and forced fresh light on historical injustices around the world.Chauvin, 45, will serve effectively only for 15 of those years; the rest, depending on good behaviour, will be supervised release.“I’m not basing my sentence on public opinion. I’m not basing it on the attempt to send any messages,” said judge Peter Cahill, explaining his order, which ran into 22 pages. “The job of a trial court judge is to apply the law to specific facts and to deal with individual cases.”A jury had in April held Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, guilty on three counts of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder (unintentional murder caused by use of eminently dangerous act) and secondary manslaughter.President Joe Biden called the sentence appropriate. “I don’t know all the circumstances that were considered but it seems to be under the guidelines, that seem to be appropriate,” he said. Biden had met Floyd’s family at the White House in May and discussed provision of a policing reforms legislation named after Floyd.The sentencing came after emotional appeals and counter-appeals from Floyd’s family, including his seven-year-old daughter Gianna Floyd and Chauvin’s mother Carolyn Pawlenty, who professed complete faith in her son’s innocence.Chauvin spoke for the first time in court. “Due to some additional legal matters at hand, I’m not able to give a full formal statement at this time,” said Chauvin, referring to pending federal cases against him. “But, very briefly, I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family.”Benjamin Crump, who is Floyd family attorney, welcomed the sentence. “This is the longest sentence that a police officer has ever been sentenced to in the history of the state of Minnesota, But, this should not be the exception when a Black person is killed by brutality by police. It should be the norm.”Floyd’s death under Chauvin’s knee on May 25 last year triggered protests that had turned violent in the initial days with the National Guard being called out in various parts of the country, including in Washington DC, where then President Donald Trump had added to the unrest by seeking to draw political advantage.Protests - under the slogan “Black Lives Matter” - spread quickly beyond the shores of the US and led to the toppling of the statue of a slave-trader in Bristol, UK; targeting of a 150-year-old statute of King Leopold II in Brussels, Belgium for brutalities in Congo; and protests in Australia against the subjugation of its indigenous people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-killer-cop-sentenced-to-over-22-years-in-jail-101624680778198.html

26-06-2021||World||Doubts about China's transparency on Covid-19 origins piling up: Report||Reports of deletion of some early sequences of coronavirus from Wuhan have surfaced, casting shadows over China's transparency on Covid-19 origin once again, news agency ANI reported. Data on the earliest cases of the coronavirus disease is integral to scientists getting closer to the spark that caused the pandemic.Jesse Bloom, a virologist and professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, discovered that early sequencing data of the virus were missing from the Sequence Read Archive, a public archive of high throughput sequencing data. It was possible that the Chinese researchers had deleted them "to obscure their existence," he said.According to an opinion piece in The Washington Post, called 'Doubts about China's transparency on the pandemic origins are piling up', Dr Bloom's discovery adds to the pile of questions about whether China is hiding something. "It is time to launch a serious, sustained investigation," it says.Evidence from the earliest patients "could suggest whether the virus jumped from an animal host to a human, in a zoonotic spillover, or whether the infection came from an inadvertent accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was actively studying bat coronaviruses and their potential to infect people. So far, the earliest cases have not been found," it adds.The article further says that the Chinese researchers didn't completely hide the data, but removed it from where people were most likely to look for it. "...they included some in an article published last year in an obscure journal, but the deletion meant that anyone looking for these early Wuhan cases would not find them in the most likely place, the Sequence Read Archive," it says.When Jesse Bloom asked the researchers why they did it, they did not answer, according to ANI. To this, The Washington Post article says, "China took offline a major database at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and imposed gag orders on medical workers and others. It has steadfastly denied that any kind of laboratory accident contributed to the pandemic and repeatedly suggested that the origins are outside its borders."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doubts-about-china-s-transparency-on-covid-19-origins-piling-up-report-101624672071035.html

In a report carried by the New York Times on Friday, the Indonesian Medical Association attested that at least 20 doctors who have died in the country since the pandemic began were fully vaccinated with Sinovac Biotech, the Chinese-made vaccine. The vaccination status of as many as 31 others who passed away in the last five months is currently being looked into.Also Read | Countries dependent on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines reporting surge in casesAmong the public health professionals who died after being vaccinated with Sinovac was Dr. Suhendro Sastrowiwoho, a frontline medical worker at the town of Kudus in Java. Although he had received a double dose of the Chinese-made vaccine, he died just days after testing positive for Covid-19 on June 18, the NYT report stated. Two nurses and a nutritionist, all of who had been fully vaccinated, also died this month in the same town.Indonesia, it seems, is a case study for a nation where the new Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus confirmed some of the most morbid apprehensions of the scientific community -- the failing efficacy of certain vaccines in dealing with particular strains. An efficacy assessment earlier this year among Indonesia's health workers had indicated Sinovac's success against death from infection, but its effect on the Delta variant has not been studied much.Also Read | China approves Covid-19 vaccine for kids as young as 3As many as 358 medical workers, who were fully vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, have tested positive for Covid-19 during a two-week span in the small town of Kudus, the NYT report stated, citing the risk mitigation team of the Indonesian Doctors Association. Less than 5% of Indonesia's total population has currently been vaccinated, although the inoculation campaign started way back in January. Of those who have been vaccinated, most received doses of Sinovac, which is now being believed to be less effective against certain Covid-19 variants.Not just Indonesia, other countries like Mongolia, Seychelles, and Bahrain who had relied on the easily accessible Chinese Covid-19 vaccines, are also battling a surge in infections now, reported NYT, adding that these are also among the top 10 countries with the worst Covid-19 outbreaks as recently as last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-doctors-fell-sick-many-died-after-taking-chinese-made-sinovac-vaccine-report-101624667601232.html

In that case, we identified the object as a large, deflating balloon. The others remain unexplained," the report read.Also Read: They are out there? US to release the most anticipated report on UFOsThe report, called 'Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena', was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.UFO report's objectiveIts objective was to provide an overview for policymakers of the challenges associated with characterising the potential threat posed by UAPs. It also aimed to provide "means to develop processes, policies, technologies and training for the US military and other US government (USG) personnel" when they encounter UAPs, "so as to enhance the Intelligence Community’s (IC) ability to understand the threat".Not enough dataThere was wide variability in the reports and the dataset that was available on UAPs. Though the data was too limited to allow for detailed pattern analysis, some clustering of UAPs was observed based on their shape, size, and, particularly, propulsion.Some UAPs demonstrate advanced technologyThe report also says that "unusual activities" were reported on several occasions, but mentions that this may be due to sensor errors. "In 18 incidents, described in 21 reports, UAP reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics. These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis," the report said.UAPs lack a single explanationWhile UAPs could be airborne clutter or natural atmospheric phenomena, they could also be part of the industry developmental programs or foreign adversary systems such as technologies deployed by China, Russia, another nation, or a non-governmental entity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ufo-report-us-says-can-identify-1-of-144-flying-objects-with-high-confidence-101624665981693.html

Crucially, they say the lineage should replace Neanderthals as our closest relatives.In Israel, excavations in the quarry of a cement plant near the central city of Ramla uncovered prehistoric remains that could not be matched to any known species from the Homo genus. Researchers from Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University of Jerusalem dubbed the “extraordinary discovery” the “Nesher Ramla Homo type” after the site, in a study that was published in the journal Science.The fossils date back to 140,000-120,000 years ago.As for the other development, the “Harbin cranium” was discovered in the 1930s in the city of the same name in China’s Heilongjiang province, but was reportedly hidden in a well for 85 years to protect it from the Japanese army. The skull dates back at least 146,000 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-finds-in-israel-china-shed-new-light-on-our-origin-101624665905546.html

Reimposing the mask requirement is a setback for Israel, days after it was lifted on June 15.In Indonesia, over a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died from Covid-19, a medical association said on Friday, as the country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers.In the UK, the number of Delta variant cases has risen by over 35,200 since last week to a total of around 111,100, representing a 46% increase, health officials said on Friday.In Australia, around a million people in Sydney neighbourhoods were ordered to stay home for at least a week. New South Wales officials called it the “scariest period” since the pandemic began.Brazil president denies Bharat Biotech linkPresident Jair Bolsonaro has said Brazil didn’t pay for or receive any doses of a vaccine developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech, in response to allegations of irregularities in a deal that is being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reinstates-indoor-mask-rule-amid-surge-101624665688734.html
26-06-2021||World||159 missing in Florida building collapse tragedy||About 160 people were still unaccounted for and four were confirmed to have died on Friday, a day after a large section of a seaside apartment building collapsed into a pile of rubble, with rescuers combing through concrete and metal in search of the missing.Scores of firefighters were working overnight to reach any possible survivors both from under and atop the remains of the building. Hopes rested on how quickly crews using rescue dogs and microphones to sift through the wreckage could complete their grim task.“Every time we hear a sound, we concentrate on those areas,” said assistant Miami-Dade fire chief Raide Jadallah.Three bodies were removed overnight after one person was initially reported dead. Miami-Dade police director Freddy Ramirez said authorities were working with the medical examiner’s office to identify the victims. Eleven injuries were reported, with four people treated at various hospitals.Officials are still saying that no cause for the building’s collapse has been determined.Miami-Dade mayor Daniella Levine Cava said rescuers themselves were at “extreme risk” going through the rubble. “Debris is falling on them as they do their work. We have structural engineers on site to ensure they won’t be injured,” she said.The work focused on what was left of the 12-storey Champlain Towers South, which drew people from around the world to enjoy life on southern Florida’s Atlantic coast, some only for a night, and some to reside there.State Senator Jason Pizzo of Miami Beach told Miami Herald that he watched as tactical teams of six worked on Friday to sift through the debris. He said he saw one body taken in a yellow bag and another that was marked. They were taken to a homicide unit tent set up along the beach.Many people remained at a reunification centre hastily set up near the site of the collapse on Friday, awaiting results of DNA swabs that could help identify victims.Video of the collapse showed the centre of the building appearing to tumble down first and a section nearest to the ocean teetering and coming down seconds later, as a huge dust cloud swallowed the neighbourhood. About half the building’s 130 units were affected, and rescuers pulled at least 35 people from the wreckage in the first hours after the collapse.Hit by gusty winds and rain, two heavy cranes began removing debris from the pile using large claws on Friday, creating a din of crashing glass and metal as they picked up material and dumped it to the side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/159-missing-in-florida-building-collapse-tragedy-101624665106235.html
26-06-2021||World||First Covid-19 case could have emerged in China in Oct 2019||The virus that causes Covid-19 could have started spreading in China as early as October 2019, two months before the first case was identified in the central city of Wuhan, a new study showed on Friday.Officially, the first Covid-19 case was identified on December 8 and linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market. However, the new study by researchers from Britain’s University of Kent pins the most likely date to November 17, saying that it had probably already spread globally by January 2020.The paper was published on Thursday on the PLOS Pathogens journal.“Our results suggest that the virus emerged in China in early October to mid-November, 2019 (the most likely date being November 17), and by January, 2020, had spread globally,” the researchers said, adding that it suggests a much earlier and more rapid spread than is evident from confirmed cases.The research estimates that the virus spread beyond China by January 2020 with the estimated first case in Japan on January 3, 2020, followed by Thailand on January 7, 2020. The researchers said the coronavirus is likely to have left eastern Asia and arrived in Europe, with the first case estimated to have come on January 12, 2020, in Spain. It then appeared in South Korea on January 14.From Europe, the virus may have spread to North America with the first infection estimated to be in the US by January 16, the research suggests.China has maintained that it has shared all relevant data on the origin of Covid-19 during the investigation conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Chinese foreign ministry has been on a diplomatic overdrive suggesting that the WHO should investigate the origin in other countries, including in the US, which, according to the study, was the fifth country where the virus most likely spread to.Doubts over the origin, however, remain, and new studies have raised new questions.In a paper released on a preprint platform this week, Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle recovered deleted sequencing data from early Covid-19 cases in China, Reuters reported. The data showed that samples taken from the Huanan market were “not representative” of Sars-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of a progenitor sequence circulating earlier, which spread to other parts of China.“Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how Covid-19 began in Wuhan?” said Alina Chan, researcher, Harvard’s Broad Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-could-have-emerged-in-china-in-oct-2019-101624657849294.html
26-06-2021||World||How the Ever Given that broke global trade crashed||Captain Krishnan Kanthavel watched the sun rise over the Red Sea through a dusty haze on March 23, 2021. From his viewpoint, through winds of more than 40 mph, it was just possible to see outlines of the 19 other ships anchored in Suez Bay, waiting their turn to enter the narrow channel.Kanthavel’s container vessel, largest in the queue, was scheduled to be the thirteenth travelling north through the canal. The Ever Given is 400 meters from bow to stern and nearly 60 meters across. It was loaded with about 17,600 brightly colored containers.Soon after daybreak, a small craft approached, carrying the local pilots who’d guide the ship during its 12-hour journey between the seas.Bloomberg reported that according to documents filed weeks later in an Egyptian court, there was a dispute between the two pilots and the Indian captain and officers, about whether the ship should enter the canal given the bad weather -- a debate that may have been hampered by the fact that English was neither side’s first language.Like airplanes, ships carry voyage data recorders, or VDRs, black-box devices that capture conversations on the bridge. The full recording of what transpired on the Ever Given’s bridge hasn’t been released by the Egyptian government, so it isn’t clear exactly what the pilots and crew said about the conditions.From the bridge, Kanthavel could see about a half-mile ahead. The captain could still have refused to proceed, but with an all-clear from the agency that manages the waterway, and with everyone eager to get going, he carried on. The lead Egyptian pilot leaned into his radio and had a brief conversation in Arabic between bursts of static. Then he instructed the bridge crew to power forward.A few miles into the transit, Ever Given began to veer alarmingly from port to starboard and back again. In response, according to evidence submitted in legal proceedings, the lead SCA pilot began barking instructions at the Indian helmsman. The pilot shouted to steer hard right, then hard left, the Bloomberg report said. The ships hull took so long to respond that by the time it began to move, he needed to correct course. When the second pilot objected, the two argued.The lead pilot then gave a new order: “Full ahead.” The second pilot tried to cancel the order, and more angry words were exchanged. Kanthavel intervened, and the lead pilot responded by threatening to leave the vessel, according to the court evidence.Suddenly, it became clear the Ever Given was going to crash. According to a person familiar with the VDR audio, Captain Kanthavel reacted as anyone might in the same situation. “Shit!” he screamed.No one could have anticipated what happened next. The vessel was wedged diagonally across the channel.Below the waterline, the bow had been driven like a dagger deep into the rocks and coarse sand. Somehow, the back end had also run aground, lodging in the opposite bank and leaving the ship at a 45-degree angle to the shore. Nothing could pass.It took about 24 hours for the SCA to release a statement, in which it said the Ever Given had lost control in bad weather. Evergreen, which declined to make any of its executives available for an interview, blamed a “suspected sudden strong wind”, while one local maritime agent cited a “blackout”.The vessel was freed six days later on March 29, after round-the-clock efforts to move the massive vessel involved sucking sand from underneath its hull, as tugboats pushed and pulled the ship.The Ever Given has been anchored in a lake between two stretches of the canal since it was dislodged.The operator of a cargo ship on Thursday that it would take more time for the vessel to be released from detainment while a final agreement with Egyptian authorities was being concluded.The Japanese owners and insurers of the ship were locked in a compensation dispute with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), but announced on Wednesday that an agreement in principle had been reached. “It may take some further time for the agreement to be concluded, for the vessel to be released from arrest and prepared for onward transit,” ship operator Evergreen Line said in a statement.Suez Canal Authority agreed to settle with the owners of the ship, having initially demanding $916 million in compensation, reputational damage and lost revenue before publicly lowering the request to $550 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-ever-given-that-broke-global-trade-crashed-101624657209460.html
26-06-2021||World||'Go to India': Philippines President threatens citizens who refuse Covid vaccine||Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, frustrated by the slow pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in his country, threatened people who refuse to get inoculated with jail or an injection of Ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug widely used to treat animals.Ivermectin has been touted as an alternative treatment for Covid-19 but US and European regulators and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended against it."You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed," Duterte said in a televised address late on Monday, following reports of low turnout at several vaccination sites in the capital Manila."Go to India if you want or somewhere to America. But for as long as you are here and you are a human being, and can carry the virus, get vaccinated."Otherwise, I will order all the village captains to have a tally of the people who refuse to be vaccinated. Because if not, I will have Ivermectin meant for pigs injected into you."Duterte is famous for his bellicose rhetoric and his remarks on Monday contradicted those of his health officials, who have said getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is voluntary."Don't get me wrong, there is a crisis in this country," Duterte said. "I'm just exasperated by Filipinos not heeding the government."With over 1.3 million cases, the Philippines is fighting one of Asia's must stubborn Covid-19 epidemics.But as of June 20, just 2.1 million people had been fully vaccinated of the 70 million people targeted for this year.Duterte, who has been criticised for his tough approach to containing the virus, also stood by his decision not to let schools reopen.In the same televised address, he took a swipe at the International Criminal Court, after an ICC prosecutor sought permission from the court for a full inquiry into thousands of killings by police in a war on drugs ordered by Duterte.Duterte, who cancelled the Philippines' membership of the ICC's founding treaty, said he would not cooperate with the probe and described the ICC as "bullshit"."Why would I defend or face an accusation before white people. You must be crazy," he said.Human rights groups say authorities have summarily executed drug suspects, but Duterte maintains those killed had violently resisted arrest.Asked for comment, ICC court spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said: "The court is an independent judicial institution, and does not comment on political statements".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/go-to-india-philippines-president-threatens-citizens-who-refuse-covid-vaccine-101624652730972.html
26-06-2021||World||George Floyd death: Former Police officer Derek Chauvin gets 22 years and 6 months in prison||Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd, whose dying gasps under Chauvin’s knee led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the U.S. in generations.The punishment — which fell short of the 30 years that prosecutors had requested — came after Chauvin broke his more than yearlong silence in court to offer condolences to the Floyd family and say he hopes more information coming out will eventually give them “some peace of mind.”With good behavior, Chauvin, 45, could be paroled after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years.In imposing the punishment, Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12 1/2-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing “your abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd.Chauvin was immediately led back to prison. As with the verdicts in April, he showed little emotion when the judge pronounced the sentence. His eyes moved rapidly around the courtroom, his COVID-19 mask obscuring much of his face.The fired white officer was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for up to 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn’t breathe and went limp on May 25, 2020.Bystander video of Floyd’s arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store prompted protests around the world and led to scattered violence in Minneapolis and beyond.On Friday, Chauvin, who did not testify at his trial, removed his mask and turned toward the Floyd family, speaking only briefly because of what he called “some additional legal matters at hand” — an apparent reference to the federal civil rights trial he still faces.“But very briefly, though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There’s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some some peace of mind,” he said, without elaborating.In asking that Chauvin be left off on probation, defense attorney Eric Nelson called Floyd’s death “tragic” and said that Chauvin's “brain is littered with what-ifs” from that day: “What if I just did not agree to go in that day? What if things had gone differently? What if I never responded to that call? What if what if what if?”Floyd's family members took the stand and expressed sorrow about his death. They asked for the maximum penalty.“We don’t want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We’ve been through that already," said a tearful Terrence Floyd, one of Floyd's brothers.Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said: “Our family is forever broken.” And Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a video played in court, said that if she could say something to her father now, it would be: “I miss you and and I love you.”Prosecutor Matthew Frank asked the judge to exceed sentencing guidelines and give Chauvin 30 years in prison, saying “tortured is the right word” for what the officer did to Floyd.“This is not a momentary gunshot, punch to the face. This is 9½ minutes of cruelty to a man who was helpless and just begging for his life," Frank said.Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, appeared in court to plead for mercy for son, saying his reputation has been unfairly reduced to that of “an aggressive, heartless and uncaring person” and a racist.“I can tell you that is far from the truth,” she told the judge. “I want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man." She added: “Derek, I want you to know I have always believed in your innocence, and I will never waver from that.”“I will be here for you when you come home,” she said.The concrete barricades, razor wire and National Guard patrols at the courthouse during Chauvin's three-week trial in the spring were gone Friday, reflecting an easing of tensions since the verdict in April.Ahead of the sentencing, the judge agreed with prosecutors that there were aggravating circumstances that could justify a heavier punishment than the recommended 12 1/2 years — among them, that Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, abused his position of authority as a police officer and did it in front of children.Before the sentencing, the judge denied Chauvin’s request for a new trial. The defense had argued that the intense publicity tainted the jury pool and that the trial should have been moved away from Minneapolis.The judge also rejected a defense request for a hearing into possible juror misconduct. Nelson had accused a juror of not being candid during jury selection because he didn’t mention his participation in a march last summer to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutors countered the juror had been open about his views.Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, said 11 non-federal law officers, including Chauvin, have been convicted of murder for on-duty deaths since 2005. The penalties for the nine who were sentenced before Chauvin ranged from from six years, nine months, to life behind bars, with the median being 15 years.With Chauvin’s sentencing, the Floyd family and Black America witnessed something of a rarity: In the small number of instances in which officers accused of brutality or other misconduct against Black people have gone to trial, the list of acquittals and mistrials is longer than the list of sentencings after conviction.In recent years, the acquittals have included officers tried in the deaths of Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two mistrials were declared over the death of Samuel Dubose in Cincinnati.“That’s why the world has watched this trial, because it is a rare occurrence,” said Arizona-based civil rights attorney Benjamin Taylor, who has represented victims of police brutality. “Everybody knows that this doesn’t happen every day.”Chauvin has been held since his conviction at the state's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, where he has been kept in a cell by himself for his own protection, his meals brought to him.The three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest are scheduled for trial in March on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter. They will also stand trial with Floyd on the federal civil rights charges. No date has been set for that trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-former-police-officer-derek-chauvin-gets-22-5-years-in-prison-101624652124622.html

This was their third spacewalk in just over a week.In what would keep the space station running for the rest of this decade, two astronauts - NASA's Shane Kimbrough and France's Thomas Pesquet successfully installed the second in a series of powerful solar wings. This spectacle comes at the time space tourism ramps up with visitors beginning in the fall.“We have a lot of happy faces down here,” Mission Control radioed as power surged through the panel.In what should have been a two-spacewalk job, roadblocks like spacesuit and other problems hampered the astronauts’ work on June 16. This delayed the first solar wing's extension to its full length of 63 feet (19 meters) until Sunday. NASA added a third spacewalk for Friday to attach and unfold the second wing — this time everything went smoothly 255 miles (410 kilometers) up.Shortly after the panel was unveiled 410 kilometers above the Earth, NASA shared a tweet with a magical view.😎 How about that view? 255 miles (410 kilometers) above Earth, @Thom_Astro (suit with red stripes) and @Astro_Kimbrough continue making progress upgrading the @Space_Station's power supply. pic.twitter.com/KLBl4x2Qb9"😎 How about that view? 255 miles (410 kilometers) above Earth, @Thom_Astro (suit with red stripes) and @Astro_Kimbrough continue making progress upgrading the @Space_Station's power supply," the tweet read.Once Pesquet released the final bolt, the newest solar wing unrolled like a giant stretch of wallpaper, high above the Bering Sea. It took 10 minutes for the slow but steady extension.“Well done out there, buddy,” Kimbrough called out.In order to prevent astronauts from electrical shocks, and to ensure work was not carried out when the solar panels were soaking up sunlight and generating power, NASA carried out most of the action during the six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk took place on the nighttime side of Earth as a safety precaution.The two solar panels delivered by SpaceX earlier this month aren't nearly as big as the station's original wings. But they produce more electricity because of new technology. NASA plans to send up four more panels over the coming year; Boeing is supplying them.This first pair will supplement the space station's oldest solar wings, degraded after 20 years of continuous operation.Kimbrough and Pesquet are two months into a six-month mission. Two other Americans are aboard the space station, along with one Japanese and two Russians.With inputs from Associated Press||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spot-the-tiny-nasa-astronauts-deck-up-solar-panels-from-410-kms-above-earth-101624645532399.html

Also, 90% of the new infections were caused by the Delta variant, the WSJ report showed citing Ran Balicer, who leads an expert advisory panel on Covid-19 for the government.Meanwhile, children below the age of 12 accounted for about half of the infections and most of them were not vaccinated against the disease, the report also showed.The outbreak has pushed the Israeli government to reimpose the indoor mask rule and other similar measures to prevent a flare-up in cases due to the highly transmissible strain. Earlier on Friday, the country’s health ministry reimposed the rule that required people to wear facemasks in enclosed public spaces following a spike in the number of daily new infections. The rule was dropped 10 days ago. However, the decision has been reversed after the country reported more than 100 new cases for the past four days. On Thursday, 227 people tested positive for the disease.Also read | Pfizer says its vaccine highly effective against Delta variant“The entrance of the Delta variant has changed the transmission dynamics,” WSJ quoted Prof Balicer as saying on Friday. The country’s vaccination program was widely regarded as one among the fastest and successful and around 80% of the adult population (age 16 above) have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.Nachman Ash, the head of Israel’s pandemic response task force, also said that the rise in cases is “likely” due to the highly contagious Delta variant. “We are seeing a doubling every few days. Another thing that's worrying is that the infections are spreading. If we had two cities where most of the infections were, we would have more cities where the numbers are rising and communities where the cases are going up,” news agency AFP quoted Ash as saying.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, only weeks into office, said that the safety of the citizens was his government’s immediate priority. “Our goal at the moment, first and foremost, is to safeguard the citizens of Israel from the Delta variant that is running amok in the world,” WSJ quoted the Prime Minister as saying.The Delta variant or the B.1.617.2 was first identified in India during late 2020 and is now prevalent in more than 70 countries across the world. World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the variant “the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,” according to a news report by the Associated Press.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-50-infected-adults-in-covid-19-delta-variant-outbreak-in-israel-fully-vaccinated-report-101624646120358.html
