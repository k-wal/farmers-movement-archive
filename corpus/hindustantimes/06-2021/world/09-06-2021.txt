The vote has to be rubber-stamped by EU nations, but that’s a formality. Starting July 1 for a year, all EU countries must recognise the vaccine certificate. They will be issued free and certify that a person has either been fully vaccinated against the virus, has recently tested negative or has recovered from the disease.47,381 wild animals sold in Wuhan from 2017-19A scientific paper in China has found that over 47,000 live wild animals were sold from wet markets in Wuhan between 2017 and 2019 before the first cases of Covid-19 were reported from the city. Researched by international scientists, the paper says 47,381 animals from 38 species were sold in 17 markets between May 2017 and November 2019, including 31 protected species.US secretary of state Antony Blinken cast doubt on the methodology of a report on the origin of Covid-19 that reportedly concluded the virus may have leaked from a Wuhan lab. He said the report originated after the Trump administration asked a contractor to look into the origin of the virus.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-okays-covid-19-vaccine-101623263182152.html
09-06-2021||World||US unveils strategy to counter rising China||The US has initiated major steps to better address the security challenge from China, which has been called the “number one pacing challenge”, including steps to “streamline and strengthen” cooperation with allies especially in the Indo-Pacific.Secretary of defence Lloyd Austin announced these initiatives on Wednesday, based on the recommendations of the China Task Force, which was announced by President Joe Biden in February to provide a “baseline assessment” of existing steps and measures and to chalk up priorities.Based on the recommendations, most of which will remain classified, secretary Austin issued a directive initiating several major department-wide efforts to better address the security challenges posed by China as the United States’ “number one pacing challenge”, said the Pentagon.These measures are designed and intended to “focus processes and procedures and better help department leaders contribute to whole-of-government efforts to address the challenge from China”. They were developed through inter-agency consultations involving the agencies and departments working on China.“Many are intended to streamline and strengthen cooperation with US allies and partners, particularly in the Indo-Pacific,” the defence department said.India-US cooperation and partnership is a crucial part of the increasing centrality of the Indo-Pacific region for America, and through bilateral efforts and those with multi-lateral cooperation such as the Quad, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, with Japan and Australia.“The initiatives I am putting forward today are nested inside the larger US government approach to China and will help inform the development of the national defence strategy we are working on,” said secretary Austin. The four-year review and update of the national defence strategy is currently under way, as required by US Congress.“The efforts I am directing today will improve the department’s ability to revitalise our network of allies and partners, bolster deterrence, and accelerate the development of new operational concepts, emerging capabilities, future force posture, and a modernised civilian and military workforce,” he added.The statement said many of the initiatives will remain classified, but among those they mentioned, will one that establishes secretary Austin’s “intent to directly oversee the department of defence’s China-related policies, operations, and intelligence as the task force’s recommendations are incorporated into ongoing reviews and department-wide processes”.Biden had announced the task force just weeks after his inauguration as the world looked for clues to the new American president’s thinking on China. It was tasked with two specific aims: “to conduct a baseline assessment of China-related programmes, policies, and processes at the department of defence; and to provide the secretary with a set of top priorities and recommended courses of action for the department”.The task force delivered their initial assessment to the defence secretary in April, and then the full set of recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unveils-strategy-to-counter-rising-china-101623261849775.html

We are grateful for her contributions," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Everson, who had been at Facebook more than a decade, was vice president of Facebook's Global Business Group. She was a key spokesperson for the company when more than 1,000 advertisers joined a Facebook boycott last summer over concerns it was not doing enough to combat hate speech on the platform.The company said Nicola Mendelsohn, who runs the Europe, Middle East and Africa region of this division and has been at the company eight years, will be the new interim leader of the Global Business Group.The news is one more shake-up in leadership at the world's largest social network, which last week announced that its vice president of global partnerships, Marne Levine, would be its first chief business officer.Earlier this year, Everson's boss and Facebook's chief revenue officer, David Fischer, who oversees its advertising business and manages its sales and marketing teams worldwide, said he would leave the company toward the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-global-ads-chief-carolyn-everson-leaves-company-101623259785459.html

During a weekly press briefing, PAHO director Carissa Etienne said that almost 1.2 million new Covid-19 cases and about 34,000 related deaths were reported in the region last week, highlighting that four of the five countries with the highest death counts - The United States, Brazil, Mexico and Peru - are in the Americas."If current trends continue, the health, social and economic disparities in our region will grow even larger, and it will be years before we control this virus in the Americas," Etienne said.PAHO serves as a regional office for the World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states include all 35 countries in the Americas. The US has been the worst-hit nation in terms of coronavirus-related deaths, followed by Brazil and India, as per the official figures. While the US has taken control with an aggressive vaccination drive, Brazil continues to report hundreds of deaths due to the infection every day.Also Read | 25% global Covid-19 deaths occurred in Americas, says Pan American Health OrganizationEtienne thanked the US, Canada, and Spain for promising to donate millions of vaccine doses or funding for the fight against Covid-19, but stressed that more needs to be done. "We hope other countries – particularly those with excess doses – and global financial institutions will follow in their footsteps to provide the support we need," Etienne said. "Vaccine donations are essential in the short-term," she added.Just around 10 per cent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully vaccinated, making it vulnerable to fresh Covid waves. The rapid spread of new variants could make the situation even worse in lower- and lower-middle-income countries of the Americas.Ahead of the kick-off of the Copa America soccer tournament in Brazil, PAHO's Director of Health Emergencies, Ciro Ugarte, warned that countries hosting mass events should consider postponing if the risk of Covid-19 cannot be controlled. He said that Venezuela still owes $10 million in funding for vaccines via the COVAX vaccine sharing program.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-covid-19-trends-continue-it-will-be-years-before-virus-is-controlled-paho-101623257077850.html
09-06-2021||World||IS-linked group says Boko Haram leader in Nigeria, Abubakar Shekau, is dead||The leader of Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has killed himself, according to a jihadi organization linked to the Islamic State group.An audio recording purportedly from Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the leader of the Islamic State West Africa Province, or ISWAP, said Shekau detonated explosives killing himself after a battle between the two groups.The audio message follows media reports last month that Shekau, one of Africa’s most wanted men, blew himself up to evade capture by ISWAP fighters.Neither Nigerian authorities nor Boko Haram have confirmed Shekau's death.There had been several false reports about Shekau’s death in the past, with Shekau later appearing in videos to refute them.Al-Barnawi, a son to the founding leader of Boko Haram, the late Mohammed Yusuf, made the statement in an audio message heard this week by The Associated Press in the native Kanuri language.The audio message, which last about 28 minutes, had what is reportedly al-Barnawi's voice, lacing his speech with quotes from the verses of the Quran. The audio was obtained from a former jihadist who provides intelligence to the government and is familiar with al-Barnawi’s voice.“He never thought this would happen to him even in his dream, but by the power of God we destabilized him; he became confused and fled to forest where he spent five days, wandering and stranded,” he said. “We followed him again where we faced him with heavy fire. He ran away, then our troops called on him to surrender so that he would be punished.”Shekau was asked to surrender in order to be pardoned or reinstalled as a leader.“We kept assuring him that we were not out to kill him, but he refused. To him it’s better to die than to surrender,” he said.He went out to describe Shekau as “a defiant and corrupt leader” whose fighters were celebrating instead of mourning his death.“This was someone who committed unimaginable terrorism. How many has he wasted? How many has he killed? How many has he terrorized?” he said.ISWAP broke off from Boko Haram in 2016 following a dispute between Shekau and al-Barnawi. Both jihadi groups have also been fighting each other over territory since they fell out.The Nigeria-based Boko Haram has been waging a bitter war against Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009.Boko Haram under Shekau’s leadership has carried out numerous suicide bombings targeting markets, crowded bus stations, churches, mosques and media houses. A Boko Haram bombing in 2011 at the U.N. building in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, killed 21 people and wounded 60 others.Boko Haram attacks on towns and villages mainly in northeast Nigeria have left tens of thousands of people dead and displaced more than 2.3 million others.In February 2014, Boko Haram killed 59 male students in an attack at the Federal Government College Buni Yadi. Two months later, the group shocked the world when it abducted 276 teenage schoolgirls from the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State. Shekau appeared in a video saying that the girls would be forced into marriage because girls as young as 9 are suitable for marriage. While many of the girls have either escaped or been released, 112 of them are still missing.The Boko Haram leader was notorious for using underage boys as child soldiers, while underage girls and young women have been used as suicide bombers in recent years.Some gruesome Boko Haram videos have shown captives, including security personnel, aid workers and others, executed — sometimes by beheading.Shekau had bounties on his head, with a reward of up to $7 million offered by the United States in 2012.If indeed Shekau, the driving force behind Boko Haram, has died, that will likely weaken Boko Haram and make it possible for ISWAP to take over vast territories under Boko Haram control in Nigeria’s northeastern states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa.A stronger ISWAP will be bad news for the Nigerian military, as the group appears to constitute a greater threat against the Nigerian army, carrying out attacks on highly fortified military bases.Many attribute ISWAP’s recent successes to new tactics of buying over the local population with food and money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islinked-group-says-boko-haram-leader-in-nigeria-abubakar-shekau-is-dead-101623254784529.html

The armed forces ministry said that the French government is also freezing about 10 million euros in budgetary support for the landlocked African nation."A number of commitments made by the Central African authorities vis-à-vis France have not been kept," the ministry told news agency Reuters, which includes stopping the online campaigns meant to undermine French influence.France has a history of military interventions in the Central African Republic, a former French colony, and diplomatic wrangling over influence in the mineral-rich nation has heightened the tension. French influence has been undermined by Russia after Moscow sent hundreds of military instructors to help arm and train CAR's government troops to fight rebels.In the past, the Central African Republic has faced deadly interreligious and inter-communal violence. A peace deal in 2019 failed to curb the violence after the constitutional court rejected former CAR president Francois Bozize’s effort to run for president again last year.President Faustin Archange Touadera won re-election in December 2020 but continues to face opposition from rebel groups linked to Bozize. In January, the rebel forces tried to attack the capital city Bangui, underscoring the serious threat faced by CAR's military.Around 160 French troops were providing operational support in Bangui and training Central African forces to support the government on the security front. While the international missions, including a European Union training deployment, will continue, soldiers working directly for the French military will no longer cooperate with the Central African Republic's military. The decision to freeze aid and military cooperation will impact France's operational support in the capital Bangui and training Central African forces.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-freezes-aid-military-support-for-central-african-republic-101623252233038.html

Gosiame Thamara Sithole, 37, gave birth to seven boys and three girls, reported Pretoria News, which could break the Guinness World Records for most children delivered at a single birth to survive.According to BBC, a South African has confirmed the birth of 10 children, while another official said that they are yet to see the babies. Meanwhile, Guinness World Records said that it was investigating the claim, reported the British media network.Quoting Sithole’s husband, Teboho Tsotetsi, Pretoria News said that the doctors had detected eight babies during the medical scans, two less than the South African woman delivered on Monday night.“It’s seven boys and three girls. She was seven months and seven days pregnant. I am happy. I am emotional. I can’t talk much. Let’s talk again in the morning please,” the local English daily quoted Tsotetsi as saying.Also Read | Model train earns Guinness World Record, rings out tunes using wine glassesSithole previously gave birth to twins, who are now six years old. While multiple births involving more than three babies are often the result of fertility treatment, Sithole, as per Pretoria News, said that her pregnancy was natural.The Guinness World Records for most children delivered at a single birth to survive is currently held by Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to six boys and two girls in California, US, in 2009. Suleman’s babies were conceived with the aid of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment and were nine weeks premature when they were delivered by Caesarean section.“The Suleman octuplets are only the second full set of octuplets to be born alive in the United States and, one week after their birth, surpassed the previous worldwide survival rate for a complete set of octuplets set by the Chukwu octuplets in 1998,” the Guinness World Records website says.Last month, a 25-year-old Malian woman had given birth to nine babies, two more than doctors had detected during medical scans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-woman-gives-birth-to-10-babies-could-be-new-world-record-report-101623250700221.html

The White House remains very concerned about the data risks of TikTok users, another administration official told reporters.Also Read| Amid ban, TikTok shares info on compliance with new rulesTikTok declined to comment. WeChat did not immediately comment.Biden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders Trump issued in August, along with another in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.The January order directed officials to ban transactions with eight Chinese apps including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd's QQ Wallet and WeChat pay; no bans have been issued to date.The Trump administration contended that WeChat and TikTok posed national security concerns with the threat that the sensitive personal data of U.S. users could be collected by China’s government.Both TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, and WeChat have denied posing national security concerns.The Trump administration had appealed judicial orders blocking the bans on TikTok and WeChat, but after Biden took office in January, the U.S. Justice Department asked to pause the appeals.Also Read| India bans TikTok, other Chinese appsA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Status reports are due in the appeals cases on Friday.Biden's order says collecting of data from Americans "threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information."The order directs the Commerce Department to "evaluate on a continuing basis" any transactions that "pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States."Republican Senator Josh Hawley said on Twitter the withdrawal of the Trump orders are "a major mistake - shows alarming complacency regarding #China’s access to Americans’ personal information, as well as #China’s growing corporate influence."Biden's executive order also directs the Commerce Department within 120 days to make recommendations to protect U.S. data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries.Last week, Biden signed an executive order that bans U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies in the defense and surveillance technology sectors.

A spokesperson for Prince Harry and Meghan on Sunday announced that the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Lilibet “Lili” Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning.When Queen Elizabeth II was a toddler, her grandfather, King George V, would affectionately call her Lilibet while imitating her failed attempts to say her name. The nickname stuck and came to be used by close relatives. A BBC report, citing an unnamed Buckingham Palace source, had earlier stated that Harry and Meghan never checked with the Queen whether they can use the moniker before naming their child.Also Read | Meghan Markle releases debut kid's book 'The Bench' on father-son relationshipA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said that Prince Harry spoke with the Queen before announcing his daughter’s name and the monarch was supportive of the decision, reported CNN."The Duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement. In fact, his grandmother was the first family member he called," CNN quoted the spokesperson as saying. "During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the names," the spokesperson added.The baby’s middle name, Diana, is in honour of her grandmother and Harry’s mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi on motorcycles.Also Read | 'She wasn't crazy': Prince Harry reveals how Meghan Markle overcame suicidal impulsesDuring an explosive interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Harry and Meghan had first revealed they were expecting a daughter.

This phenomena is witnessed when the Moon moves between the Sun and the Earth and blocks the Sun's light from reaching the Earth.This particular eclipse is an annular one. In an annular eclipse, the Sun is not entirely covered and a thin boundary of it is visible, which is called the ‘ring of fire.’The celestial event, also called Surya Grahan in India, will take place for 3 minutes and 51 seconds.Here is a list of places where the eclipse will be witnessed:Experts advise enthusiasts to take precautions while watching the eclipse.

09-06-2021||World||China defends cultural links with Japan amid online nationalist fury||The Chinese foreign ministry defended the value of cultural exchanges with Japan on Wednesday after Chinese intellectuals came under heavy attack from nationalists online for attending events sponsored by the Japanese government over many years.The ministry's mild tone contrasted with the hardline "wolf warrior diplomacy" it has often favoured on international issues, especially those concerning Japan, whose brutal wartime occupation of China is a touchstone for Chinese nationalists.Some prominent Chinese scholars and writers came under fire last week after nationalistic netizens noticed their names among a list of 144 Chinese intellectuals who had been sponsored by the Japan Foundation to visit Japan from 2008 to 2016.Two netizens, operating under the pseudonyms Diguaxiong Laoliu and Guyan Muchan, who each have more than six million followers on their Twitter-like Weibo accounts, accused the intellectuals of currying favour with Japan for financial gain.They joined an online "name and shame" campaign to brand the intellectuals as traitors.Asked about the controversy at a regular press conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said government-supported people-to-people interaction had contributed positively to relations between China and Japan."We hope to achieve more understanding, trust and deeper friendship through continual healthy and stable interaction among Chinese and Japanese people," said Wang.Wang's comment comes a week after President Xi Jinping told senior Communist Party officials that they should improve the way they communicate with the rest of the world."We must focus on setting the tone right, be open and confident but also modest and humble, and strive to create a credible, lovable and respectable image of China," Xi said, according to Xinhua news agency.Some Chinese diplomats and commentators have taken up hardline positions on social media in recent years, appealing to nationalist passions among their online followers.But this has contributed to friction with Western and Asian countries, encouraging them to reevaluate ties with an increasingly assertive China, the world's second biggest economy.Relations with China will be on the agenda of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies when they meet this week for a summit in Britain.

Two children were among 13 killed in Israel by Gaza militant rocket fire, which sent thousands of Israeli families running for bomb shelters where they cradled their children for hours on end.Also Read | Israel claims Hamas tried to hamper Iron Dome rocket defense from destroyed Gaza buildingSuzy's home was struck in a wave of Israeli attacks on Gaza City on May 16 that Gaza health officials said killed 42 people, including 10 children.Israel said those strikes targeted an underground tunnel system used by Hamas to transport weapons, and that the houses collapsed as a result of the tunnel network crumbling.The Israeli military said the civilian casualties were unintentional, and that it does all it can to avoid civilian harm.Psychologists have paid Suzy regular visits to help her process her trauma. At an art therapy session on Sunday, she sat silently as she and her cousins painted their names on paper.Alongside her name, Suzy painted two large hearts, in red."She was taken from her family's lap, from her mother's lap ... she survived death with a miracle," said psychologist Samar Awad, who oversees Suzy's case.Also Read | UN agency for Palestinian refugees withdraws director from Gaza after threats'When will the next war be?'Around half of Gaza's two million population are under 18.

You (feel like) you have nothing. You (feel) helpless, hopeless, worthless," he said.Owaida said that as a result of trauma, many Gaza children wet their beds, stutter, have nightmares and refuse to eat.The sense of hopelessness can be overwhelming, Owaida said."The question of many children now - they ask when the next war will be ... what will we do, where will we go?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-screams-when-someone-comes-near-gaza-children-in-trauma-after-israel-airstrikes-101623242009072.html
09-06-2021||World||Solar eclipse 2021: When and how to watch from India, US, and other countries||People across the northern hemisphere will have a chance to witness an annular or partial solar eclipse on Thursday, June 10, when the moon moves between the sun and Earth. The Moon will cast a shadow on Earth while revolving around the planet, causing a full or partial blocking of the sun’s light in some areas.The upcoming solar eclipse, dubbed as “ring eclipse”, is getting a lot of attention due to the distance of the Moon from Earth. The Moon will be far enough from Earth that it will appear smaller than the sun. In some areas, the moon will look like a dark disk on top of a larger, bright disk, creating what looks like a ring of fire around the moon.According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), people in parts of Canada, Greenland, and northern Russia will experience the annular eclipse. Much of Canada and parts of the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and northern Africa will experience a partial solar eclipse.Also Read | Solar eclipse 2021 to occur on June 10: Timing, how to watch 'Ring of Fire'In the United States, the partial solar eclipse will be visible along with parts of the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest, and in Northern Alaska. While the eclipse will not be visible from India, some reports claim that some parts of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh will be able to experience a partial solar eclipse.How to safely watch a solar eclipse?Solar eclipses last only a few minutes and eclipse enthusiasts are advised to never look directly at the sun, even if the sun is partly or mostly obscured. Individuals watching a partial solar eclipse or annular solar eclipse must wear solar viewing or eclipse glasses throughout the entire eclipse if they face the sun. Solar viewing or eclipse glasses are different from regular sunglasses which are not safe for viewing the sun. An alternate indirect method of projecting sunlight onto a surface can be used to experience the solar eclipse. Pinhole projectors shouldn’t be used to look directly at the sun.Also Read | Solar eclipse to occur on June 10, some regions to witness 'ring eclipse'How to experience the solar eclipse from countries like India where it won’t be visible?People in India and other countries where the solar eclipse won’t occur can see it via a live webcam. Weather permitting, Nasa will live stream a view of the partial solar eclipse on its YouTube channel and on its website nasa.gov/live.

09-06-2021||World||Thousands of live animals sold in Wuhan markets before Covid-19 began: Study||More than 47,000 live wild animals were sold from wet markets in the central Chinese city of Wuhan between 2017 and 2019 before the first cases of Covid-19 were officially reported from the city, a new scientific paper says.Researched by international scientists including from China, the paper said that as many as 47,381 animals from 38 species were sold in 17 markets in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019, including 31 protected species.The animals were kept in cages with poor welfare and hygiene, raising health risks.The Chinese government says the first Covid-19 cases were detected in Wuhan in early December, the infection at that time described as a kind of pneumonia.Many of the earliest cases of human Covid-19 infection were linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market, initially identified as where SARS-CoV-2 first jumped to humans through a zoonotic process, but a similar number of cases were associated with other markets as well.The new paper, written by researchers from China, Britain and Canada and published in the open access journal Scientific Reports on June 7, said there was no evidence that live bats or pangolins were sold in Wuhan, but mink, raccoon dogs, squirrels and foxes were all available. “We note that no pangolins or bats were traded, supporting reformed opinion that pangolins were not likely the spillover host at the source of the current coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic,” the authors wrote in the report.The experts added, “While we caution against the misattribution of Covid-19’s origins, the wild animals on sale in Wuhan suffered poor welfare and hygiene conditions and we detail a range of other zoonotic infections they can potentially vector.”The traded species were capable of hosting a wide range of infectious zoonotic diseases or disease-baring parasites, the researchers found.Following the outbreak and its rapid spread, the Chinese government temporarily banned all wildlife trade on January 26, 2020, three days after Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million, was locked down.The government permanently banned eating and trading terrestrial wild (non-livestock) animals for food on February 24, the same year. “These interventions, intended to protect human health, redress previous trading and enforcement inconsistencies, and will have collateral benefits for global biodiversity conservation and animal welfare,” the paper said.The authors said the study showed the range and extent of wildlife exploitation in Wuhan markets, prior to new trading bans linked to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with the poor conditions under which these animals were kept prior to sale.“Circumstantially, the absence of pangolins (and bats, not typically eaten in central China; media footage generally depicts Indonesia) from our comprehensive survey data corroborates that pangolins are unlikely implicated as spill-over hosts in the Covid-19 outbreak. This is unsurprising because live pangolin trading has largely ceased in China.”A joint study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and China in 2021 and published in March said it could not be verified if wild animals were sold at the Huanan market.“The WHO sent an investigative team to Wuhan, from 14 January-10 February 2021, to try to retrospectively ascertain what wildlife was being sold in local wet markets in this region. Their findings were inconclusive, with markets having been closed down completely at that point for 4 months; however, they did recommend that pangolins should be included in the search for possible natural hosts or intermediate hosts of the novel coronaviruses.”Incidentally, the experts collated the data from monthly surveys of wet markets unrelated and prior to the outbreak.The two-and-half years survey was intended to identify the source of the tick-borne (no human-to-human transmission) Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) following an earlier outbreak in the province, the researchers said in the paper.There is ongoing speculation that SARS-CoV-2 could have been leaked from a high-security Wuhan bio laboratory that researched coronaviruses.The disease, however, is widely believed to have originated in bats with the closest natural match found in a cave in Yunnan in southwestern China..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-live-animals-sold-in-wuhan-markets-before-covid-19-began-study-101623239047439.html

Here’s the list||New Zealand and Australian cities dominated the Global Liveability Index 2021 published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), owing to their strong response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The data for the liveability survey was collected from February 22, 2020, to March 21, 2021, the period that witnessed multiple waves of pandemic across the world. According to the EIU report, the overall global average liveability fell by seven points as compared with the pre-pandemic score.Auckland has been ranked the best on liveability rankings due to the ability of New Zealand city to contain Covid-19 faster, leading to the early lifting of restrictions than other cities around the world. According to the EIU survey, six of the top 10 cities are in New Zealand and Australia, where tighter border controls from the early days of the pandemic allowed residents to live a relatively normal life.The report also noted a decline in liveability in many European cities as they battled the second Covid-19 wave by closing schools and restaurants, and restructuring cultural and sporting events. As the pandemic hit healthcare hard in most cities around the world, cities concentrated in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region were least affected.Also Read | Mumbai slips 2 spots to 119 in global liveability indexJapanese cities of Osaka and Tokyo grabbed second and fourth place on EIU’s Global Liveability Index 2021, while two Swiss cities, Zurich and Geneva, were ranked seventh and eighth respectively. Four Australian cities - Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane - made it to the top 10 list, with Melbourne sharing the eighth position with Geneva. Honolulu was the biggest mover up the ranking in the past six months, moving 46 places to get the 14th rank on the liveability index.As per the report, living conditions remained worst in the Syrian capital Damascus. Other cities scraping along the bottom of the rankings are Lagos, Port Moresby, and Dhaka.

09-06-2021||World||LGBTQ activists in Japan plan Tokyo Olympics as 'turning point' for gay rights||LGBTQ activists in Japan plan to use the Tokyo Olympics as a "turning point" for non-heterosexual and non-cisgender rights in the country, due to the wide international attention involved with the multi-sport event. "The Tokyo 2020 Olympics is galvanising huge international attention to how this country is going to address LGBTQ issues," said Gon Matsunaka, head of Pride House Tokyo, a community hub recognised as part of the Olympic programme. The renewed push for long-term changes in favour of the protection of gay rights in Japan comes amid the backdrop of the country's parliament mulling over an anti-discrimination bill and growing support among the younger population for LGBTQ-friendly laws.The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, while originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, was eventually postponed as a result of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Now, the much-awaited global games are slated to be held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo.The fact that the games were pushed back this year comes with revamped global attention. Speaking with reporters at the Foreign correspondents' club of Japan, Gon Matsunaka detailed the LGBTQ campaign's plan to use the heightened international spotlight to push for gay rights. "By utilising this huge momentum, we aim to do two things: first, to create change inside Japan's sports industry, and second to create change in society itself," he said.Japan's handling of LGBTQ rights is chequered with controversies. While the country has some protections for sexual minorities, it remains the only G7 nation that does not recognise same-sex unions, and many couples say they can struggle to rent apartments together and are even barred from hospital visits.The situation is equally arduous for Japanese athletes. It is "very difficult" for LGBTQ sports figures in Japan to be honest about their sexuality, said Fumino Sugiyama, a former athlete who was on the national women's fencing team before coming out as a transgender man. Athletes are afraid they will disappoint their fans and families, or that they will face discrimination from their sports association that could hinder their career, Sugiyama explained.Japan's proposed anti-discrimination law has been under discussion for years and gained traction after a group of lawyers began working on it in 2015. During one debate in May, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker -- a member of the conservative ruling party -- sparked outrage by reportedly saying same-sex relationships threaten "the preservation of the species".However, things do have the potential for change, LGBTQ activists believe. Yuri Igarashi, director of the LGBTQ rights group J-ALL, told reporters there was still time for the proposed law to be passed before the parliament session ends next week. "We would like them to fulfil their promise to the people of this country," she said, citing a 2019 election pledge by the LDP to "promote understanding" of LGBTQ issues.At the UN, Japan has supported an anti-discrimination resolution, Igarashi added, while prime minister Yoshihide Suga recently spoke out against prejudice and discrimination. An increasing number of local governments and private companies are also introducing more inclusive policies, and a recent landmark court verdict called the failure to recognise same-sex marriage unconstitutional.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lgbtq-activists-in-japan-plan-tokyo-olympics-as-turning-point-for-gay-rights-101623233000009.html
09-06-2021||World||Bill Gates drove to office in Mercedes, left in Porsche to meet women: Report||After Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce last month, the reputation of the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation has come under media scrutiny due to his alleged extramarital affairs. A report published by Vanity Fair suggests that Gates’s inappropriate workplace relationships were an open secret in his broader professional and social circles.A former employee who had signed a non-disclosure agreement said that Bill Gates would drive to the office in his Mercedes and security personnel would show up with a golden-brown Porsche for the American business magnate to drive away, reported Vanity Fair. “We all assumed that it was when he was with women...I knew there were many offsite meetings that were not on his calendar,” the former employee was quoted by Vanity Fair as saying.Also Read | Gates marriage 'irretrievably broken' since 2019 over Epstein link: ReportQuoting two people familiar with the relationship situation between Gates and Melinda, Vanity Fair reported that someone in Melinda’s circle hired a private investigator, leading to the divorce filing. The claims were dismissed by a spokesperson for Melinda, calling the claim “completely false.” “Neither Melinda nor anyone at her direction ever hired a private investigator,” Vanity Fair quoted the spokesperson as saying.According to a New York Times report, Gates pursued women in the workplace when he was the chairman of Microsoft. He reportedly emailed a Microsoft employee to ask her out to dinner. He also told a woman, who was employed with Gates Foundation, that he wanted to take her out to dinner while they were on a business trip, reported Times.Melinda Gates had been working with a divorce lawyer for over a year before the duo announced it last month, partly because of her husband’s dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Wall Street Journal. In a Times report, concerns were raised about Gates’ several meetings with Epstein, which were dismissed by a spokesperson for Microsoft Corporation as meetings centred around philanthropy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-drove-to-office-in-mercedes-left-in-porsche-to-meet-women-report-101623232091097.html
09-06-2021||World||WTO should punish Chinese economic coercion: Australia||The World Trade Organization should penalize “bad behaviour when it occurs,” Australia's prime minister said Wednesday ahead of a Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Britain where he hopes to garner support in a trade dispute with China.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would be “working with others to buttress the role of the World Trade Organization and to modernise its rulebook where necessary.”“In my discussions with many leaders, I've taken great encouragement from the support shown for Australia's preparedness to withstand economic coercion in recent times,” Morrison said in a speech delivered in the Australian west coast city of Perth before leaving for the G7 meeting in Cornwall.The Australian government announced in December it would ask the WTO to intervene in its dispute with China over barley and expects other nations to become involved in the case.China effectively ended imports of Australian barley in May 2020 by putting tariffs of more than 80 per cent on the crop, accusing Australia of breaching WTO rules by subsidizing barley production and selling the grain in China at below production cost.Trade in Australian seafood, wood, beef, wine and coal has also been disrupted since Australia angered China by requesting an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.The Geneva-based WTO, which makes rules governing international trade, is facing calls for restructuring and reform as it struggles to forge a long-awaited world trade pact.“A well-functioning WTO that sets clear rules, arbitrates disputes objectively and efficiently penalizes bad behaviour when it occurs. This can be one of the most powerful tools the international community has to counter economic coercion,” Morrison said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month the United States will not leave Australia alone to face coercion from China and that such behavior toward US allies will hamper improvement in relations between Washington and Beijing.Morrison said in his speech the most practical way to address economic coercion would be to restore the WTO's binding dispute settlement system.“Where there are no consequences for coercive behaviour, there is little incentive for restraint,” Morrison said.The G-7 meeting “provides an opportunity to point a way forward” at a WTO ministerial conference on trade reforms in November, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-should-punish-chinese-economic-coercion-australia-101623224446459.html
09-06-2021||World||'This IS INSANE': Africa desperately short of Covid-19 vaccine||In the global race to vaccinate people against Covid-19, Africa is tragically at the back of the pack.In fact, it has barely gotten out of the starting blocks.In South Africa, which has the continent's most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to a worldwide tracker kept by Johns Hopkins University.And hundreds of thousands of the country's health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots.In Nigeria, Africa's biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1 per cent are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn't have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities.Chad didn't administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt,” WHO said last week.“It is extremely concerning and at times frustrating,” said Africa CDC Director Dr John Nkengasong, a Cameroonian virologist who is trying to ensure some of the world's poorest nations get a fair share of vaccines in a marketplace where they can't possibly compete.The United States and Britain, in contrast, have fully vaccinated more than 40 per cent of their populations, with higher rates for adults and high-risk people. Countries in Europe are near or past 20 per cent coverage, and their citizens are starting to think about where their vaccine certificates might take them on their summer vacations.The US, France and Germany are even offering shots to youngsters, who are at very low risk of serious illness from Covid-19.Poorer countries had warned as far back as last year of this impending vaccine inequality, fearful that rich nations would hoard doses.In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G-7 summit to share spare vaccines — something the United States has already agreed to do — and avert a “moral catastrophe.”“I'd like to believe that the G-7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just ... promises and goodwill.”Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic.“People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages.The Biden administration made its first major move to ease the crisis last week, announcing it would share an initial batch of 25 million spare doses with desperate countries in South and Central America, Asia and Africa.Nkengasong and his team were in contact with White House officials a day later, he said, with a list of countries where the 5 million doses earmarked for Africa could go to immediately.Still, the US offer is only a "trickle” of what's needed, Hasan wrote.Africa alone is facing a shortfall of around 700 million doses, even after taking into account those secured through WHO's vaccine program for poorer countries, COVAX, and a deal with Johnson & Johnson, which comes through in August, two long months away.Uganda just released a batch of 3,000 vaccine doses in the capital, Kampala — a minuscule amount for a city of 2 million — to keep its program barely alive.There and elsewhere, the fear is that the luck that somehow enabled parts of Africa to escape the worst of previous waves of Covid-19 infections and deaths might not hold this time.“The first COVID was a joke, but this one is for real. It kills,” said Danstan Nsamba, a taxi driver in Uganda who has lost numerous people he knew to the virus.In Zimbabwe, Chipo Dzimba embarked on a quest for a vaccine after witnessing Covid-19 deaths in her community. She walked miles to a church mission hospital, where there were none, and miles again to a district hospital, where nurses also had nothing and told her to go to the region's main government hospital. That was too far away.“I am giving up,” Dzimba said. “I don't have the bus fare.”South African health workers faced similar disappointment when they crowded into a parking garage last month, hoping for vaccinations and ignoring in their desperation the social distancing protocols. Many came away without a shot.Femada Shamam, who is in charge of a group of old-age homes in the South African city of Durban, has seen only around half of the 1,600 elderly and frail people she looks after vaccinated. It is six months, almost to the day, since Britain began the global vaccination drive.“They do feel very despondent and they do feel let down,” Shamam said of her unvaccinated residents, who are experiencing “huge anxiety” as they hunker down in their sealed-off homes 18 months into the outbreak. Twenty-two of her residents have died of Covid-19.“It really highlights the biggest problem ... the haves and the have-nots,” Shamam said.As for whether wealthy countries with a surplus of vaccine have gotten the message, Nkengasong said: “I am hopeful, but not necessarily confident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-insane-africa-desperately-short-of-covid-19-vaccine-101623221746639.html
09-06-2021||World||Pandemic propels Auckland to top of EIU's most liveable cities ranking||Covid-19 has shaken up the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual ranking of most liveable cities, propelling Auckland to first place, replacing Vienna, which crashed out of the top 10 as the island nations of New Zealand, Australia and Japan fared best.The Austrian capital had led the list since 2018 and for years ran neck and neck with Melbourne at the top of the survey of 140 urban centres. New Zealand's elimination of Covid-19 within its borders through lockdown measures helped by its geographic isolation, however, gave its cities a big boost."New Zealand's tough lockdown allowed their society to reopen and enabled citizens of cities like Auckland and Wellington to enjoy a lifestyle that looked similar to pre-pandemic life," the EIU said in a statement.The EIU generally does not make the full ranking public. The last time Auckland was in the top 10 was in 2017, when it came eighth, a position Melbourne shared with Geneva this year. Vienna fell to 12th.Illustrating New Zealand's advantage this year, Wellington also entered the top 10. It came fourth behind Osaka, which rose two spots to second place, and Adelaide, which leapfrogged its compatriots Sydney and Melbourne to third place from 10th.The latest ranking is from 2019 as last year's was cancelled."The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on global liveability," the EIU said."Cities across the world are now much less liveable than they were before the pandemic began, and we've seen that regions such as Europe have been hit particularly hard."The European Union struggled to get its vaccination campaign off the ground and many member states including Austria imposed more lockdowns than they had hoped to, hurting their cities' scores in the measure of 'culture and environment'. The four other categories assessed are stability, healthcare, education and infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-propels-auckland-to-top-of-eiu-s-most-liveable-cities-ranking-101623215195157.html

It is part of our culture, of our art of living, that we are going to reacquaint ourselves with," he said.Tables of up to six will be permitted at cafes and restaurants while gyms can also reopen for clients indoors.In virtually all of France however, masks however remain obligatory even out of doors until further notice.Vaccine campaign acceleratingBut the latest figures suggest the health situation is improving.The numbers in intensive care are down to 2,394 compared with 6,000 in late April.And as of Tuesday, more than 28 million people had had at least one vaccine shot -- nearly 43% of the population, and 55% of the adult population.Despite the closures, France over the last half-year endured less severe lockdowns than its neighbours -- notably avoiding major school closures -- in what was seen as a major gamble by Macron.Its vaccine campaign got off to a wobbly start but is now seen as a success, with 700,000 jabs being given on some days.Travel to France is also becoming easier, with France from Wednesday fully opening its borders to EU residents.Visitors from the EU will not have to provide a negative antigen or PCR test if they have had a full course of one of the four vaccines authorised by the bloc.Travel from other zones including the US and Britain are subject to tighter restrictions but visitors will no longer have to prove a compelling reason for a visit, so long as they have had the full course of vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-starts-relaxing-covid-19-curbs-shortens-night-curfew-101623214428989.html

09-06-2021||World||'Motivated by hatred': Trudeau denounces truck attack targeting Muslim family||A pickup truck attack that killed four members of an immigrant family has shaken Canada, a country where immigrants are largely accepted, and drew denunciations Tuesday from Canada’s prime minister, who called it a hate crime directed at Muslims.The victims — two parents, two children and a grandmother — were on an evening walk when the driver of the truck struck them at an intersection in London, Ontario. The sole survivor was a 9-year-old boy, who was hospitalized.“This was a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament. “If anyone thinks racism and hatred don’t exist in this country, I want to say this: How do we explain such violence to a child in a hospital? How can we look families in the eye and say “Islamophobia isn’t real”?The victims’ extended family issued a statement identifying the dead as Salman Afzal, 46; his wife Madiha, 44; their daughter Yumna, 15; and a 74-year-old grandmother whose name was withheld. The hospitalized boy was identified as the couple’s son, Fayez. Friends said the family immigrated to Canada 14 years ago.Many Canadians have been enjoying evening walks to get fresh air after long days at home during the pandemic, Trudeau said.“But unlike every other night, this family never made it home,” Trudeau said. “Their lives were taken in a brutal, cowardly and brazen act of violence. This killing was no accident. ... Canadians are outraged by what happened on Sunday. And many Muslim Canadians are scared.”Trudeau said words matter and in part blamed rhetoric, disinformation and extremism online and in politics.“They can be a seed that grows into an ugly, pervasive trend. And sometimes, they lead to real violence,” the prime minister said.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter that the attack revealed the growing Islamophobia in Western countries.A 20-year-old suspect, Nathaniel Veltman, was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. He was facing four counts of first-degree murder. Police were inside the suspect’s London apartment on Tuesday.Police said Veltman did not know the victims. Detective Supt. Paul Waight said it was not clear if he belonged to any specific hate group, but that local police were working with federal authorities to investigate potential terrorism charges. He said the attack was planned.Veltman worked part time at an egg farm in nearby Strathroy, Ontario. The chief executive of Gray Ridge Eggs Inc., William Gray, gave no details about Veltman’s job. He said the company was “shocked and saddened” by the attack, and he expressed sympathy for the victims’ relatives and the Muslim community.Arman Moradpourian, a friend who worked with Veltman, called Veltman a very devout Christian and said he was home schooled. Moradpourian said Veltman didn't have a problem with him being Persian and raised Muslim.“He never judged me,” Moradpourian told The Associated Press. “He would give his shirt off his back for you.”Moradpourian said Veltman helped him with rides to grocery stores and helped him mediate family issues. He said Veltman deleted his social media years ago and remade it a few months ago. He said he used the same name but said it was deactivated after he was arrested. He said Veltman was into video games and fishing.Everyone who knew the Afzal family knew “the model family they were as Muslims, Canadians and Pakistanis,” the statement from the extended family said. “They worked extremely hard in their fields and excelled. Their children were top students in their school and connected strongly with their spiritual identity.”A fundraising webpage said the father was a physiotherapist and cricket enthusiast and his wife was working on a doctorate in civil engineering at Western University in London. Their daughter was finishing ninth grade, and the grandmother was a “pillar” of the family, the page said.Thousands of mourners including Trudeau and the leaders of all of Canada’s political parties attended a vigil Tuesday night at the mosque the family attended. Pandemic restrictions were eased to allow mourners to attend the outdoor vigil.“There are no words that can ease the grief of having three generations murdered in their neighborhood,” Trudeau told the crowd. “There are no words that can undo the pain and yes the anger of this community. There are no words that can fix the future of that little boy who has had his future taken away. But know this: You are not alone. All Canadians mourn with you and stand with you.”Imam Abd Alfatah Twakkal of the London Muslim Mosque said he hoped the vigil would be a pivotal moment for his community and country in the fight against the scourge of racism and discrimination.“Every single one of us need to do our part,” he said.Rauf Ahmad and three friends earlier watched the growing tribute at the intersection in the day.“I didn’t think there was racism in Canada, and I felt very safe when I came here two years ago, but I do not feel safe now,” Ahmad said. “Humanity is first. We should not care about whether someone is a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.”Near the crash scene, Zahid Khan, a family friend, said through tears: “They were just out for their walk that they would go out for every day.

Everyone should be absolutely proud of what we have all achieved together," Victoria state acting Premier James Merlino said Wednesday.He said collective efforts had steamed the outbreak in the city, which has seen more than 80 people test positive for either the Kappa or Delta strains that originated in India."But we know this isn't over yet, and until we have widespread vaccination across Victoria and across our country, the virus will still be with us," Merlino said.Melbourne residents still cannot travel more than 25 kilometres (16 miles) from their homes or have visitors over, but may gather in groups of up to 10 outside.Schools, cafes and beauty salons can reopen, but gyms and nightclubs must remain closed for at least another week.Brett Sutton, Victoria's chief health officer, said there could not be a "snap back" to no restrictions as the situation remains "reasonably volatile"."We have to move by increments, safely, but with the minimum restrictions that we know will continue to control this," he said.Australia is one of the few countries globally without endemic transmission, recording 30,000 Covid-19 cases and fewer than 1,000 deaths in a population of 25 million.The border remains closed to most travellers -- with the exception of those from New Zealand -- and authorities are quick to impose restrictions when cases are detected.The virus is believed to have leaked out of Australia's makeshift hotel quarantine facilities up to 18 times in six months, prompting tough scrutiny of the system in recent weeks.Outbreaks in Taiwan and Japan have also underscored how initial success in containing the virus can quickly erode without widespread vaccination.Australia had administered about 5.2 million jabs as of Monday, but only a small fraction of people are fully vaccinated.hr/arb/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-5-million-in-melbourne-exit-two-week-coronavirus-lockdown-101623207467281.html
09-06-2021||World||US, Japan Covid aid counters China's rising influence in Indo-Pacific: Taiwan||The United States and Japan Covid-19 vaccine support to Taiwan is intended as a countermeasure to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan News reported citing a political scientist.As Taiwan faces the spike in Covid-19 cases, the US and Japan stepped forward and provided the vaccine against the infection to the island. The move has irked China which considers Taiwan as its own territory.Japan's donation of over 1.2 million Covid-19 doses to Taiwan last week was followed by a visit by three American senators who announced the US has pledged 750,000 vaccines to the country as part of its program to distribute unused vaccines worldwide.While the relief was interpreted by some as reciprocating Taiwan's assistance to the two countries in the past, the moves also demonstrate Washington and Tokyo's determination to check Chinese political manoeuvring aimed at sowing discord in Taiwanese society, said Lin Wen-cheng, distinguished professor at National Sun Yat-sen University's Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies (ICAPS).ICAPS professor Kuo Yu-jen reckoned that the speedy assistance from the US and Japan suggests the two nations are including Taiwan in their collaborative strategy toward China.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.A US delegation travelled to Taiwan to announce the donation of 750,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses.Reacting to the visit, the Chinese defence ministry on Tuesday said the trip had seriously damaged the foundation of China-US ties and the stability of the Taiwan Strait, calling it "extremely irresponsible", South China Morning Post reported."If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from mainland China, the People's Liberation Army will hit back and be determined to protect national unity and territorial integrity at all costs," ministry spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-japan-covid-aid-counters-china-s-rising-influence-in-indo-pacific-taiwan-101623197159028.html

09-06-2021||World||Israeli lawmakers to vote Sunday on coalition formed against PM Netanyahu||After weeks of political wrangling the Israeli parliament is set to vote Sunday on whether to install a "change" coalition and end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12 consecutive years in power.Announcing the date for the confidence vote, speaker Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, said on Tuesday "a special session of parliament" would debate and vote on the fragile eight-party alliance, after the country's fourth inconclusive election in two years back in March.Later in the day, the prime minister's office announced that a march by Jewish nationalists through Jerusalem would go ahead in a week's time, potentially re-escalating tensions with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group which went to war with the Jewish state for 11 days last month.Israeli right-wing groups had the day before cancelled plans for the controversial march, originally due to take place this Thursday, citing Israeli police restrictions, and as Hamas warned that the route could spark new violence.Divisive incumbent Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for more than a decade, pushing it firmly to the right.If Sunday's crunch parliamentary vote hands a majority to the coalition, which is united only by hostility to Netanyahu's rule, it would spell the end of an era.Since the nascent coalition was announced last week, Netanyahu has lived up to his reputation as a ruthless political operator, piling pressure on right-wingers within its ranks to reject this "dangerous left-wing government".The anti-Netanyahu bloc includes three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an Arab Islamic conservative party.On paper it commands a wafer-thin majority, but Netanyahu has urged his supporters to shame right-wing lawmakers into walking away from the prospective alliance.Hamas warningThe Israeli political drama is playing out as tensions with the Palestinians smoulder, with police cracking down on demonstrations over the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from homes in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem to make way for Jewish settlers.Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday that cabinet had approved a decision to hold the so-called March of the Flags next Tuesday, adding that it would go ahead in a format to "be agreed by police and organisers".The decision had been agreed by both the prime minister and his defence minister Benny Gantz, before it was put to the cabinet, the premier's office said.The event had previously been due to proceed through flashpoint areas of east Jerusalem that have seen repeated clashes recently between Israeli police and Palestinians.A top Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, had warned Israel Monday "against letting the march approach east Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound"."We hope the message is clear so that Thursday doesn't become (a new) May 10," he said, in reference to the start of the 11-day war which Hamas launched in response to tensions at the mosque compound, Islam's third-holiest site, which is also revered by Jews.Netanyahu had convened a late-night meeting Monday with senior government officials to discuss alternatives that could allow the march to proceed -- a move that saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of working to ratchet up tensions as his grip on power grows increasingly shaky.Labor MP Gilad Kariv, a supporter of the coalition, called the move "another chapter in the outgoing government's attempt to leave a scorched earth".'Let go'If the new government is confirmed, Netanyahu's right-wing opponent Naftali Bennett would serve as premier for two years, after which the "change" coalition's centrist architect, Yair Lapid, would take over."The unity government is on the way and ready to work on behalf of all the people of Israel," Lapid, a former television presenter, said in a statement following the announcement of the vote.Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges that could result in jail time, has refused to go without a messy fight.Bitter recriminations within the Israeli right and far right prompted Israeli security services to issue a rare warning against incitement online, which Netanyahu's opponents say was a warning to the prime minister.Alarm has grown over angry rallies by supporters of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, including protests outside the homes of right-wing lawmakers accused of "betrayal" for joining the coalition. Security has been stepped up for some of the MPs.The 71-year-old prime minister has rejected allegations of incitement, saying "there is a very thin line between political criticism and inciting violence".Bennett, who served as Netanyahu's aide before turning against him, has urged his former boss to "let go".Should 11th-hour defections torpedo the fledgling coalition, Israel would likely have to return to the polls for a fifth election in just over two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-lawmakers-to-vote-sunday-on-coalition-formed-against-pm-netanyahu-101623183950888.html
09-06-2021||World||UK urges EU to show 'pragamatism and common sense' in post-Brexit talks||The UK's chief negotiator called on the European Union to show “pragmatism and common sense,” instead of threatening to retaliate, as the two sides meet to resolve differences over the deal that was supposed to keep trade flowing after Brexit.David Frost made the comments after his EU counterpart said the bloc was ready to act “firmly and resolutely” if the UK fails to honor its commitments under the divorce agreement. The two men are scheduled to meet Wednesday in London amid rising tensions over implementation of the deal in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the bloc.Central to the talks are provisions of the deal that effectively created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, angering many pro-British residents of the island. While Britain has called for compromise, the EU says the new rules are needed to protect the bloc's single market.Both sides fear the tensions could fuel a return to violence in Northern Ireland.“Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won't make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can't buy their favorite product,” Frost said, referring to a town in Northern Ireland. “What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important, and it is ever more urgent.”The divorce deal, which took effect on Jan. 1, included a number of grace periods that gave Britain time to put in place new systems to check a variety of goods coming into Northern Ireland to ensure they comply with EU rules. Those grace periods are now ending, causing headaches for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.The UK angered Brussels earlier this year when it unilaterally extended the grace period covering many supermarket items, delaying the required inspections for six months. The EU has threatened legal action over that decision.The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, reported Tuesday that the UK may also extend the grace period covering chilled meats such as sausages and ground beef, which is scheduled to end at the end of this month.Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief negotiator, cautioned against such action, saying the two sides should strive to achieve “mutually agreed compliance paths.”“If this does not happen, and if the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations,” Sefcovic wrote Tuesday in the Telegraph.While Sefcovic didn't specify what those actions might be, the Times of London quoted an unidentified EU official as saying the bloc was ready to impose trade sanctions and retaliatory tariffs.Sefcovic described the so-called Northern Ireland protocol as an opportunity that will give the region access to more than 500 million customers in both the UK and European Union.But Frost said compromise is needed to make this a reality. The UK has sent 10 papers to the EU offering solutions to many of the issues that divide the two sides, but has received no written responses from the bloc, he said.“When I meet Maros Sefcovic later today my message will be clear: time is short and practical solutions are needed now to make the Protocol work,” Frost said.Britain accused the EU of taking an unnecessarily “purist approach” to the new rules.“There's no case whatsoever for preventing chilled meats from being sold in Northern Ireland,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman, Max Blain. “We are working very hard to try and resolve these issues consensually,”“Time is starting to run out and solutions are urgently needed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-eu-to-show-pragamatism-and-common-sense-in-post-brexit-talks-101623183589827.html

"I would say the situation inside the country is concerning. And the situation is continuing to get worse. I think we are looking at all scenarios."Myanmar has been in turmoil since a Feb. 1 military coup, with daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority militias, some of which have only existed for a few weeks.The United Nations said on Tuesday an estimated 100,000 people in Myanmar's Kayah state had been displaced by fighting that included "indiscriminate attacks by security forces" in civilian areas.Campbell noted that Myanmar's coup leader Min Aung Hlaing had admitted in an interview aired on military-owned television he had not anticipated the level of civil unrest.Campbell said Washington, which has imposed sanctions on the coup leaders and their economic interests, had supported efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and others to try to begin a process of moving Myanmar back to democracy and was urging countries isolate the generals diplomatically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/undeniable-that-violance-is-spiraling-us-govt-s-top-asia-official-on-situation-in-myanmar-101623181673931.html

The AP said it has not seen evidence to support the claim.Ambassador Gilad Erdan issued his statement a day after meeting the AP's president and chief executive, Gary Pruitt, and Ian Phillips, vice president for international news, at the AP's New York headquarters.The Israeli air force bombed the 12-story al-Jalaa tower on May 15, roughly an hour after ordering all occupants to evacuate. No one was injured, but the building was destroyed. The building was home to offices belonging to the AP, the Al Jazeera satellite channel as well as dozens of families.The airstrike came during an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group.In a statement on Twitter, Erdan said he told AP executives that the building was used by Hamas to disrupt the Iron Dome, which intercepted hundreds of incoming rockets fired by the militant group during the fighting.Erdan said the airstrike did not intentionally target journalists.“AP is one of the most important news agencies in the world and Israel does not suspect its employees were aware a covert Hamas unit was using the building in this way,” he said.“I reaffirmed that Israel upholds the importance of press freedom and strives to ensure the safety of journalists wherever they are reporting. Israel is willing to assist AP in rebuilding its offices and operations in Gaza,” he added.The meeting with Erdan "was a positive and constructive conversation,” the AP said in a statement. The agency expressed its appreciation for his pledges to help rebuild an AP bureau in Gaza.The AP renewed its call to see evidence backing Israel’s claim that Hamas militants were operating in the building.“Israeli authorities maintain that the building housing our bureau was destroyed because of a Hamas presence that posed an urgent threat," the AP said. "We have yet to receive evidence to support these claims. AP continues to call for the full release of any evidence the Israelis have so that the facts are public.”The AP has repeatedly urged Israel to share any evidence supporting its claims of Hamas activity in the building. It also has urged an independent investigation into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-claims-hamas-tried-to-hamper-iron-dome-rocket-defense-from-destroyed-gaza-building-101623180604763.html
09-06-2021||World||‘We are deeply sorry’: Colonial Pipeline's CEO tells US Senate Panel on impact of ransomware attack||The chief executive officer of the pipeline company hit by a ransomware attack last month apologized to a US Senate panel for the incident that paralyzed the East Coast’s flow of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, while defending his company’s response and offering tips for future hacking victims.“We are deeply sorry for the impact that this attack had, but are also heartened by the resilience of our country and of our company,” Colonial Pipeline Co. CEO Joseph Blount Jr. said at Tuesday’s hearing.Blount’s appearance before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee comes as Congress readies its response to the hack, which affected 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supply, driving up gasoline prices and sparking shortages at filling stations after the company shut the roughly 5,500-mile pipeline on May 7.The senators’ questions for Blount were direct but relatively gentle. Blount was contrite -- and sometimes vague -- on some details about the company’s cybersecurity protections. When asked about Colonial’s cybersecurity budget, for instance, he said they had spent $200 million on information technology over five years without specifying how much was defending against hacks.Blount said responding quickly to contain the threat and swiftly communicating with the government were among the most important lessons he learned from the incident.The hackers, who the FBI said have been linked to a group known as DarkSide operating in Russia, were able to breach the company’s computer system April 29 using a virtual private network -- or VPN -- account, an encrypted internet connection that allowed employees to remotely access the company’s computer network. Blount testified that the VPN account only had single-factor authentication.The “legacy” network “was not intended to be in use,” said Blount, who took over as Colonial CEO in 2017. He added that the company is still trying to determine how the hackers gained the needed credentials to exploit it.Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the ranking member on the committee, called out this failure. “Mr. Blount you’re a victim, and we understand that,” he said, but added, “this account apparently didn’t use multifactor authentication, which again is just a basic cybersecurity hygiene item that companies should have in place, making it harder for people to gain access.”Blount was asked repeatedly about his decision to pay the hacker’s ransom, an action that is discouraged by the FBI because it encourages others to attempt cyberattacks. He described it as “the hardest decision I’ve made in my 39 years in the energy industry.”“I believe with all my heart it was the right choice to make,” Blount told the committee. After it was over, he told reporters, “I’d do it again under the same circumstances.”Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, asked Blount to consider the alternative. “How much worse could it have been had you not made that very difficult decision to bite the bullet so you could get your pipelines up and operational?” Johnson asked.Blount responded, “That’s an unknown we probably don’t want to know.” But he said that even after paying the ransom, it still took the company six days to get the pipeline back up and running. The remediation at Colonial is ongoing, Blount said, including bringing seven affected financial systems back online this week.The Department of Justice announced Monday it had recovered the majority of the payment Blount made to the perpetrators in cryptocurrency after law enforcement identified a virtual wallet used in the ransom payment. Because of the declining value of Bitcoin since the ransom was paid, the US seizure in late May amounted to $2.3 million, just over half the $4.4 million paid weeks earlier after the ransom was demanded.The ransomware attack on Colonial is part of a rising trend of such acts against critical infrastructure that is posing an early test of President Joe Biden’s administration. It was among a wave of ransomware attacks that included JBS SA, the largest meat producer globally, which forced the shutdown of all its US beef plants, halting output at facilities that account for almost a quarter of American supplies.US intelligence and law enforcement officials say stopping hacking attacks has become a national security priority. Congress is also considering a legislative response that could include cybersecurity mandates that energy and pipeline companies have spent years opposing.Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the committee, said the committee is working on comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that would address information sharing by the private sector with government during cyberattacks. “The private industry has to be very forthcoming. They have to let us know what they know so that information can be shared with other companies. We’re going to be putting a mechanism to do that,” he said.Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, expressed concern that Colonial didn’t have a specific plan in place for ransomware attacks prior to the breach. “I have small school districts in New Hampshire that are more prepared than Colonial Pipeline appeared to be, and that’s really concerning,” she told reporters.“It really speaks to the importance of understanding that when critical infrastructure is run by a private entity, that there needs to be some rules and frameworks to make sure that interests of the American people are served,” Hassan added.Johnson endorsed a response led by the private sector, saying he wasn’t convinced that government could issue standards and keep them up-to-date given its struggles to pay for top talent.Meanwhile, Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, said the Colonial pipeline shutdown and resulting fuel shortages demonstrated the need to build more pipelines to provide redundancy in the case of outages.The Colonial shutdown, he said, is “the ghost of Christmas future for the entire country if we don’t continue to maintain our pipelines, increase capacity of pipelines, if we don’t continue to expand, have a duplication of pipelines in spots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-deeply-sorry-colonial-pipeline-s-ceo-tells-us-senate-panel-on-impact-of-ransomware-attack-101623180218700.html

According to the Indian data, trade grew 55.83% in the first five months of the year.The reason for the discrepancy in the data isn’t known; both countries denominate the trade in dollars. Calling it a “spectacular growth”, Chinese state media interpreted the increase in bilateral trade as a sign of resilience in trade ties between the two countries despite serious conflict at the border and political differences.“Trade between China and India soared 70.1 % in US dollar terms in the first five months of this year to $48.16 billion, according to Chinese customs data released on Monday. Specifically, Chinese exports to India grew 64.1% year-on-year from January to May, while imports surged 90.2%,” the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times reported.According to the Indian data, imports from China rose 59.13% to $33.49 billion, while exports to China rose 46.09% to $10.41 billion.The trade volume between the two countries was higher than the trade China conducted with other trading partners in this period, the Global Times report said. The latest statistics were released by China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Monday.As per Chinese data, the trade – or specifically Chinese exports to India – rose sharply between April and May. The rise could be attributed to the increase of exports of Chinese medical goods and equipment by Indian companies to fight the surge in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of months. “If anything, these extraordinary growth rates show that China-India trade has largely shrugged off the impact of the political tensions caused by the border friction last year...,” the state media report said.India-China trade in 2020 declined by 9.1% to $77.66 billion, though China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner in 2020.Those numbers are for the calendar year. India, follows an April to March financial year and according to government data, Indian exports to China saw a 27.53% jump in 2020-21 , while China’s imports saw a 0.07% contraction. Total India-China trade in the financial year was $86.4 billion, with a $44 billion trade balance in favour of China, a significant 30.15% drop from about $63 billion in 2017-18.According to the Indian embassy in Beijing, though bilateral trade between the two countries grew exponentially overall – notwithstanding a fall last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic -- India continues to be saddled with a big trade deficit.“The growth of trade deficit with China can be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, that we export to China and market access impediments for most of our agricultural products and the sectors where we are competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, IT/IteS, etc. Our pre-dominant exports have consisted of cotton, copper and diamonds/ natural gems,” the Indian embassy says on its website under the section “India-China Trade and Economic Relations”.India’s Commerce ministry did not respond to an email query on this matter.According to an Indian official who asked not to be named, the spurt in trade in 2020-21 signified a jump in Indian exports to China and a sharp decline in Chinese imports. “This is a grand success of Make in India and Make for the world aided by competitiveness of Indian industry,” the official said requesting anonymity.To be sure, some analysts also point to the contraction of the Indian economy as the main reason for the fall in Chinese imports last year, although some bit of it was also on account of the situation at the Line of Actual Control.As for the first five months of this year, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the numbers likely reflect the spike in imports of medical equipment from China to cope with the second wave of Coronavirus infections. The people, however, added that this shouldn’t be perceived as “business as usual” against the backdrop of the dragging border standoff.In a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on April 30, external affairs minister S Jaishankar highlighted the importance of transport corridors and cargo flights remaining open and speedy logistics support from the Chinese side to facilitate the procurement of Covid-19 related products and raw materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-shows-trade-between-beijing-new-delhi-grew-in-5-months-of-2021-101623179540344.html

"Easing of restrictions will be focused on Canadians who are fully vaccinated."Trudeau did not give details and did not mention what would happen to Americans who had two doses, saying only that restrictions would remain until more people had received their second doses of vaccine. Canadian officials say Ottawa and Washington are in constant contact over the issue.Canadian officials have previously said the border should stay partially closed until 75% of the population has received their first shots and 20% their second, and that could happen in mid-July, according to projections based on planned vaccine deliveries.A source familiar with the talks said Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair had told US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas that Canada could theoretically be able to admit fully vaccinated Americans by August.The mayors of some border cities said on Monday they expected Canada to move as early as June 21, the next deadline for a possible rollover of restrictions.The US and Canadian chambers of commerce and other business groups said in a joint statement on Tuesday that the two governments should allow fully vaccinated travelers to cross the border starting June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-soon-say-how-covid-19-curbs-at-us-border-would-be-eased-for-fully-vaccinated-pm-trudeau-101623178746633.html

He has asked for a report in 90 days.The US has said it is determined to “get to the bottom” of the pandemic and, along with several other countries, has urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to launch a comprehensive probe, going beyond its earlier report, which had found the lab leak theory “extremely unlikely”.The May 2020 study was conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s intelligence wing ,“Z Division”, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the study, and it was based on a genetic analysis of the virus that causes Covid-19.The report, dated May 27, 2020, was sent to the state department in October and it sought more information.A factsheet released by the state department in January 2021 listed out several reasons why the pandemic might have been caused by an accidental leak from the Wuhan lab. It said, “The US government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019.”The WSJ has reported based on US intelligence assessment that three researchers from the Wuhan virology lab were taken to hospital, and it was in November 2019, well before the first case was reported by China in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-concluded-covid-19-lab-leak-theory-plausible-101623178968573.html

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a “strengthened package of support” in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, including more testing and door-to-door visits to encourage vaccine take-up. Residents were advised to minimize travel, though officials insisted it’s not a local lockdown.Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham urged the government to send the region more vaccine doses.The move highlights the deep concern in government about the spread of the delta variant, which was first identified in India, and its potential impact on coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is weighing whether to ease England’s remaining Covid-19 restrictions as planned on June 21, with an announcement due on June 14. Ministers have said no decisions have yet been made on whether to push the date back a few weeks until more people receive two vaccine doses.Easing the rules would allow nightclubs to reopen, sports stadiums to fill to capacity, queuing for drinks in bars, and large weddings and conferences to resume. Johnson is under pressure from businesses and Conservative Party colleagues to stick to the date they have dubbed “Freedom Day.”But the latest data is heading in the wrong direction for the government. A further 6,048 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday, up from 5,238 last week. NHS England data showed there were 879 coronavirus patients in hospitals, up from 776 in a week.In Parliament, Hancock said “conclusive” data on the effectiveness of vaccines against the delta variant would be available in the next “couple of weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sends-military-to-covid-19-hotspots-in-northern-england-to-tackle-delta-variant-s-spread-101623177366634.html
09-06-2021||World||US CDC eases travel recommendations on over 110 countries including Japan, Canada||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics.The CDC's new ratings were first reported by Reuters and posted on a CDC website on Monday, include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest "Level 4" rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.Another 50 countries and territories have been lowered to "Level 2" or "Level 1," a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania.Among those now listed at "Level 3," are France, Ecuador, Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary, and Italy.A US State Department official said it was in the process of revising its travel advisory to reflect the CDC changes.As of early Tuesday, the State Department had lowered its ratings on more than 90 countries and territories, including for Japan.On May 24, the State Department had urged against travel to Japan, citing a new wave of coronavirus cases before the Tokyo Olympics are set to begin July 23.The State Department warning raised concerns and prompted the White House to reaffirm its support for Tokyo's plan to hold the Games this summer and for US athletes competing there despite a new wave of infections and low vaccination rate in the host country.Foreign spectators have been banned, and organizers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators.The CDC said the change comes after it revised its criteria for travel health notices. The CDC said it has also revised its rating for the United States to "Level 3" from "Level 4."The agency said the new criteria for a Level 4 "avoid all travel" recommendation has changed from 100 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 to 500 cases per 100,000.The agency added that many countries have lower ratings "because of the criteria changes or because their outbreaks are better controlled." The CDC said it expects more countries to get lower, more favorable travel ratings.Other countries being lowered to "Level 3" include Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Libya, Panama, Poland, Denmark and Malaysia.Many of the countries that now have lower ratings remain on the US government's list of countries subject to severe travel restrictions - and most have been subject to the restrictions since early 2020.The United States bars nearly all non-US citizens who have within the previous 14 days been to China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, South Africa, Brazil, Iran and the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls.Asked why the United States is maintaining the warnings even though some countries now have low infection rates subject to the restrictions, while others with high rates are exempt, CDC Director Rochelle Wallensky said on Tuesday the issue is subject to "an interagency conversation, and we are looking at the data in real time as to how we should move forward with that."The United States also has been in discussions with Canada and Mexico - both of which had recommendations eased on Tuesday - on how to eventually lift or revise restrictions at US land borders that bar non-essential travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-eases-travel-recommendations-on-over-110-countries-including-japan-canada-101623173181994.html
