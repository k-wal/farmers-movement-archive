Speaking to CNN, Fauci highlighted the disparity in vaccination rates in different regions of the United States to express his concern over the spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases."When you have such a low level of vaccination superimposed upon a variant that has a high degree of efficiency of spread, what you are going to see among undervaccinated regions -- be that states, cities or counties -- you're going to see these individual types of blips," Fauci said."It's almost like it's going to be two Americas," the 80-year-old immunologist added.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 'variant of concern' B.1.617.2, first detected in India, accounts for more than one-fourth of the total active Covid-19 cases in the country and has reached nearly every state. The United States has administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to over 53% of its population and aims to achieve herd immunity through vaccination as soon as possible.Also Read | Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy boosterHowever, US authorities are now struggling to combat vaccine hesitancy when the Delta variant, known for its higher transmissibility, has started gaining more ground in the country, especially in places with low vaccination rates. States like Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Wyoming, and Louisiana have less than 35% of residents fully vaccinated. In Mississippi, unvaccinated people accounted for more than 90% of Covid-related deaths in the past month."I'm concerned about the Delta variant...and I am worried that what we are seeing in terms of a plateauing of cases nationally but also an increase in cases in many small sections of the United States, that is, in fact, being driven by the Delta variant," US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-warns-of-two-americas-as-delta-variant-cases-rise-in-us-101625070616548.html

30-06-2021||World||Experts want countries to closely watch UK strategy of combating Delta variant||Experts are urging countries to watch the strategy of the United Kingdom closely as it attempts to out-vaccinate the potential third wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant first detected in India, according to a CNN report. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier expressed confidence in the government’s four-step roadmap out of lockdown that would have culminated on June 21 if not for the Delta variant.The government had to extend the final phase of lifting virtually all restrictions and returning back to normal on July 19, a goal targeted through aggressive vaccination drives. Britain boasts of one of the largest vaccination coverage in the world in terms of vaccination population percentage and should have been easier than other countries. However, the emergence of the Delta variant, which has become the dominant strain in the country, could potentially jeopardise Britain’s plan to return back to normal.Dr Susan Hopkins, strategy director for Covid-19 at Public Health England (PHE), recently said that it should be possible for 70 per cent of the adult population to receive both doses of Covid vaccine before July 19, indicating an endorsement of the government's position on the final phase of unlocking. But the country is now witnessing a worrying spike in Covid-19 cases, with nearly 120,000 new infections reported in the past week.The impact of vaccination has impacted the demography of infection since recent data on Covid-19 indicates that people under-30s, who have not been extensively vaccinated, were the ones largely infected by the virus. Deepti Gurdasani, a senior epidemiology lecturer at the Queen Mary University of London, told CNN that the Delta variant has the “potential to change the shape of the pandemic” in the UK.Also Read | Delta Plus: What should diabetic, high BP people do? All you need to knowWhile Britain’s new health secretary, Sajid Javid, has stressed that there’s “no reason” to reconsider the July 19 target for opening-up, several countries have started imposing restrictions on travellers from the UK in the wake of Delta variant spread. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has labelled the United Kingdom as an "extremely high-risk" location.As the variant of concern is becoming a dominant strain in many countries across the world, experts believe that they should look at Britain’s approach closely, which is solely relying on vaccines to contain a potential catastrophe. Gurdasani said that Britain needs to refocus the entire strategy, adding that all countries need to have a long term focus on masks and ventilation."What we're seeing is the dangers of a vaccine-only strategy. Vaccines are a hugely important part of our response, but we do need to protect our vaccines, and we need to reduce transmission," Gurdasani was quoted as saying by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-want-countries-to-closely-watch-uk-strategy-of-combating-delta-variant-101625062908781.html
30-06-2021||World||Scientists closer to solving methane mystery on Mars, says Nasa||Scientists are now a step closer to solving the mystery of methane gas detected by Nasa’s Curiosity rover on Mars. On Earth, a significant amount of methane is produced by microbes that help livestock digest their food and the process ends with cattle releasing the gas into the air while exhaling or burping.Curiosity rover’s repeated detections of methane right above the surface of Gale Crater has captivated scientists and non-scientists alike as it may imply that microbes were, or are, present on the Red planet. It is also, however, possible that the gas was produced due to the geological processes that involve the interaction of rocks, water, and heat.But the mystery of methane gas intensified after ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter sent by the European Space Agency (ESA) failed to detect any methane higher in the Martian atmosphere.Chris Webster, a senior research scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said he was fully expecting the Trace Gas Orbiter team to report that there’s a small amount of methane everywhere on Mars when the orbiter came onboard in 2017.“But when the European team announced that it saw no methane, I was definitely shocked,” said Webster, lead of the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) instrument in the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) chemistry lab aboard the Curiosity rover.Also Read | Scientists use NASA satellite data to track ocean microplastics from spaceThe TLS has measured less than one-half part per billion (in volume) of methane on average in Gale Crater, punctuated by spikes of up to 20 parts per billion in volume. The contradictory data from the high precision of Curiosity’s TLS and the European orbiter, designed to be the gold standard for measuring methane and other gases over the whole planet, baffled the scientists.John E Moores, a planetary scientist from York University in Toronto, published an intriguing prediction in 2019 asking “what if Curiosity and the Trace Gas Orbiter both are right?" The hypothesis suggested that the discrepancy between methane measurements comes down to the time of day they’re taken.TLS operates mostly at night when no other Curiosity instruments are working since it needs a lot of power. Moores noted that the Martian atmosphere is calm at night, so the methane seeping from the ground builds up near the surface where Curiosity can detect it. On the other hand, the European orbiter requires sunlight to pinpoint methane about 5 kilometres above the surface.During the daytime, warm air rises and cool air sinks. The methane gas detected near the Martian surface at night gets mixed into the atmosphere during the day, getting diluted to undetectable levels.The Curiosity team decided to test Moores’ prediction and powered TLS over the course of one Martian day, bracketing one night-time measurement with two daytime ones. SAM sucked in Martian air for two hours, leaving a concentrated sample of methane that TLS could easily measure by passing an infrared laser beam through it many times“John predicted that methane should effectively go down to zero during the day, and our two daytime measurements confirmed that,” said Paul Mahaffy, the principal investigator of SAM.While the scientists were able to solve the mystery behind variations, they are yet to solve the global methane puzzle at Mars. According to Nasa, methane is a stable molecule that is expected to last on Mars for about 300 years before getting torn apart by solar radiation. But scientists suspect that something is destroying methane on Mars in less than 300 years, given the constant seeping of methane from similar craters should have accumulated enough in the atmosphere for the Trace Gas Orbiter to detect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-closer-to-solving-methane-mystery-on-mars-says-nasa-101625056847448.html

About four hours later, I felt that there was some tenderness where I had received the shot. I received the second at mid-day. At midnight, I measured my temperature. It was 98.9°F. I went to sleep, when I woke up my temperature was 97.8°F. That was it,” Putin told the nation.Putin said that he is against mandatory vaccination but said that the army is getting vaccinated with Sputnik-V like him. He also defended the local authorities taking steps to ensure vaccination saying it is needed to avoid a national lockdown. “The military is getting vaccinated with Sputnik V, and after all I'm the commander-in-chief,” Putin said. The Russian president however urged Russians to not listen to rumours and pay heed to what the specialists are saying about the vaccine. He said it is ‘necessary’ to avoid listening to people ‘who understand less and spread rumours’.Putin’s comments come in the backdrop of Russia reporting a record-high number of deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours and as daily case tally remained above 20,000. Russia on Wednesday reported 669 deaths and 21,042 fresh cases which brought the caseload to more than 5.5 million.The government is also concerned about the vaccine hesitancy among Muscovites. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier this week admitted that Russia will fail to vaccinate 60% of the population within the fall season. Only 16% Russians have had at least one dose so far whereas the European Union and the United States have vaccinated more than 50% and 54% of its population respectively.(with inputs from Reuters, Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-he-received-both-doses-of-sputnik-v-asks-russians-to-follow-suit-101625052716989.html

30-06-2021||World||WHO declares China malaria-free after nation reports zero cases for last 4 years||China was certified as malaria-free on Wednesday by the World Health Organization, following a 70-year effort to eradicate the mosquito-borne disease.The country reported 30 million cases of the infectious disease annually in the 1940s but has now gone four consecutive years without an indigenous case."We congratulate the people of China on ridding the country of malaria," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."Their success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal."Countries that have achieved at least three consecutive years of zero indigenous cases can apply for WHO certification of their malaria-free status. They must present rigorous evidence -- and demonstrate the capacity to prevent transmission re-emerging.Beijing, which is in the middle of a propaganda push ahead of celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Communist Party this week, hailed the WHO's certification as a "great achievement for China's human rights cause"."The CCP and the Chinese government have always prioritised safeguarding people's health, safety and prosperity," said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a routine briefing in Beijing."Eliminating malaria is a great contribution by China to human health and global human rights progress."China becomes the 40th territory certified malaria-free by the Geneva-based WHO.The last countries to gain the status were El Salvador (2021), Algeria and Argentina (2019), and Paraguay and Uzbekistan (2018).There is a separate list of 61 countries where malaria never existed, or disappeared without specific measures.China is also the first country in the WHO's Western Pacific region to be awarded a malaria-free certification in more than three decades.The WHO's World Malaria Report 2020 warned global progress against the disease was plateauing, particularly in African countries bearing the brunt of cases and deaths.In 2019 the global tally of malaria cases was estimated at 229 million -- a figure that has been at the same level for the past four years.'Outside the box' In the 1950s, Beijing started working out where malaria was spreading and began to combat it with preventative anti-malarial medicines, said the WHO.The country reduced mosquito breeding grounds and stepped up spraying insecticide in homes.While searching for new malaria treatments in the 1970s, China discovered artemisinin -- the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are the most effective antimalarial drugs available.In the 1980s, China was among the first countries to extensively test the use of insecticide-treated nets to prevent malaria. By 1988, more than 2.4 million had been distributed nationwide.By the end of 1990, the number of malaria cases in China had plummeted to 117,000, and deaths had been cut by 95 percent."China's ability to think outside the box served the country well in its own response to malaria, and also had a significant ripple effect globally," said Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO's global malaria programme. Southern border surveillance From 2003, China stepped up efforts across the board that brought annual case numbers down to around 5,000 within 10 years.After four consecutive years of zero indigenous cases, China applied for WHO certification in 2020.Experts travelled to China in May this year to verify its malaria-free status -- and its plans to prevent the disease from coming back.The risk of imported cases remains a concern, not only among people returning from sub-Saharan Africa and other malaria-hit regions, but also in the southern Yunnan province, which borders Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, all struggling with the disease.China has stepped up its malaria surveillance in at-risk zones in a bid to prevent the disease re-emerging, said the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-declares-china-malaria-free-after-nation-reports-zero-cases-for-last-4-years-101625044219458.html

The boy, identified by his family name Huang, was admitted to a hospital on April 21 and had been in a coma for 70 days with severe brain haemorrhages, reported news agency AFP. Huang’s parents decided to withdraw his life support after he developed respiratory problems as well as multiple organ failure.The boy’s coach, identified by his surname Ho, reportedly not only directed other judo students to practise their throws on Huang, but he himself threw the boy a dozen more times, according to the prosecutors. The boy had complained of a bad headache but the coach continued throwing him to the floor until he turned pale and became unresponsive. He was rushed to Feng Yuan Hospital in central Taichung city after the alleged physical assault.According to Taiwan News, doctors said the boy’s injuries resembled those from a car crash. The severe haemorrhages prompted doctors to perform craniotomy and after the operation, declared that Huang was in a “brain dead state.” Citing Huang’s family, local media reported that the boy was thrown about 27 times. Prosecutors said his head repeatedly hit the floor but did not specify how many times."Wish you can rest in peace in another world and the justice system can finally bring comfort to your family," Taichung city mayor Lu Shiow-yen, who visited the boy in hospital, said in a post on her Facebook page.Earlier this month, Ho was charged with physical assault resulting in serious injuries and using children to commit a crime, prosecutors said in a statement. The accused has denied any wrongdoing saying that “it was a normal judo lesson. We did not use inappropriate force and had no idea that he sustained grave injuries,” according to the prosecutors.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-taiwan-boy-thrown-27-times-during-judo-class-dies-101625044414330.html
30-06-2021||World||Explained: What's causing heat wave in Northwestern US, Canada||A sweltering heat wave that has settled over western Canada for several days is believed to be a contributing factor in dozens of sudden death calls received by police in the Vancouver area, authorities said on Tuesday. The temperature has reached a record 49.5 degrees Celsius.At least 134 people have died suddenly since Friday in the Vancouver area, according to figures released by the city police department and the Royal Canadian Mounted police, reports news agency AFP.When does rising temperature is labelled heat wave?According to the National Weather Service (NWS), in most parts of the country, temperatures must be above the historical average in an area for two or more days before the label heat wave is applied to a hot spell, reports AFP.How does a heat wave form?Heat waves begin when high pressure in the atmosphere moves in and pushes warm air towards the ground. That air warms up further as it is compressed and one begins to feel a lot hotter, said the NWS.What's causing the heat wave?The ongoing heat wave affecting the northwestern United States and adjacent Canada is because of a combination of weather effects and climate-driven warming, said the NWS.This heat wave is being driven by an extreme strong heat dome. Heat domes or sprawling ridges of high pressure are a staple of summer. They bring copious sunshine and sinking air that heats up as it is compressed.This particular heat dome is unprecedented for its strength in the Pacific Northwest and it has blown away records based on measurements from three miles high in the sky down to the ground.Places in North America currently experiencing a heat waveOne of the hottest cities on the continent on Monday was Salem, Oregon, about 45 miles southwest of Portland, where the high temperature reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit,, the NWS said.Canada broke a national heat record on Sunday when the temperature in a small town in British Columbia reached almost 116 degrees, breaking an 84-year-old record by nearly 3 degrees.The Northeast, under a separate weather system from the Northwest, is also in the middle of a three-day heat wave that is expected to end on Thursday. Boston reached 97 degrees on Monday, tying its record for that date, the NWS said.When will the heat wave end?Forecasters say that temperatures will remain hot upto next week in the Pacific Northwest. In Portland, temperatures have moderated somewhat but are expected to reach the mid-80s later in the week, said Clinton Rockey, a meteorologist with the NWS in Portland. Temperatures will remain 10 to 20 degrees above average at least until next Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-s-causing-heat-wave-in-northwestern-us-canada-101625036778779.html

"Vancouver has never experienced heat like this, and sadly dozens of people are dying because of it," police sergeant Steve Addison said.Other local municipalities have said they too have responded to many sudden death calls, but have yet to release tolls.The scorching heat stretching from the US state of Oregon to Canada's Arctic territories has been blamed on a high-pressure ridge trapping warm air in the region.Temperatures in the US Pacific Northwest cities of Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington reached levels not seen since record-keeping began in the 1940s-- 115 degrees Fahrenheit in Portland and 108 in Seattle Monday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).The heat wave has forced schools and Covid-19 vaccination centers to close in the Vancouver area, while officials set up temporary water fountains and misting stations on street corners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-130-dead-as-canada-reels-under-record-breaking-temperature-101625035130182.html
30-06-2021||World||A brief history of China's Communist Party as it celebrates 100 years||China's ruling Communist Party will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on July 1. In the build-up to it, President Xi Jinping and the party have exhorted its members and the nation to remember the early days of struggle in the hills of the inland city of Yan'an, where former president of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong established himself as party leader in the 1930s.Origin of Communist PartyThe Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded in 1921, holding its first Congress in Shanghai, with the help of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, during a tough period after the nation had a decade earlier cast off 2,000 years of dynastic rule.Mao's role in the finding of the partyAt the initial Congress, Mao Zedong was the representative for Hunan province. He rose to become the commander of the Red Army in 1935 and became the founding leader of the People's Republic of China in 1949.Members of the partyThe CCP's ranks have risen roughly in line with China's population, totalling 95.2 million members as of this month or 6.7 per cent of the Chinese population.Initially founded as a party for peasants and workers, the CCP has become increasingly diverse. In 1982, it shifted its focus to recruiting university students and in 2002 began to welcome private entrepreneurs. Men dominate the party, with women making up only 28.8 per cent of members. All seven members of top party leadership are men.The members from ethnic minoritiesEthnic minorities make up 7.5 per cent of members, slightly less than their share in China's population. Party members are required to be secular atheists, renouncing religions including Buddhism and Taoism, which have been present in Chinese society for centuries.How does one join the party?Chinese youth and students with good grades and behaviour are chosen by teachers to join the Young Pioneers, who don red neckerchiefs to set themselves apart and are given leadership roles to manage other students. The same process repeats in high school, where good students join the Youth League, the teenage wing of the party.Application to join the party proper is a laborious process that typically begins in university and lasts two to three years. The process has several stages, ending in an oath-swearing in front of the party's hammer-and-sickle flag.Membership cardsMembers must pay dues set at 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent of their income. Under Xi, the party has encouraged party members to wear the party badge to show their affiliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-brief-history-of-china-s-communist-party-as-it-celebrates-100-years-101625029448335.html

We call on all parties to commit to an immediate, indefinite, negotiated ceasefire, so as to end the violence, restore stability to Tigray, and create a context for an inclusive dialogue that preserves the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement on Tuesday.The United States also urges Ethiopian authorities to immediately restore telecommunication services in Tigray and permit unhindered freedom of movement, Price added.Meanwhile, the rebels in the Tigray region gained more territory on Tuesday as part of the nearly eight-month-long conflict that has claimed thousands of lives. The Tigray Defence Forces' (TDF) latest victory came in the town of Shire, in the counter offensive they launched against the government crackdown.Shire was captured just a day after regional capital Mekele was wrested by the TDF on Monday. The victory led to street celebrations in multiple locations.In a statement, Tigray's pre-war government said Mekele is under complete control of TDF. "We reiterate our expressed commitment and pledge that Tigray will indeed be the graveyard of the unjust and unholy coalition of invading forces," the statement further said.Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, sent troops into Tigray last November to oust the northern region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).He said the move came in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps, and promised that victory would be swift.But his military has suffered a dramatic reversal at the hands of TDF.The brutal war in Tigray has been marked by massacres, widespread sexual violence and other abuses. The United Nations has also warned that roughly 350,000 people face starvation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tigray-rebels-gain-more-ground-us-gives-cautious-welcome-to-ethiopia-ceasefire-101625030738727.html
30-06-2021||World||US House passes resolution on Covid-19 help for India||The US House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday calling for urgently facilitating assistance to India to help it fight the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.The resolution, which is non-binding and expresses the sense of the House, was introduced by the Democratic and Republican co-chairs of the House India caucus and also expresses bipartisan solidarity with India.“The resolution stands with the people of India as they collectively work to stem the spread of Covid-19,” said Congressman Brad Sherman, a Democrat. “The US must work with our partners around the world to quell the virus everywhere it persists.”Steve Chabot, the Republican co-chair, said, “India’s Covid-19 second wave has caused immense suffering, both in India and among the Indian-American community many of whose members have family in India. Our close ties to India and India’s support for us early in the pandemic call for our support. As case rates continue to decline, we must help them finish the battle against the second wave and win the war against Covid-19 altogether.”The resolution “recognises the efforts of the administration to deliver urgently needed medical supplies and vaccine raw materials to India; (and) urges the administration to facilitate private, in-kind medical supply donations to India and work to deliver additional, urgently needed medical supplies to India, including oxygen generator plants and a cryogenic oxygen tanker and containers.”The passage of the resolution came just a day after the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced $41 million more in assistance, taking up the total to $200 million, in addition to $500 million of supplies and relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-passes-resolution-on-covid-19-help-for-india-101625030540092.html
30-06-2021||World||Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy booster||A top US infectious diseases institute on Tuesday said it funded research that led to the development of a chemical substance that boosts the efficacy of Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, which, studies have suggested, can effectively neutralise the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2.The adjuvant used in Covaxin - Alhydroxiquim-II - has been developed by ViroVax of Lawrence, Kansas, a company founded and run by Indian-American Sunil David.The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said the project was exclusively supported and funded by its adjuvant development programme. “Ending a global pandemic requires a global response,” said Anthony Fauci, the NIAID director, and added, throwing the institute’s weight behind the vaccine, “I am pleased that a novel vaccine adjuvant developed in the United States with NIAID support is part of an efficacious Covid-19 vaccine available to people in India.”David had been working with the NIAID Adjuvant Program since 2009, since he founded the company after 20 years of research and teaching on the faculty of the University of Kansas and University of Minnesota. He has focused on “searching for novel molecules that activate innate immune receptors and developing them as vaccine adjuvants”.David went to Christian Medical College in Vellore and came to the US after postdoctoral training stints at Borstel, Germany, and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Covaxin is one of the two most popular Covid-19 vaccines in India, alongside AstraZeneca’s Covishield. Though results of Phase 3 clinical trials are awaited, it has been given emergency use authorisation in India.NIAID gave the vaccine its backing - drugs are authorised and regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration - saying, “Unpublished interim results from the Phase 3 trial indicate that the vaccine has 78% efficacy against symptomatic disease, 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19, including hospitalisation, and 70% efficacy against asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.”The institute also cited two studies that Covaxin generates antibodies that “effectively neutralise” both Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2.Here is how this adjuvant works, according to NIAID: “The adjuvant comprises a small molecule attached in a unique way to Alhydrogel, a substance frequently called alum that is the most commonly used adjuvant in vaccines for people. Alhydroxiquim-II travels to lymph nodes, where the small molecule detaches from alum and activates two cellular receptors. These receptors, TLR7 and TLR8, play a vital role in the immune response to viruses.”Bharat Biotech signed a licensing agreement with ViroVax in 2019 for some of its candidate vaccines - also arranged by NIAID under the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program - and expanded the licence to include its use in the Covid-19 vaccine after the breakout of the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faucis-institute-backs-covaxin-funded-its-efficacy-booster-101625029640619.html
30-06-2021||World||North Korea's Kim sacks top officials after Covid-19 'grave incident'||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has replaced several top officials after a "grave incident" in the country's efforts to defend itself against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to news agency AP on Wednesday, which cited reports in state media.Pyongyang closed its borders in January last year to defend itself against the Covid-19 pandemic that first emerged in neighbouring China.North Korea has claimed to have had no cases of coronavirus infections throughout the pandemic, despite testing thousands of people and sharing a border with its ally China, where the first Covid-19 cases were confirmed in late 2019. But officials had "caused a grave incident that poses a huge crisis to the safety of the nation and its people", Kim told a politburo meeting, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The alleged “grave incident” in North Korea's pandemic fight was not specified in the report from the KCNA.Kim added that the "incompetence and irresponsibility of the senior officials are a major factor that hampers the implementation of important tasks", adding that they were "captivated by selfishness and passivity". Earlier, Kim had warned his people to prepare for the "worst-ever situation".New members of the presidium of the politburo -- the highest decision-making body of the ruling Workers' Party -- and the politburo were named at the meeting on Tuesday, KCNA reported, adding that "government officials were transferred and appointed".From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea described its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed cross-border traffic and trade.Earlier this month, Kim during a political conference, called for officials to brace for prolonged Covid-19 restrictions, indicating that the country isn’t ready to open its borders anytime soon despite its economic woes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-sacks-top-officials-after-covid-19-grave-incident-101625015089710.html
30-06-2021||World||Northwest US battles 'unprecedented' heat wave; deaths, power outage reported||As the northwest US battles an "unprecedented" heat wave, officials have said at least more than half a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon might be due to the heat wave that began last week.In Oregon, an immigrant from Guatemala who apparently arrived in the US just a few months ago, and was working at a nursery in St. Paul, might have died due to the heat wave, the state's worker safety agency, known as Oregon Osha, said. Also in Oregon, officials in Bend said deaths of two homeless people may have been weather-related. Meanwhile, deaths of four people in Washington's Bremerton were also ascribed to weather.The National Weather Service said the "dangerous" weather which led to consecutive days of record high temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius) in both Seattle (Washington state) and Portland (Oregon) is now expected to ease though the agency also said the mercury was recorded at 109 Fahrenheit or 42.2 degrees Celsius in Spokane (Washington)-the highest-ever temperature recorded there.According to energy corporation Avista Utilities, about 9,300 of its customers in Spokane lost power on Monday, adding that more "planned" blackouts began on Tuesday afternoon. "We try to limit outages to one hour per customer," said Heather Rosentrater, an Avista Utilities vice president.Explaining why the company had to implement deliberate blackouts, Avista president and chief executive Dennis Vermillion said, "The electric system experienced a new peak demand, and the strain of high temperatures impacted the system in a way that required us to proactively turn off power for customers. This happened faster than anticipated.US president Joe Biden, while delivering a speech in Wisconsin, also took note of the heat wave in the northwest. "“Anybody ever believe you’d turn on the news and see it’s 116 degrees in Portland Oregon? 116 degrees! But don’t worry, there is no global warming because it’s just a figment of our imaginations," Biden said.Meteorologists have said a "dome of high pressure" over the northwest has led to the intense heat wave in the region. "Human-caused climate change," experts say, has led to the worsening of the heat wave.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northwest-us-battles-unprecedented-heat-wave-deaths-power-outage-reported-101625010370020.html

The alert, also tweeted by the Indian embassy’s handle, said terror groups operating in Afghanistan had “escalated violent activities and carried out a series of complex attacks in various parts of Afghanistan...”Meanwhile, the Afghan Taliban, in a statement, said “all civilian and non-military foreign nationals, diplomats, embassies, consulates and workers of humanitarian organisations” would not “face any problems or security risks” from the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-nationals-in-afghanistan-warned-against-rising-violence-101625012103000.html
30-06-2021||World||Death toll in Florida condo building collapse rises to 12||Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava says another victim has been found in the rubble of a collapsed Florida condo building.The new discovery brings the death toll to 12, with 149 people still unaccounted for.Elected officials pledged Tuesday to conduct multiple investigations into the collapse of an oceanfront Florida condo tower, vowing to convene a grand jury and to look closely “at every possible angle” to prevent any other building from experiencing such a catastrophic failure.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said she and her staff will meet with engineering, construction and geology experts, among others, to review building safety issues and develop recommendations "to ensure a tragedy like this will never, ever happen again."State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said she will pursue a grand jury investigation to examine factors and decisions that led to Thursday's collapse of the 12-story Champlain Towers South in Surfside. The disaster killed at least 11 people and left 150 unaccounted for.Even as officials looked to the future to determine the cause of the collapse, they were resolute in vowing to continue the effort to find survivors.On the sixth day of a painstaking search, Governor Ron DeSantis evoked a well-known military commitment to leave no one behind on the battlefield and pledged to do the same for the people still missing in the rubble.“The way I look at it, as an old Navy guy, is when somebody is missing in action, in the military, you're missing until you're found. We don't stop the search," DeSantis said at a news conference."I think that's what is happening. Those first responders are breaking their backs trying to find anybody they can. I think they are going to continue to do that. They've been very selfless. They've put themselves at risk to do it.”Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett cited the case of a woman who was found alive 17 days after a garment factory collapsed in 2013, killing more than 1,000 people in Dhaka, Bangladesh.“No one is giving up hope here. ... We are dedicated to getting everyone out of that pile of rubble," Burkett said.Also on Tuesday, the White House announced that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden would travel to Surfside on Thursday.Martin Langesfeld, whose sister, 26-year-old Nicole Langesfeld, is missing in the collapse, also expressed hope that there are still survivors.“We're not alone in this. There's hope. I really believe miracles do happen. Things like this have happened around the world," he said during a vigil Monday night on the beach near the collapsed building.The collapse has drawn scrutiny of the safety of older high-rise buildings throughout South Florida. Cava ordered a 30-day audit on whether buildings 40 years old or older are complying with a required recertification of their structural integrity, and that any issues raised by inspections are being addressed.On Tuesday, the mayor said building inspections have found four balconies in one building in Miami-Dade County that “must be immediately closed due to safety concerns".Previous grand juries in South Florida have examined other large-scale disasters, such as the 2018 collapse of a pedestrian bridge at Florida International University, which killed six people. That investigation is ongoing.Criminal charges in such matters are possible, such as the third-degree felony murder and manslaughter charges brought in the 1996 crash of ValuJet Flight 592, which killed 110 people in the Everglades.Work at the site has been deliberate and treacherous. Debris fell onto the search area overnight from the shattered edge of the part of the building that still stands. That forced rescuers to mark a “don't go beyond here” line and focus their efforts on parts of the debris pile that are farther from the structure, Burkett told Miami television station WSVN.Several members of an Israeli rescue team worked partly on hands and knees Tuesday over a small section of the rubble, digging with shovels, pickaxes and saws. They removed debris into buckets that were dumped into a metal construction bin, which was periodically lifted away by a crane. The crane then delivered an empty bin.Late in the afternoon, rescue officials sounded a horn for a second time during the day's work, signaling an approaching storm with lightning. Workers temporarily evacuated.Authorities said it's still a search-and-rescue operation, but no one has been found alive since hours after the collapse on Thursday.The pancake collapse of the building left layer upon layer of intertwined debris, frustrating efforts to reach anyone who may have survived in a pocket of space.The authorities meet frequently with families to explain what they're doing and to answer questions. They have discussed how DNA matches are made to help identify the dead, how next-of-kin will be contacted and explained in “extreme detail” how they are searching the mound, the mayor said.With that knowledge, Cava said, families are coming to their own conclusions.“Some are feeling more hopeful, some less hopeful, because we do not have definitive answers. We give them the facts. We take them to the site," she said."They have seen the operation. They understand now how it works, and they are preparing themselves for news, one way or the other.”Rachel Spiegel, whose 66-year-old mother, Judy Spiegel, is missing, said Tuesday that she was hoping for a miracle, but she also wrote about looking beyond the tragedy.“Our mom Judy was the glue that kept our family together. All of the family mementos, photos, clothing and heirlooms our father and mother have collected over the past 65 years were lost in a matter of seconds,” Spiegel wrote in a message about setting up a fund for charities on behalf of her mother.“As we continue to search for meaning in this catastrophe, we must also look to the future and rebuild.”In a text message exchange with The Associated Press, she added, “Please keep praying for a miracle".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-florida-condo-building-collapse-rises-to-12-101625008569442.html
30-06-2021||World||US to close 4 emergency shelters for migrant children||US officials will close four emergency facilities set up to house record numbers of migrant children crossing the Mexican border alone but cautioned Tuesday that minors were still arriving.The Department of Health and Human Services will shut two facilities in Texas and two at convention centers in California by early August, Aurora Miranda-Maese, juvenile coordinator for the agency's office of refugee resettlement, said during a court hearing about custody conditions for migrant children.Four of the large-scale shelters will remain open, including one that has faced criticism from immigrant advocates at Fort Bliss Army Base in El Paso, Texas, she said. Others are in Albion, Michigan; Pecos, Texas; and Pomona, California, she said.US officials have reported a recent drop in the number of children held in emergency facilities, including a more than 40% decline at Fort Bliss since mid-June. Miranda-Maese said more children are being released to relatives in the US or being sent to state-licensed shelters, which have a higher standard of care.The emergency sites were set up by the Biden administration this spring to handle a rise in the number of children arriving on the southern border alone, many fleeing violence in Central America and seeking to reunite with relatives in the United States.Henry A. Moak Jr., juvenile coordinator for US Customs and Border Protection, said it isn't clear whether that's about to change despite the summer heat.“It appears the numbers are still going up,” he told the court. “I don’t know if the hot weather is going to deter that at all.”Health and Human Services cares for the children until they can be sent to live with relatives in the United States. The agency has about 15,000 children in its care, and fewer than 3,000 in emergency facilities, Miranda-Maese said. But she noted that the number of children received from border authorities has increased in the past week.“That's concerning because this is definitely a very difficult and challenging time to be crossing the border,” she said.Miranda-Maese recognized the challenges at Fort Bliss and said the facility was being reconfigured to a more child-friendly pod system with single cots instead of doubles. She said officials also are working to improve the system to screen relatives more quickly so children can go live with them.Her comments came during a hearing in a federal court in Los Angeles that oversees a longstanding settlement governing custody conditions for immigrant children.In recent filings to the court, more than a dozen children described their desperation to get out of the emergency facilities. In one account, a teenage girl said she had been at Fort Bliss for nearly 60 days and could hardly sleep at night because the lights were always on and she resorted to eating only popsicles and juice because the food was foul.Carlos Holguin, an attorney for the children, said advocates were concerned that well-run facilities like one at the Long Beach Convention Center were being shut down while Fort Bliss will remain open. He also said it wasn't clear which children were sent to state-licensed shelters, which are governed by different standards, and which are sent to the emergency sites.Officials are expected to file updates to the court in July. Another hearing is scheduled for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-close-4-emergency-shelters-for-migrant-children-101625005499528.html
30-06-2021||World||New Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid in the UAE on first state visit||Israel’s foreign minister kicked off the highest-level visit by an Israeli official to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, nine months after the two countries established relations in a deal brokered by the United States.Foreign Minister Yair Lapid met the UAE's foreign minister in Abu Dhabi and inaugurated Israel's first embassy in the Gulf.Although the visit is historic, it received little fanfare across local media. Lapid was not greeted on the airport tarmac by Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, but by a lower-ranking minister of state. Even press access for Lapid’s various appearances in Abu Dhabi was strictly limited to Emirati media and select Israeli outlets traveling with him.The toned-down atmosphere surrounding his visit belies the UAE's open-arm embrace of its newfound ties with Israel. In recent months, the two countries have rapidly expanded bilateral trade and signed investment deals, including in gas, technology and other sectors. More than 200,000 Israeli tourists have traveled to the UAE, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has said. Many of those visits have been to Dubai, which is open to tourists.Lapid's visit, however, comes just weeks after a new government in Israel was formed in a power-sharing deal that named the ideologically hawkish, right-wing Naftali Bennett as Israel’s prime minister.His visit also comes less than six week after emotions ran high across the Middle East amid Israel's 11-day war in the Gaza Strip that killed 254 Palestinians, including dozens of children. In Israel, 13 people died as a result of the conflict.Lapid told diplomats gathered at the official opening of the Israeli Embassy in Abu Dhabi that the moment represented “the right to determine our fate by ourselves.” Israel, he said, isn’t going anywhere.“The Middle East is our home. We’re here to stay. We call on all the countries of the region to recognize that. And to come talk to us,” he said, according to the speech released by Israel’s Foreign Ministry.The Gaza war and tensions in Jerusalem, however, have interrupted US-backed diplomatic efforts to encourage more Arab states to sign normalization deals with Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Lapid’s visit as “significant for Israel, the UAE, and the broader region.” In a statement, he said the US will work with Israel and the UAE to strengthen the partnership.The Trump administration brokered the so-called "Abraham Accords" agreement that established ties between the UAE and Israel. It was hailed at the time by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump as among their greatest achievements.Lapid’s visit to the UAE was one that Netanyahu had hoped to make himself before his 12-year-run at the helm ended earlier this month. He had repeatedly tried to score a lightning trip to Abu Dhabi to boost his re-election campaign.In acknowledgement of Netanyahu, Lapid told diplomats gathered at the Israeli Embassy that the former prime minister is “the architect of the Abraham Accords” and that “this moment is his, no less than it is ours.”Underpinning UAE-Israel ties is a shared concern that Iran's nuclear deal with world powers did not go far enough to curb Tehran's reach in the region. Their reservations about the deal helped propel quiet ties, long before they formally announced full diplomatic relations last year.President Joe Biden is pushing to revive and expand the nuclear accord, which Trump pulled the US out of in 2018. Earlier this week, Lapid was quoted as saying that Israel has serious reservations about the nuclear deal being discussed in Vienna, but pledged Israel would make its objections privately. It’s expected that Lapid’s conversation with his Emirati counterpart included talk of Iran.“There’s been years of under-the-radar relations between Israel and the UAE, and we are now enjoying the fruits of the infrastructure of peace that we’ve built in the last decades,” said Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat.On Wednesday, Lapid will inaugurate Israel’s consulate in Dubai and visit the site of the World Fair's Expo in Dubai, which will open in October. Lapid is also due to meet with members of the expatriate Jewish community residing in Dubai.The UAE’s move to formalize ties with Israel marked the first time in over two decades that an Arab state had normalized relations with Israel. It paved the path for a similar announcement by Bahrain, and later by Sudan and Morocco in rapid succession.Soon after its pact with Israel, the UAE scored US authorization for the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets, which would make it only the second country in the Middle East, after Israel, to acquire them.Meanwhile, Palestinians across the political spectrum have slammed the UAE’s ties with Israel in the absence of peace talks or concessions toward a two-state solution.In May, tensions flared in east Jerusalem when Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian protesters and worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the final days of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. The site in east Jerusalem is holy to both Jews and Muslims.The tensions in Jerusalem drew rare public rebuke from the Emirati government. The UAE's public statements, however, changed in tone after Hamas militants in Gaza began firing rockets at Israel. The UAE considers Hamas as an Iran-backed militant group and an offshoot of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-israeli-foreign-minister-yair-lapid-in-the-uae-on-first-state-visit-101624998714004.html

By 2035, all new cars and light duty trucks sold in Canada will be zero emission vehicles -- 100 percent of them," Alghabra told a news conference."This is five years sooner than our previous goal," he said.The regulatory move, he said, will help Canada to meet its overall net-zero carbon emissions target for the economy by mid-century.Alghabra noted that his country is one of the few in the world with domestic access to all of the key resources for producing electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and praised General Motors, Ford and other automakers for opening EV assembly plants in Canada.But despite government incentives to defray the relatively higher prices of EVs, purchases have been slow to take off.According to government data, battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for less than four percent of the 25 million passenger cars and trucks registered in Canada last year -- up from about two percent in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cars-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035-in-canada-says-transport-minister-101624998076169.html
30-06-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan says country under under 'pressure' from US, western powers over close ties with China||Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that Pakistan was under "pressure" from the US and other Western powers over his country's all-weather ties with China and vowed to never buckle under pressure.Pakistan and China enjoy a "very special relationship" spanning over 70 years and nothing could change these time-tested ties, Khan said in an interview with China's English-language state-broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN), an excerpt of which was shared on his Instagram account.Talking about the evolving regional rivalry between the US and China, Khan said that "Pakistan thinks it is very unfair for the US or other powers – western power" to pressurise "countries like us to take sides" in a conflict with China."Why should we take sides? We should have good relations with everyone. It is not going to happen if pressure is put on Pakistan to change its relationship or downgrade its relationship with China, it wouldn’t happen," Khan said.Emphasising the deep relationship with China, Khan said that Pakistan would never bend under any kind of pressure. "Whatever will happen, our relationship between the two countries - no matter what pressure is put on us - is not going to change," he said.He said that there was a "strange, great rivalry" taking place in the region which was public knowledge."You see the United States being wary of China. The way United States and China are looking at each other creates problems because what the United States is doing is it's formed this regional alliance called the Quad, which is US, India and a couple of other countries," Khan said.The Quad or Quadrilateral alliance consisting of the US, India, Japan and Australia has been resolving to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.Responding to a question about how to further deepen Sino-Pakistan ties, Khan said that the two sides enjoyed strong political ties but the relationship was not only limited to official relations but it was also "people to people relationship".He said trade was important to increase ties in future and termed the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as the "biggest thing happening in Pakistan".The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Highlighting the 70 years of diplomatic ties, Khan said China always stood with Pakistan, which "always had a very special relationship with China".He said that China "always stood with us" whenever Pakistan was in trouble politically or internationally or in a conflict with its neighbour, in an apparent reference to India."In good times, everyone stands with you but in your difficult, tough times, bad times, you remember those people who stood by you. That's why you will find that in Pakistan, people always have a special fondness for people in China," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-says-country-under-under-pressure-from-us-western-powers-over-close-ties-with-china-101624997567137.html
30-06-2021||World||Top US general says security in Afghanistan deteriorating||The US's top general in Afghanistan on Tuesday gave a sobering assessment of the country's deteriorating security situation as America winds down its so-called “forever war.”Gen. Austin S. Miller said the rapid loss of districts around the country to the Taliban — several with significant strategic value — is worrisome. He also cautioned that the militias deployed to help the beleaguered national security forces could lead the country into civil war.Miller told a small group of reporters in the Afghan capital that for now he has the weapons and the capability to aid Afghanistan’s National Defense and Security Forces.“What I don’t want to do is speculate what that (support) looks like in the future,” he said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in meetings at the White House last week with President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah — the Afghan official tasked with making peace with the Taliban — President Joe Biden said the US was committed to humanitarian and security assistance to Afghanistan.But the president also said that keeping US soldiers in Afghanistan defied a peace deal the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban and that wasn't a risk he was prepared to take.“Given the timeline set by the prior administration, that if we did not withdraw our troops, US men and women would be facing fire from on the ground and that was not something as the commander in chief, that he felt was acceptable,” Psaki said.Washington signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020. It laid out the promise of a US withdrawal and commitments by the Taliban to ensure Afghanistan does not harbor militants that can attack the United States. The details of those commitments have never been made public.The Taliban have accused Washington of breaking the agreement, which called for all troops to be out by May 1, the date the final withdrawal began. US officials have said the Taliban have made some progress, but it's not clear whether the insurgent group has kept its end of the deal.The insurgent group issued orders to commanders against allowing foreign fighters among their ranks, but evidence continues to surface that non-Afghans are on the battlefield.Still, Miller was insistent that only a political solution will bring peace to the war-tortured nation.“It is a political settlement that brings peace to Afghanistan. And it’s not just the last 20 years. It’s really the last 42 years,” he said.Miller was referring to not only the US war but that of Russia's 10-year occupation that ended in 1989. That conflict was followed by a brutal civil war fought by some of the same Afghan leaders deploying militias against the Taliban. The civil war gave rise to the Taliban, who took power in 1996.American officials have said the entire pullout of US troops will most likely be completed by July 4. But Miller refused to give any date or time frame, referring only to the Sept. 11 timeline given by Biden in April when he announced the withdrawal of the remaining 2,500-3,500 American troops.Meanwhile, Taliban fighters have been over-running districts in rapid succession, many of them in the north of the country, which is dominated by Afghanistan's minorities. The north is also the traditional stronghold of many former mujahedeen leaders who have been a dominant force in Afghanistan since driving the Taliban from power in 2001 together with the US-led coalition.Several of the districts are on key roads and one is on the border with northern Tajikistan. The Taliban have issued statements saying hundreds of Afghan security forces have surrendered, most of them going to their homes after being recorded on video receiving transportation money from the Taliban.Miller said there are multiple reasons for the collapse of these districts, including troop fatigue and surrender, psychological defeat and military defeat. But he said the escalating violence puts the country at risk of falling into a deadly civil war.Going forward, the Afghan defense forces must focus on consolidating their strengths and establishing strategic areas and protecting them, Miller said. Losing districts to the Taliban that allows them to sever transportation and communication links threatens provincial capitals.“As we start talking about how does this all end, the way it must end for the Afghan people is something that revolves around a political solution,” he said. “I’ve also said that if you don’t reduce the violence, that political solution becomes more and more difficult.”Miller refused to say where the US and its NATO allies were in the withdrawal process.He said his time as the head of the US's military mission in Afghanistan was coming to an end, without giving a date, though the press briefing had the feeling of a farewell.Miller wouldn't speculate on the legacy of America's longest war, saying it will be for history to decide.“The future will tell the rest of the story," he said. "What we will have to do is make an honest assessment of what went well and what didn’t go so well over the years as we work forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-general-says-security-in-afghanistan-deteriorating-101624996614285.html
30-06-2021||World||Randy Moore becomes first African American to lead US Forest Service||Veteran forester Randy Moore has been named chief of the US Forest Service, the first African American to lead the agency in its 116-year history.Moore, 66, replaces Vicki Christiansen, who has led the agency since 2018. The Forest Service, a division of the Agriculture Department, oversees 193 million acres of public lands in 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands.Moore has served as regional forester in the California-based Pacific Southwest Region since 2007, where he has responsibility for 18 national forests in California and Hawaii.He will take over from Christiansen as head of the 30,000-employee agency upon her retirement July 26. Christiansen and Moore will collaborate on what is already shaping up as a severe wildfire season in the West, where an epic drought, complicated by climate change, has made putting out fires more challenging and strained firefighting resources throughout the region.In the Pacific Northwest, where an extended heat wave has triggered record-breaking temperatures in Oregon and Washington state, fire crews have been positioned in high-risk areas, and cities and counties have imposed burn bans.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who appointed Moore, called him “a catalyst for change and creativity” in carrying out the Forest Service’s mission to sustain the nation’s forests.As a regional forester, Moore has been on the forefront of climate change, most notably leading the region’s response to the dramatic increase in catastrophic wildfires in California over the last decade, Vilsack said. “His proven track record of supporting and developing employees and putting communities at the center of the Forest Service’s work positions him well to lead the agency into the future at this critical time in our country,'' Vilsack said in a statement.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised Moore's selection as Forest Service chief.“California understands all too well the challenges facing our forests and I’m glad a Californian will head efforts to tackle them,” she said.Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Moore “a seasoned professional,'' adding: “I sincerely hope we can work together on mitigating catastrophic wildfires, opening up our national forests to sustainable lumber harvesting, making forests more resilient against insects and diseases and much more.''Before heading the Pacific Southwest region, Moore was regional forester in the Wisconsin-based Eastern Region, where he oversaw forests in 20 states.Moore started his federal career in 1978 at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Dakota. He has worked at national forests in Colorado, North Carolina and Missouri, a national grassland in Kansas and as an administrator in Washington.Moore's appointment comes as Congress and the Biden administration push to increase firefighter pay and convert at least 1,000 seasonal wildland firefighters to year-round workers as fires have grown more severe. President Joe Biden last week called for an increase in pay for federal firefighters, who start as low as $13 an hour.“That’s a ridiculously low salary to pay federal firefighters,” Biden said. "That’s going to end in my administration.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/randy-moore-becomes-first-african-american-to-lead-us-forest-service-101624995250129.html
