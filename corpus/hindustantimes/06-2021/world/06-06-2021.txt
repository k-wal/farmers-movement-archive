The rising threat of cyberattacks has pushed the Biden administration into a more aggressive stance against Russia, which is thought to be harboring some of the perpetrators."We're not taking anything off the table as we think about possible repercussions, consequences or retaliation," Raimondo said.Last weekend, the world's largest meatpacker was targeted by cybercriminals and in May, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States was attacked, stoking fears over supply disruptions of food and fuel.U.S. adversaries have the ability to shut down the country's entire power grid, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said separately in an interview with CNN, noting "thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector".The recent high-profile attacks have prompted Biden to put the issue of Russia harboring hackers on the agenda for his meeting with Putin.The White House plans to use the June 16 summit to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials say. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say.U.S. officials are asking private companies to be more vigilant and transparent about attacks. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday said the May attack on Colonial Pipeline, which created temporary gasoline shortages, showed the national implications of a hack on a private company."Part of our vulnerability on cybersecurity is you're only as strong as your weakest link," he said in an interview with CBS.Companies need to alert the federal government when they are targeted, Granholm said, and stop paying attackers. "You shouldn't be paying ransomware attacks, because it only encourages the bad guys," she said.While she opposes ransomware payments, she said she is uncertain whether Biden or Congress is prepared to outlaw them.Companies should be required to report ransomware attacks, Democratic Senator Mark Warner from Virginia said on Sunday, though he stopped short of saying he supported making such payments illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-also-considering-military-response-to-counter-cyberattack-us-officials-101622998292130.html
06-06-2021||World||Trump rallies Republicans for 2022 midterm polls||Former US president Donald Trump returned on Saturday to public limelight with a speech in North Carolina in which he exhorted Republicans to gear up for the 2022 midterm elections, repeated lies about his election loss, attacked Dr Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist, and called for China to pay $10 trillion in “reparations” for the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump spoke at a convention of North Carolina Republicans in Greenville, which his advisers have said will be the first of more. And, it came amid possibility of an indictment from the Manhattan district attorney, and growing fissures in the Republican Party over his continued role and influence.“The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump said in a characteristically rambling speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes.KEEPS SUPPORTERS GUESSING ON 2024 PREZ RUNRepublicans are hoping to win the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, closing and overtaking their eight-seat deficit in the 435-member chamber (they trail 211 to 219 Democrats, with five vacancies), and the 100-member Senate, which they split evenly with Democrats. Midterms have tended to favour the party not holding the White House.Trump has managed to keep a tight grip on the Republican Party despite the initial outrage felt among many over his incitement of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. “We are going to have a tremendous 2022 like we did frankly in 2020, more votes than any sitting president in the history of the US. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election,” Trump said repeating claims of election fraud that were dismissed by more than 60 times by courts and the legislatures of Republican-ruled states that he lost.Trump has since leaving office kept a relatively lower profile. Deprived of social media accounts - Twitter has banned him permanently and Facebook and Instagram have suspended him until January 2023 - communicating largely through short statements, some interviews and advisers.He has teased a run for the White House in 2024 but has not committed himself to it yet. “We’re gonna take back the Senate, take back the House, we’re gonna take back the White House and sooner than you think,” he said in a short fund-raising video released ahead of the North Carolina speech.TARGETS BIDEN ADMINISTRATIONThe former president went on to rip apart the Biden administration in his speech. “As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding, police departments are being ripped apart and defunded,” he said. He called the surge of immigrants at the border the start of the “Biden disasters”, criticised the president for rejoining the Paris Accord and his proposal to raise corporate tax.“Drugs are pouring in, gas prices are soaring, our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyberattacks,” he went on to say. “That’s a lack of respect for our country and our leaders.” Trump was referring to recent cyber-hacking of US companies. But the most sweeping and egregious of them - the SolarWinds attack - took place on his watch.FAUCI AND CHINA IN THE LINE OF ATTACKThe former president also attacked Dr Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying he is “not a great doctor, but a hell of a promoter”. Trump had clashed with Dr Fauci even while in office, which had turned the epidemiologist into a target for then president’s supporters. “Fauci said at the beginning, ‘no masks’. Remember that? Then, he became a radical masker. Get three, four. Get a pair of goggles, ideally. Wear them for another five or six years,” Trump said to laughter.The former president, who had deflected his own shoddy handling of the pandemic by blaming China, doubled down on it. “The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay - they must pay,” he said, going on to suggest it be around $10 trillion.LEGAL TROUBLESTurning to his own legal troubles, he dismissed them as an extension of the “five-year witch-hunt” he said he had faced from the time he announced his candidature for the White House. He called the Manhattan district attorney’s case “the ultimate fishing expedition”. “It’s been a five-year witch hunt, hoax after hoax,” he added. “They’ll never stop until November of 2024.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rallies-republicans-for-2022-midterm-polls-101622999490738.html

06-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bid||US vice-president Kamala Harris has been assigned a high-risk task by his boss, President Joe Biden, to lead the administration’s effort to protect voting rights. She has also been tasked with addressing the main cause behind immigration from Central America as the United States is witnessing a surge in refugees looking for asylum in the country. While both tasks are fraught with the high risk of failure, success could be highly rewarding for Harris, who is being dubbed as presidential-nominee-in-waiting.After Biden asked Harris to lead the administration’s effort to protect the voting rights for all Americans, the vice-president said in a statement that she will work with voting rights organisations, community organisations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts. Harris further stated that she will also work with members of Congress to help advance the bills. "Every American has a right to have their voice heard at the ballot box, and no American should be kept from voting early, voting by mail, or voting at all," she said.Although the Democrats control the Senate with 50 seats and a tie-breaker vote of Harris, most legislation requires 60 votes to end the debate and go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote. In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators have to be on board with the plan.Also Read | Kamala Harris calls PM Modi; US to share Covid vaccines with India by JuneBiden had called for the Senate to pass For the People Act but the legislation is facing opposition from moderate Democrats. Senator Joe Manchin on Sunday said that he will neither vote for the legislation, nor he will support ending the filibuster rule. In an op-ed for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the Democrat wrote, “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For the People Act.”“Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster,” he added.Without Manchin’s support, the voting rights legislation will most likely fail in the evenly-divided Senate. Harris’s new portfolio has now put her squarely in the middle of a partisan battle. Taking a jibe at the challenging assignment, Alyssa Farah, former spokesperson for Mike Pence, said that Biden was carrying on the “long-standing American tradition of passing off the terrible/impossible tasks to your VP.” However, Farah didn’t elaborate on the “impossible” task assigned to Pence under the Trump administration.Harris is set to depart Washington later on Sunday on her first foreign trip as vice-president. She will visit Guatemala and Mexico to deepen diplomatic ties and lead the administration’s efforts to stem the spike in migration at the US border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-two-assignments-that-could-make-or-break-her-presidential-bid-101622994464110.html
06-06-2021||World||Trump's groundless election grievances cloud Republican agenda heading into 2022||Republicans are fighting to seize control of Congress. Just don't ask what they'd do if they win.Look no further for evidence of the GOP's muddled governing agenda than battleground North Carolina, where party leaders packed into a convention hall Saturday night to cheer former President Donald Trump. Even with a high-stakes U.S. Senate election looming, the Republicans there were united not by any consistent set of conservative policies or principles, but by Trump's groundless grievances about the 2020 election and his attacks against critics in both parties.The lack of a forward-looking agenda stands in stark contrast to successful midterm elections of past years, particularly 1994 and 2010, when Republicans swept into power after staking clear positions on health care, federal spending and crime, among other issues. Without such a strategy heading into 2022, Republicans on the ballot risk allowing themselves to be wholly defined by Trump, who lost his last election by 7 million votes nationally and has seen his popularity slide further, even among some Republicans, since leaving office in January.“I’m unaware of a GOP agenda. I would love to see one,” said Texas-based conservative activist and former tea party leader Mark Meckler.“Nobody knows what they’re about,” he said of today's Republicans. “They do this at their own peril.”The GOP’s embrace of Trump’s self-serving priorities has almost completely consumed the party’s long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline, free markets and even the rule of law. That leaves Republican candidates from North Carolina to North Dakota unwilling or unable to tell voters how they would address the nation’s biggest challenges if given the chance.Party leaders acknowledge it could be another year or more before Republicans develop a clear governing agenda. In the meantime, Trump, who is focused on the past far more than the future, plans to become a regular campaign fixture again. Building on Saturday's North Carolina appearance, his advisers are eying potential rallies in states with top Senate races in 2020, including Ohio, Florida, Alabama and Georgia.In an interview, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the Senate Republican political arm, offered a lukewarm response when asked about Trump's role in the upcoming campaign.“We both want to take back the majority in 2022. I tell him what I’m doing, and I’d love to get his support,” Scott said of Trump.He balked when asked whether Trump should serve as the face of the Republican Party for the midterms, when control of the House, Senate and dozens of governorships are at stake.“The face of the party is each individual race,” Scott said, noting that there will be hundreds of Republican candidates on midterm ballots. “The party is those people, it’s not one person, it’s not one person’s agenda."For now, when Republicans are not aligning themselves with Trump, they're focusing much of their energy on culture wars and railing against President Joe Biden's agenda. Biden, backed by narrow Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, has already adopted a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package that was widely popular among voters. Now, he's pushing a massive infrastructure package that polls suggest could be equally popular.Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., worries that Republicans could squander built-in advantages in their quest to win back control of Congress and expand their advantage with governorships. In recent history, the party out of the White House has almost always made significant gains in the first midterm election of a new presidency.Democrats will lose control of Congress if Republicans flip just five seats in the House and only one in the Senate.“The only way we can screw it up is with Donald Trump,” Hogan told The Associated Press, lamenting that Republicans in Washington are consumed by infighting and “swearing fealty to one individual.”The two-term governor and frequent Trump critic continued: “I’m really kind of frustrated with the fact that the Republican Party doesn’t seem to be focused on an agenda. It doesn't seem to be focused on putting up coherent arguments for what people care about."Some Republican leaders close to Trump are encouraging him to look to the future.The former president is set to meet this week with the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, to begin discussing the party's policy prescriptions should the GOP retake the House majority next year.Trump has met privately with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in recent weeks to discuss the creation of policy document in line with Gingrich's famous “Contract With America,” which outlined a clear and concise Republican agenda before the GOP's 1994 midterm success.Trump adviser Jason Miller said it's “a bit of an overreach” to suggest Trump is actively working with Gingrich to create the document.In the meantime, Republican candidates in key Senate contests, North Carolina among them, are struggling to offer voters a clear vision for what they would do if elected as they fight for Trump's endorsement.At least three Republicans are competing to succeed retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, who was censured by state party leaders for supporting Trump's impeachment in February. The Republican nomination fight features former Gov. Pat McCrory, current Rep. Ted Budd and former Rep. Mark Walker.After Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump bowed out of the race over the weekend, Trump formally endorsed Budd, the only candidate in the Republican primary who voted against certifying Trump's 2020 election loss.Walker had called himself the most “pro-Trump congressman from North Carolina" but that apparently was not enough to win Trump's backing.Beyond courting Trump, Budd has also played up the GOP’s culture wars. In his kickoff video, the gun store owner addressed growing immigration at the border with Mexico and the decision by Dr. Seuss' publisher to stop printing some of the popular children's book author's books because of racist imagery. Budd said he read the books to his children “and they turned out just fine.”Trump slapped at McCrory in Saturday's address by reminding voters, without using his name, that the former Republican governor had previously lost two elections.McCrory, who hails from the GOP's business wing, has embraced elements of Trump’s agenda, but has been critical of Trump's false claims about election fraud.“I’m not going to be diverted by talking about the past because I care about the future,” he told the AP in April.With 17 months before the 2022 general election and few voters paying close attention to the midterm jockeying, Republicans have time to develop an agenda that moves beyond Trump's grievances and conservative culture wars.But it's unclear whether there is sufficient political will.Scott, the Florida senator, said his party must ultimately communicate what it’s for — instead of simply what it’s against. But he noted that the "Contract With America” was released only two months before the 1994 election.“I don’t know if there will be a real contract for America, or everybody will just be more consistent with what they’re talking about,” Scott said of the Republican agenda in months ahead.On Trump, Scott added, “I think he's going to be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-groundless-election-grievances-cloud-republican-agenda-heading-into-2022-101622987930083.html
06-06-2021||World||‘Expect us’: Hacktivist group Anonymous threatens Elon Musk for 'playing games' with Bitcoin||A decentralised international hacktivist group, Anonymous, has threatened Tesla CEO Elon Musk to “expect” them, saying the games played by the entrepreneur with crypto markets seemed to have destroyed lives. In a video posted on the Facebook page of Anonymous, the hackers said that the “carefully curated” image of Elon Musk is getting exposed, and people are “beginning to see [him] as nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.”WATCH | Elon Musk threatened on video by 'Anonymous' over Tesla, Bitcoin, Mars plan“There are plenty of other companies working on space exploration and electric vehicles, you are just the only CEO who has gained a cult following through sh*tposting and trolling the world on social media,” the hacktivist group said.According to a Forbes report, much of Tesla’s seven-quarter profit streak came from the billions of dollars it hauled in from selling carbon tax credits to makers of gasoline-powered autos that need them to meet pollution rules of the US and the European Union. The report further suggested that the electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California, reported cumulative credit sales worth $4.4 billion, with $2.69 billion of that coming just since 2019.Also Read | Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses $15.2 billion in a day after issuing warning regarding Bitcoin surgeAnonymous said that people have started learning that the vast majority of Tesla’s income doesn't actually come from selling cars but from government subsidies and selling carbon tax credits for the innovation with clean energy. “This, technically, isn't your innovation though, because you aren't actually the founder of Tesla. You simply purchased the company from two people much more intelligent than you are, Mark Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning,” they added.The group claimed that Tesla has made more money by holding Bitcoin for a few months than they have by selling cars for years. They also suggested that it is more than likely the Bitcoins were purchased with money from government subsidies. “It is now widely believed that you have been forced to denounce your company's involvement with Bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla's coffers,” Anonymous said.Last month, Elon Musk, citing climate change concerns, said in a tweet that Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. The announcement was followed by a meltdown in the crypto market, wiping out more than billions of dollars in value from the coin’s peak market value. Anonymous said that the use of energy argument about Bitcoin mining “is a very nuanced conversation that requires a fairly complex understanding of how power grids work, and how excess energy is wasted by power companies and sought out by crypto miners.”“This is a conversation that you have been having for over a year and were intimately aware of, but as soon as your main source of income was threatened you pretended to be clueless in an attempt to play both sides of the fence,” the hacktivist group alleged.Also Read | Bitcoin slips after Musk tweets a broken heart emoji with Linkin Park songAnonymous said that Elon Musk’s move to create a Bitcoin miner council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralise the industry and take it under Tesla CEO’s control. They noted that millions of retail investors were counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives, and even though they took the risk upon themselves when they invested, Musk’s tweets showed a clear disregard for the average working person.“You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match. We are Anonymous! We are Legion! Expect us,” the group warned.Anonymous also lambasted Elon Musk for “prematurely” calling himself 'Emperor of Mars', saying the Red Planet is a place where the SpaceX founder will be sending people to die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anonymous-threatens-narcissistic-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-for-playing-games-with-bitcoin-101622984465178.html
06-06-2021||World||UK PM to set end-2022 target to vaccinate world against Covid-19 at G7 summit||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will call on fellow G7 leaders to make concrete commitments to vaccinate the entire world against coronavirus by the end of 2022 at the Leaders’ Summit in Cornwall, Downing Street has said.The meeting, starting on Friday, is the first between G7 leaders since the coronavirus pandemic and the UK as president of the summit has made vaccine supply and support for equitable access, tackling climate change and getting more children into school as central themes of the meeting of the world’s leading economies.India has been invited as a guest country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to participate virtually.“Next week the leaders of the world’s greatest democracies will gather at an historic moment for our countries and for the planet. The world is looking to us to rise to the greatest challenge of the post-war era: defeating Covid and leading a global recovery driven by our shared values,” Johnson said in a statement on Saturday.“Vaccinating the world by the end of next year would be the single greatest feat in medical history. I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end to this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again,” he said.The UK government is keen to highlight its efforts to ensure the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people have access to vaccines.At the outset of the pandemic, Downing Street said the UK funded the development and production of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and guaranteed it would be made available at cost around the globe.As a result, almost one in three vaccines administered around the world have been the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – 450 million out of 1.5 billion doses – with the Serum Institute of India among those licenced to manufacture the doses as Covishield in India.“The UK also worked to establish the COVAX scheme to distribute the vaccine to developing countries, providing a significant financial contribution of 548 million pounds early on and encouraging other countries to commit to the scheme. COVAX would not have been able to deliver the 80 million doses it already without Oxford-AstraZeneca, which made up 96 per cent million of those doses,” Downing Street said.As part of his G7 message, Johnson is expected to call for stepping up the manufacture of vaccines, lowering barriers to the international distribution of those vaccines – as the UK has done with Oxford/AstraZeneca – and ultimately sharing surplus doses with developing countries bilaterally and through COVAX.The UK says it has already pledged to share a significant majority of its surplus doses with the scheme and will announce more details of the UK’s plans to support developing countries by sharing doses not needed by the country at the summit.G7 leaders – from the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan as well the European Union – will arrive at Carbis Bay in the coastal region of Cornwall on Friday for three days of meetings on a huge range of global issues, with a particular focus on how the group can lead the global recovery from coronavirus.Next Saturday, the G7 countries will be joined by the leaders of Australia, South Africa, South Korea and India for discussions on health and climate change – a mix of in person and virtual, as in the case of India.As well as asking leaders to join the UK in efforts to vaccinate the world, Johnson will call on them to support the Global Pandemic Radar – a new global surveillance system which will protect immunisation programmes against new vaccine resistant variants by detecting them before they have the chance to spread.Alongside efforts to defeat the pandemic itself, Downing Street he will stress the need to build back better, with a recovery that puts opportunity, sustainability and democratic values at its heart.This is the first G7 where all members will have committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Johnson will ask leaders to channel this ambition and make strong commitments on cutting emissions, shifting to renewable energy and providing climate finance for developing countries ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit later this year.It is expected that the Cornwall Summit will advance the work the UK and other G7 countries have done to make sure all girls have access to 12 years of quality education. Next month the UK will also co-host the Global Partnership for Education Summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-to-set-end-2022-target-to-vaccinate-world-against-covid-19-at-g7-summit-101622983682002.html

06-06-2021||World||11 killed in roadside bombing in northwest Afghanistan, says official||A minivan carrying civilian passengers in northwest Afghanistan was hit by a roadside bomb, leaving at least 11 passengers dead, including three children, an Afghan official said Sunday.The minivan fell into a valley with the shock of the explosion Saturday, said Badghis provincial Gov. Hesamuddin Shams, adding that rescuers were still searching for bodies in the valley.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the provincial government accuses the Taliban of placing the bomb to target security forces. There was no immediate response from the Taliban.Large swathes of war-ravaged Afghanistan are littered with bombs and land mines. Many were planted by insurgents to target government military convoys, but they often kill civilians instead.The United Nations has repeatedly demanded both government forces and the Taliban take more precautions to protect civilians. In the first three months of this year, the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said that 1,783 civilians had been killed or wounded in Afghanistan, an increase of 29% over the same period last year.The violence comes as U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and a delegation from the National Security Council and Department of Defense traveled to the region to start a new series of talks between the Taliban and the government. They were to meet in Kabul and Doha in Qatar to urge the sides to reach a political settlement.Negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan representatives began last September in Doha and continued earlier this year. But the Taliban announced on April 13 that it would not take part in any conference intended to decide the future of Afghanistan until all foreign troops were gone.President Joe Biden had announced a day earlier that all U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan by Sept. 11.In northern Faryab province, provincial officials said Sunday the district of Qaisar had fallen to Taliban fighters after a weeks-long fight between the two sides.Provincial council chief Mohammad Tahir Rahmani told The Associated Press that provincial police chief Saifulrahman was killed in the fighting along with seven other police officers. Like many Afghans, Saifulrahman went by one name.According to Rahmani, the district had already fallen but police officers at police headquarters were resisting. He said the Taliban took 37 police hostage.A provincial police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said that besides police headquarters, the main market and municipality office fell to the Taliban.The Taliban immediately did not comment on taking control of Qaisar district but both the Taliban and Afghan government defense and security forces have increased their operations against each other.Also on Sunday, Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said a roadside bomb explosion in eastern Kabul targeted a civilian car wounding three people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-killed-in-roadside-bombing-in-northwest-afghanistan-says-official-101622975516951.html

Taiwan was chosen as one of the first to receive vaccines as it continues to battle a sudden surge in cases, NHK reported.A group of three Senators arrived at Songshan Airport in Taipei on a US Air Force cargo plane. The short visit was part of a larger tour of the Indo-Pacific region."It was critical that Taiwan be included in the first group to receive vaccines because the United States recognizes Taiwan's urgent need and values this partnership," said Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who serves on the Senate Committee on Armed Services.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said that the United States' pledge to donate Covid-19 vaccines to Taiwan has sent a strong and clear message of its support for the country.Earlier this week, the White House had said that of the first 25 million, 19 million will be distributed through the COVAX initiative.As part of Washington's vaccine outreach, 7 million doses will be given to Asia which includes the following countries and entities: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-to-receive-750-000-covid-19-vaccine-doses-from-us-101622974053084.html

Here's what reports suggest||With the planned date of the final easing of social restrictions in Britain approaching, UK health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is absolutely open to not reopening on June 21 “if that's what needs to happen.” Hancock told Sky News on Sunday that it is too early to make a final decision on easing of restrictions, highlighting the growing concern over the coronavirus variant first identified in India.The final step of the United Kingdom’s planned four-step roadmap out of lockdown has seemingly been thrown in doubt with the rise of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 first identified in India. Repeating the findings of the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), Hancock said that the Delta variant, B.1.617.2, is 40 per cent more transmissible than the original strain.“It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant,” the UK health secretary said. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective,” he added.Also Read | Covid variant found in India dominant in UK, had 'significant impact': MinisterThe Independent SAGE on Friday warned against progressing with the last stage of the roadmap, saying there is “increasing evidence that vaccine efficacy is compromised against this variant.” The independent group of scientists said that there is some evidence that protection from two doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wanes after a number of months, particularly in the elderly.“As things stand, it is very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of the roadmap, scheduled for 21st June, a point that should be made now to modify current false hopes,” the group said.Earlier this week, Public Health England (PHE) stated that the Delta variant has become the dominant variant of concern in Britain, overtaking the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, first identified in Kent, UK. PHE’s latest weekly data on circulating variants showed that there were 5472 new cases of the Delta variant in the UK in the week to May 26, bringing the total number of cases of the variant detected to 12,431.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/has-delta-variant-threatened-uk-lockdown-ending-here-s-what-reports-suggest-101622972397572.html

We've said that we'll give people enough time ahead of the June 21 date."We are not saying 'No' to June 21 at this point," he added.Hancock said it was important that people receive both doses of Covid-19 vaccines as the data showed this could protect effectively against the delta variant.Britain's swift vaccine rollout had weakened, but not broken, the link between the virus, hospitalisation and death, Hancock said.Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could see nothing in the data that would derail the plan to end lockdown restrictions, although caution was needed.Britain's overall death toll from the pandemic stands at 127,836 and is the sixth-highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-found-in-india-dominant-in-uk-had-significant-impact-minister-101622969178732.html

"When we meet, I will again underscore the commitment of the United States, Europe and like-minded democracies to stand up for human rights and dignity."Since taking office in January, Biden has ramped up pressure on the Kremlin, and his comments likening Putin to a "killer" were met with fierce criticism in Moscow.But both leaders have expressed hopes that relations can improve, with the Russian president saying Friday he expected a "positive" result from the talks.Biden in his weekend op-ed also stressed that Washington "does not seek conflict" -- pointing to his recent extension of the New START arms reduction treaty as proof of his desire to reduce tensions."We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-will-stand-with-european-allies-ahead-of-putin-summit-101622966353558.html

06-06-2021||World||Providence-Biological E Covid-19 vaccine to undergo phase two trials this month||A Canadian vaccine developer that announced a partnership with an Indian firm last week is hoping to start phase two trials for its Covid-19 vaccine this month. Providence Therapeutics, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, is confident that it will be able to send a shipment of the vaccine candidate PTX-COVID19-B to its Indian partner, Hyderabad-based Biological E, in July so that trials can start in India, too, prior to application for emergency-use authorisation from health authorities.Brad Sorenson, CEO of Providence, told HT the company expects to soon submit some additional data requested by Health Canada. “As soon as we have that, which it may be as early as next week, but I expect it’ll be within two weeks, we will submit that to Health Canada and we will proceed into our phase two trials,” Sorenson said. Sorenson was hopeful that the first consignment of the vaccines, if approved, will start flowing to India from Providence’s manufacturing unit in the province of Manitoba by the end of this year. “If everything goes well, we should have approval before the end of the year and we should have doses to begin distributing right away once approval comes in,” he said.Providence will manufacture a batch of 30 million doses, with Biological E making between 600 million and a billion doses thereafter. Half that capacity made in India will be retained by Biological E and the other half given to Providence for overseas sale.Sorenson said Providence was exploring partnerships for manufacturing the vaccine so that high demand for a coronavirus vaccine could be met. “The nature of this deal is to make messenger RNA vaccines at very low cost,” he said.Providence is also in discussions with the World Health Organization (WHO) for participation in the UN body’s “solidarity trials”, which it describes as “one of the largest international randomised trials for Covid-19 treatments, enrolling almost 12,000 patients in 500 hospital sites in over 30 countries”. While acceptance is not guaranteed, Sorenson said he was confident Providence has “a world-class vaccine” and that the WHO is “very excited to have an mRNA vaccine of this calibre participating in the solidarity trial”. Authorisation by the WHO will also open up the vaccine’s usage globally, and Sorenson was hopeful it would become part of the Covax global vaccine distribution facility.Interestingly, Providence is working on another version of the vaccine, PTX-COVID19-LT, which is in its investigation phase. Sorenson said the “immunity that would be generated would be longer lasting” so a booster dose wouldn’t necessarily be required every year. “You might be able to get this shot and it might be good for five or ten years, and so it would be very effective for the entire world; and particularly for low and middle-income countries where rolling out vaccines on an annual basis is very prohibitive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/providencebiological-e-covid-19-vaccine-to-undergo-phase-two-trials-this-month-101622960609272.html

Until now, the immunisation drive was limited to people aged 18 and above.In an official statement to state media, the company's chairman Yin Weidong announced the decision on Friday. The government is yet to announce an exact date when it will start administrating the jab to kids. "When Sinovac's vaccine will be offered to younger groups depends on health authorities formulating China's inoculation strategies," local media reported Yin as saying.The preliminary results from Phase I and II clinical trials show that the vaccine can trigger an immune response in kids. The adverse effects have been mild so far, news agency Reuters reported.The participants were injected with a third booster dose after they completed their two regular shots. This resulted in 10-fold increase in antibody levels in a week, and 20-fold in half a month, Yin said while making the announcement.It will continue to test a three-dose regimen and to observe antibody duration before the company actually makes the recommendation to authorities about when a third dose should be given, he added.After Sinovac, state-backed drugmaker Sinopharm has also submitted a request for emergency approval for kids to the government. A vaccine from CanSino Biologics' is also in Phase II of the clinical trial involving those aged between six and 17.Meanwhile, the vaccination drive in China accelerated in the country as authorities administered 100 million shots injust five days. Chinese public health officials said that they are aiming to inoculate 80% of the population of 1.4 billion by the end of the year.(Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-covid-19-vaccine-for-kids-as-young-as-3-101622950941591.html

The total number of coronavirus cases in the country now stands at 4,511,669. With 13 new deaths on Saturday, the UK's total toll went up to 127,836.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWhile a Downing Street spokesperson said "no decision" has been made on whether to ease the Covid-19 restrictions, another government official told Sky News that other options were being drawn but "we are still expecting to be in a place to go ahead on June 21," PTI reported. "As the prime minister has set out, we can see nothing in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to deviate from the roadmap," according to the Downing Street spokesperson. The government would continue to review the latest data, she added.The government, which said there is "nothing in the data" to suggest ending lockdown should be delayed, is expected to mandate wearing of masks in certain settings and encourage people to continue working from home.Also Read: UK unlikely to relax foreign travel curbs amid Covid-19 surgeThe number of Covid-19 cases in the country is at its highest since March 25, when 6,397 were recorded.

"Under the principles of the landmark reforms, the largest global firms with profit margins of at least 10% will be in scope – with 20% of any profit above the 10% margin reallocated and then subjected to tax in the countries where they make sales," he said in one of the tweets.He also said that the move will create a more level-playing field for UK firms and cracking down on tax avoidance.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the agreement “provides tremendous momentum” for reaching a global deal that “would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world.”The meeting of finance ministers came ahead of an annual summit of G7 leaders scheduled for June 11-13 in Cornwall, England."Signaling that there is consensus around some of the key features of what’s being discussed globally was really, really important so they have the momentum to go to the next phase of this with the G-20," said Manal Corwin, a tax principal at professional services firm KPMG and a former Treasury Department official.Part of the agreement Saturday is that other countries would repeal their unilateral digital taxes in favour of a global agreement.The Group of 7 is an informal forum among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. European Union representatives also attend. Its decisions are not legally binding, but leaders can use the forum to exert political influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-strike-deal-to-tax-google-amazon-and-other-tech-giants-101622945395412.html

Now, a new study has revealed that a woman with advanced HIV carried the virus for 216 days.The case report, still to be reviewed by peers, also says that the virus accumulated more than 30 mutations. The report was published on Thursday.The 36-year-old woman has not been named. She is living in South Africa.The mutations involved 13 to the spike proteins, which helps the virus escape the immune response, and 19 others, which could change its behaviour, according to the study."While most people effectively clear Sars-CoV-2, there are several reports of prolonged infection in immunosuppressed individuals. We present a case of prolonged infection of greater than 6 months with shedding of high titter SARS-CoV-2 in an individual with advanced HIV and antiretroviral treatment failure. Through whole genome sequencing at multiple time-points, we demonstrate the early emergence of the E484K substitution associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, followed by other escape mutations and the N501Y substitution found in most variants of concern," an excerpt of the study said."This provides support to the hypothesis of intra-host evolution as one mechanism for the emergence of Sars-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion properties," it further said.There is, however, no clarity if the mutations present in the woman's body were passed on to others.A person carrying HIV is 2.75 times more likely to die when infected with the coronavirus than someone with no co-morbidities, because of the immunity issue. But the woman in the case study was immunosuppressed.Still, the impact HIV had on mortality was less than expected and well below that of other co-morbidities such as diabetes, although it was higher than tuberculosis, an analysis of the South African data done by Western Cape Department of Health last year showed.About 7.8 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, which causes AIDS, while about 300,000 have TB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiv-woman-had-coronavirus-for-216-days-mutated-30-times-in-6-months-study-101622944129781.html
06-06-2021||World||'Country being destroyed': Trump slams 'radical left-wing Biden administration'||Former President Donald Trump on Saturday pushed Republicans to support those candidates who share his values in next year's midterm elections as he launched a new more active phase of his post presidency.The former Republican president teased the prospect of another presidential bid of his own in 2024, but vowed first to be an active presence on the campaign trail for his allies in next year's fight for control of Congress.“The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump charged.Trump delivered his latest comments in a speech to hundreds of Republican officials and activists gathered for the North Carolina GOP convention, the opening appearance in what is expected to be a new phase of rallies and public events. Out of office for more than four months and banned from his preferred social media accounts, the former president hopes to use such events to elevate his diminished voice ahead of another potential presidential run.His advisers are already eyeing subsequent appearances in Ohio, Florida, Alabama and Georgia to help bolster midterm candidates and energize voters.In contrast to the mega rallies that filled sports arenas when Trump was president, he faced a crowd of several hundred North Carolina Republicans seated at dinner tables inside the Greenville convention center Saturday night. Tens of thousands more followed along on internet streams.Invited to the stage briefly during his remarks, Trump daughter-in-law and North Carolina native Lara Trump announced she would not run for the Senate because of family obligations.“I am saying no for now, not no forever,” Lara Trump said.Minutes later, Trump announced his endorsement of loyalist Rep. Ted Budd in the crowded Republican primary, adding a slap at former Gov. Pat McCrory, who has been critical of Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election.“You can’t pick people who have already lost two races and do not stand for our values,” Trump said.Trump devoted much of his remarks to railing against President Joe Biden, which he called "the most radical left-wing administration in history.”“As we gather tonight our country is being destroyed before our very eyes,” he said.Democratic National Committee spokesman Ammar Moussa took a shot at Trump in a statement released ahead of his speech.“More than 400,000 dead Americans, millions of jobs lost, and recklessly dangerous rhetoric is apparently not enough for Republicans to break with a loser president who cost them the White House, Senate, and House,” Moussa said.While Trump has had to work harder to make his voice heard since leaving office, he remains a commanding force in the Republican Party. A recent Quinnipiac University national poll found that 66% of Republicans would like to see him run for reelection, though the same number of Americans overall said they would prefer he didn’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survival-of-us-depends-on-our-ability-to-elect-republicans-trump-at-north-carolina-101622941074381.html
06-06-2021||World||Israel's domestic security warns of 'possible violence' as PM Netanyahu faces unseating||The head of Israel's domestic security service issued a rare warning on Saturday of possible violence during one of the most politically charged periods in decades, with the country on the verge of unseating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, its longest serving leader.Netanyahu is facing the prospect of an end to his 12-year run as premier after Israel's centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid announced on Wednesday that he had succeeded in forming a governing coalition following a March 23 election.The new government, yet to be sworn in, is an unlikely patchwork of left-wing, liberal, rightist, nationalist and religious parties, as well as - for the first time in Israel's history - an Arab Islamist party.Netanyahu in online posts has warned the partnership was "a dangerous leftist government."Some right-wing groups are angry at Naftali Bennett, head of a small ultra-nationalist party who is slated to replace Netanyahu in a power-sharing pact with Lapid, garnering many postings attacking him on social media.Before the election, Bennett had promised he would not join the centrist Lapid, or any Arab party in a coalition."We have recently identified a rise in increasingly extreme violent and inciteful discourse particularly on social networks," Nadav Argaman, head of the Shin Bet security force, said in a statement without mentioning any names."This discourse may be interpreted among certain groups or individuals, as one that permits violent and illegal activity that may even cause physical harm," he said.Since Bennett announced he was joining forces with Lapid, security services have ramped up his protection with right-wing demonstrations held near the homes of his party members, hoping to keep them from joining the government.Argaman called on political and religious leaders to show responsibility and tone down potential incitements. His warning was reminiscent to some in Israel of the days leading up to the 1995 assassination of then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was shot by a Jewish ultra-nationalist for pursuing a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.Israel's left has for years pointed the finger at Netanyahu, then head of the opposition, for playing a part in incitement that preceded the assassination. Netanyahu has vehemently rejected the accusation and has repeatedly condemned Rabin's killing.Lapid and Bennett have said they hope their "unity government" will heal deep political divides among Israelis and end hate. A poll by Israel's N12 Television's Meet the Press on Saturday showed that 46% of Israelis support the Bennett-Lapid government, 38% would prefer another election - the fifth in about two years - and 15% did not state a preference.Tensions could flare further this week, when a Jewish right-wing march is expected to pass through Jerusalem's Old City's Damascus gate. Eleven days of intense fighting broke out last month between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, sparked by Israeli-Palestinian confrontations in Jerusalem, in and around the Old City. A similar march, its route diverted at the last minute, was held the day the fighting broke out.In the nearby flashpoint East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where the potential eviction of Palestinians by Jewish settlers played a major role in the buildup to the latest Israel-Hamas conflict, scuffles broke out on Saturday.Media network Al Jazeera said one of its reporters, Givara Budeiri, had been assaulted and arrested by Israeli police while covering a protest there.A police spokesperson said that Budeiri had assaulted officers and had refused to identify herself. Footage posted online showed Budeiri, wearing a press vest, being pulled and pushed while led away by three or four officers. Al Jazeera also said the reporter's camera was smashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-domestic-security-warns-of-possible-violence-as-pm-netanyahu-faces-unseating-101622925569391.html

His enduring influence is extraordinary, considering that he was defeated after a single term -- and was twice impeached.Yet in coming months, Trump is expected to again hold the big election rallies that he thrives on.The 'next time' For many Republicans, the party's focus in the midterm campaigns should be a sharp critique of the policies of Trump's successor, President Joe Biden.But Trump seems unable to let go of his theory -- debunked by scores of judges and state officials -- that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He seems certain to return to the subject Saturday evening.Trump is also expected to criticize White House pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, accused by some Republicans of misleading the American public about Covid-19, according to the New York Times.The Biden administration, of course, is sure to take a beating as well.Still no concessionNearly five months after leaving the presidency, and now comfortably installed at his Bedminster golf resort near New York, Trump has yet to explicitly acknowledge his defeat -- and even talks more and more openly of a return to the White House.Ever the provocateur, the former president said Friday that the "next time" he is in the presidential mansion, he will not be inviting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to dinner, after Facebook announced a two-year extension of its Trump ban.Facebook said Trump could return only after it determines that any "risk to public safety" has disappeared. The popular platform had temporarily banned him on January 7, for having encouraged the deadly attack on the Capitol.The former president, also banned by Twitter, called Facebook's unprecedented decision an "insult" to the 75 million people who voted for him in November.Biden received more than 80 million votes.Accused in the House of Representatives' letters of impeachment of "inciting violence against the government" in the Capitol assault, Trump was acquitted in February by the Senate as only seven Republicans voted to convict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-returning-to-the-stage-as-he-flirts-with-2024-run-101622921056060.html

So we've yet to set the final rate," Yellen said.Treasury officials have said they believe a higher US tax rate will create incentives for other countries to push higher, otherwise they would miss out on potential revenue from American companies in their territory.Not all countries would need to sign on to the global corporate tax deal for it to work, Yellen said, as it would allow countries to additionally tax overseas income of companies operating via tax havens, negating that advantage."It doesn't require absolute agreement across the board. It has a way of bringing hold-outs into it," she said, adding that she hoped to secure the backing of G20 countries that represent a "very large share" of global GDP at a meeting in July.Keeping an eye on inflationYellen said inflation will remain elevated at 3% on a year-over-year basis until about the end of 2021."I personally believe that this represents transitory factors," she said. Production bottlenecks had caused elevated prices in some industries, such as motor vehicles, while other prices, such as airline fares, were rebounding back to more normal levels, she added."We'll watch this very carefully, keep an eye on it and try to address issues that arise if it turns out to be necessary," Yellen said.There is still slack in the labor market, she said, because of people who had lost jobs permanently, and it will take a while to reabsorb those workers into the economy."So we shouldn't expect this process to be complete in a month or two," Yellen said. "And while we're seeing some inflation, I don't believe it's permanent."Yellen said the G7 finance ministers agreed to ambitious commitments to de-carbonize their economies and mobilize public and private finance for action to combat climate change."To facilitate the mobilization of private climate finance, the G7 also agreed to take action to improve the availability of consistent, comparable, and decision-useful climate-related financial information to market participants," Yellen said in prepared remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-s-janet-yellen-tells-g7-to-keep-spending-says-inflation-will-pass-101622917277694.html
