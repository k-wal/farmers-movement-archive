Meanwhile the government released a report that claims that nearly 31 million Americans — a record — now have health coverage through Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act.“We did this together," said Obama, whose administration established the health insurance marketplace. “We always talked about how, if we could get the principle of universal coverage established, we could then build on it.”The White House effort to spotlight the expanded enrollment period and claim strong numbers for the Obama-era health care law comes as the political world and the health care system await a Supreme Court ruling on the law's constitutionality.The Health and Human Services Department said in a report that nearly 31 million have obtained coverage in 2021 as a result of the law. That's considerably higher than the more than 20 million estimate that’s commonly cited.The Biden administration has launched a special COVID pandemic sign-up period, and Congress passed a big boost in subsidies for private health plans sold under the law. But that alone doesn’t explain the increased coverage.The report says 11.3 million people are covered through the health law’s marketplaces, where subsidized private plans are offered. An additional 14.8 million are covered through expanded Medicaid, the report adds. All but a dozen states have accepted Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which mainly serves low-income working adults. And 1 million are covered by so-called basic health plans, an option created by the ACA and offered in a limited number of states.That accounts for enrollment of about 27 million people. But the Biden administration is also claiming credit for four million people who would have been eligible for Medicaid without Obama’s law.The Supreme Court is soon expected to rule on a challenge to the health law from Texas and other GOP-led states. They argue that because Congress has eliminated the law’s penalty for being uninsured, a now-toothless ACA requirement that almost all Americans must have health insurance is unconstitutional and therefore the law should fail.Those defending Obamacare say that even if the Supreme Court strikes down the coverage requirement there’s no reason to tamper with the rest of the law.The White House says 1.2 million people have now signed up for health insurance through the government marketplace during the special enrollment period that began in February. That number includes people who would have qualified for a sign-up opportunity even without Biden’s special enrollment period.A life change such as losing workplace coverage or getting married is considered a “qualifying life event” that allows people to sign up any time during the year. Last year about 390,000 people signed up because of life changes from Feb. 15 to April 30, the government said.Biden, in the conversation with Obama, spoke about the 2015 death of his son Beau Biden from cancer.“I literally remember sitting on the bed with him within a week or so him passing away," Biden said, "and thinking, what in God’s name would I do if I got a notice from the insurance company saying you’ve outlived your coverage?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-turns-to-obama-to-help-boost-health-care-enrollment-101622914074698.html
05-06-2021||World||In Venezuela, an account of a kidnapping renews focus on violence against women||In 2001, Linda Lopez was kidnapped and held for almost four months in a Caracas apartment, where she was repeatedly raped and tortured.Now, she has released a book about her experience and her years-long battle to bring the case to trial in a system that she says still fails Venezuelan women.The release of the book co-written by Lopez, a lawyer, and Luisa Kislinger, a Venezuelan writer and activist, has revived debate about violence against women and girls in Venezuela, which activists says is often overshadowed by the country's humanitarian and economic crisis.Venezuela does not publish statistics on domestic abuse, but it is a widespread problem in Latin America that increased during the pandemic, according to data from the U.S.-based nonprofit International Rescue Committee in a report published last June.In her book, "Double Crime," Lopez, best known by her first and middle names Linda Loaiza, details a horrific ordeal of being gagged and handcuffed, beaten with glass bottles, burned with cigarettes and repeatedly raped between March and July 2001.Luis Carrera, the son of a prominent academic, was arrested in November 2001 and convicted in 2006 for beating and kidnapping Lopez and spent six years in prison.The court determined she had been raped during her captivity, but absolved Carrera of rape charges on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to show he was the perpetrator.That was a failure of the system, Lopez told Reuters in an interview.Failing to punish rape "is telling society: do it. You have carte blanche. You can," she said.Lopez's case became a symbolic one for women's rights groups because proceedings were delayed for years as judges repeatedly declined to hear it, according to Lopez and the groups, such as Tinta Violeta in Caracas.Her supporters said the delay was because of the prominence of the Carrera family. Rights groups say the government fails to investigate and prosecute abuse, particularly when assailants are well-connected men, and that it has not invested enough in helping women escape or recover from abusive relationships.Reuters was unable to locate Carrera, who was released from jail in 2008.His father, Gustavo Carrera, did not respond to emails seeking comment.Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a message to Reuters that the government actively prosecutes cases of domestic abuse and that women's rights are guaranteed under the country's constitution.He said prosecutors were investigating 185 cases of women being murdered between January and November of 2020 and 53 cases in the first three months of 2021. Watchdog group Femicide Monitor says 256 women were murdered in 2020 and 73 from January to April this year.The issue of women's rights returned to the spotlight in April due to a flood of sexual harassment accusations against musicians and entertainers. One well-known Venezuelan poet died of an apparent suicide days after being accused of statutory rape. He had confirmed the accusation in an Instagram message and asked for forgiveness.Lopez was rescued by police and firefighters on July 19, 2001, when Carrera left her alone in the apartment unbound for the first time, allowing her to call for help, she told state prosecutors.She spent a year in a hospital to treat a broken jaw and broken ribs, and underwent 15 operations to reconstruct her face and genitals."I have innumerable scars on my body," she said.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, a Costa-Rica based tribunal that forms part of the Organization of American States human rights protection system, in 2018 ruled that the Venezuelan state had failed to properly protect Lopez from sexual assault.Lopez said Venezuela has not complied with key elements of the sentence, which ordered that Lopez be paid damages and said the government should investigate why officials ignored warnings by family members that Lopez had been kidnapped.Saab told Reuters that his office was in talks with the foreign ministry and the women's ministry to determine how to respond to the sentence, without elaborating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-venezuela-an-account-of-a-kidnapping-renews-focus-on-violence-against-women-101622913007135.html

The foreign ministers and central bank governors of the G7 met in London for two days of talks, chaired by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. The United Kingdom holds the rotating presidency for the G7 Leaders' Summit in 2021.The UK treasury department, known as HM Treasury, said in a statement that the agreement among the G7 countries on global tax reform delivers on Sunak's promise for “big international companies to start paying their fair share.” After the G7 countries agreed on the key pact, Sunak, in a video address, thanked his G7 counterparts “for their willingness to work together...to strike a deal of historic significance that finally brings the global tax system into the 21st century.”“I am delighted to announce that G7 finance ministers today, after years of discussions, have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age and, crucially, to make sure it's fair. So that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places.

05-06-2021||World||'We made it!': G7 nations sign historic pact to make tech giants pay fair taxes||The Group of Seven wealthy democracies agreed Saturday to support a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15% in order to deter multinational companies from avoiding taxes by stashing profits in low-rate countries.G-7 finance ministers meeting in London also endorsed proposals to make the world's biggest companies - including U.S.-based tech giants - pay taxes in countries where they have lots of sales but no physical headquarters.Britain’s Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, the meeting's host, said the deal would “reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age and crucially to make sure that it’s fair, so that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places.”U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who attended the London meetings, said the agreement “provides tremendous momentum” towards reaching a global deal that “would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation, and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world.”France cheered Saturday’s agreement and claimed credit for acting as its catalyst.“We made it! After 4 years of battle, a historic accord was reached with G7 member states,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire tweeted. “France can be proud!”The meeting of finance ministers came ahead of an annual summit of G-7 leaders scheduled for June 11-13 in Cornwall, England. The U.K. is hosting both sets of meetings because it holds the group’s rotating presidency.The endorsement from the G-7 could help build momentum for a deal in wider talks among more than 140 countries being held in Paris as well as a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Venice in July.The G-7 has also been facing pressure to provide vaccines for low-income countries facing new surges of COVID-19 infections and to finance projects to combat climate change. A statement Saturday from the two-day finance ministers' meeting said only that they welcomed increased funding commitments by member countries and looked forward to more.International discussions on the tax issue gained momentum after U.S. President Joe Biden backed the idea of a global minimum of at least 15% on corporate profits.The tax proposals endorsed Saturday have two main parts. The first part lets countries tax a share of the profits earned by companies that have no physical presence but have substantial sales, for instance through selling digital advertising.The G-7 statement echoes a U.S. proposal to simply let countries tax part of the earnings of the largest and most profitable companies — digital or not — if they are doing business within their borders. It also supported awarding countries the right to tax 20% or more of profit exceeding a 10% profit margin.Part of the agreement is that countries such as France that have imposed digital services taxes would remove them in favor of the global agreement. The U.S. considers those unilateral digital taxes to be unfair trade measures that single out big U.S. tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.The other main part of the proposal is for countries to tax their home companies' overseas profits at a rate of at least 15%. That would deter the practice of using accounting schemes to shift profits to a few very low-tax countries.Nations have been grappling with the question of how to deter companies from legally avoiding paying taxes by resorting to tax havens — typically small countries that entice companies with low or zero taxes, even though the firms do little actual business there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-sign-key-pact-to-make-tech-giants-pay-fair-taxes-101622903739003.html

All you need to know||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved a new version of popular diabetes medicine to be sold as a weight-loss drug in the United States. In addition to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, the doctors will now be ableto prescribe injectable drug Wegovy, a higher-dose version of Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug semaglutide, for chronic weight management.Wegovy is the first approved drug for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight since 2014. The drug is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related condition like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol.Wegovy’s safety and efficacyAccording to the FDA, the safety and efficacy of Wegovy were studied in four 68-week trials, in which more than 4,100 patients participated. Over 2,600 patients received Wegovy for up to 68 weeks and more than 1,500 patients received placebo during these four trials.In a trial that enrolled adults without diabetes, the average body weight of participants was 105 kg and 74 per cent were female. Those who received this under-the-skin injection lost an average of 12.4 per cent of their initial body weight compared to those who received placebo.In another trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes, the average body weight was 100 kg and 51% of the patients were female. Individuals who received Wegovy under this trial lost 6.2 per cent of their initial body weight compared to those who received placebo.Also Read | Obesity may protect patients, with severe bacterial infection, against deathSide effects of WegovyThe US FDA said that that the most common side effect of Wegovy includes nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, indigestion, dizziness, abdominal distension, eructation, low blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes, gastroenteritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (a type of digestive disorder).Warnings about Wegovy useWegovy contains a boxed warning, informing healthcare professionals and patients about the potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumours.

Now we have the next decade for ecosystem restoration," Khan said.He said although Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions was quite low as compared to advanced nations, yet the country was one of the most vulnerable to changing climate patterns."Pakistan's contribution to global warming and climate change is minimal. Rich countries, which contribute significantly more, have a greater responsibility to provide funds to ones like ours so that we can fight climate change," he said."The countries which contribute the most towards pollution and have the resources should support those trying to combat climate change," he said.Khan also lauded UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for reiterating the message that the developed world has to take responsibility and help countries which do not have the resources when it comes to fighting global warming.Talking about the steps being taken by Pakistan to tackle the challenge, he said the country was aiming to produce 60 per cent clean energy by 2030.Khan said one billion trees had been planted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the government would achieve the target of planting 10 billion trees in the next five years."If we are successful in our goal of planting 10 billion trees, it will have a major impact on the people, the country and the economy," he said, urging the people to take part in the campaign.Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose message was read out by the country's ambassador to Pakistan Nong Rong, commended the strides made by Pakistan to cope with climate change.Xi Jinping said his country stands ready to work with Pakistan and other countries to inject new impetus into global environmental governance and contribute to a clean and beautiful world.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson virtually delivering his message appreciated Prime Minister Khan for undertaking the project of planting ten billion trees and termed it a huge campaign for forestation.UN Secretary General Guterres in his virtual address said the next ten years will be the final chance to avert a climate catastrophe, turn back the deadly tide of pollution and end species loss."We should finally make peace with nature and secure a better future for all," he said.Earlier, Khan in a tweet urged the "world to join hands to protect the environment and reset relationship with Nature".He said Pakistan was fully committed to play a leadership role in restoration of the ecosystem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chance-for-world-to-correct-course-imran-khan-tells-rich-nations-to-help-poor-countries-combat-climate-change-101622902513800.html
05-06-2021||World||US official says trade relationship with China marked by 'significant imbalance'||The trade relationship between the two largest economies in the world has “significant imbalance” and the Biden administration is committed to leveling it, according to the US trade representative.“There are parts of this trade relationship that are unhealthy and have over time been damaging in some very important ways to the US economy,” Trade Representative Katherine Tai told reporters Saturday in response to a question about whether the US would continue with a trade deal signed with China in January 2020 and the tariffs on Chinese goods.“It’s a relationship in trade that has been marked by significant imbalance - that is in terms of performance, but also in terms of opportunity and openness of our markets to each other,” she said ahead of a virtual meeting of trade ministers from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ”The United States is committed to doing everything we can to bring balance back to the US-China trade relationship.”The comments come as the two nations seem to be increasing their economic discussions, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He speaking to both Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen over the past two weeks. While China said that those talks showed the two sides have restarted normal communications, there’s been no public sign of any progress on the bilateral tariffs or of discussions over other economic flashpoints between the nations.The US administration is reviewing its stance toward China and hasn’t made any major changes to the policies it inherited from former President Donald Trump, and Tai has pledged to build on the January 2020 trade pact, saying on May 5 that she respects the continuity of US policy.However, there are increasing signs of the direction the new administration’s policy will take. The White House’s top official for Asia said last month that the US is entering a period of intense competition with China, and the administration this week kept in place a Trump-era ban on investment in the US by some Chinese companies.Despite those diplomatic and political tensions, trade and investment flows between the two nations continue to strengthen. China’s exports to the US are still growing, while China is stepping up its purchases of US goods, even though that’s not enough to reach the levels promised in the trade deal.At the same press conference, China’s Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao argued that China is continuing to open up its economy despite the challenges of the pandemic, listing a number of areas in which it had reduced controls on foreign investment and trade. He also reiterated that China was “favorably considering” joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, an economic treaty originally meant to help cement US power in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-says-trade-relationship-with-china-marked-by-significant-imbalance-101622899725449.html

During an interview, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson told CNN Business that he turned to the space agency scientists, asking them to look at the mysterious events from a scientific standpoint to get a better idea.In April last year, the US department of defense released three declassified videos that showed US Navy pilots encountering what appeared to be UFOs. While the videos had earlier been leaked and published by a leading US daily, it was the first time when the Pentagon formally acknowledged the existence of such videos. The US Navy then released seven incident reports, revealing more details about the series of encounters between their pilots and ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’.“I have talked to those navy pilots and they are sure that they saw something real. And of course we have seen their video from their jet. What is it? we don't know,” said Nelson, the former Florida senator and spaceflight veteran.Also Read | Documentary filmmaker releases video of ‘swarm of UFOs’ over US navy shipEven as the broad conclusions of US intelligence on UFOs have been reported, the full report is expected to be delivered to Congress later this month. The complete report could present a broader picture of what the US government knows about the mysterious flying objects.“We don't know if it's extra-terrestrial, we don't know if it's an enemy. We don't know if it's an optical phenomenon,” said Nelson, while dismissing the possibility of an optical illusion. “We don't think so because of the characteristics that those navy jet pilots described as they saw it move around,” the Nasa chief added.On being asked whether Nasa should be more involved at this point, Nelson said, “Well we are... and I have started it. I have been here a month, and I have started it.” The Nasa administrator also said that the agency is not directly working with the Pentagon, but stressed that “if we find something, the Pentagon will want to know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-saw-something-real-nasa-getting-serious-about-ufos-under-new-chief-101622897177178.html

It is all done within the context of the United States' domestic political process," Putin was quoted as saying."The people who do this, they probably assume that the United States has such economic, military and political might that it can get away with that. It is no big deal, that is what they think."Putin said such behaviour reminded him of the Soviet Union."The problem with empires is that they think they are powerful enough to make some mistakes. We will buy these (people), bully them, make a deal with them, give necklaces to them, threaten them with battleships. And this will solve all the problems. But problems accumulate. A moment comes when they cannot be solved anymore."Biden and Putin will meet in Geneva on June 16, the White House and the Kremlin have said, to discuss "the full range of pressing issues", according to Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-get-away-with-making-threats-putin-likens-us-behaviour-to-soviet-union-101622895642823.html

05-06-2021||World||G7 nations near historic deal on taxing multinationals||Group of Seven rich nations will seek to overcome long-standing differences on Saturday and strike a landmark deal to close the net on large companies that they say do not pay enough tax.The proposed accord, which could form the basis of a global pact next month, is aimed at ending a decades-long "race to the bottom" in which countries have competed to attract corporate giants with ultra-low tax rates and exemptions.That has in turn cost their public coffers hundreds of billions of dollars - a shortfall they now need to recoup all the more urgently to pay for the huge cost of propping up economies ravaged by the coronavirus crisis."We are just one millimetre away from a historic agreement," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC on Friday as he and other G7 finance chiefs met in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic at talks in London.British finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is chairing the talks, also wants large companies to be required to declare their environmental impact in a consistent way. The G7 is likely to commit to avoid withdrawing Covid stimulus too early as well.Rich nations have struggled for years to agree a way to raise more revenue from large multinationals such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, which often book profits in jurisdictions where they pay little or no tax.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has given the stalled talks fresh impetus by proposing a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, above the level in countries such as Ireland but below the lowest level in the G7.Yet major disagreements remain on both the minimum rate at which companies should be taxed, and on how the rules will be drawn up to ensure that very large firms with lower profit margins, such as Amazon, face higher taxes.TO THE WIREOne question is whether 15% should be the final rate or whether it should be regarded as the floor for a final deal, leaving room to agree a higher level at subsequent talks within the broader G20 group of nations scheduled for Venice in July.Beyond the level itself, just as important for Britain and many others is that large multinationals pay more tax where they make their sales - not just where they book profits, or locate their headquarters."Their business model gives them chances to avoid taxes ... much more than other companies," German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said.The United States is also holding out for an immediate end to the digital services taxes levied by Britain, France and Italy, which it views as unfairly targeting U.S. tech giants for tax practices that European companies also use."It's going to go right to the wire," one source close to the talks said. "The United States are holding to their position, as are we."British, Italian and Spanish fashion, cosmetics and luxury goods exports to the United States will be among those facing new 25% tariffs later this year if there is no compromise.The U.S. has proposed levying the new global minimum tax only on the world's 100 largest and most profitable companies.Britain, Germany and France are open to this but want to ensure companies such as Amazon - which has lower profit margins than other tech firms - do not escape the net.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-near-historic-deal-on-taxing-multinationals-101622887882185.html
05-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Chinese virologist says Fauci emails prove her Wuhan lab leak claims||A Chinese virologist, who was among the first to suggest the Covid-19 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab, said that US top coronavirus advisor Anthony Fauci's emails prove that she was right all along.A trove of Fauci's emails covering the onset of the coronavirus outbreak was released this week to media under a freedom of information request.In one email sent last April, an executive at a health charity thanked Fauci for publicly stating that scientific evidence does not support the lab-leak theory.Dr. Li-Meng Yan was one of the first to research the emerging coronavirus and previously revealed she was forced into hiding after accusing Beijing of a cover-up, New York Post reported.Now, as international leaders finally focus on her Wuhan lab-leak theory, the scientist told Newsmax that Fauci's emails contain "a lot of useful information" suggesting he always knew more than he revealed."They verify my work from the very beginning, even from last January, that these people know what happened, but they choose to hide for the Chinese Communist Party and for their own benefits," Yan insisted speaking of the treasure trove of documents released this week."He knows all these things," she insisted of Fauci and the apparent gain-of-function work carried out by the now-notorious Wuhan Institute of Virology in the heart of the city where the pandemic first emerged.Also Read | Covid-19: Chinese virologist says Fauci emails prove her Wuhan lab leak claimsOne email, she said, showed that "Dr. Fauci even back to 1st of February last year immediately realized that there would be gain-of-function experiment involved in the Covid-19 virus."Over 3,000 pages of emails were obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, date from January to June 2020.The emails have sparked the debate whether Fauci chose to remain mum despite knowing about the onset of the virus.The emails revealed about early days of the US Covid outbreak. Dr Fauci and his colleagues took notice, in the early days, of the theory that Covid-19 may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.In an interview with CNN, Fauci said the email had been taken out of context by critics and he had an "open mind" about the origin of the virus.With regard to the "lab leak" email, the doctor told CNN that he still finds it unlikely that a Wuhan laboratory released the virus."I don't remember what's in that redacted [email], but the idea I think is quite far-fetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill themselves as well as other people," he said.Amid criticism of an inconclusive international probe into the virus' origins and new reports of Covid-related illness in the region weeks before it was officially identified, the theory is once again sparking debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-virologist-says-fauci-emails-prove-her-wuhan-lab-leak-claims-101622885464792.html

The country is partially compliant' with seven recommendations and non-compliant' with two out of a total 40 recommendations.All in all, Pakistan is now compliant or largely compliant with 31 out of 40 FATF recommendations.READ MORE: Eyewash by Pakistan on terror againThe reporting date for this evaluation was October 1, 2020, which means Islamabad may have made further progress since then that would be evaluated at a later stage.“Pakistan will move from enhanced (expedited) to enhanced follow-up, and will continue to report back to the APG on progress to strengthen its implementation of anti-money laundering and combating financing terror measures,” the APG said.Pakistan submitted its third progress report in February 2021 which is yet to be evaluated.“Overall, Pakistan has made notable progress in addressing the technical compliance deficiencies identified in its Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) and has been re-rated on 22 recommendations,” the APG added.Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list since June 2018.Global terror financing watchdog, FATF, in February this year, had retained Pakistan on its "grey list" till June after concluding that Islamabad failed to address its strategically important deficiencies, to fully implement the 27-point action plan that the watchdog had drawn up for Pakistan.Pakistan's continuation on the 'grey list' means that it will not get any respite in trying to access finances in the form of investments and aid from international bodies including International Monetary Fund (IMF).Pakistan is facing the difficult task of clearing its name from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatfs-regional-body-retains-pakistan-on-enhanced-follow-up-list-101622884899780.html

His ministry also announced Twitter's suspension on Twitter When asked about the details of the suspension, a ministerial aide told Reuters: "Wait and see how things will turn out."As of the early hours of Saturday, Twitter's website was inaccessible in Nigeria on some mobile carriers, while its app and website worked on others, according to Reuters tests in Lagos and Abuja.Twitter is investigating its "deeply concerning" suspension of operations by the Nigerian government, and "will provide updates when we know more," the company said in a statement.On Wednesday, the US tech firm said Buhari's post threatening to punish groups blamed for attacks on government buildings had violated Twitter's "abusive behaviour" policy.In April, the information minister reacted angrily when Twitter chose neighbouring Ghana for its first African office. He said the company had been influenced by media misrepresentations of Nigeria, including reports of crackdowns on protests last year.Demonstrators calling for police reform had used social media to organise, raise money and share alleged proof of police harassment. Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted to encourage his followers to donate.In the protests' wake, Mohammed called for "some form of regulation" on social media to combat "fake news".A spokesperson for Airtel, one of Nigeria's largest mobile carriers, on Friday declined to say whether the company had received any government directives about the suspension.MTN, the largest mobile carrier, did not respond to calls and a message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter-days-after-president-s-post-removed-101622884753678.html
05-06-2021||World||Videos contradict US police version of fatal shooting of Kansas City man||A group of Christian ministers is questioning the fatal police shooting of a Kansas City man after they said videos released this week contradicted the law enforcement version of what happened.Malcolm Johnson, 31, was shot and killed inside a Kansas City gas station convenience store on March 25 when officers tried to arrest him for questioning in an earlier shooting.The Missouri State Highway Patrol, which is investigating all fatal shootings by Kansas City police, has said two officers tried to arrest Johnson when a fight ensued. The patrol said Johnson pulled a gun and shot an officer in the leg as other officers arrived. The wounded officer returned fire, killing Johnson, the patrol said.A video released on Thursday, which was taken by a store employee, shows several officers struggling with Johnson on the floor. A shot is heard and the officer who was shot backs away. Then two other shots are heard and Johnson stops struggling.The video does not show if Johnson drew a gun, who shot the officer or which officers then fired at Johnson, who was Black. The ministers said the video does not show Johnson with a gun.Dr. Emanuel Cleaver III said ministers watched the video together on a large screen Thursday. Several ministers at a news conference Thursday afternoon said they believed the video showed one of the police officers may have accidentally shot the officer after a shot ricocheted and then another officer shot Johnson twice in the back of the head.Pastor Darron Edwards said the videos show “this is not an open and shut case" and police need to tell everyone what really happened. He said the officers involved should not be on the street if the case is still being investigated.“We're still searching for the truth, and all this community wants is the truth,” Edwards said.Some of the ministers are part of a group called Getting to the Heart of the Matter, which has worked with the police department and Chief Rick Smith to bridge a divide with minority communities since social justice protests broke out last summer, while other community activists have criticized the force and called for Smith to resign or be fired.Cleaver said Kansas City has a serious disconnect between the police and the community, particularly minority communities. He said the videos were given to the ministers and activists, rather than to investigators, because the community does not trust police.“If you look at the disconnect, the distrust, between KCPD and the community you have to of course look at it from the head,” Cleaver said. “I think, in order to change the narrative, in order to change this ongoing problem, we have to start with the top and then work our way down. That's the only way we're going to bring about change and bring the community and law enforcement together, which is the sign of a happy and healthy city.”The ministers first questioned the shooting on Tuesday, when they released a different video that showed two officers with guns drawn entering the store and trying to arrest Johnson, who appears to try and run before being taken down by officers. The struggle moved out of the camera angle before Johnson was shot.After meeting with patrol officials on Wednesday, the ministers expressed more confidence in the investigation but the new video raised new questions.Sheryl Ferguson, a Kansas City organizer with It's Time 4 Justice, said both videos showed Johnson's feet were to the side, or facing down and she could not believe that he was so combative that five officers could not contain him.“I would think that I was looking at a replication of George Floyd, wouldn't you,” She said. “I would think that I was looking at someone that was working to save his life, wouldn't you?”Floyd died last year after former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for about 9 ½ minutes. Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said Thursday that her office has received the videos and is analyzing the information. The office is also evaluating its processes to find ways to engage with the community to gain “these necessary facts” in the investigation.“A part of our review will be an evaluation of any discrepancies between the original accounting of this event and the actual evidence, including any video evidence,” Peters Baker said in a statement.The Kansas City police department has referred questions to the highway patrol. Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman Andy Bell said Thursday the department could not comment on an ongoing investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/videos-contradict-us-police-version-of-fatal-shooting-of-kansas-city-man-101622882737875.html

We are grateful for the continuous support, ongoing initiatives and generosity of our members in helping the people of India”.The statement also noted though in the last few weeks, infection rates were “starting to decline across many states as vaccination rates are increasing rapidly”, there were still “many areas” that are “experiencing devastating case loads and are still in crisis mode”.Given those circumstances, C-IBC “is continuing to support relief efforts in supporting the people of India”.C-IBC’s president Victor Thomas said that it was very heartening that Canadian companies operating in the “India-Canada economic corridor stepped up and have been very supportive”.Funds were donated primarily through the Canadian Red Cross, while some companies sent medical supplies that were immediately required during the crisis. While major Canadian pension funds, which have heavily invested in India’s infrastructure sector, could not contribute directly due to their charters, they undertook matching grants programmes based on contributions from their employees.Thomas said the cumulative contribution was “not insignificant” and Canadian companies wanted to send out the message, “we’re there and we’re supportive” in the context of doing their bit to assist India during a critical phase.According to C-IBC the donations have “helped set up temporary Covid-19 hospitals, supply hospital beds, medical oxygen, lifesaving medicine, provide personal protective equipment (PPE), emergency care for migrants, and implement infection control activities in communities across India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firms-contribute-rs-354cr-for-india-s-covid-fight-101622871683378.html
05-06-2021||World||Health authorities call to speed up second dose of Covid vaccination in Canada||Alarmed over the possibility of an increase in transmissibility of the Delta variant of Covid-19, Canadian health authorities are calling for acceleration of administration of second doses of vaccines, particularly to those in communities considered most at risk.“The Delta variant or B.1.617 has been detected essentially across Canada,” Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said on Friday, according to the agency Canadian Press.The Public Health Agency of Canada or PHAC believes the variant, which was first detected in India, is “at least 50% more transmissible” than the original coronavirus which originated in China, according to a statement released by Tam on Thursday. And, it also stated that the four major variants of concern “all have certain mutations in common, which may have an impact on vaccine effectiveness, although the evidence is still limited”.Therefore, Tam stressed on Friday it “is very important to get that second dose when variants” like Delta were present in the country.Surprisingly, despite being declared a variant of concern or VoC in mid-May, PHAC is yet to release any data on the extent of the spread of the B.1.617 variant in Canada, while it provides daily updates on the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants.However, Tam said that in the “context of a transmissible variant, that variant could well takeoff and replace other viruses in the communities”.That alert was sounded earlier this week by Dr Lawrence Loh, medical officer of health in the Peel Region of Ontario, as he said during a press interaction: “B.1.617 is quickly replacing B.1.1.7, which was the Alpha variant originally detected in the UK and which drove our third wave across Brampton and the region of Peel.” He warned the Delta variant could become the dominant strain in the region in a month and then across the province in a matter of weeks after that. Peel region comprises cities in the suburbs of Toronto and is among the most densely populated areas in the country.While less than seven per cent of Canadian have been fully vaccinated, Mayors within the Peel Region have called for quickening that pace because of the threat that the Delta variant could precipitate another wave of the pandemic even as the country is slowly emerging from a third wave.The National Advisory Committee on Immunisation or NACI’s guidelines state that second doses can be given up to four months after the first, but in an updated recommendation on May 28, it said “second doses should be offered as soon as possible, with priority given to those at highest risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 disease after or concurrent with first doses for all remaining eligible populations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-authorities-call-to-speed-up-second-dose-of-covid-vaccination-in-canada-101622869882663.html
05-06-2021||World||Environment day: Phase out carbon or lose out on contracts, UK tells businesses||Boris Johnson’s government told companies to publish their carbon reduction plans and commit to phasing out greenhouse gas emissions altogether by 2050, or lose out on large UK state contracts.Firms that haven’t committed to so-called net zero emissions or published a “clear and credible” carbon reduction plan by September won’t be allowed to bid for contracts worth more than 5 million pounds ($7.1 million) a year, the Cabinet Office said in an emailed statement.Johnson is seeking to position the UK as a leader in the battle against climate change as he carves out a post-Brexit identity for the nation, and Saturday’s announcement, timed for World Environment Day, means the government is using its 290 billion pounds of annual procurement to push businesses into swifter action to slash emissions.“It’s important we use this purchasing power to help transform our economy to net zero,” Minister for Efficiency and Transformation Theodore Agnew said. “Requiring companies to report and commit to reducing their carbon emissions before bidding for public work is a key part of our world-leading approach.”The UK hosts a major round of United Nations climate talks in Glasgow in November, and Johnson has unveiled a succession of ever-more ambitious targets in an effort to spur international and domestic action.The UK has a legally-binding goal to phase out net emissions by 2050, and Johnson has announced interim plans to reduce them by 68% by 2030 and 78% by 2035, from 1990 levels -- the most ambitious targets among major economies.The announcement also adds to government efforts to spur action from business, after Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in November said the UK would compel large companies and financial institutions to report their climate risks by 2025. It’s a measure he’s pushing other major economies to adopt at a two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations that concludes on Saturday.The latest proposals require firms to publish a carbon reduction plan setting out where their emissions come from, and any environmental management measures they have in place.They’ll be required to publish so-called Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, encompassing their direct emissions and those from the power they consume. They’ll also have to include reporting of some Scope 3 emissions taking in their wider footprint -- including business travel, employee commuting, transportation, distribution and waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/environment-day-phase-out-carbon-or-lose-out-on-contracts-uk-tells-businesses-101622855846592.html
05-06-2021||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un appears in public for the first time in month||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first public appearance in about a month, with state media showing him at a Party meeting that discussed ways to improve the country’s deteriorating economy.Kim, wearing his signature black Mao suit, said it was time to take “additional state measures for solving pending problems urgent for the economic work and people’s living,” according to official Korean Central News Agency Saturday. A plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Party will be held in early June, KCNA said.Kim also reviewed the “execution of major policy tasks in different fields” in the meeting, the state media said.North Korea’s economy has shown little sign of growth this year after its worst contraction in decades as it continues to struggle with the pandemic, US sanctions and a lack of trade with China.Kim’s last public appearance was on May 6, when he posed for a photograph after a gathering for military families, according to NK News, a web site that focuses on North Korean news. Before that he had failed for the first time to appear for events, following a political congress in Pyongyang, it said.State MattersThe latest absence could be part of Kim’s plans to avoid Covid-19, NK News said. He could have been attending to state matters or vacationing at his coastal mansion, where satellite imagery indicates an increase of activity in the area, it said.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the reclusive state, known only to a few people in the country’s most powerful inner circle.Being overweight and a chain smoker, Kim, 37, has been the subject of health speculation for years. His longest absence from the public eye was six weeks in 2014. When he did appear, he was walking with a cane, raising speculation that he could be suffering from gout.Periods of prolonged absences have become a bit more frequent for Kim since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. NK News said the current break is his seventh since 2020.North Korea, which was quick to shut its borders, could find its antiquated and underfunded medical system overwhelmed by an outbreak of the coronavirus. Pyongyang has said it has had no recorded cases of Covid 19, a claim doubted by officials in the U.S. and Japan.Kim is thought to have three children, the oldest about 11 years old. With no clear successor, the leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is seen by the outside world as a possible candidate to take over should something happen to her brother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-appears-in-public-for-the-first-time-in-month-101622855858571.html
05-06-2021||World||Microsoft says error led to Bing blocking images of Tiananmen 'tank man'||Microsoft Corp on Friday blamed "accidental human error" for its Bing search engine not showing image results for the query "tank man" in the United States and elsewhere after users raised concerns about possible censorship around the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary.Users, including in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore, reported Friday that when they performed the search Bing returned the message, "There are no results for tank man."David Greene, civil liberties director at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and "egregious mistakes are made all the time."But he said it could be more sinister: "At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state."Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the "tank man" search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world."Tank man" is often used to describe an unidentified person famously pictured standing before tanks in China's Tiananmen Square during pro-democracy demonstrations in June 1989.Microsoft said the issue was "due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this."Smaller search engines such as DuckDuckGo that license results from Microsoft faced similar issues around "tank man" searches and said they expected a fix soon.Rival Google showed many results for the famous image when the "tank man" search was performed on Friday.A significant percentage of the Microsoft employees who work on Bing are based in China, including some who work on image-recognition software, according to a former employee.China is known to require search engines operating in its jurisdiction to censor results, but those restrictions are rarely applied elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-says-error-led-to-bing-blocking-images-of-tiananmen-tank-man-101622854343520.html
05-06-2021||World||No obligation to pay for workers' Covid screening time: Amazon||Amazon.com Services LLC has no obligation to pay fulfillment center workers for time spent undergoing mandatory Covid-19 screenings, which benefits the public in general, the company says in a motion to dismiss a would-be class action filed in the Eastern District of California.The required screenings, conducted in accordance with government regulations and guidance—not just for employees but for all visitors—aren’t compensable “work” under the Fair Labor Standards Act because they aren’t primarily for Amazon’s benefit, the Thursday motion says. According to Amazon, the screenings benefit everyone, and its benefit is merely incidental.Even if considered work-related, the pre-shift health screenings are “preliminary” to their principle activities, Amazon argues, likening them to the security screenings the U.S. Supreme Court found not compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act in Integrity Staffing Sols. Inc. v. Busk.Amazon acknowledges an informal FAQ published by the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division states that for certain employees, “a temperature check before they begin work must be paid because it is necessary for their jobs.”But according to Amazon, although the screenings may be necessary for patient-facing health-oriented jobs, it isn’t needed for its warehouse associates, and the guidance isn’t entitled to a high-degree of deference in any event.The plaintiffs also fail to allege that the “screenings themselves take any appreciable amount of time,” Amazon says. Waiting time is clearly not compensable, the company says, but the plaintiffs’ 10 to 15 minute estimates collapsed the screening and wait time together.Amazon advances similar arguments to challenge the plaintiffs’ claims for unpaid wages and overtime under state law.Amazon distinguishes Frlekin v. Apple Inc., where a California court found time spent in security screenings compensable under the state’s laws.First, the security screenings were implemented to prevent theft and were, as a result, primarily intended for the benefit for the employer, Amazon says. And second, the employees weren’t permitted to leave the work until the screenings were complete and were subject to a higher degree of intrusion and control, it adds.Amazon says the plaintiffs additional claims related to inaccurate wage statements and payment of wages owed upon discharge fail because, among other things, they are derivative of the other non-viable claims.The case is in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California.Amazon is represented by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Plaintiffs are represented by Hodges & Foty LLP and Parmet PC.The case is Boone v. Amazon.com Services LLC, E.D. Cal., No. 1:21-cv-00241, motion to dismiss 6/3/21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-obligation-to-pay-for-workers-covid-screening-time-amazon-101622853196431.html
05-06-2021||World||Alaska man, charged in US Capitol riots, avoids house arrest||A federal magistrate on Friday declined to order house arrest for a far-right internet troll charged in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol after court officials raised concerns about his recent encounters with police officers in Arizona.U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey warned Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet that he acted dangerously and “came close to committing crimes" while he videotaped himself arguing with a drunken friend and calling police twice. But the magistrate ultimately concluded that Gionet didn't violate any conditions of his pretrial release.Gionet grew up in Anchorage, Alaska and had grown well known in right-wing politics through his social media appearances.Gionet was arrested 10 days after the riot in Washington, D.C. He is charged with violent and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds and knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority.After his arrest in Houston, Gionet initially was ordered to submit to electronic location monitoring, but the court lifted that condition of his release on March 31.On Jan. 6, Gionet streamed live video that showed himself inside the Capitol and encouraging other protesters to stay. Investigators say Gionet also profanely called an officer an “oathbreaker” and chanted, “Whose house? Our house!”His lawyer has said he only went to Washington to film what happened.he Justice Department has arrested about 465 people in nearly all 50 states - an average of about three defendants arrested every single day, including weekends, since January 6th. Marine Corps officer, Christopher Warnagiris, the first active-duty service member arrested in the insurrection, was indicted Thursday on nine charges including assaulting an officer.In Gionet's case, a pretrial services officer had recommended imposing home detention and banning Gionet from posting videos to social media or other video sharing platforms. A federal prosecutor concurred with the recommendations.Harvey rejected both recommendations, but chided Gionet for “baiting” his friend into fighting in a moving car.“You knew what you were doing, putting the camera in his face,” he said. “You wanted to get a rise out of him, and you did.”A video of Gionet's contact with law enforcement in Arizona on May 26 was posted on YouTube, according to a pretrial services report. Gionet apparently called police that evening to report that a friend and fellow “YouTuber” had assaulted him, federal prosecutors said in a court filing.After officers arrived, Gionet agreed to take his friend home. When the friend became belligerent in the car, Gionet called police again and was “somewhat uncooperative” with the second set of officers who respond, prosecutors said."He also appears to threaten his friend," they wrote.Defense attorney Zachary Thornley said Gionet didn't break any laws or violate any conditions of his release.“I really don't know why we're all here today,” he said during a remote hearing Friday.“We're all here because your client recorded all of this and put it up on YouTube, which a smart person might wonder if that's what you should be doing while you're under court supervision,” the magistrate countered.Prosecutors say the video appears to be a money-making vehicle for Gionet, a social media personality who was listed as one of the speakers at the white nationalist “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in violence in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alaska-man-charged-in-us-capitol-riots-avoids-house-arrest-101622851592713.html
05-06-2021||World||India likely to get large share of US jabs: Envoy||India is expected to get possibly the largest share of the 25 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that the US on Thursday announced it will send to partners countries and those in need of them to deal with ongoing surges.India figures in two categories of prospective recipient countries.Out of the 25 million doses, 19 million will go through Covax, the WHO-led initiative for global equitable distribution, to countries earmarked by the US. Of this, 7 million will go to Asia, including India and 15 other countries, according to a fact sheet issued by the White House.India also figures on a list of recipient countries described by the US as “regional partners and partner recipients”, which also include Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Georgia and Gaza — 7 million doses have been set aside for this group.India did not feature in the first fact sheet, leading to some confusion, because it was in statement issued by President Joe Biden. An updated fact sheet has India in this category as well. No country-specific numbers have been released by the US.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US, told PTI: “India will be a significant recipient of US vaccines as India has been included in both the identified categories in the allocation announced today- direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the Covax initiative.”“The vaccine allocation announcement by US and telephone call between PM and VP Kamala Harris reflect the firm commitment of the leadership of both India and US to work in partnership on global issues,” the Ambassador later told HT.President Biden has pledged to share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines countries that need them — 60 million of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which the US doesn’t intend to use, and 20 million of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — by the end of June.The Biden administration announced the allocation plan for 25 million of 80 million on Thursday, promising, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said, “the United States will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries”. It was a thinly disguised shot at Russia and China, who, the Americans say, have distributed vaccines seeking to advance their own interests.The White House also announced it was lifting restrictions invoked under the Defense Production Act that will allow sharing of raw materials needed for the AstraZeneca, as well as Sanofi and Novavax vaccines, which are also not authorised in the US.“The removal of the Defence Production Act priority ratings would further strengthen vaccine supply chains including for manufacturers AstraZeneca and Novavax,” Sandhu said.Sandhu, on Thursday, also had a discussion with US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy. “We discussed India US cooperation to contain the global pandemic, including in vaccines, and potential collaborations to ensure affordable health care,” the Ambassador said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-get-large-share-of-us-jabs-envoy-101622844581102.html
