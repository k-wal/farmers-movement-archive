Iran says its legal system is independent and not influenced by political interests."Raisi is a pillar of a system that jails, tortures, and kills people for daring to criticize state policies,” said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), in a statement.Iran denies it tortures prisoners.A mid-ranking figure in the hierarchy of Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim clergy, Raisi has been a senior judiciary official for most of his career. He served as deputy head of the judiciary for 10 years, before being appointed prosecutor-general in 2014.Gaining a reputation as a feared security hawk, he was one of four judges who oversaw executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988, rights groups say. Amnesty International has put the number executed at around 5,000, saying in a 2018 report that "the real number could be higher".SUPPORT FOR IRAN TALKSThe CHRI said that those executed were "buried in unmarked mass and individual graves, based on the committee’s determination of their 'loyalty' to the newly established Islamic Republic. These prisoners had already been tried and were serving their issued prison sentences".Iran has never acknowledged the mass executions. However, some clerics have said the trials of the prisoners were fair, and those judges involved should be rewarded for eliminating the armed opposition in the revolution's early years. Raisi himself has never publicly addressed allegations about his role.In 2020, U.N. human rights experts called for accountability over the 1988 deaths, warning "the situation may amount to crimes against humanity” if the Iranian government continued to refuse to hold responsible those involved.The United States imposed sanctions on Raisi in 2019 for human rights violations, including the 1980s executions and his part in the suppression of unrest in 2009.Raisi, who lost to pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani in 2017, offered no detailed political or economic programme during his election campaign, while wooing lower-income Iranians by promising to ease unemployment.However, by promising not to "waste a single moment" in removing U.S. sanctions, Raisi signalled his support for talks with world powers aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear deal.A Raisi presidency will strengthen Khamenei's hand at home, and rights activists fear it could usher in more repression."He would not have registered as a candidate if his chances were not all but certain, and Raisi's decision to register would have almost certainly been guided by Khamenei himself," said Kasra Aarabi, a senior analyst on Iran & Shia Islamist Extremism at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. NEXT SUPREME LEADER? With the rejection of prominent moderate and conservative candidates by a hardline vetting body, voters had a choice only between hardliners and low-key moderates in the election. Turnout was, as expected, a record low amid rising anger over economic hardship and curbs on personal freedoms."By taking its exclusionary strategies to a new height, the Guardian Council has left no space for surprise," said Ali Vaez, senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. An election win would increase Raisi's chances of succeeding Khamenei, who himself served two terms as president before becoming supreme leader upon founder of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 death, analysts said before Friday's vote."Raisi is someone that Khamenei trusts ... Raisi can protect the supreme leader's legacy," said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program.Born in 1960 to a religious family in Iran's holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Mashhad, Raisi was active in the 1979 revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah and continues to proclaim his fidelity to the "fundamental values" of Khamenei."The deep state is willing to go as far as undermining one of its pillars of legitimacy to ensure that Ayatollah Khamenei's vision for the revolution's future survives him when Raisi takes over the Supreme Leader's mantle," said Vaez.Vaez was referring to the republican pillar of Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule. Critics say the hardline election body's rejection of leading moderate and conservative hopefuls to enter the election race has cleared the way for tyranny, a charge Iranian authorities deny.(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-ebrahim-raisi-all-you-need-to-know-about-iran-s-new-likely-chief-101624126681498.html

19-06-2021||World||Myanmar rejects UN resolution urging arms embargo after military coup||Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday rejected a UN General Assembly resolution calling for an arms embargo against the Southeast Asian nation and condemning the military's February seizure of power.Myanmar described the resolution, which passed Friday and is not legally binding, as being “based on one-sided sweeping allegations and false assumptions.” The statement issued in the capital Naypyitaw said the Foreign Ministry had sent letters of objection to the UN secretary-general and the General Assembly's president.The resolution reflected a broad international consensus condemning the takeover that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government. It called on the military junta to restore the country’s democratic transition, condemned its “excessive and lethal violence” since the takeover and called on all countries “to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar.”The resolution also called on Myanmar's armed forces to immediately and unconditionally release Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other officials and politicians detained after the coup, as well as “all those who have been arbitrarily detained, charged or arrested.”″The measure was approved with 119 countries voting “yes,” Belarus — a major arms supplier to Myanmar — voting “no” and 36 countries abstaining, including Myanmar’s neighbors China and India, along with Russia.Myanmar’s UN Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who in February denounced the military takeover, voted “yes” and urged the international community “to take the strongest possible action to immediately end the military coup.”The Foreign Ministry statement said it considers Kyaw Moe Tun as having been dismissed from his position and noted that he has been charged with treason in Myanmar.“Accordingly, his statement, participation and action in the meeting are illegitimate and unacceptable and Myanmar strongly rejects his participation and statements,” it said.“While Myanmar embraces constructive advice by the international community in addressing the challenges that Myanmar is facing, any attempt infringing on the state sovereignty and interference in the internal affairs of Myanmar will not be accepted,” said the statement.The more powerful UN Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, has adopted several statements on Myanmar, including condemning the use of violence against peaceful protesters, calling on the military to restore the democratic transition and “exercise utmost restraint” and “on all sides to refrain from violence.”But it has never been able to condemn the coup or authorize an arms embargo or other sanctions because of an almost-certain veto by China, and possibly Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-rejects-un-resolution-urging-arms-embargo-after-military-coup-101624122205870.html

The price of a small packet of black tea has gone up to $70 ( ₹5,167) while one kilogram of banana costs $45 ( ₹3,336 approx). According to NK News, a bottle of shampoo is selling at $200 in Pyongyang.Rice and fuel prices have remained stable while the prices of imported products like sugar, soybean oil and flour have skyrocketed. In the four-day meeting of the ruling party, which ended on June 19, Kim admitted the crisis and swore to find a redressal to the situation.According to CNN, the depth of the crisis remains unknown as North Korea has not disclosed the scale of the shortage, but quoting the Food and Agriculture Organization's estimate, CNN said that the country is short of approximately 860,000 tons of food which is equivalent to over two months of national supply.The crisis started during winter of 2020 and 2021, which was a fallout of the decrease in the import owing to the pandemic. In May, it was reported that the farmers were asked to donate two litres of their urine daily to make fertiliser as for fertiliser the country is dependent on China. And the borders have been closed and trade remains suspended owing to the pandemic.In April, Kim was reported to have asked his officials to prepare for an "Arduous March", a term related to North Korea's devastating famine in the early 1990s. Only this time, it would be more difficult, Kim was believed to have said to his officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-packet-of-coffee-in-kim-jong-un-s-north-korea-costs-100-report-101624120363511.html

Major had to be briefly removed from the premises after two incidents of nipping staff on White House grounds.The arrival of Champ and Major marked the return of pets to the White House after a four-year hiatus under former President Donald Trump. Champ lived with the Bidens when the current president served as vice president under Barack Obama, and spent his days, "chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory."“Even as Champ’s strength waned in his last months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up, his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly rub,” the Bidens said.“In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and will miss him always,” they added.(With agency input)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-beloved-german-shepherd-champ-dies-president-first-lady-pay-tribute-101624119516516.html
19-06-2021||World||Many Brazilians insist on hard-to-find Pfizer, hesitant to Sinovac, AstraZeneca||Brazil is approaching half a million Covid deaths, a toll second only to the U.S. that shows few signs of easing. Yet residents are spurning vaccines that they believe are substandard in favor of hard-to-find shots from Pfizer Inc.In Sao Paulo, people demand the U.S. company’s shots at public clinics and often walk out if none are available. Some health-care centers have put up signs saying “no Pfizer shots” to save time. Many vaccination centers are empty, and the few that have Pfizer have massive lines.Maressa Tavares, a 29-year-old teacher, could have gotten her shot two weeks ago in Rio de Janeiro. But at the request of her father, she’s holding out for Pfizer. “For me, it didn’t make a lot of difference which one to take, but my father has very strong beliefs,” she said.Such reluctance is hobbling a vaccination campaign already plagued by shortages and delays. Failure to control the disease would harm not only Brazilians, who are dying at the rate of about 2,000 a day, but also threaten a global resurgence of the pandemic if the nation of 213 million becomes a breeding ground for new strains.China’s Sinovac and England’s AstraZeneca Plc account for about 96% of shots available in the country, compared with just 4% for Pfizer, according to government data.While doctors say residents should get any shot available, Sinovac’s CoronaVac has a far lower efficacy rate than other vaccines, and President Jair Bolsonaro bashed its “origin” and initially refused to buy it. Astra saw its usage suffer worldwide thanks to rare blood clots, side effects and a still-pending approval in the U.S.“At first, people were afraid to get CoronaVac, because it’s Chinese, and now it’s Astra because of the reactions,” said Luiz Carlos de Souza e Silva, a nurse who helps immunize people at a public clinic in Rio. “People are really misinformed, the government took too long to come up with a vaccination plan, that creates a lot of fear.”Hesitancy isn’t uniquely Brazilian. Amesh Adalja, who studies pandemics at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, said it has existed ever since the smallpox vaccine was created in 1796. More than two centuries later, U.S. officials have promised everything from french fries to lottery prizes to persuade people. In Europe, Astra usage stalled after the blood-clot reports, and Uruguay even threw away doses.But nowhere are vaccines needed more than Brazil. The country has given out more than 86 million shots, but that covers less than 30% of the population with a first dose and just 12% with two, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adalja said misinformation on social media, combined with “denial from the highest levels of the government,” have hindered Brazil’s campaign.If the virus continues to spread unchecked, Adalja said, new variants may emerge. Many have already appeared, including the highly contagious gamma, which was first documented in Brazil in November and has since spread to 64 countries. Vaccines appear effective against these variants, but countries with low vaccination rates could plunge deeper into crisis.In Brazil, contagion remains high -- and could worsen as winter arrives in the Southern Hemisphere. Some cities and states are reinstating lockdowns, but after some 15 months of slap-dash quarantines, such measures have become less effective.“The virus is circulating like crazy, a lot of people are infected, few are vaccinated, and mostly just with first doses,” said Atila Iamarino, a biologist educated at the University of Sao Paulo and Yale who specializes in virology. “Opting to wait for this or that vaccine is extremely dangerous.”The government began an organization campaign to push vaccination and masks only in May, more than a year after the virus arrived. Bolsonaro has minimized the crisis throughout. In the past week alone, he was the star of a motorcycle rally in his honor in Sao Paulo, criticized lockdowns and ordered the health ministry to study making masks optional.Unlike the U.S., which earlier bet on several vaccines, Brazil opted to buy only Astra, which has an efficacy rate of about 63% against symptomatic disease. After delays, governors and mayors sought contracts of their own. As options ran out, the government finally struck an agreement for CoronaVac, a shot with an efficacy rate of about 51% that Bolsonaro has publicly disavowed several times.After being criticized during a congressional probe for not buying 95%-effective Pfizer vaccines, the president has begun to highlight arrivals of new batches -- though he still questions the science behind them. He said Thursday that getting sick is a more effective way of protection, and has yet to get a shot himself.Experts say that even less effective shots are well worth taking, but Bolsonaro’s mistrust is reflected among his supporters. Edilson Pessanha, father of Maressa Tavares, delayed his immunization about three months until he could get the U.S. vaccine. He said he feared CoronaVac.“People prefer excellence,” the 62-year-old farmer said. “I research and want what’s best for me, what’s best for our country, which is what’s happening. Bolsonaro is doing what’s best for us.”Natalia Pasternak, a microbiologist who’s become a vocal critic of the government’s handling of the pandemic and testified before Congress, calls such people “vaccine sommeliers.”“It’s the government’s job to tell people they shouldn’t be cherry-picking, they’re all effective and the ‘good’ one is any you take,” Pasternak said in an interview.Still, the pace has picked up recently. After a sharp drop in May, the average number of daily doses given has climbed to about 984,000 in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The progress has made markets more optimistic for the outlook for Latin America’s largest economy, sending stocks soaring. More doses are expected to arrive in the second half of the year.But for now, experts see Brazil stuck as the virus rages. With more than 17 million confirmed cases, the country ranks third in infections, trailing the U.S. and India. It’s second in deaths, about 1,500 shy of 500,000 less than two months after crossing the 400,000 mark.Fiocruz, an institution that monitors the disease, called the situation “critical” in a Thursday report. It said the average age of deaths has dropped below 60 for the first time, months after similar moves in cases and hospitalizations. Now, more than half of deaths occur in those between 20 and 59 years.“It’s absurd that we look at these numbers of daily deaths and think it’s OK -- this isn’t OK,” Pasternak said. “A lot of people are seeing other countries going back to normal, and believe we’re also there, but clearly that’s not the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-brazilians-insist-on-hard-to-find-pfizer-hesitant-to-sinovac-astrazeneca-101624107019709.html
19-06-2021||World||'Crying and begging': Afghanistan running out of oxygen as Covid surge worsens||Afghanistan's is racing to ramp up supplies of oxygen as a deadly third surge of Covid-19 worsens, a senior health official told The Associated Press in an interview Saturday.The government is installing oxygen supply plants in 10 provinces where up to 65% of those tested in some areas are Covid positive, health ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigir Nazari said.By WHO recommendations, anything higher than 5% shows officials aren’t testing widely enough, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.By WHO recommendations, anything higher than 5% shows officials aren’t testing widely enough, allowing the virus to spread unchecked. Afghanistan carries out barely 4,000 tests a day and often much less.Afghanistan's 24-hour infection count has also continued its upward climb from 1,500 at the end of May when the health ministry was already calling the surge “a crisis,” to more than 2,300 this week. Since the pandemic outbreak, Afghanistan is reporting 101,906 positive cases and 4,122 deaths. But those figures are likely a massive undercount, registering only deaths in hospitals — not the far greater numbers who die at home.Meanwhile, Afghanistan received 900 oxygen cylinders from Iran on Saturday, part of 3,800 cylinders Tehran promised to deliver to Kabul last week. The shipment was delayed by Iran's presidential elections, said Nazari.Afghanistan has even run out of empty cylinders, receiving a delivery of 1,000 last week from Uzbekistan.Meanwhile hospitals are rationing their oxygen supplies. Afghans desperate for oxygen are banging on the doors of the few oxygen suppliers in the Afghan capital, begging for their empty cylinders to be filled for Covid infected loved ones at home.Abdul Wasi, whose wife has been sick for nearly 10 days, has been waiting four days for one 45-liter cylinder to be filled at the Najb Siddiqi oxygen plant in east Kabul. Scores of mostly men were banging on the 10-foot steel gate of the oxygen plant. Some rolled their empty oxygen cylinders up against the gate, while others waved small slips of paper carrying the number of their cylinder inside the plant, waiting to be filled.Wasi said there were no hospital beds for his wife, whose oxygen level hovers around 70-80%. They are rationing her, he said giving her small amounts of oxygen when it drops to around 45 -50%.“How can I do anything else? I have been waiting four days for my cylinder to be filled,” he said. The oxygen plant refills cylinders for 400 Afghanis (roughly $5), while in the market it costs 4,000 Afghanis (roughly $50).For the country’s poor — over half of Afghanistan 36 million people according to World Bank figures — the situation has become desperate.Wasi said on Friday as he waited outside the oxygen plant that a patient on a stretcher was carried to the door while the family begged for oxygen. The patient died.“Right there,” he said pointing to the gate. “I saw them carrying the patient. They were crying and begging and then he died.”Barat Ali had arrived at the plant at 6 a.m. Saturday. It was his third day waiting for his cylinder to be filled.“The poor people in this country have nothing. I have been standing in the sun for eight hours,” he said clutching his small piece of paper that contained his cylinder number. The government “has eaten all the (international) donations.”Necephor Mghendi, who is the Afghanistan delegation head for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the AP in an interview in Kabul that the groups are working to get an oxygen generation plant into the country. The Afghan Red Crescent runs a 50-bed hospital devoted to Covid patients and uses roughly 250 cylinders a day, but in recent days it has been receiving barely half that many.The needs are critical he said, offering as an example one patient currently at the Red Crescent hospital who needs one 45-litre cylinder every 15 minutes to stay alive, he said.“The situation is very concerning,” he said.Inside the Najib Siddiqi oxygen plant dozens of cylinders were being filled, but owner Najib Siddiqi said he can’t keep up. He supplies hospitals but has cut output to them by half, with the other half going to the crowds banging on his gates. He even fills smaller cylinders for free, but he has only the capacity to fill 450-500 cylinders a day.“It’s not enough. They are outside like this all day,” he said.Sakhi Ahmad Payman, chairman of the Afghanistan Chamber of Industries and Mines, who was inside the plant having made a tour of the oxygen plants in the city, said all nine facilities in Kabul were overwhelmed. Countrywide he said Afghanistan has 30 oxygen producing plants, and all are unable to keep up with demand.Payman blasted the government.“They knew we were in the middle of a crisis and didn’t do anything until it was too late,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crying-and-begging-afghanistan-running-out-of-oxygen-as-covid-surge-worsens-101624116051803.html
19-06-2021||World||Brazil inches close to half a million Covid-19 deaths, second worst-hit globally||Already battered by the delayed vaccination campaign and the government's staunch opposition to social distancing measures, Brazil is expected to cross the grim milestone of at least half a million deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19). As of Friday, Brazil has registered 498,499 deaths and a total of 17,801,462 confirmed Covid-19 cases, according to the official data. Brazil continues to be the second worst-hit nation globally - second after the United States. In the last week, Brazil saw 2,000 deaths per day on average.Adding to Brazil's woes, the slow-paced vaccination campaign has seen only 11% of Brazilians fully vaccinated. The crisis, experts say, may worsen with the winter arriving in the southern hemisphere and new variants of the coronavirus circulating, deaths will continue to mount even if immunizations gain steam.The virus-driven crisis is far from over for the Americas as officials recorded 1.1 million new cases and 31,000 deaths in the last week. Six Mexican states - Belize, Guatemala, Panama and parts of the Caribbean continue to see a surge. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has warned that Colombia's Covid-19 situation is at its worst point yet, with intensive care unit beds filled in major cities.As seen with several nations battling the viral disease, experts suggest that the deaths in Brazil are not going to slow down before they reach close to a million. "I think we are going to reach 700,000 or 800,000 deaths before we get to see the effects of vaccination," Gonzalo Vecina, former head of Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, was quoted a saying by Reuters. "We are experiencing the arrival of these new variants and the Indian variant will send us for a loop," Vecina said, predicting a near-term acceleration in fatalities.The former health official criticized far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic, including the lack of a coordinated national response and his skepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen.Raphael Guimaraes, a researcher at the Brazilian biomedical center Fiocruz pointed out the downfall of the delayed vaccination programme. Guimaraes said the full effects of the inoculation drive would not be felt until September or later.Brazil could revisit scenes from the worst of its March-April peak when the country averaged 3,000 deaths per day, he warned. "We are still in an extremely critical situation, with very high transmission rates and hospital bed occupancy that is still critical in many places," he said.This week, new confirmed cases in Brazil accelerated to more than 70,000 per day on average, edging past India for the most in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-inches-close-to-half-a-million-covid-19-deaths-second-worst-hit-globally-101624112171831.html
19-06-2021||World||Putin promises billions of Russian rubles in spending ahead of polls||President Vladimir Putin proposed Saturday at his United Russia party congress billons of rubles in spending ahead of September parliamentary polls that could see the deeply unpopular party struggle.Addressing several hundred of his mostly mask-wearing and socially-distanced loyalists in a Moscow convention centre as the capital set a pandemic high for new Covid cases for the second straight day, Putin proposed deploying billions towards social support.This included 50 billion rubles ($687 million) on public transport, 30 billion rubles for repairing roads and 20 billion rubles to clean up rivers, among other spending projects on infrastructure and healthcare."The program of the party of the leader has to be the program of the people," the 68-year-old Kremlin chief said in a speech broadcast on state television.He also said the state would be allocating payments and new forms of support for families starting next month."Our task is to significantly increase the prosperity of Russian families and the incomes of our citizens," Putin said.The gathering, which determines the ruling party's candidates and electoral platform for September's lower house of parliament vote, comes after the party has seen support tumble in recent years amid economic stagnation, entrenched corruption and widespread voter fatigue.On Friday, state-run pollster VTsIOM published a survey showing that 30 percent of voters support United Russia -- a 10-point drop from the last lower house State Duma elections in 2016.Navalny neutralisedBut the party, which controls a majority of the State Duma, is projecting calm."It is a good base of support that can be further increased during the election campaign," party chairman and former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said at the start of the month.Putin, who came to power in 2000, himself boasts much higher support than his party with an approval rating of 61.5 percent, according to VTsIOM.The pollster also predicts that three opposition parties that are seen as doing the Kremlin's bidding -- the nationalist LDPR, the Communists and A Just Russia -- will garner around 30 percent of the vote.Further buoying the Kremlin's prospects in September is the recent dismantling of the movement of Russia's main opposition politician Alexei Navalny.Barring his organisations from working in the country, a Moscow court earlier this month branded them as "extremist", while Putin signed legislation outlawing staff, members and sponsors of "extremist" groups from running in parliamentary elections.Critics say the moves were aimed at ensuring that Navalny, who was jailed earlier this year for two-and-a-half years on old fraud charges he says are politically motivated, does not spoil September's vote for the Kremlin.Despite the clampdown, Navalny's allies are promoting his Smart Voting strategy that backs candidates best placed to defeat Kremlin-linked politicians -- a tactic that has seen United Russia lose a number of seats in recent local elections.'All opponents in prison'But less known opposition candidates that Smart Voting could help prop up have faced pressure too.Police this month have arrested at least two municipal lawmakers and one pro-democracy activist who had declared their intentions to run.Meanwhile, opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov fled to Ukraine after he said sources close to the Kremlin told him he would be arrested if he did not leave.Critics also claim that authorities will rig the vote in their favour in September.On Friday, Russia's elections chief announced the parliamentary polls would be staggered from September 17 to September 19 to limit the spread of coronavirus.Last summer, after authorities held a constitutional referendum over one week, independent election monitor Golos said it had received hundreds of complaints of violations including multiple voting and intimidation.The opposition said the multi-day nature of the referendum -- which paved the way for Putin to stay in power until 2036 -- gave election officials greater opportunities to fix the vote as the ballots were held overnight.At Saturday's congress, Putin told his party that they must make sure September's elections are conducted fairly and legally."Open battle and honest win, hello? You put all your opponents in prison," tweeted Navalny aide Georgy Alburov.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-promises-billions-of-russian-rubles-in-spending-ahead-of-polls-101624111470473.html
19-06-2021||World||Mystery of ‘see-through’ galaxy deepens after new Hubble observation: Nasa||The mystery behind the unusual “see-through” galaxy discovered using Nasa’s Hubble telescope has only deepened, the US space agency said on Friday. When astronomers first discovered the giant cosmic cotton ball, it looked like the galaxy didn’t have much dark matter, the invisible glue that makes up the bulk of the universe's matter.All galaxies, according to Nasa, appear to be dominated by dark matter and astronomers looked for a simpler explanation after they uncovered the oddball galaxy. In a Hubble Space Telescope snapshot of the galaxy, its ancient stars were so spread out that distant galaxies in the background could be seen through it.“So, finding a galaxy lacking the invisible stuff is an extraordinary claim that challenges conventional wisdom. It would have the potential to upset theories of galaxy formation and evolution,” Nasa said in a statement.The US space agency said that the ultra-diffuse galaxy, first reported in 2018, is almost as wide as the Milky Way but it “contains only 1/200th the number of stars as our galaxy.” The ghostly galaxy, named NGC 1052-DF2, or DF2, doesn't appear to have a noticeable central region, spiral arms, or a disk. Determining the amount of the galaxy's dark matter depends on accurate measurements of how far away it is from Earth."I think people were right to question it because it's such an unusual result. It would be nice if there were a simple explanation, like a wrong distance. But I think it's more fun and more interesting if it actually is a weird galaxy," said Pieter van Dokkum, lead researcher of the Hubble observations.Also Read | ‘Cosmic masterpiece’: New Nasa image shows ‘violent energy’ of Milky Way ‘downtown’To bolster their original finding, the researchers followed up their initial study. They observed about 5,400 ageing red giant stars using Hubble to calculate a more accurate distance to the galaxy. The red giant stars reach the same peak brightness, so they are reliable yardsticks to measure distances to galaxies.The researchers estimated that DF2 is 72 million light-years from Earth, which places the galaxy farther than the original Hubble 2018 estimate of 65 light-years distance. Nasa said that the distance measurement solidifies their claim that DF2 lacks dark matter. The galaxy contains at most 1/400th the amount of dark matter that the astronomers had expected.“So the mystery of why DF2 is missing most of its dark matter still persists,” Nasa added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-of-see-through-galaxy-deepens-after-new-hubble-observation-nasa-101624113258931.html

UK will now witness tough competition between the vaccines and the highly transmissible Delta variant, Professor Adam Finn, advisor on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JVCI) said on Saturday. On Friday, for the first time in four months, United Kingdom recorded 11,007 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, with the emergence of the Delta variant. The fresh surge has pushed the figure above 10,000 for the first time since late February.Pointing out the rise in cases, although at a slower pace, Professor Finn said, "It's going up, perhaps we can be a little bit optimistic it's not going up any faster, but nevertheless it's going up, so this third wave is definitely underway."UK will have to vaccinate its population fast against the deadly virus in order to prevent spike in infection and deaths, which implies the clock is ticking for the nation with the arrival of Delta variant. "We can conclude that the race is firmly on between the vaccine programme, particularly getting older people's second doses done, and the Delta variant third wave," Professor Fin said, reported PTI.Alongside, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said he was very confident that he would be able to lift remaining coronavirus restrictions on his new target date of July 19, based on the most recent data but was forced to delay the opening-up plan. "I am very confident that we'll be able to go through with step four of the roadmap on the timetable that I've set out with treating July 19, as I've said, as a terminus date," PM Johnson had said. The government has now delayed the planned lifting of remaining social and economic restrictions until July 19 amid a rise in cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant.As per the latest figures, around eight in 10 adults have received their first dose while more than half have had their second dose. The reliance on vaccine is seen a as vital in the fight against the highly transmissible Covid-19 variant. However, Professor Finn stated that he is not confident about the vaccine strategy defeating Delta variant. However, it may help the UK fight the outbreak in the third wave, he said. "No, I don't feel confident, but I think there's some grounds for optimism. The latest ONS [Office for National Statistics] figures continue to show a rise, but that rise has not accelerated quite as much as I'd feared over the last week,” he said."So, the race is on. The sooner we can get, particularly second doses, into older people, the less of a hospitalisation wave we'll see this time around. That's the critical thing, that's what's grounded us all in the past, and if we've managed to protect enough older people that we can avoid a great big surge of hospitalisations and deaths, then things will be able to move back towards normal," Professor Finn said. The latest ONS figures show that one in every 540 people is infected, with the Delta variant now the dominant strain of the deadly virus circulating in the country and accounting for almost all infections.Surge testing is being rolled out in further parts of England, including south London, to track the spread of the growing Delta variant.Britain has recorded almost 128,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-wave-of-covid-19-arrives-in-uk-says-expert-as-delta-variant-wreaks-havoc-101624105595519.html

Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots.The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna Inc vaccine will leave Memphis, Tennessee, on a flight belonging to Taiwan's China Airlines early on Saturday and arrive in Taipei on Sunday evening, the senior US administration official said, adding that the prompt delivery was due to experts from both sides being able to work out regulatory issues."We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions. We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of saving lives," the official said."Our vaccines do not come with strings attached," the official said, adding Taiwan had "faced unfair challenges in its efforts to acquire vaccines on the global marketplace."A deal for Taiwan to purchase vaccines from Germany's BioNTech SE fell through this year, with Taiwan's government blaming pressure from Beijing.China has denied the accusation, saying Taiwan is free to obtain the vaccines through Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd, which has a contract to sell BioNTech's vaccine in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan."We believe that these attempts by China to block purchases, for political purposes, are reprehensible," the senior Biden administration official said.Taiwan is trying to speed up the arrival of the millions of vaccines it has on order, although infections remain comparatively low despite a rise in domestic cases. Only around 6% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one shot of a vaccine regimen.The US shipment comes at a time when Washington has been working with Taipei to create secure supply chains for strategic items such as computer chips, of which Taiwan is a key producer, that are vital for US automobile manufacturers and other industries.It also comes after Taiwan announced on Friday that it will allow Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Taiwan's Foxconn and semiconductor giant TSMC, to negotiate on its behalf for Covid-19 vaccines.Jonathan Fritz, a senior State Department official, said on Thursday that China had been "very aggressively using vaccine donations as a lever to induce more of Taiwan's diplomatic partners to switch recognition."Beijing has steadily whittled down the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, which now stands at just 15 countries.The United States, which like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, has watched with alarm the stepped up tensions with Beijing and Biden's administration has vowed to boost ties with the island, which it is required under US law to supply with the means of defense.Earlier this week Taiwan reported the largest incursion yet by China's air force, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, into its air defense identification zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-triples-moderna-covid-vaccines-for-taiwan-with-2-5-million-dose-shipment-101624107047772.html
19-06-2021||World||Hit by a ransomware attack in US? Your payment may be tax deductible||As ransomware attacks surge, the FBI is doubling down on its guidance to affected businesses: Don't pay the cybercriminals. But the US government also offers a little-noticed incentive for those who do pay: The ransoms may be tax deductible.The IRS offers no formal guidance on ransomware payments, but multiple tax experts interviewed by The Associated Press said deductions are usually allowed under law and established guidance. It’s a “silver lining” to ransomware victims, as some tax lawyers and accountants put it.But those looking to discourage payments are less sanguine. They fear the deduction is a potentially problematic incentive that could entice businesses to pay ransoms against the advice of law enforcement. At a minimum, they say, the deductibility sends a discordant message to businesses under duress.“It seems a little incongruous to me,” said New York Rep. John Katko, the top Republican on the House Committee on Homeland Security.Deductibility is a piece of a bigger quandary stemming from the rise in ransomware attacks, in which cybercriminals scramble computer data and demand payment for unlocking the files. The government doesn’t want payments that fund criminal gangs and could encourage more attacks. But failing to pay can have devastating consequences for businesses and potentially for the economy overall.A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline last month led to gas shortages in parts of the United States. The company, which transports about 45% of fuel consumed on the East Coast, paid a ransom of 75 bitcoin — then valued at roughly $4.4 million. An attack on JBS SA, the world’s largest meat processing company, threatened to disrupt food supplies. The company said it had paid the equivalent of $11 million to hackers who broke into its computer system.Ransomware has become a multibillion-dollar business, and the average payment was more than $310,000 last year, up 171% from 2019, according to Palo Alto Networks.The companies that pay ransomware demands directly are well within their rights to claim a deduction, tax experts said. To be tax deductible, businesses expenses should be considered ordinary and necessary. Companies have long been able to deduct losses from more traditional crimes, such as robbery or embezzlement, and experts say ransomware payments are usually valid, too.“I would counsel a client to take a deduction for it,” says Scott Harty, a corporate tax attorney with Alston & Bird. “It fits the definition of an ordinary and necessary expense.”Don Williamson, a tax professor at the Kogod School of Business at American University, wrote a paper about the tax consequences of ransomware payments in 2017. Since then, he said, the rise of ransomware attacks has only strengthened the case for the IRS to allow ransomware payments as tax deductions.“It’s becoming more common, so therefore it becomes more ordinary,” he said.That’s all the more reason, critics say, to disallow ransomware payments as tax deductions.“The cheaper we make it to pay that ransom, then the more incentives we’re creating for companies to pay, and the more incentives we’re creating for companies to pay, the more incentive we’re creating for criminals to continue,” said Josephine Wolff, a cybersecurity policy professor at the Fletcher School of Tufts University.For years, ransomware was more of an economic nuisance than a major national threat. But attacks launched by foreign cybergangs out of reach of U.S. law enforcement have proliferated in scale over the past year and thrust the problem of ransomware onto the front pages.In response, top U.S. law enforcement officials have urged companies not to meet ransomware demands.“It is our policy, it is our guidance, from the FBI, that companies should not pay the ransom for a number of reasons,” FBI Director Christopher Wray testified this month before Congress. That message was echoed at another hearing this week by Eric Goldstein, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.Officials warn that payments lead to more ransomware attacks. “We’re in this boat we’re in now because over the last several years people have paid the ransom,” Stephen Nix, assistant to the special agent in charge at the U.S. Secret Service, said at a recent summit on cybersecurity.It's unclear how many companies that pay ransomware payments avail themselves of the tax deductions. When asked at a congressional hearing whether the company would pursue a tax deduction for the payment, Colonial CEO Joseph Blount said he was unaware that was a possibility.“Great question. I had no idea about that. Not aware of that at all,” he said.There are limits to the deduction. If the loss to the company is covered by cyber insurance — something that also is becoming more common — the company can’t take a deduction for the payment that’s made by the insurer.The number of active cyber insurance policies jumped from 2.2 million to 3.6 million from 2016 to 2019, a 60% increase, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ auditing arm. Linked to that was a 50% increase in insurance premiums paid, from $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion.The Biden administration has pledged to make curbing ransomware a priority in the wake of a series of high-profile intrusions and said it is reviewing the U.S. government’s policies related to ransomware. It has not provided any detail about what changes, if any, it may make related to the tax deductibility of ransomware.“The IRS is aware of this and looking into it,” said IRS spokesperson Robyn Walker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hit-by-a-ransomware-attack-in-us-your-payment-may-be-tax-deductible-101624103595847.html

The disease outbreak had erupted in the west African state on February 14. Marking the end of disease outbreak, WHO official Alfred Ki-Zerbo on Saturday said, "I have the honour of declaring the end of Ebola", reported news agency AFP. Zerbo was addressing a ceremony in the southeastern Nzerekore region where the disease surfaced at the end of January.In its first deadly wave in 2013-2016, the Ebola outbreak killed 11,300 people in West Africa's Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The country is set to announce an end to the Ebola epidemic in the West African state this weekend, the health minister Remy Lamah said on Saturday. Lamah, on Thursday, credited the speed of the health response for getting the outbreak under control.Lamy confirmed the viral epidemic will be declared over on Saturday -- barring the discovery of new cases. The health minister was addressing a webinar hosted by the WHO.The outbreak was officially confirmed in Guinea this year on February 14, sending waves of panic and reminders from the deadly first outbreak. Ebola is a highly contagious hemorrhagic fever that causes a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, generalized pain or malaise and in many cases internal and external bleeding.The disease is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.In the second wave, at least 16 people were infected by the disease and five died since February in Guinea, the WHO said. The disease is known to have made a comeback in the forested Nzerekore region in the southeast of the impoverished nation.New outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus disease in the two African countries are sending fresh jitters to Africa as the continent is still grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.Soon after the disease reappeared, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March called on all African countries to enhance their cross-border surveillance efforts by mapping population movements to identify all potential crossing points where there is a risk of disease spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-ebola-outbreak-officially-over-in-guinea-announces-who-101624102694348.html

Raisi is set to take over from moderate Hassan Rouhani in August and his loyal supporters argue that the former head of the judiciary is Iran’s best hope for standing up to the West and bringing relief from a deep economic crisis exacerbated by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and US sanctions.However, for rights groups, Raisi’s name is associated with the mass executions of Marxists and other leftists in 1988 when he was deputy prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. Amnesty International’s secretary-general Agnès Callamard said in a statement that the 60-year-old Iranian leader should have been investigated for the “crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture” instead of being elected as the president of the Islamic republic.Callamard, who has previously served as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions for the UN Human Rights Council, said that Raisi had been a member of the “Death Commission” that forcibly disappeared and extrajudicially executed thousands of political prisoners.“The circumstances surrounding the fate of the victims and the whereabouts of their bodies are, to this day, systematically concealed by the Iranian authorities, amounting to ongoing crimes against humanity,” she added.Also Read | Iran's next president: Ebrahim Raisi, ultraconservative 'champion of the poor'Amnesty accused Raisi of presiding over a “spiralling crackdown” on human rights and said that under his watch, the judiciary has granted blanket impunity to government officials and security forces responsible for “unlawfully killing hundreds of men, women and children and subjecting thousands of protesters to mass arrests...in the aftermath of the nationwide protests of November 2019.”“We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction,” the London-based pressure group added.Raisi has repeatedly denied playing a role in the mass execution even as he has lauded an order he said was handed down by the Islamic republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to proceed with the purge. In 2019, Raisi and others were placed on a sanctions list by the United States, citing the executions and other alleged rights abuses. Tehran had dismissed the charges as symbolic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebrahim-raisi-amnesty-demands-probe-into-iran-s-next-president-over-rights-101624102248929.html

In an interview with Tolo News, Qureshi apparently held the Afghan government responsible for the recent spate of violence, saying that it would be an “exaggeration” to again blame the Taliban for the rise in violence.“You try to create this impression that the violence is high because of the Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration. Aren't there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler?” said Qureshi.“Like who?” The interviewer pressed Qureshi on his rhetorical question.The Pakistan foreign minister said, “like Daesh, like forces within Afghanistan...who gained from the war economy? Who wants to perpetuate their power? Who is not seeing beyond their nose and just wants to hold on to power?”Pakistan has been long blamed for providing support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Qureshi’s attempt to deflect the blame from the Taliban met with criticism from the current Afghan dispensation as well as Pakistani politicians. Pakistan’s Awami National Party leader and Pashtun rights activist Afrasiab Khattak said that Islamabad has thrown away even the pretence of neutrality in Afghanistan and accused the government of internalising the Afghan conflict.“Why would the Taliban need another foreign minister when they already have one?Pakistan’s “neutrality” in Afghanistan was never credible but it has finally thrown away even that pretension.On its way to fully internalising the Afghan conflict,is Pak sure it can chew what it’s biting?” tweeted Khattak.Also Read | Islamabad severs ties with Afghan NSA for terming Pakistan as 'brothel house'The Afghan government has long-standing reservations that Pakistan may be using the Afghan Taliban as a proxy. Mohib, who had earlier drawn the ire of Islamabad for reportedly calling Pakistan a “brothel house”, said that Qureshi’s remark comes at a time when the Taliban is launching a violent offensive against Afghan people across the country.“[Qureshi] is either uninformed, ignorant or accomplice. Maybe he also rejects that, Osama [Bin Laden] was found next to Pakistani Military HQ,” the Afghan NSA tweeted.This comes as Taliban launches violent offensives against Afghan people across the country, we know how & why they continue to be enabled to do this. Quraishi is either uninformed, ignorant or accomplice. Maybe he also rejects that, Osama was found next to Pakistani Military HQ. https://t.co/PmNOnJjEIZThe Pakistan Foreign Office issued a rejoinder to Mohib’s tweet for what it called his "repeated impertinent and unwarranted remarks" and accused him of trying to "disregard and nullify" the progress made in the Afghan peace process. The Pakistan Foreign Office said, "[r]repeated impertinent and unwarranted remarks" were "a calculated attempt by his office to disregard and nullify the progress in the peace process so far", according to Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-nsa-hits-out-at-pak-fm-over-ties-with-taliban-islamabad-replies-101624096922164.html

19-06-2021||World||Iran's next president: Ebrahim Raisi, ultraconservative 'champion of the poor'||Dressed in a black turban and cleric's coat, Iranian ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi casts himself as an austere and pious figure and an corruption-fighting champion of the poor.On Saturday the 60-year-old was named the winner of the Islamic republic's presidential election, set to take over from moderate Hassan Rouhani in August.Critics charge the election was skewed in his favour as strong rivals were disqualified, but to his loyal supporters he is Iran's best hope for standing up to the West and bringing relief from a deep economic crisis.Raisi is not renowned for great charisma but, as head of the judiciary, has driven a popular campaign to prosecute corrupt officials.In the election campaign he vowed to keep up the fight on graft, construct four million new homes for low-income families, and build "a government of the people for a strong Iran".Many Iranian media outlets see him as a possible successor to supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who turns 82 next month.Raisi, whose black turban signifies direct descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed, holds the title of "hojatoleslam" -- literally "proof of Islam" -- one rank below that of ayatollah in the Shiite clerical hierarchy.Like other ultraconservatives, he harshly criticised Rouhani's camp after the 2015 nuclear deal was torpedoed by then US president Donald Trump, who reimposed punishing sanctions.But, like Iranian political figures across the spectrum, Raisi supports efforts to revive the deal to bring relief from Iran's painful economic crisis.Student of the guideBorn in 1960 in the holy city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran, Raisi rose to high office as a young man.Aged just 20, in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the US-backed monarchy, Raisi was named prosecutor-general of Karaj, which neighbours Tehran.For the exiled opposition and rights groups, his name is indelibly associated with the mass executions of Marxists and other leftists in 1988, when he was deputy prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran.Asked in 2018 and again last year about the executions, Raisi denied playing a role, even as he lauded an order he said was handed down by the Islamic republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to proceed with the purge.In 2019, the US placed Raisi and others on a sanctions list citing the executions and other alleged rights abuses -- charges Tehran dismissed as symbolic.Raisi has decades of judicial experience, serving as Tehran's prosecutor-general from 1989 to 1994, deputy chief of the Judicial Authority for a decade from 2004, and then national prosecutor-general in 2014.He studied theology and Islamic jurisprudence under Khamenei and, according to his official biography, has been teaching at a Shiite seminary in Mashhad since 2018.In 2016, Khamenei put Raisi in charge of a charitable foundation that manages the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and controls a large industrial and property asset portfolio.Three years later, Khamenei appointed him head of the Judicial Authority. Raisi is also a member of the assembly of experts who select the supreme leader.He is married to Jamileh Alamolhoda, an educational sciences lecturer at Tehran's Shahid-Beheshti University. They have two daughters.Raisi is the son-in-law of Ahmad Alamolhoda, the Friday prayer imam and supreme leader's representative for Mashhad.'Uproot sedition'His election win comes after he lost to Rouhani in 2017. This time, five ultra-conservatives and two reformists were approved to run after many other prominent figures were disqualified.Raisi gathered support from traditional conservatives, who are close to the Shiite clergy and the influential merchant class, as well as ultraconservatives who are united in a their anti-Western stance.He also sought to extend a hand beyond his traditional base, by pledging to defend "freedom of expression" and "the fundamental rights of all Iranian citizens".Raisi has also vowed to eradicate "corruption hotbeds" -- a theme he already pursued in his judicial role, through a spate of highly publicised corruption trials of senior state officials.Even judges have not been spared by his much trumpeted anti-graft drive; several have been sentenced over the past year.Raisi has also taken a hard line against protest groups. When the Green Movement in 2009 rallied against populist president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad winning a disputed second term, he was uncompromising."To those who speak of 'Islamic compassion and forgiveness', we respond: we will continue to confront the rioters until the end and we will uproot this sedition," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-next-president-ebrahim-raisi-ultraconservative-champion-of-the-poor-101624089842892.html
19-06-2021||World||Two more Indo-Canadians join Ontario province cabinet||Representation of Indo-Canadians in the cabinet of Canada’s most populous province Ontario has tripled with two more members of the community being appointed in a major reshuffle on Friday.With the reshuffle, Ontario now has the highest number of Indo-Canadian cabinet ministers among any province in the country. It equals the record for three, which was also in Ontario under the previous Liberal Party government of Kathleen Wynne.In the previous ministry, Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government had one Indo-Canadian - Prabhmeet Sarkariya, who was the associate minister of small business and red tape reduction. Sarkariya has now been promoted to take over as president of the Treasury Board.His prior portfolio will now be handled by one of the two Indo-Canadian newcomers, Nina Tangri. The other entrant is Parm Gill, who has been appointed minister of citizenship and multiculturalism.Gill, who represents the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Milton in the provincial parliament, was born in Moga, Punjab. A businessman, Gill was earlier the parliamentary assistant for housing to the minister of municipal Affairs and housing.Gill was a Conservative Party MP in the House of Commons between 2011 and 2015 representing Brampton-Springdale. In a tweet, Gill welcomed his latest responsibility: “Who would have thought a young boy who immigrated from India to Canada, raised by a single mother, would today be sworn in as minister of citizenship and multiculturalism for the province of Ontario.”Like Gill, Tangri, who represents a riding in the Greater Toronto Area, Mississauga Streetsville, also served as a parliamentary assistant, to the minister of economic development, job creation, and trade.Sarkaria, who represents Brampton South, was the only Indo-Canadian to serve even as a parliamentary assistant when the Doug Ford government was elected in June 2018. Originally, parliamentary assistant to the minister for community safety and correctional services, he later became parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general. It was only in June 2019 that he became an associate minister, and the first person wearing a turban to be appointed to the Ontario cabinet.Ford was criticised at the start of the tenure for not including any Indo-Canadians, but with provincial elections due next June, and the significance of the community, he has increased their representation in the latest reshuffle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-more-indo-canadians-join-ontario-province-cabinet-101624084648710.html
19-06-2021||World||Hong Kong: Executives of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily denied bail||Two executives of Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, charged under a national security law, were denied bail on Saturday in a case that has drawn international condemnation and stoked fears over media freedoms in the financial hub.Editor-in-chief Ryan Law 47 and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung 59 were among five Apple Daily executives arrested on Thursday when 500 police also raided the outlet's newsroom, which authorities described as a "crime scene."Police said on Thursday dozens of the newspaper's articles were suspected of violating the national security law. It was the first case in which authorities have cited media articles as potentially violating the contentious legislation.Law and Cheung, who are charged with "collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security" appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Saturday and were denied bail by Judge Victor So.They will next appear in court on August 13.The pair are accused of colluding with Apple Daily owner and staunch Beijing critic Jimmy Lai between July 1 2020 and April 3 April 2021 to request a foreign country, person or organisation "to impose sanctions or blockade or engage in other hostile activities against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or the People's Republic of China," according to a charge sheet.The National Security Law came into force in Hong Kong just before midnight on June 30, 2020.Judge So said Law and Cheung were denied bail because there was insufficient evidence to believe they would not endanger national security.Under the security law, the onus is on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.Three companies related to Apple Daily that are also being prosecuted for collusion with a foreign country appointed people to represent them in court. Authorities have frozen HK$18 million ($2.32 million) of the companies' assets.The other three executives arrested on Thursday, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Puiman and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai, were released on bail late on Friday, according to Apple Daily.Earlier on Saturday, crowds had gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing, some holding yellow umbrellas or wearing Apple Daily T-shirts saying, "No fear, fight on.""Right now, you can be charged with NSL (the national security law) because of a word or a speech that they didn't like. It’s a big regression,” Lo, 29, a reader of the popular, 26-year-old paper, said.The law punishes what Beijing broadly refers to as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The arrests and scale of the Apple Daily raid have been criticised by Western nations, global rights groups, press associations and the chief U.N. spokesperson for human rights.Apple Daily and its listed publisher Next Digital have come under increasing pressure since Lai was arrested last year under the legislation.Lai, whose assets have been frozen under the security law, is already in jail for taking part in unauthorised assemblies and awaiting trial in his national security case.As investigations into Apple Daily and its senior executives ramp up, some employees and observers have expressed deepening concern over the newspaper's future.Since the law was imposed by Beijing in June last year, more than 100 people have been arrested, with most denied bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-executives-of-pro-democracy-newspaper-apple-daily-denied-bail-101624082821676.html

But it is clear who received the votes," Rouhani said.The interior ministry is to announce the final results later on Saturday as the counting of the votes continued, state TV said.Other candidates also congratulated Raisi, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2019 shortly after being appointed by Khamenei as the judiciary chief.Hoping to boost their legitimacy, Iran's clerical rulers had urged Iranians to turn out and vote on Friday, but dissidents inside and abroad said popular anger over economic hardship and curbs on freedoms kept many Iranians at home.Another deterrent for many pro-reform voters was a lack of choice, after a hardline election body barred heavyweight moderate and conservative candidates from standing. Opinion polls suggest turnout around 44%, lower than previous elections in the Islamic Republic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-sole-moderate-presidential-candidate-congratulates-raisi-for-win-report-101624082642503.html
19-06-2021||World||Justice Jamal will be a valuable asset to Canada’s highest court: PM||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that Mahmud Jamal, who will be the first person of Indian-origin to be a Supreme Court justice, will be a valuable asset to Canada’s highest court.A statement from the prime minister’s office described him as having “had a distinguished career as a litigator with a deep commitment to pro bono work”. Trudeau said, “I know that justice Jamal, with his exceptional legal and academic experience and dedication to serving others, will be a valuable asset to our country’s highest court.”Earlier, Trudeau had nominated Jamal, an Ontario judge to Supreme Court. Once he assumes that position after the retirement of an incumbent judge, he will become the first person of Indian-origin to be a Supreme Court justice in Canada.Jamal is currently a justice at the Court of Appeal for Ontario, to which he was appointed in 2019.He was born in Kenya in 1967 to parents from India, and two years later the family immigrated to the England. In 1981, they moved to Canada, settling in the city of Edmonton in Alberta.Narrating his experience in a questionnaire for Supreme Court candidates, he said, “Like many others, I experienced discrimination as a fact of daily life. As a child and youth, I was taunted and harassed because of my name, religion, or the colour of my skin.”Justice Jamal was the first in his family to attend university, spending a year at the London School of Economics before obtaining an economics degree from the University of Toronto. He then moved to McGill University in Montreal to complete the national programme in common law and Quebec civil law, before receiving a graduate law degree from Yale Law School.While he grew up in the Ismaili Muslim tradition, he is a practising member of the minuscule Baha’i faith. “These experiences exposed me to some of the challenges and aspirations of immigrants, religious minorities, and racialised persons. My perspectives on these issues have broadened and deepened over more than 25 years as a lawyer and judge,” he wrote.The judge is married with two teenage children.He was earlier a director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and has taught constitutional law at McGill University and administrative law at Osgoode Hall Law School, which is in York University in Toronto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-jamal-will-be-a-valuable-asset-to-canada-s-highest-court-pm-101624082008466.html
19-06-2021||World||Myanmar: Protesters wear flowers to mark deposed leader Suu Kyi's birthday||Anti-coup protesters in Myanmar donned flowers in their hair Saturday to mark the birthday of ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest and is due to face court again next week.Suu Kyi's elected government was overthrown in a February 1 coup that sparked mass protests and renewed clashes between the military and ethnic rebel armies in border regions.Flowers tucked into a bun have long been a signature look of Suu Kyi, who turns 76 on Saturday.Many replicated the floral hairstyle and uploaded pictures onto social media across Myanmar on Saturday.Among them was Myanmar Miss Universe beauty queen Thuzar Wint Lwin, who wore red flowers in her hair and wrote: "May our leader be healthy."In Yangon's north, protesters put up posters on power lines wishing Suu Kyi a happy birthday and expressing solidarity."Happy Birthday Mother Suu. We are right behind you," the signs read.Some marched with black umbrellas and banners that read "freedom from fear" alongside pictures of Suu Kyi.In the border region of Karen state, some rebel soldiers were photographed holding their guns and yellow, white and purple posies and single flowers tucked behind their ears.Demonstrators in the south-eastern city of Dawei made a giant pink birthday cake and brought it to their street protest.The Noble Peace Prize Laureate's international reputation was damaged after she defended Myanmar's military over allegations of genocide against the ethnic minority Rohingya population in troubled Rakhine state in 2017.Back in courtNot all Myanmar flower protest participants were full of praise for Suu Kyi."I am involved in this campaign because now she is unfairly detained by the military and her civilian rights... and freedom is denied," a 35-year-old activist told AFP, adding it wasn't personal support."After she is free from her detention, she will have to take full responsibility over her silence concerning the suffering of Rohingya and other ethnic groups."The civilian death toll since the coup is estimated to be at least 870 people and close to 5,000 protesters are in detention after being arrested, according to a local monitoring group.The UN General Assembly on Friday took the rare step of calling on member states to "prevent the flow of arms" into Myanmar, part of a non-binding resolution condemning the military coup in the violence-wracked country.The resolution -- which did not go so far as to call for a global arms embargo -- also demands that the military "immediately stop all violence against peaceful demonstrators".It was approved by 119 countries, with 36 abstaining including China, Myanmar's main ally. Only one country, Belarus, voted against it.Suu Kyi is due back in court next week and has been hit with an eclectic raft of criminal charges, including accepting illegal payments of gold and violating a colonial-era secrecy law.She went on trial for sedition on Tuesday, but journalists were barred from observing proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-wear-flowers-to-mark-deposed-leader-suu-kyi-s-birthday-101624081178138.html
19-06-2021||World||Hong Kong court holds first hearing for Apple Daily executives||The top editor of Hong Kong's Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper and the head of its parent company were brought to a courthouse Saturday for their first hearing since their arrest under the city's national security law.Ryan Law, the chief editor, and Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of Next Digital, arrived in an unmarked white van with covered windows. They have been charged with collusion with a foreign country to endanger national security in a case widely seen as an attack on press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Three others also arrested Thursday — two Apple Daily senior editors and another executive — have not been charged yet and were released on bail late Friday pending further investigation.The Apple Daily has long been one of the most outspoken defenders of civil liberties in Hong Kong. It supported massive protests demanding more democracy in 2019 and has criticized the subsequent crackdown, including the enactment of a national security law last year.The central government in Beijing has defended the legislation and the crackdown on opposition voices as necessary to restore order and stability. The 2019 protests that challenged Beijing's rule often started as peaceful marches during the day but turned into violent clashes between hard-core demonstrators and police at night.Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai is currently serving a 20-month prison sentence after being convicted of playing a role in unauthorized assemblies — rallies and marches that had not received police approval — during the 2019 protests. He has also been charged under the national security law.The latest arrests mark the first time journalists have been targeted under the new law, except for a freelancer who was arrested for pro-democracy activities. Hundreds of police and security agents who raided Apple Daily's office on Thursday also seized 44 hard drives, and authorities froze $2.3 million of its assets.Police said the arrests were based on more than 30 articles that had appeared in the Apple Daily since the security law took effect and that had called for international sanctions against China and Hong Kong.The security law specifically criminalizes colluding with a foreign country, institution, organization or individual to impose sanctions or a blockade against Hong Kong or China. Critics say Beijing is walking back on its promise at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain that the city could retain its freedoms not seen elsewhere in China for 50 years.The US has imposed sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials over the crackdown and called for the immediate release of the Apple Daily editors and executives.Asked how journalists should avoid getting in trouble, Hong Kong Security Secretary John Lee told a news conference this week that “the answer is simple: Do your journalistic work as freely as you like in accordance with the law provided you do not conspire or have any intention to break the Hong Kong law and certainly not the Hong Kong National Security Law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-court-holds-first-hearing-for-apple-daily-executives-101624077384101.html

19-06-2021||World||Declaration of Juneteenth holiday sparks scramble in states||Congress and President Joe Biden acted with unusual swiftness this week in approving Juneteenth as a national holiday. That shifted the battle to the states, where the holiday faces a far less enthusiastic response.Nearly all states recognize Juneteenth in some fashion, at least on paper. But most have been slow to move beyond proclamations issued by governors or resolutions passed by lawmakers. So far, at least nine states have designated it in law as an official paid state holiday — Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia and Washington. All but Texas, where the events of the original Juneteenth took place, acted after the killing of George Floyd last year.This year alone, legislation to make Juneteenth a paid state holiday died in Florida and South Dakota and stalled in Ohio, all states controlled by Republicans. But even in Maryland, where Democrats control the Legislature, a Juneteenth bill passed one chamber only to die in the other.The effort recalls the drawn-out battles over recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the last time the federal government designated a new holiday. That legislation, finally passed in 1983, scheduled the holiday to begin three years later. It set off bitter debates in the states over whether to enact their own holidays.Only a handful of states headed into Thursday's signing of the federal Juneteenth law with the paid holiday on the books to be celebrated in 2021. The governors of Washington, Illinois, Louisiana and Maine, by contrast, all signed more recent laws that were set to kick in for 2022, when June 19 falls on a Sunday.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards closed state offices for a half-day Friday, only a few days after he signed Juneteenth legislation, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker was among governors who changed their states' start dates to 2021.In another twist, many states have laws that automatically recognize all federal holidays — even those not named in state statute.Such was the case in Ohio, where Republican Gov. Mike DeWine issued a Juneteenth statement late Thursday and closed state offices in the manner of a hastily called school snow day. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice also declared Juneteenth a state holiday at a last-minute virtual press conference. The governors of Connecticut and Florida issued their Juneteenth proclamations Friday.Ohio state Sen. Hearcel Craig, a Columbus Democrat who is Black, said codifying Juneteenth in state law remains essential. He is sponsoring a bill that passed the Ohio Senate unanimously last session, but time ran out for consideration in the House. Republicans control both of Ohio's legislative chambers.Georgia law caps the number of state holidays at 12, meaning Juneteenth could be added only if another holiday were dropped. In other states, including Oregon, whether Juneteenth becomes a paid holiday will depend on union negotiations.In Mississippi, Democratic state Rep. Bryant Clark has filed bills to make Juneteenth a state holiday for about 15 years. All have stalled.Clark said Friday that he will keep trying. He noted that Mississippi legislators took four years to create a state holiday honoring King after the federal holiday was established. In 1987, Mississippi legislators revised a holiday named for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that had been in place for decades, creating a joint holiday honoring both Lee and King.Two other Mississippi lawmakers said Friday that they plan to file a bill to eliminate Confederate Memorial Day as a state holiday and replace it with Juneteenth.“Sometimes progress is extremely slow,” said Clark, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus. Several communities in Mississippi already hold Juneteenth celebrations. One is the capital city of Jackson, where the population is more than 80% Black.Minnesota has recognized the third Saturday in June as Juneteenth since 1996, but the statute only obligates the governor to issue a proclamation each year honoring the observance. That's a common situation in the U.S., where the holiday is sometimes called Emancipation Day.Calls by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, to make it an official state holiday have failed to gain traction so far in the Legislature, the only one in the nation where Democrats control one chamber and Republicans control the other.Hawaii had been one of only three states left not to recognize the holiday at all. A bill marking Juneteenth was signed there Wednesday and in a second holdout state, North Dakota, in April. Neither created a paid state holiday, however.South Dakota still does not officially recognize the holiday, but Gov. Kristi Noem has issued a proclamation celebrating it. The governor does not have the power to make it an official state holiday — that must be done through the Legislature. A bill to recognize it as a working holiday fell a handful of votes short of passing this year.It was defeated by an unusual coalition of Democrats who felt the day should be recognized as a full-fledged holiday, rather than a working holiday, and conservative lawmakers who opposed recognizing the holiday at all.Vaney Hariri, a Black business owner who organized a march after Floyd’s death, said that vote showed the entrenched attitude of many lawmakers who “would turn down a day off rather than celebrate your freedom from pain and captivity.”In Tennessee, an attempt to designate Juneteenth as a state holiday stalled last year after some Republican lawmakers raised questions about the $647,000 price tag. Others questioned why it was necessary when the state already recognizes Aug. 8 as Emancipation Day.Arizona dragged its feet for years on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, until it became the only state that did not have some sort of holiday inspired by the slain civil rights leader.That long delay cost Arizona a Super Bowl and millions of dollars in tourism revenue from canceled conventions and other events. It also inspired a boycott by singer Stevie Wonder and a protest song by Public Enemy called “By the Time I Get to Arizona.”Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 1986 declaring Martin Luther King Jr. Day a state holiday. Babbitt’s Republican successor, Evan Mecham, rescinded the order a year later, saying Babbitt exceeded his authority.Mecham’s action led to years of divisive political maneuvering, including a ballot measure that ended in defeat for King holiday supporters, before Arizona voters ultimately approved the holiday in 1992.Warren H. Stewart Sr., pastor of the Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix, helped lead a grassroots campaign to establish Arizona's King holiday. But he said he did not rejoice when Biden signed the Juneteenth law. He fears it will distract from legislation on vital issues such as voting rights and police reform.“I see it as a distraction," Stewart said, "almost as a handout of some candy, but the meat of justice is still going to be denied.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/declaration-of-juneteenth-holiday-sparks-scramble-in-states-101624065063928.html
19-06-2021||World||Global Covid-19 fatalities top 4 million||Coronavirus-related deaths worldwide passed a grim milestone of 4 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, as many countries struggle to procure enough vaccines to inoculate their populations.While the number of new cases and deaths have abated in countries like the US and Britain, several nations have vaccine shortages as the Delta variant becomes the dominant strain around the world.It took over a year for the Covid-19 death toll to hit 2 million, while the next 2 million were recorded in just 166 days, according to a Reuters analysis.The top five countries by total number of deaths - the US, Brazil, India, Russia and Mexico– represent about 50% of all deaths in the world, while Peru, Hungary, Bosnia, the Czech Republic and Gibraltar have the highest death rates when adjusted for population.Countries in Latin America are facing their worst outbreak since March, with 43 of every 100 infections in the world being reported in the region, according to a Reuters analysis.The top nine countries reporting the most deaths per capita over the last week were all in Latin America. Hospitals in Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay are largely seeing Covid-19 patients between the ages of 25 and 40 as the trend towards younger patients continued. In Brazil’s Sao Paulo, 80% of intensive care unit occupants are Covid-19 patients.India and Brazil are the countries reporting the most deaths each day on a seven-day average and are still troubled with cremation woes and lack of burial space. India accounts for one in every three deaths reported worldwide each day, according to a Reuters analysis.Delta variant expected to be dominant in US: CDCThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky says she expects the delta variant, first detected in India, will become the dominant coronavirus strain in the US.“As worrisome as this delta strain is with regard to its hyper transmissibility, our vaccines work,” Walensky told ABC’s Good Morning America on Friday. Get vaccinated and “you’ll be protected against this delta variant”, she urged Americans.The White House said President Joe Biden was later on Friday going to announce that 300 million Covid-19 shots have been administered in the 150 days since he took office on January 20. But as Biden marks a new milestone, he is in danger of failing to meet another: his target to have 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July 4.In Russia, new Covid cases hit a pandemic high in Moscow on Friday, tripling in just weeks due to the Delta variant. A total of 9,056 new cases were recorded in the megapolis of 12 million in the past 24 hours, with Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin saying that the highly infectious Delta variant represented almost 90% of new cases||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-fatalities-top-4-million-101624064842470.html
19-06-2021||World||Arizona teenager accused of firing at people across Phoenix area||An Arizona teenager suspected of killing one person and injuring a dozen others during a 90-minute string of drive-by shootings in metropolitan Phoenix told police he believed people were after him because of his involvement in another shooting, according to court documents released Friday.Ashin Tricarico, 19, is accused of opening fire on vehicles and pedestrians from a white SUV on Thursday in at least eight separate shootings in three cities that stoked fear throughout the region. Four people were shot, including a man whose pickup truck careened into a canal alongside a freeway.A witness told police he saw the suspect drive up behind the truck and swerve into the lane beside it and then he heard a gunshot. Police later found the man's body inside the truck with a gunshot wound to the neck and his head, face and body covered in blood, the court documents state.Police said Tricarico admitted to some of the shootings and declined to talk about others but denied firing at a woman or killing the man, whom police haven't identified. Tricarico told police he was involved in another shooting a month ago in Phoenix while he was a security guard and believed people have been following him because of it, according to the court documents.“Ashin thinks every vehicle and person he drives past is pointing a gun at him," police wrote.Phoenix police did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking confirmation of Tricarico's account of an earlier shooting.Tricarico, who was arrested Thursday, appeared remotely for a court hearing Friday and was directed to contact a public defender. The Maricopa County Office of the Public Defender did not have a specific attorney assigned to Tricarico, whose next court hearing is June 24. He faces charges of first-degree murder, shooting from a vehicle, aggravated assault and endangerment.There was no immediate response to a message left at a number listed for a relative of Tricarico.Documents police filed in Maricopa County Superior Court allege Tricarico fired at more than a dozen people, seemingly at random. In some cases, he pulled up beside vehicles and placed the barrel of an assault rifle through his window and fired multiple shots, police said.A 3-year-old child was in one vehicle with her mother when the front windshield and driver's side door were hit, but wasn't harmed. The mother told police she heard three gunshots while driving and immediately felt pain in her arm, stomach and head. She was covered in blood and screaming “oh my god,” according to witness statements.Others were injured as bullets hit or shattered glass. Authorities said the injured ranged in age from 19 to 56.Police said Tricarico left his house in the city of Surprise with an AR-15 rifle and later bought four boxes of ammunition, filling two 30-round magazines. Matching shell casings were found at some of the shooting scenes, police said.Richard Valencia, 34, said he spent Thursday afternoon in the hospital after being shot in the shoulder as he walked from a convenience store in Surprise. He told Phoenix news station KSAZ-TV that he fired back three times with his own weapon.“I don’t even know the guy,” he said. “It was completely random.”Victims and witnesses were able to give authorities a description of the suspect's vehicle — a white Volkswagen SUV — and the license plate number. A local fire department spotted the vehicle and called police, who swarmed a shopping center that includes restaurants, a nail salon and a Walgreens.Neil Betrue, a pastor in Surprise, was alone in his church’s office when he noticed a few police officers and heard a helicopter buzzing overhead. He peered out the door and saw even more officers surrounding the suspect’s car and started recording the commotion on his cell phone.“I did not know at the time it was a shooting spree happening,” Betrue told The Associated Press on Friday. “I just thought maybe there must have been a car chase or something.”As officers drew their weapons, the suspect, wearing a black jacket, black pants and white shoes, raised his hands in the air. He then was cuffed without incident, Betrue's video shows.“I'm just thankful that he didn't try to put the officers or any of the business or anyone else in harm's way here,” Betrue said.Police don't believe anyone else was involved in the attacks.Tricarico also was accused of pointing an assault rifle at a man in the parking lot of a convenience store Wednesday evening as the two were sitting in their vehicles, according to the court documents. Tricarico later followed the man, who ducked when he heard a gunshot but wasn't harmed, police said. Tricarico, however, claimed not to have left his house that day.Police said they won't release any further information until Monday, saying the investigation is complex.The Phoenix metropolitan area has seen other deadly drive-by shootings.In 2005 and 2006, the area was terrorized by a pair of serial shooters who drove around and shot at random targets, killing six people and wounding 19 others. After they were finally arrested, airport janitor Dale Hausner and his roommate Sam Dietman, a petty criminal, were given life sentences. Hausner killed himself in prison by overdosing in 2013.A decade later, a similar string of drive-by shootings started. In 2015 and 2016, nine people were killed and two injured in what police called the “Serial Street Shootings.” Police in 2017 arrested Aaron Saucedo, then 23, alleging he randomly gunned down the people, often at night, while they were returning home from work or in their front yards. He has pleaded not guilty to numerous charges and is awaiting trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arizona-teenager-accused-of-firing-at-people-across-phoenix-area-101624063961545.html
19-06-2021||World||North Korea: Kim Jong Un names new politburo members, reviews 'party discipline'||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has appointed new members of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK)'s powerful politburo and "reinforced the discipline" within party ranks, news agency Reuters reported on Saturday, citing a communiqué by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state media of North Korea. The decisions were made at the fourth and final day of the WPK's plenary meeting, where Kim Jong Un, heading the party's central committee, reviewed organisational and ideological issues.North Korea's ruling party, the WPK, elected two new members to the central committee's powerful politburo, according to the KCNA report. The new members are -- Thae Hyong Chol, vice president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, and U Sang Chol, an official at the party's Central Auditing Commission, appointed as an alternate member.As the head of North Korea's central leadership organ, Kim Jong Un pointed out "serious problems" with the lifestyles of some of the members of the party leadership, KCNA reported. To this, the party members expressed "remorse for failing to live up to the expectations," the news agency added, without elaborating further on the matter.Notably, Kim had recently sparked controversies after called K-pop, a music genre originating in South Korea, a “vicious cancer” corrupting the country’s youth. Not just K-pop, Kim, and the North Korean party leadership have been rallying in recent months against South Korean pop culture, including movies, K-dramas, and K-pop videos. The North’s state media has warned that K-pop’s growing influence, which it calls “anti-socialist and nonsocialist”, on youth would make North Korea “crumble like a damp wall.”Kim Jong Un, during earlier sessions of North Korea's plenary meetings, had warned about possible food shortages and urged the country to brace for extended Covid-19 restrictions. The meetings were conducted as part of a political conference to discuss national efforts to salvage a broken economy.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-kim-jong-un-names-new-politburo-members-reviews-party-discipline-101624063021707.html
19-06-2021||World||Extreme heatwave scorches US southwest amid drought, hits record temperatures||An extreme heatwave that has already shattered temperature records across the US Southwest threatened on Friday to push power systems to the brink of failure as residents cranked up air conditioners.California power grid operators, who have so far been able to keep the lights on, issued their latest "flex alert" for Friday, asking homeowners across the state to conserve energy in the late afternoon and evening when demand surges.The heat, which comes amid years of drought across the Southwest, has strained power grids in California and Texas and fueled the spread of wildfires.“It feels somewhat apocalyptic with the record high heat, the smoke from wildfires tearing through the Sonoran desert, and the news on the drought,” said Emily Kirkland, a communications organizer for a Phoenix nonprofit group. "Just the 10-minute walk from my house to the light rail made me queasy."The National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings for five states - California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado - warning that temperatures soaring well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) can be dangerous."Very hot conditions will continue for interior areas through Saturday, followed by gradual cooling into next week. Until then, USE CAUTION as heat can be deadly! Most importantly, stay hydrated and never leave kids or pets in a hot car!!" the National Weather Service station for Los Angeles said on Twitter.Records brokenTemperature records have already been tied or broken in Salt Lake City, Palm Springs, and elsewhere and record highs were forecast for Phoenix on Friday at 117 degrees."It's miserable, you literally just don't leave your house unless you have to," said Hannah Knight, 20, a waitress at The Coronado coffee shop in Phoenix.The diner has an outdoor dining area but "when it reaches over 110 (degrees Fahrenheit), there's no way to make it comfortable," she said.Many other cities were expected to come close to tying or breaking their daily records, including Las Vegas where a high temperature of 114 degrees was forecast.A high-pressure ridge, or dome, over the Southwest has been blamed for the heatwave."Every year it's hot in the Southwest," National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Oravec said from the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. "It just seems to be more newsworthy when you have temperatures of 115 or so day after day. It's pretty hot."Power systems in Texas and California have so far withstood the strain but operators said that if residents did not conserve energy in the late afternoon, rolling blackouts could be required to keep the system running.In Texas, where temperatures have moderated, demand hit a record on Monday, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).California's power demand peaked on Thursday at 41,364 megawatts and was expected to surpass that level on Friday, according to the California Independent System Operator, which operates the grid in most of the state. One megawatt can power about 200 homes on a hot day.The heatwave extended to the Midwest, prompting weather services to issue advisories for Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois before a strong cold front brings relief by the end of the weekend. Temperatures in St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, were forecast to top 100 degrees on Friday.Relief, relatively speaking, is also forecast to come to the Southwest at the beginning of next week, Oravec said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-heatwave-scorches-us-southwest-amid-drought-hits-record-temperatures-101624062202795.html

The president noted that 65 per cent of adults have received at least one shot, setting the stage for most Americans to have a relatively normal summer as businesses reopen and employers hire.“We're heading into a very different summer compared to last year,” the president said. “A bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy.”But as Biden marks one milestone, he is in danger of failing to meet another: his target to have 70 per cent of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July Fourth, in a little over two weeks.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 305 million vaccine doses had been administered as of June 1O. About 141.6 million people, or 42.6% of the US population, have been fully vaccinated.The pace of new vaccinations in the US has dropped significantly from a high of nearly 2 million per day about two months ago, jeopardizing Biden's ability to hit the 70 per cent mark.The White House said its whole-of-government approach to the vaccination effort has put the virus in retreat, which in turn has brought Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths to their lowest levels in more than a year. But Biden noted in his remarks that some communities in states with lower vaccination rates are seeing cases and hospitalizations increase.The administration is in the middle of a monthlong blitz to combat vaccine hesitancy and the lack of urgency some people feel to get the shots, particularly in the South and Midwest.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that she expects the delta variant of the coronavirus will become the dominant strain in the US. That strain has become dominant in Britain after it was first detected in India.During an appearance on ABC's “Good Morning America,” she told Americans who get their shots that “you'll be protected against this delta variant.”As part of the administration's vaccination push, Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta on Friday to tour a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination site at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a pastor until his assassination in 1968. The current senior pastor is US Sen. Raphael Warnock.Harris also spoke at a Covid-19 vaccination mobilization event at Clark Atlanta University, a historically Black school.The Biden administration insists that even if the 70 per cent vaccination goal is unmet, it will have little effect on the overall US recovery, which is already ahead of where Biden said it would be months ago.Biden wants to celebrate Independence Day as a “summer of freedom” from the virus.Earlier this week, the White House announced plans to host first responders, essential workers and service members and their families on the South Lawn for a cookout and to watch the fireworks over the National Mall.More than 1,000 guests are expected for what will be one of the largest events of Biden's presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/300-million-vaccine-shots-in-150-days-biden-s-new-milestone-after-taking-office-101624048767114.html
19-06-2021||World||UN aid chief says tackle root causes of hunger and suffering||The outgoing UN humanitarian chief warned that “the explosion” in needs for humanitarian assistance in recent years will keep getting worse until major powers tackle the root causes of hunger and desperation -- conflicts, extremism, climate change, poor governance, corruption and violence, to name a few.Mark Lowcock, who steps down Friday after four years, said in an interview with The Associated Press that unfortunately the world has been dealing with symptoms, including people displaced by fighting and natural disasters or at risk of famine, which is now stalking Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region and Yemen.In a very divided world, where the geopolitical system has failed to manage conflicts very well, he said, there has been a “failure of the leading powers" to tackle the causes.“If the world wants to see less humanitarian suffering, you have to deal with the causes of that suffering,” Lowcock said. “If you tackle the causes, you can make progress, you can improve people’s lives.”During his lifetime, the 58-year-old British economist said the world moved from having more than half the global population living in “the most extreme poverty” to less than 10% in that dire situation before the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.The people and countries left out of that economic progress are “the ones enmeshed in humanitarian suffering,” he said.Lowcock was highly critical of the world’s rich countries, and especially the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, for “not acting much more aggressively and generously and protecting the poorest countries coming out of the pandemic,” not only with vaccines but supporting their economies, which “have taken the biggest hit in relative terms” and are “under huge strain.”Rich countries pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to protect their citizens and their nations, and “that’s the right thing to do,” he said.“But it would also have been a smart thing as well as a kind and generous thing to have spent a little bit of that money protecting the very poorest countries,” Lowcock said in the virtual interview on Wednesday.It is also in the self-interest of wealthier nations, he said, because the problems that can brew in fragile countries — becoming havens for terrorism, places where climate change is hardest to tackle, sites where new diseases emerge and old diseases like Ebola reemerge — “come back to bite you if you don’t invest enough to contain the problems.”Lowcock called for a much bigger effort to help poorer countries out of the pandemic.Rather than just announcing it was donating vaccines, he said, the G-7 should have made clear that what they were doing was “a small down payment,” and that they would work with the larger Group of 20 major economies to do a lot more.The G-7 leaders promised 1 billion doses for vaccine-hungry countries, far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to inoculate at least 70% of the world’s population and truly end the pandemic.Lowcock said the G-7 announcement -- including 500 million doses from the United States and 100 million each from Britain and Canada -- is basically enough vaccine to reach about 10% of the people who need it in low- and middle-income countries.He said the G-7 didn’t announce money to get the vaccine from the manufacturer into the syringes of health workers who can immunize people, stressing that there are “huge costs in the delivery system.” Some of the very poorest countries that got a little bit of vaccine but had no delivery systems gave some back, he said.The G-7 should have made “a much more rounded, longer term commitment” to finance vaccine requirements, he said, and it should be challenging the G-20 “to step up and meet part of the share of the costs as well.”By comparison, he recalled that in the much smaller financial crisis of 2007-2008, “the leading countries in the G-20 instructed the international financial institutions to provide a lot of assistance to the most vulnerable countries, and they bankrolled that.”For the last 15 months, Lowcock said, he has been pressing the G-7 and the G-20 to provide a lot more economic help to the poorest countries.“That has not happened through this crisis,” he said. “If more resources don’t come, then the pandemic is going to last a lot longer than it would otherwise do, and that will ultimately harm the rich countries as well as adding to the misery and suffering of the poorer countries.”Lowcock called his last four years as the UN's undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs “challenging,” especially because “the causes of humanitarian suffering have been growing.”He said the UN and the broader humanitarian community, whose “true grit” he has come to admire, have been able “to stave off the worst outcomes in these big disasters, essentially because we have raised quite a lot of money.”In his first year, the UN raised $14 billion for its global humanitarian appeals, Lowcock said, and four years later “we raised $20 billion, so roughly a 40% increase over the period.”But he said he worries that funding for humanitarian aid is voluntary, and there’s far too much reliance on a small number of countries. As a prime example, he said, 70% of the $20 billion raised last year came from the US, Germany, the European Union and the United Kingdom.Historically, the system for humanitarian relief has been “far too reactive,” Lowcock said. “It’s waited for the problem to get almost overwhelming before doing something about it, and we’ve tried to act much earlier when we knew a problem was coming, and much faster.”He said an earlier and faster response to a humanitarian crisis is cheaper, and “it’s also more humane.”“We reach 100 million people a year,” Lowcock said. “We certainly saved millions of lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-aid-chief-says-tackle-root-causes-of-hunger-and-suffering-101624045483512.html
19-06-2021||World||Wall Street sees turbulence as Fed shift causes rally in value stocks to wobble||The Federal Reserve's hawkish shift is forcing investors to reevaluate the rally in so-called value stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days after ripping higher for most of the year.Shares of banks, energy firms and other companies that tend to be sensitive to the economy’s fluctuations have tumbled following the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank surprised investors by anticipating two quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2023 amid a recent surge in inflation.The Russell 1000 Value Stock Index is down 4% from its June peak, though still up 13.2% this year. Its growth counterpart is up 9.1% year-to-date.One factor driving the move is the idea that a Fed more strongly focused on preventing the economy from overheating may begin unwinding easy-money policies sooner than previously expected. On Friday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank’s shift was a "natural" response to economic growth and inflation moving quicker than expected, bolstering that view.“Value stocks had gotten ahead of themselves, particularly in energy and financials, and the folks that are caught offsides are starting to unwind those trades,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.The post-Fed meeting slide in value has been accompanied by a retreat in some commodity prices, a surge in the dollar and a rally in US government bonds that dragged down yields on the benchmark US Treasury to around 1.44% on Friday afternoon.Investors will be keeping a close eye on next week’s economic data for clues on whether the recent surge in inflation -- which saw consumer prices accelerate at their fastest pace in 12 years last month -- will persist.New home sales and mortgage applications are due out June 23, while May consumer spending numbers are expected on June 25.Investors piled into value stocks in the latter half of 2020, as signs of breakthroughs in vaccines against Covid-19 bolstered the case for a powerful economic rebound in 2021. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by nearly 7 percentage points since the start of November 2020, bucking a trend that saw technology and other growth sectors regularly outshine value over the last decade.An unwinding of the heavy positioning in value shares could exacerbate the recent slide. Mutual funds are overweight value names to a larger degree than any time in the last eight years, according to a Goldman Sachs report published on June 9.Some big-name investors such as Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing US equity fund last year, have suggested that growth stocks will resume their market outperformance as investors rotate away from value sectors such as energy that are up 38.5% since the start of the year. Wood’s flagship ETF is down 4.8% year-to-date.Others, however, believe the recent wobble in value stocks is a pause, rather than a turning point.Cyclical companies remain the least over-valued in the US stock market, according to Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse. High sales-growth companies are trading at valuations nearly double their 10-year averages, while cyclical companies are trading at valuations approximately 40% more than their historical levels, he wrote in a research note.The prospect of rising interest rates should also benefit higher quality value stock names that held up better in last year's downturn but have lagged during the recovery, said John Mowrey, chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group.He has been increasing his positions in utility and consumer staples stocks that have underperformed value stocks as a whole, betting that they will increase their dividend payouts, which would make them more attractive even if Treasury yields eventually rise.Among his holdings are consumer companies Church & Dwight Co, which is down 4% for the year to date, and McCormick & Company Inc, which is down 9.7% for the year to date."The idea of dividend growth has been largely sidelined because we’ve all been enjoying stock appreciation," he said. "We think this will be the next leg of the value stock rally."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wall-street-sees-turbulence-as-fed-shift-causes-rally-in-value-stocks-to-wobble-101624045536878.html
19-06-2021||World||'Lower drug costs': Pfizer CEO asks Joe Biden to form coalition||Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla on Friday urged US President Joe Biden to form a bipartisan coalition in Washington to address high drug costs.There’s a great opportunity for Biden to take the initiative to “reduce significantly the cost of medicines for the patients, which is the thing that is now problematic,” Bourla said in an interview Friday with David Westin on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” show.The out-of-pocket drug costs now paid by patients “is something that needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed urgently,” Bourla said. Pharmaceutical industry executives would be willing to help cover the cost of such reform, but they want to ensure their contributions would go directly toward lowering patient costs, he added.“What we don’t want to do is to give money that will go to the black hole of the federal budget,” Bourla said. “We want everything that we contribute to go to lower the out-of-pocket costs of the patients.”In the interview, Bourla didn’t discuss specifics on what reforms he might want to see from the government. In an earnings call in May, though, he said the three key areas the company would like to see from Congress and the Biden administration are rebate reform, capping beneficiary cost-sharing in Medicare Part D and incentivizing the uptake of biosimilars.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech SE are the developers of a messenger RNA vaccine that, along with shots by Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, has helped stem the Covid-19 pandemic.Bourla was asked if he was worried the goodwill developed by Pfizer’s actions in developing and producing the vaccine could turn over the industry’s overall actions on pricing. “I know that reputation is earned in drops,” he said. “But you can lose it in buckets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lower-drug-costs-pfizer-ceo-asks-joe-biden-to-form-coalition-101624038964758.html
19-06-2021||World||China likely to remove all restrictions on births by 2025, says report||Chinese officials are planning to ease birth restrictions further and are considering possibly doing away with all of them by 2025, Dow Jones reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Authorities will likely begin by eliminating restrictions in provinces where the birthrates are the lowest, the news organization reported. The plans being drawn up would include policies to explicitly encourage childbirth, it said.Beijing last month eased a previous two-child limit, allowing all couples to have a third child as it tries to slow the nation’s declining birthrate. However, economists and demographers say the reforms are too little too late and won’t be able to prevent an eventual decline in the population.After the Chinese government changed the norms, social media participants cited the high cost of raising children in urban China, where housing can be expensive and children undergo private tuition in addition to public schools amid a fiercely competitive education system, as deterrents to having kids. At the time, the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, acknowledged the difficulty of having three children in big cities but also said economics was not the only factor.Researchers at the central bank earlier this year called for birth limits to be abolished entirely.The debate was intensified after the results of China’s latest national census showed the lowest number of births in almost 60 years last year and a decline in the country’s working-age population over the past decade.The decision to allow three children in every family was a response to China’s deepening ageing problem and aims to improve the country’s population structure in the future.The census data made public earlier in May revealed that China’s population is growing at its most sluggish pace in decades, with the country adding only 72 million in the past decade. The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, down from a rate of 0.57% between 2000 and 2010 - bringing the population to 1.41 billion.The total population figure on the mainland stood at 1.41178 billion on November 1, 2020. The rate is the slowest since 1953 when the first census was carried out.During the period when China strictly implemented the one-child policy — from the late 1970s to 2016 — only couples from minority ethnicities were allowed more than one child.When the country scrapped its one-child policy in 2016, there was a brief uptick in births followed by a decline that has steepened as costs continue to rise.The slump in population growth rate — despite Beijing withdrawing the one-child policy in 2016 — will add pressure on Beijing to incentivise child-bearing as the most populous country deals with a rapidly ageing population and the added economic burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-to-remove-all-restrictions-on-births-by-2025-says-report-101624043361659.html
