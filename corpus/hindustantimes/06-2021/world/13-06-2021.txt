Early this year, an intruder lurked in hundreds of computers related to water systems across the US. In Portland, Oregon, burglars installed malicious computers onto a grid providing power to a chunk of the Northwest.Two of those cases -- L.A. and Portland -- were tests. The water threat was real, discovered by cybersecurity firm Dragos.All three drive home a point long known but, until recently, little appreciated: the digital security of US computer networks controlling the machines that produce and distribute water and power is woefully inadequate, a low priority for operators and regulators, posing a terrifying national threat.“If we have a new world war tomorrow and have to worry about protecting infrastructure against a cyberattack from Russia or China, then no, I don’t think we’re where we’d like to be,” said Andrea Carcano, co-founder of Nozomi Networks, a control system security company.Hackers working for profit and espionage have long threatened American information systems. But in the last six months, they’ve targeted companies running operational networks like the Colonial Pipeline fuel system, with greater persistence. These are the systems where water can be contaminated, a gas line can spring a leak or a substation can explode.The threat has been around for at least a decade -- and fears about it for a generation -- but cost and indifference posed obstacles to action.It isn’t entirely clear why ransomware hackers -- those who use malicious software to block access to a computer system until a sum of money has been paid -- have recently moved from small-scale universities, banks and local governments to energy companies, meatpacking plants and utilities. Experts suspect increased competition and bigger payouts as well as foreign government involvement. The shift is finally drawing serious attention to the problem.The US government began taking small steps to defend cybersecurity in 1998 when the Clinton administration identified 14 private sectors as critical infrastructure, including chemicals, defense, energy and financial services. This triggered regulation in finance and power. Other industries were slower to protect their computers, including the oil and gas sector, said Rob Lee, the founder of Dragos.One of the reasons is the operational and financial burden of pausing production and installing new tools.Much of the infrastructure running technology systems is too old for sophisticated cybersecurity tools. Ripping and replacing hardware is costly as are service outages. Network administrators fear doing the job piecemeal may be worse because it can increase a network’s exposure to hackers, said Nozomi’s Carcano.Although the Biden administration’s budget includes $20 billion to upgrade the country’s grid, this comes after a history of shoulder shrugging from federal and local authorities. Even where companies in under-regulated sectors like oil and gas have prioritized cybersecurity, they’ve been met with little support.Take the case of ONE Gas Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Niyo Little Thunder Pearson was overseeing cybersecurity there in January 2020 when his team was alerted to malware trying to enter its operational system -– the side that controls natural gas traffic across Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.Hacker DogfightFor two days, his team was in a dogfight with the hackers who moved laterally across the network. Ultimately, Pearson’s team managed to expel the intruders.When Richard Robinson at Cynalytica fed the corrupted files into his own identification program, ONE Gas learned it was dealing with malware capable of executing ransomware, exploiting industrial control systems and harvesting user credentials. At its core were digital footprints found in some of the most malicious code of the last decade.Pearson tried to bring the data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation but it would only accept it on a compact disc, he said. His system couldn’t burn the data onto a CD. When he alerted the Department of Homeland Security and sent it through a secure portal, he never heard back.Robinson of Cynalytica was convinced a nation-state operator had just attacked a regional natural gas provider. So he gave a presentation to DHS, the Departments of Energy and Defense and the intelligence community on a conference call. He never heard back either.“We got zero, and that was what was really surprising,” he said. “Not a single individual reached back out to find out more about what happened to ONE Gas.”The agencies didn’t respond to requests for comment.Such official indifference -- even hostility -- hasn’t been uncommon.The 2018 break-in to the L.A. water and power system is another example.These weren’t criminals but hackers-for-hire paid to break into the system to help it improve security.After the initial intrusion, the city’s security team asked the hackers to assume the original source of compromise had been fixed (it hadn’t) while hunting for a new one. They found many.Between the end of 2018 and most of 2019, the hired hackers discovered 33 compromised paths, according to a person familiar with the test who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. Bloomberg News reviewed a report produced by the hackers for Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office.It described 10 vulnerabilities found during their own test, along with 23 problems researchers had discovered as early as 2008. (Bloomberg News won’t publish information that hackers could use to attack the utility.) The person familiar with the operation discovered that few, if any, of the 33 security gaps have been fixed since the report’s submission in September 2019.It gets worse.Soon after the hackers produced the report, Mayor Garcetti terminated their contract, according to a preliminary legal claim filed by the hackers hired from Ardent Technology Solutions in March 2020. The company alleges the mayor fired the hackers as a “retaliatory measure” for the scathing report.Ellen Cheng, a utility spokeswoman, acknowledged that Ardent’s contract was terminated but said it had nothing to do with the report’s substance. She said the utility frequently partners with public agencies to improve security, including scanning for potential cyber threats.“We want to assure our customers and stakeholders that cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to LADWP and that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that our cybersecurity is compliant with all applicable laws and security standards,” Cheng said in a statement.Garcetti’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.The case of the Oregon network -- the Bonneville Power Administration -- is no more encouraging.The testing went on for years beginning in 2014 and involved an almost shocking level of intrusion followed by a pair of public reports. One published in 2017 admonished the agency for repeatedly failing to take action.By 2020, two-thirds of the more than 100 flaws identified by the Department of Energy and the utility’s own security team hadn’t been resolved, according to interviews with more than a dozen former and current Bonneville security personnel and contractors and former members of the Department of Energy cyber team, in addition to documents, some accessed via Freedom of Information Act request.Doug Johnson, a spokesperson for Bonneville, said a team reviewed the security reports in mid-2019 and that efforts to remediate those are ongoing. The utility acknowledged that hackers were able to breach certain BPA systems in those test hacks, but Johnson said “at no time were they able to gain access to any of the BPA systems that monitor or control the power grid.”Dragos estimated in its 2020 cybersecurity report that 90% of its new customers had “extremely limited to no visibility” inside their industrial control systems. That means that once inside, hackers have free rein to collect sensitive data, investigate system configurations and choose the right time to wage an attack.The industry is finally focused on fighting back.“If the bad guys come after us, there has to be an eye-for-an-eye, or better,” observed Tom Fanning, chief executive officer of Southern Co., at a conference this week. “We’ve got to make sure the bad guys understand there will be consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-water-and-power-are-shockingly-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-101623602238905.html

The female calf has not been named yet, but both baby and mother are healthy and doing well.“The baby rhino appears to be strong and is nursing alongside her mother,” the zoo said in a statement posted on its Facebook page Saturday.Alake was paired with the only adult male in the Tampa zoo, Ongava. Their calf will join the crash, or group of rhinos, in the coming weeks, zoo officials said. Visitors will be able to see the baby rhino in the new Expedition Wild Africa attraction, set to open soon.The zoo says the white rhino population had dropped in the early 20th century to between 50 and 200, but conservation efforts made the population increase to 20,400 in Africa. White rhinos are still classified as near-threatened because of habitat loss and poaching for their horns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-zoo-announces-birth-of-southern-white-rhino-101623602242344.html

After the conclusion of the G7 summit, Biden told a news conference that the US will deal with China in a straightforward manner and will state the disagreements frankly.“I think we are in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century,” said Biden.In a communique published on Sunday, the seven richest democracies said that they recognise their responsibility in upholding a rules-based international system and commit to playing their role in it. The G7 nations further stated that, with regard to China, they will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.Also Read | G7 demands Covid origin study in China, calls on Beijing to respect human rightsThe G7 also called on China to respect human rights in the Xinjiang region and a higher degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, which has been undermined by China’s draconian national security law. According to the communique, the G7 countries will cooperate with China on issues of mutual interest on shared global challenges, particularly on climate action and addressing biodiversity loss in the context of COP26 and other multilateral discussions.“You are gonna see just straightforward dealing with China, and again, we are looking for, as I told Xi Jinping myself, I am not looking for conflict. Where we cooperate, we will cooperate, where we disagree, we will state it frankly,” he added.People familiar with the G7 discussions on China said that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses. While Canada, Britain and France largely endorsed Biden's more hawkish position on China, Germany, Italy and the European Union showed more hesitancy, reported Associated Press.

The G7 leaders, in an almost finalised version of the communique, reiterated their demand to restore the higher degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, which has been undermined by China’s draconian national security law."We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law," the G7 said.In recent times, Beijing has drawn the ire of the West over its alleged human right violations and forced labour practices in the Xinjiang region, largely inhabited by Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority group in China. Several reports have claimed Uyghur Muslims have been facing persecution at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the name of “re-education camps”.Also Read | G7 agrees to increase climate finance, calls on others to joinG7 countries repeated the demand earlier made by the United States for the second phase of the investigation into Covid-19 origins and the route of introduction to the human population, to be convened by the World Health Organization (WHO). A report by an international team of experts after the first phase of investigation had deemed the theory of laboratory incident “extremely unlikely.”However, the hypothesis gained a lot of traction after top infectious disease Dr Anthony Fauci said he was convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.” US President Joe Biden recently ordered intelligence officials to “redouble” efforts to probe the origins of the pandemic, including the possibility of a Chinese laboratory link."We also call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 Covid-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts’ report, in China," the draft G7 communique said.The G7 leaders also underscored "the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues."

The people arriving in Abu Dhabi from there countries will just have to undergo an RT-PCR test at the airport, the emirate's administration, the reports added.The passengers who are fully vaccinated will need to undergo a follow-up RT-PCR test after six days, while those not fully vaccinated have been directed to hold another test on Day 12, the media reports said quoting the emirate's tourism ministry.Abu Dhabi's gree list now comprises of 28 countries which are as follows: Australia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Brunei, China, Cuba, Germany, Greenland, Hong Kong (SAR), Iceland, Israel, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Mauritius, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, United States of America and Uzbekistan.Notably, the United Kingdom and India are not part of the new list. It will replace the previous 'green list' issued by the emirate on May 23.Abu Dhabi last week made it mandatory for its residents to have a green pass on the country's Covid-19 app in order to enter shopping malls, restaurants, cafes and other public places from June 15. The restrictions will also apply to gyms, hotels and their facilities, public parks, beaches, swimming pools, entertainment centres, cinemas, and museums, Abu Dhabi's media office said.Visitors will have to prove they have been vaccinated or have recently tested negative through the Alhosn app, which displays an individual's vaccination and testing history.The mobile app will show green if the person has been vaccinated or has tested negative.The UAE announced last month that from June 6, attendance at live events and social activities, including weddings and bars, would be limited to those who could prove they had been vaccinated.The UAE has one of world's highest inoculation rates with the AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines available to citizens and residents.In Abu Dhabi, those immunised with the Chinese-made Sinopharm shot are also able to take a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech as a booster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-abu-dhabi-expands-green-list-uk-india-not-added-101623583447593.html

The leaders of the seven richest economies arrived at a consensus to offer developing nations to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is seen by many as a “debt trap”. India has vehemently objected to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under BRI, as it runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir."Trudeau's message today was that we really need to work to build a consensus on a unified approach to the challenges that China presents all of us. We have to show solidarity as a group and show action as a group as well," news agency Reuters quoted a person familiar with the discussions as saying.During a background press call on US President Joe Biden’s meetings at the G7 summit, a senior US official said that the administration is working to respond to non-market economic practices that are objectionable in a global economy and pursuing an affirmative infrastructure initiative that’s high standards and transparent. The White House said that the G7 leaders hope the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, the plan to counter China’s BRI, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035.Also Read | Explained: How G7 counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative will benefit IndiaWhile the G7 leaders agreed on the infrastructure plan, reports suggest that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses.

It recorded 2,281 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total so far to around 596,000 cases. Daily cases peaked at almost 4,000 a day in early February.DHA said 90% of the Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care units in Dubai hospitals were unvaccinated, without specifying when that statistic was recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-has-fully-vaccinated-two-thirds-of-eligible-people-against-covid19-101623580068715.html

The new coalition consists of eight parties from across Israel’s political spectrum, including a small Arab party, which makes it extremely fragile. The disparate opposition parties have come together, mainly, to keep Netanyahu out of the office and avoid another election.Naftali Bennett, 49, has served as minister of defence as well as of education and the economy in various governments under the leadership of Netanyahu. Born in the Israeli city of Haifa to immigrants from San Francisco, California, Bennett stormed into national politics in 2013 after renouncing his US citizenship.The far-right Yamina party leader is a religious ultranationalist who supports the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the annexation of most of the occupied region. Bennett made the annexation of parts of the West Bank that Israel captured in a 1967 war a major feature of his political platform. He is against a two-state solution and argues that a Palestinian state would be suicide for Israel due to security reasons.Also Read | Explained: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violenceLast year, as Netanyahu pushed the West Bank annexation plan and settlement building during the final months of the Trump administration, Bennett, then defence chief, said, "The building momentum in the country must not be stopped, even for a second." The plan was eventually scrapped as Israel moved to normalise ties with the UAE under Abraham Accords.Following through on expansion will now be politically unfeasible since the so-called “change” coalition, which relies on the support of the United Arab List, a small party with Islamist roots, would collapse even if one party bolts.Bennett, also a self-made tech millionaire, formed a start-up in 1999 and then moved to New York, eventually selling his anti-fraud software company, Cyota, to US security firm RSA for $145 million in 2005.

However several European Union member states have stopped administering it to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65, restricting its use to the older population, due to the rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people."In a pandemic context, our position was and is that the risk-benefit ratio remains favourable for all age groups," Covid-19 task force chief Marco Cavaleri told the Italian newspaper La Stampa.However, as the number of Covid-19 cases is falling and taking into account that the younger population is less exposed to Covid-19 related risks, Cavaleri said it would be better to use on them Covid-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (​mRNA) technology, such as Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.Asked whether health authorities should avoid giving the Astrazeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, Cavaleri said: "Yes, and many countries, such as France and Germany, are considering it in the light of greater availability of mRNA vaccines."The Italian government said on Friday it would restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting.Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations in March over concerns about the rare blood clotting problems.It resumed them the following month with the recommendation that the product be "preferably" used for people over the age of 60, after the EMA said its benefits outweighed any risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-shots-should-be-halted-for-over-60s-too-ema-official-101623572901317.html

The WHO Director-General hoped there would be better cooperation and transparency when the next phase of the probe into the virus's origin is underway."As you know we will need cooperation from the Chinese side," he said. "We need transparency to understand or know or find the origin of this virus...after the report was released there were difficulties in the data sharing, especially in the raw data."He further said that the preparations for the probe's next steps were underway and that the issue of the origin of the virus was discussed by G7 leaders on Saturday, WSJ reported.Earlier this week, the US and the UK had extended support to a "timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process" for the next phase of the WHO-convened study of Covid-19 origins."We will also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened Covid-19 origins study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin in the future," a joint statement said after US President Joe Biden met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday.This comes amid growing calls for a timely, transparent, and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened origin study.Recently, the calls to investigate further the origins of the virus have intensified. President Biden has also ordered a fresh US intelligence inquiry into the origins of the pandemic.The origin of novel coronavirus that caused havoc around the world has remained a mystery even after 1.5 years the first case of infection was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Now, scientists and world leaders are calling for further investigations to figure out whether the virus originated naturally or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-asks-china-to-cooperate-with-probe-into-origins-of-covid19-101623565411373.html

How could their hate be so strong?” Murphy said. “But today I have an even harder time understanding why some politicians still refuse to take the most basic steps to prevent the next shooting,” she added, speaking live during a national discussion hosted by a coalition of human rights and gun safety groups.Also Read: On fifth anniversary of Pulse Nightclub shooting, Joe Biden to name site a national memorialThe attack, which took place as “Latin Night” was being celebrated at the club, is considered the deadliest on the LGBTQ community in US history. It left 49 people dead and 50 others injured. Shooter Omar Mateen of the Islamic State was killed after a three-hour standoff by SWAT team members following the incident.“Bigotry and hatred are not asleep. They still move around us,” said Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the attack. “And if we are going to snuff them out, we must make the same defiant choice we made on this site five years ago today, and that is to embrace the power of community and reject the temptation to come apart at the seams of our differences.” he said, according to news agency AP.Moreover, the anniversary of the shooting should remind people to recommit themselves to taking action, he added.According to Orlando's deputy police chief James P Young, a gay man who reported to the scene on that fateful night, said he has seen friendships strengthen and the community unite over the past five years.“If we use our shared experiences and our shared values, including those of strength and unity, love will always win,” Young said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulse-nightclub-shooting-victims-of-massacre-remembered-after-5-years-101623552602692.html

Victoria emerged from the lockdown on Friday as new cases declined, but some physical distancing rules remain."My expectation is by later in the week, we will be in a position to announce further easing of restrictions for regional Victoria and ... for metropolitan Melbourne," Merlino said.Merlino added he was keen to get people back to attending sporting events and theatre, though he had no announcement to make yet in that regard.Under existing curbs, Melbourne residents can only travel up to 25 kilometres (15.5 miles) from home while outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people. Masks are required indoors and outdoors at all public spaces.Also Read: Covid-19: Australia's Victoria enters 7-day lockdownMore than 3,000 primary close contacts of infected cases are already in quarantine with about 122 exposure sites listed on the Victorian government website.Australia has fared much better than many other developed countries during the pandemic, with more than 22,300 local COVID-19 cases and 910 deaths since March 2020, mostly in Victorian aged-care homes.Snap lockdowns, internal border controls and tough social distancing rules have helped it contain prior outbreaks.New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, and neighbouring Queensland are on high alert after an infected woman and her husband travelled from Victoria through several country towns in both states.With no new cases on Sunday, New South Wales, which includes the largest city, Sydney, has not reported any locally acquired infection in more than a month, while Queensland last reported cases in late March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-state-expects-to-further-ease-covid-19-curbs-101623561850026.html

The new cabinet, which will be sworn in after a Knesset confidence vote it is expected to win, was cobbled together by the centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid and ultra-nationalist Naftali Bennett.Also Read: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violenceBennett, a hawkish hi-tech millionaire, will serve as premier for two years before Lapid, a former popular TV host, takes over. They will head a government that comprises parties from across the political spectrum, including for the first time one that represents the 21% Arab minority. They plan largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy toward the Palestinians while they focus on domestic reforms.With little to no prospect of progress toward resolving the decades-long conflict with Israel, many Palestinians will be unmoved by the change of administration, saying Bennett will likely pursue the same right-wing agenda as Netanyahu.BYE BYE BIBI?On the international stage, with his polished English and booming baritone voice, the telegenic Netanyahu has become the face of Israel. Serving in his first term as prime minister in the 1990s and since 2009 winning four more terms in succession, he has been a polarising figure, both abroad and at home.Also Read: Thousands of anti-Netanyahu protesters in Jerusalem claim 'victory' on eve of Israel voteOften referred to by his nickname Bibi, Netanyahu is loved by his hard-core supporters and loathed by critics. His ongoing corruption trial, on charges he denies, has only deepened the chasm.His opponents have long reviled what they see as Netanyahu's divisive rhetoric, underhanded political tactics and subjection of state interests to his own political survival. Some have dubbed him 'Crime Minister' and have accused him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout.Celebrations by his opponents to mark the end of the Netanyahu era began late on Saturday outside his official residence in Jerusalem, the site of weekly protests against the right-wing leader for the past year, where a black banner stretched across a wall read: "Bye Bye, Bibi, Bye bye", and demonstrators sang, beat drums and danced.But for Netanyahu's large and loyal voter base, the departure of "King Bibi" as some call him, may be difficult to accept. His supporters are angered by what they see as the country turning its back on a leader dedicated to its security and a bulwark against international pressure for any steps that could lead to a Palestinian state, even as he promoted diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.None of those moves, however, nor the role he played in securing COVID-19 vaccines for the country's world-beating inoculation campaign, were enough to grant Netanyahu's Likud party enough votes to secure him a sixth term in office.Bennett in particular has drawn anger from within the right-wing camp for breaking a campaign pledge by joining forces with Lapid. He has justified the move by saying another election, which would likely be called were no government formed, would have been a disaster for Israel.Both he and Lapid have said they want to bridge political divides and unite Israelis under a government that will work hard for all its citizens.Their cabinet faces considerable diplomatic, security and financial challenges: Iran, a fragile ceasefire with Palestinian militants in Gaza, a war crimes probe by the International Criminal Court, and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.On top of that, their patchwork coalition of parties commands only a razor-thin majority in parliament, 61 of the Knesset's 120 seats, and will still have to contend with Netanyahu - who is sure to be a combative head of the opposition. And no one is ruling out a Netanyahu comeback.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-reign-set-to-end-as-israel-s-knesset-to-vote-for-new-govt-today-101623561271888.html

The agency cited The News International as saying that Canada, Nepal, Egypt and Sri Lanka have also expressed their regrets at accepting the gift.Also read | Mango diplomacy: How the first crate of Pakistani mangoes impacted Mao’s ChinaThe News International said that the chaunsa variety of mangoes were sent to these countries on behalf of President Dr Arif Alvi.

Michael Packard told local paper Cape Cod Times he was diving for lobster off the coast of the northeastern state of Massachusetts when the humpback whale trapped him in its mouth before coughing him back up."I was in his closed mouth for about 30 to 40 seconds before he rose to the surface and spit me out," the 56-year-old wrote on Facebook hours after. "A humpback whale tried to eat me. I am very bruised up but have no broken bones," he said.Packard initially thought he was inside a great white shark, but he couldn’t feel any teeth and he hadn’t suffered any wounds. “I was completely inside; it was completely black. I thought to myself, ‘there’s no way I’m getting out of here. I’m done, I’m dead.’ All I could think of was my boys — they’re 12 and 15 years old,” Packard told the Cape Cod Times from hospital.Packard was released from Cape Cod Hospital on Friday afternoon, just hours after the incident.'Hard to believe'However, experts and fellow seamen were sceptical about the encounter described by Packard.The New York Post reported citing a doctor at the Cape Cod Hospital, where the lobsterman was treated, saying that a person involved in such an encounter should expect more serious injuries. Hearing loss, because of the sudden change in water pressure from that depth, noted the physician, who did not treat Michael Packard after his brush with the leviathan.“He reportedly ascended from a 45-foot depth in 20 to 40 seconds and didn’t have any evidence of barotrauma?” the Cape Cod Hospital emergency room doctor was quoted as saying by the New York Post.Some fellow seamen were also sceptical. “People who are in the fishing industry, and people who know whales, are finding this hard to believe,” a Bay State lobsterman, who has fished the area for 44 years, told the Post.“It’s a first-ever that this would happen. For a guy to be in the middle of that giant school of fish corralled by a whale doesn’t make sense,” the lobsterman, who was not named by the Post, added.'Wrong place, wrong time'But Jooke Robbins, the director of humpback whale studies at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said does not doubt Packard's account. "I didn't think it was a hoax because I knew the people involved... So I have every reason to believe that what they say is true," she told AFP.Robbins said she had never heard of an "accident" of this type, but "it may be that he (Packard) was just in the wrong place at the wrong time." "When they (whales) fish... they rush forward, open their mouth and engulf the fish and the water very quickly," she saidShe added that whales have large mouths but throats so narrow they wouldn't be able to swallow a human. The whale "may not be able to detect quickly enough that something is in the way," she said.Charles “Stormy” Mayo, a senior scientist and whale expert at the Center for Coastal Studies, told the Cape Cod Times that such human-whale encounters are rare. Mayo said humpback whales are not aggressive and that it was an accidental encounter while the whale was feeding on fish, likely sand lance.Humpback whales can grow to 40 tonnes and are toothless filter feeders who corral large schools of fish or other small marine life in a tight circle before taking massive gulps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fisherman-says-swallowed-by-humpback-whale-experts-weigh-in-101623549528649.html

This year, the theme of the celebration is 'Strength Beyond All Odds'.According to the global body, the theme was chosen to highlight the achievements of people with albinism around the world, show that people with albinism can defy all odds, celebrate how people with albinism worldwide meet and exceed expectations in all domains of life and encourage everyone during this time of a global pandemic to join the global effort to build back better.Here is all you need to know about albinism:-Albinism is a rare and genetically inherited condition present at birth. It is also non-contagious.-For albinism to be passed on, both parents must carry the gene, even if they do not have the condition themselves.-Albinism is found in both sexes, regardless of ethnicity, and in all countries of the world.-Albinism results in a lack of pigmentation (melanin) in the hair, skin and eyes, causing vulnerability to the sun and bright light.-As a result, almost all people with albinism are visually impaired and are prone to developing skin cancer. In some countries, a majority of persons with albinism die from skin cancer between 30 and 40 years of age. -There is no cure for the absence of melanin that is central to albinism.-It is estimated that in North America and Europe, one in every 17,000 to 20,000 people have some form of albinism.-Albinism is much more common in sub-Saharan Africa, with estimates of 1 in 1400 people being affected in Tanzania and prevalence as high as 1 in 1000 reported for a few populations in Zimbabwe and for other specific ethnic groups in southern Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-albinism-awareness-day-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-condition-101623546881543.html
13-06-2021||World||Evidence in Mexico serial killer's house suggests 17 victims||Investigators digging under the house of a suspected serial killer on the outskirts of Mexico City said Saturday they have found 3,787 bone fragments so far, apparently belonging to 17 different victims.Prosecutors in the State of Mexico, which borders Mexico City, suggested the grisly finds may not end there. In excavations carried out since May 17, authorities have dug up the floors of the house where the suspect lived. They now plan to extend the search to the soil beneath several other rooms he rented out on the same property.ID cards and other possessions from people who disappeared years ago were found at the junk-filled home, suggesting the trail of killings may go back years.The number of bone fragments found underneath concrete floors at the suspect's home would imply the corpses may have been hacked into tiny pieces. That could make sense: the suspect, identified by prosecutors only as “Andrés,” was formerly a butcher and in fact sectioned and filleted his last victim.“The bones fragments are being subjected to ‘lateralization’ studies, which include carefully cleaning each one, identifying what part of the body they are and then placing them in their anatomical position, providing a method for determining the approximate number of victims,” the office said in a statement.“This analysis indicates that, up to now, the bone fragments found may possibly be those of 17 people,” the statement said.Authorities have not released the full name of the 72-year-old suspect under Mexican laws protecting a suspect’s identity.He has been ordered to stand trial in the killing of his last victim, a 34-year-old woman whose body he allegedly dismembered with a butcher’s hacksaw and knives on May 14.He was caught, not as a result of keen investigative work, but because his most recent alleged victim was the wife of a police commander whom he knew personally. He was to have accompanied the victim on a shopping trip the day she disappeared, so her husband suspected him when she failed to return.The police officer gained access to police surveillance cameras showing his wife had entered, but not left, the street where the suspect lived; the policeman went to the home, confronted the suspect, and found his wife's hacked-up body inside.But what investigators also found was women’s clothing, voter IDs and audio and video tapes suggesting he may have recorded his victims.The format of the video tapes found at the house may suggest how far the killings went back: authorities found 28 8mm video tapes, which were discontinued around 2007, and 25 VHS cassettes, which largely fell out of favor by 2016.However, outdated tech formats often remain in use in Mexico after they have been abandoned in other countries.In total, prosecutors said they have found 91 photographs, many of the type people would have used to obtain ID cards; eight cellphones, and women's jewelry and makeup.Prosecutors said they are still examining the bone fragments to see if they can extract any DNA to identify the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evidence-in-mexico-serial-killer-s-house-suggests-17-victims-101623547524104.html

13-06-2021||World||Rash of mass shootings in three US states kill 2, injures at least 30 people||Two people were killed and at least 30 others wounded in mass shootings overnight in three states, authorities said Saturday, stoking concerns that a spike in US gun violence could continue into summer as coronavirus restrictions ease and more people are free to socialize.The attacks took place late Friday or early Saturday in the Texas capital of Austin, Chicago and Savannah, Georgia.In Austin, authorities said they arrested one of two male suspects and were searching for the other after a shooting early Saturday on a crowded pedestrian-only street packed with bars and restaurants. Fourteen people were wounded, including two critically, in the gunfire, which the city's interim police chief said is believed to have started as a dispute between two parties.No arrests were reported by late Saturday in the two other shootings.In Chicago, a woman was killed and nine other people were wounded when two men opened fire on a group standing on a sidewalk in the Chatham neighborhood on the city's South Side. The shooters also got away and hadn't been identified by mid-afternoon Saturday.In the south Georgia city of Savannah, police said one man was killed and seven other people were wounded in a mass shooting Friday evening, police said. Two of the wounded are children — an 18-month-old and a 13-year-old.Savannah's police chief, Roy Minter, Jr., said the shooting may be linked to an ongoing dispute between two groups, citing reports of gunshots being fired at the same apartment complex earlier in the week.“It's very disturbing what we're seeing across the country and the level of gun violence that we're seeing across the country," he told reporters Saturday. "It's disturbing and it's senseless.”The attacks come amid an easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions in much of the country, including Chicago, which lifted many of its remaining safeguards on Friday. Many hoped that a spike in US shootings and homicides last year was an aberration perhaps caused by pandemic-related stress amid a rise in gun ownership and debate over policing. But those rates are still higher than they were in pre-pandemic times, including in cities that refused to slash police spending following the death of George Floyd and those that made modest cuts.“There was a hope this might simply be a statistical blip that would start to come down," said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “That hasn't happened. And that's what really makes chiefs worry that we may be entering a new period where we will see a reversal of 20 years of declines in these crimes.”Tracking ups and downs in crime is always complicated, but violent crime commonly increases in the summer months. Weekend evenings and early-morning hours also are common windows for shootings.Many types of crime did decline in 2020 and have stayed lower this year, suggesting the pandemic and the activism and unrest spurred by the reaction to Floyd’s death didn’t lead to an overall spike in crime.The two mass killings in 2020 were the lowest annual total in a decade, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. The database tracks all mass killings including shootings, defined as four or more people dead not including the perpetrator.According to that definition, there have been 17 mass killings, 16 of those shootings, already this year, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University.The Gun Violence Archive, which monitors media and police reports to track gun violence, defines mass shootings as those involving four or more people who were shot, regardless of whether they died. Overall, according to its database, more than 8,700 people have died of gun violence in the U.S. this year.The GVA also found that mass shootings spiked in 2020 to about 600, which was higher than in any of the previous six years it tracked the statistic. According to this year's count, there have been at least 267 mass shootings in the U.S. so far, including the latest three overnight Friday into Saturday.“It’s worrisome,” Fox said. “We have a blend of people beginning to get out and about in public. We have lots of divisiveness. And we have more guns and warm weather. It’s a potentially deadly mix.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rash-of-mass-shootings-in-three-us-states-kill-2-injures-at-least-30-people-101623541189685.html

13-06-2021||World||Iran casts doubt on reviving nuclear deal before its election||Iran cast doubt on the chances of reviving a nuclear accord with world powers before Iranians elect a new president next week who’s likely to be less willing to make concessions.Diplomats convened a sixth and possibly final round of negotiations in Vienna on Saturday. At stake is the 2015 agreement that capped Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Then-President Donald Trump jettisoned the accord three years ago and unilaterally reimposed punishing penalties, prompting Iran to dramatically increase its production of nuclear fuel.”I don’t think we can reach a final conclusion this week,” Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Iranian state television. “I believe we need to return to capital cities at least one more time. So I don’t think we’ll reach a conclusion in this round of talks...I can’t even predict how many days this round of talks will last.”A deal would remove US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and could help calm the Middle East, after the standoff between Tehran and the Trump administration fueled regional conflicts and coincided with a spate of unclaimed attacks on shipping.Plenary talks between China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and the U.K. convened before technical groups break off to negotiate over sanctions and nuclear activities. Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief who’s coordinating sessions, is charged with shuttling messages and instructions between delegates and American envoy Robert Malley as long as the US formally remains outside the accord.Hours before arriving in Vienna for talks, Araghchi accused the Biden administration on Twitter of continuing to “immiserate” Iranians by levying sanctions amid a pandemic.Russia’s envoy Mikhail Ulyanov said questions remain about whether a final document can be achieved.European diplomats have warned for weeks that resurrecting the deal could become more complicated if an agreement isn’t struck before Iran’s presidential election on June 18.Araghchi said the outcome of Iran’s election will have “no bearing” on the talks in Austria.Asked if one week is enough time to reach a deal, assuming there’s a will on both sides to do so, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Thursday that “big issues” continue to divide the sides.“We are moving at a pace that is consistent with our desire to see Iran’s nuclear program once again restricted and to see Iran, once again, subject to a permanent and verifiable ban on ever obtaining a nuclear weapon,” he said.Previous deadlines for mid-May and early June were missed after sides remained deadlocked over the scope and timing of sanctions relief, as well as the possibility of follow-on talks about regional security.An Iranian government spokesman said this week that the country’s approach toward restoring the deal won’t change after President Hassan Rouhani, who championed the accord, leaves office in August. But he’s widely expected to be succeeded by conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who’s generally seen as hostile to engagement with the US.Mora told delegates after adjourning the last round of negotiations that both the US and Iran needed to make “hard decisions” that could ruffle domestic political constituencies.‘Galloping Forward’Members of both parties in the US Congress remain opposed to the accord, making it harder for the Biden administration to lift non-nuclear-related sanctions -- as demanded by Iranian lawmakers -- before Tehran rolls back the advances in its enrichment program.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that Iran’s nuclear program is “galloping forward” in the absence of an agreement. Iran, home to the world’s No. 2 natural gas and No. 4 oil reserves, began enriching uranium close to the levels needed for nuclear weapons in April and its stockpile of fuel has been growing.“It’s becoming increasingly difficult,” said International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi this week, whose inspectors will face greater restrictions on access to Iranian nuclear sites once a temporary monitoring pact expires on June 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-casts-doubt-on-reviving-nuclear-deal-before-its-election-101623533620552.html
13-06-2021||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro fined for flouting Covid-19 mask rule during motorcycle rally in Sao Paulo||Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro led a throng of motorcyclist supporters through the streets of Sao Paulo on Saturday — and got hit with a fine for failure to wear a mask, in violation of local pandemic restrictions.The conservative president waved to the crowd from his motorcycle and later from atop a sound truck, where helmeted but largely maskless backers cheered and chanted as he insisted that masks were useless for those already vaccinated — an assertion disputed by most public health experts.Sao Paulo's state government press office said a fine — equivalent to about $110 — would be imposed for violation of a rule that has required masks in public places since May 2020.Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The procession of cyclists wound out of the city and back, arriving at Ibirapuera Park, where the president clambered atop a car to defend his denunciation of masks for the vaccinated.“Whoever is against this proposal is because they don't believe in science, because if they are vaccinated, there is no way the virus can be transmitted,” he said.Vaccines are designed chiefly to protect recipients from getting sick, not necessarily from being infected. While studies show many vaccines reduce viral load, and likely spread, not all varieties have been fully studied.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “The risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus.”Less than 12% of Brazil's population so far has received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Ministry of Health, and many Brazilian experts say masks can only be abandoned after the majority of the population has been vaccinated.Bolsonaro also was fined for failure to wear a mask during a rally with supporters in May in the northeastern state of Maranhao.Governors of that state and Sao Paulo have been feuding with Bolsonaro over their restrictive measures to stifle the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-fined-for-flouting-covid-19-mask-rule-during-motorcycle-rally-in-sao-paulo-101623529763092.html

Biden said in a statement Saturday that he has “stayed in touch with families of the victims and with the survivors who have turned their pain into purpose" and described the club as “hallowed ground.”The president emphasized that the country must do more to reduce gun violence, such as banning assault weapons and closing loopholes in regulations that enable gun buyers to bypass background checks. Biden said the nation must acknowledge that gun violence has hurt members of the LGBTQ community“We must drive out hate and inequities that contribute to the epidemic of violence and murder against transgender women — especially transgender women of color,” Biden said.White House advisers Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual roundtable on Friday with LGBTQ leaders, gun violence survivors and gun control advocates.Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, walked Saturday with the crowd for the Capitol Pride Walk And Rally in Washington.“We still have so much to do," Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-fifth-anniversary-of-pulse-nightclub-shooting-joe-biden-to-name-site-a-national-memorial-101623528949797.html

I am almost crying. We fought peacefully for this and the day has come," said protester Ofir Robinski."Netanyahu only tried to divide us and set each part of society against the other. But tomorrow we'll be united: right, left, Jews and Arabs."Protesters blew vuvuzelas or beat drums, while some wore T-shirt that read in Hebrew: "Bibi Lekh" (get out)."We are about to be done with a dark era for Israel," said Ram Shamir.Another protester, Gali Israel Tal, 62, was also optimistic that the Knesset vote on Sunday would spell Netanyahu's political demise."This is our last Saturday here. We won. Tomorrow the Knesset will vote and this prime minister will go. It is good. He will go," she said.Anti-Netanyahu protests have been staged each Saturday since July last year to denounce his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy.Protesters have condemned Netanyahu who became the first sitting Israeli prime minister indicted while in office, and is on trial for corruption.He is accused of accepting improper gifts and seeking to trade regulatory favours with media moguls in exchange for positive coverage -- allegations which he denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-anti-netanyahu-protesters-in-jerusalem-claim-victory-on-eve-of-israel-vote-101623528619949.html

He said that reaching the goal requires 100 million doses in June and July, and 250 million more by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-covid-19-vaccine-need-outstrips-pledges-by-g7-countries-101623526417157.html

It was the first time in 15 months that the number of security screenings has surpassed 2 million in a single day.Airline bookings have been picking up since around February, as more Americans were vaccinated against Covid-19. In the US, travel restrictions, such as mandatory quarantines, have eased.The crowds Friday were only 74% of the volume compared to the same day in 2019. However, the 2.03 million was 1.5 million more travelers than the same day last year, according to the TSA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-travel-rebounds-as-more-people-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101623523949196.html
13-06-2021||World||Iran nuclear deal: EU talks up hope of breakthrough at meetings in Vienna||European Union negotiators said international talks that resumed Saturday on the Iran nuclear agreement were on track to revive the deal, which crumbled after the United States withdrew in 2018.Senior diplomats from China, Germany, France, Russia, and Britain concluded a 90-minute meeting with Iranian representatives at a hotel in the Austrian capital.“We are making progress, but the negotiations are intense and a number of issues (remain), including on how steps are to be implemented,” EU representative Alain Matton told reporters in Vienna.The United States is not formally part of meetings that launched in Vienna earlier this year. But the administration of President Joe Biden has signalled willingness to rejoin the deal under terms that would broadly see the US scale back sanctions on Tehran and Iran return to abiding by the limits on its nuclear activity contained in the 2015 agreement.“The EU will continue with the talks with all the participants...and separately with the United States to find ways to get very close to a final agreement in the coming days,” Matton said.Diplomats say complicating factors have included the sequence of the proposed measures, dealing with advances in Iran's nuclear processing capability since the United States withdrew, and the presidential election in Iran next week.Officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 deal provided Iran vital sanctions relief in exchange for a commitment to allow extensive international monitoring as it dismantled much of its nuclear programme.Former President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, arguing that it handed Tehran too many concessions while failing to curb its aggression in the region and ambitions to build a nuclear weapon. US sanctions that were re-imposed and intensified under Trump tipped Iran into a severe recession and enriching more uranium than permitted under the deal.Iranian officials have balked at the suggestion that some of the terms agreed to in 2015 would have to be updated, insisting that it would return to nuclear compliance as soon as Washington restored its pre-Trump sanctions policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-deal-eu-talks-up-hope-of-breakthrough-at-meetings-in-vienna-101623523273206.html
