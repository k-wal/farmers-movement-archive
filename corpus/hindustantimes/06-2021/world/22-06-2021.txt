Spotlighting the highly transmissible strain, Fauci said the Delta variant is more easily transmitted than the original Covid-19 variant. The variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said on Friday."The transmissibility is unquestionably greater in the Delta variant than the original variant of Covid-19," Fauci said. The variant is associated with increased disease severity," he added. The Delta variant contributed to a severe outbreak of Covid-19 in India during April and May that overwhelmed health services in the country and killed hundreds of thousands. The variant, experts say, drove the deadly second wave in the country unleashing a crisis with daily cases being clocked at more than 400,000, crematoriums running out of space and wood to cremate bodies, and collapse of health infrastructure across states.Turning the focus on US' artillery to fight the disease, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said that the vaccines widely available in the nation are effective against the Delta variant. The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, Fauci said. "The vaccines authorized in the United States, including the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, are effective against the new variant of Covid-19. We have the tools, so let's use them and crush the outbreak," Fauci said.The White House on Tuesday said the US may need additional few weeks to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of adults. Earlier, the Biden administration had set the target of July 4 - the Independence Day - to vaccinate 70% of adults in the US. White House Covid-19 senior adviser Jeffrey Zients said he expects 70% of adults over 27 years old will have had at least one shot by July 4.More than 150 million people in the United States, or more than 45% of the population, have been fully vaccinated, according to federal data last updated on Monday.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday pointed towards the reluctance among younger American adults for getting vaccine doses, as they are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults. This is likely to hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-covid-19-variant-found-in-india-greatest-threat-to-us-pandemic-response-says-fauci-101624383753587.html

The 24-year-old Vismaya, an Ayurveda medical student, allegedly died by suicide in the bathroom of her husband's house at Sasthamkotta district in south Kerala on Monday.The woman's family has alleged torture and harassment by her husband S Kiran Kumar, an assistant motor vehicles inspector, over dowry. A day after the woman was found dead, the police arrested Kumar and charged him under section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (dowry death). Kumar was taken into custody last night on the basis of her family's complaint.Vismaya was beaten, dragged and stamped on her face: FamilyHighlighting repeated torture from Kumar's family, Vismaya's kin alleged that their daughter was beaten, mistreated and tortured in her in-law's house.A day before the incident, Vismaya sent an SOS to her family in a series of WhatsApp messages over the alleged harassment she was suffering from Kumar over dowry.Vismaya shared photos of the wounds and marks of beatings on her body which she suffered during the recent severe physical torture from Kumar, the relatives alleged.Vismaya, in the WhatsApp chat, said that her husband did not like the car gifted by her father as dowry and used to thrash her over that. Vismaya said she was dragged by her hair and stamped on the face over dowry. The harassment was especially over the car by Kumar who used to verbally abuse Vismaya's father, saying that he deserved more dowry according to his stature but got only very little.How much dowry was Kumar givenVismaya's father Thrivikraman Nair claimed that their family had given 100 sovereigns of gold and over one-acre land, besides a car worth ₹10 lakh car as dowry to Kumar during their wedding in 2020, reported PTI.Nair added that Kumar had assaulted his daughter in front of him as well over the dowry demand."But he did not like the car and wanted ₹10 lakh as cash instead. As I said it was not possible, he used to torture my daughter. He had beaten Vismaya in front of us after coming to our home at midnight last January, he said.What is the family sayingNair has alleged that his daughter would never die by suicide and it was a case of murder by Kumar's family.What happens to Kumar and his family nowShortly after the incident was reported, the State Transport Department suspended Kumar from service. Kumar was taken into police custody on Monday night and was arrested the next morning over charges of dowry death.Other legal measures will also be taken against Kumar after getting the post-mortem report, he said. Now, Kumar would be produced before the court and his custody will be sought later as more investigation is required. The role of his relatives in the incident would also be probed, police said.The state police chief Loknath Behera has said that the incident has shaken the conscience of people in Kerala. He assured of stringent legal action against those allegedly involved in the incidents that led to the woman's death.Behera said inspector general of police Harshitha Attalluri will head the investigation, involving all senior police officials. "It is a very sad incident which has affected the conscience of Kerala. Such incidents are very rare in our society, which is a tolerant and advanced society," he said.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

But more than half — 477 — worked in the special agent division, which is responsible for protecting the president and vice president, as well as the families of these leaders and other government officials.CREW noted that the Trump administration took actions that risked exposure to Secret Service workers, but it could not verify a direct connection to possible infections because the identities of those infected remains private.After President Donald Trump contracted Covid-19, he took a drive in his presidential vehicle as Secret Service personnel drove and protected him. The former president also held multiple large rallies and events, including the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, despite restrictions on public gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-900-secret-service-employees-were-infected-with-covid19-101624378031739.html

standards, Finland should be deluged by people wanting to relocate, but in fact it faces an acute workforce shortage."It's now widely acknowledged that we need a spectacular number of people to come to the country," recruiter Saku Tihverainen from agency Talented Solutions told AFP.Workers are needed "to help cover the cost of the greying generation", the recruiter explained.While many Western countries are battling weak population growth, few are feeling the effects as sharply as Finland.With 39.2 over-65s per 100 working-age people, it is second only to Japan in the extent of its ageing population, according to the UN, which forecasts that by 2030 the "old age dependency ratio" will rise to 47.5.The government has warned that the nation of 5.5 million needs to practically double immigration levels to 20,000-30,000 a year to maintain public services and plug a looming pensions deficit.Finland might seem like an attractive destination on paper, scoring high in international comparisons for quality of life, freedom and gender equality, with little corruption, crime and pollution.But anti-immigrant sentiment and a reluctance to employ outsiders are also widespread in Western Europe's most homogenous society, and the opposition far-right Finns Party regularly draws substantial support during elections.Also Read | India ranks 139 out of 149 countries in World Happiness Report | Here's list of 20 happiest nations- Tipping point -After years of inertia, businesses and government "are now at the tipping point and are recognising the problem" posed by a greying population, said Charles Mathies, a research fellow at the Academy of Finland.Mathies is one of the experts consulted by the government's "Talent Boost" programme, now in its fourth year, which aims to make the country more attractive internationally, in part through local recruitment schemes.Those targeted include health workers from Spain, metalworkers from Slovakia, and IT and maritime experts from Russia, India and Southeast Asia.But previous such efforts have petered out.In 2013, five of the eight Spanish nurses recruited to the western town of Vaasa left after a few months, citing Finland's exorbitant prices, cold weather and notoriously complex language.Finland has nonetheless seen net immigration for much of the last decade, with around 15,000 more people arriving than leaving in 2019.But many of those quitting the country are higher-educated people, official statistics show.Faced with the OECD's largest skilled worker shortage, some Finnish startups are creating a joint careers site to better bag overseas talent."As you can imagine, this is a slow burner," Shaun Rudden from food delivery firm Wolt said in an email, adding that "We try to make the relocation process as painless as possible."- Systemic problem -Startups "have told me that they can get anyone in the world to come and work for them in Helsinki, as long as he or she is single," the capital's mayor, Jan Vapaavuori, said to AFP.But "their spouses still have huge problems getting a decent job."Many foreigners complain of a widespread reluctance to recognise overseas experience or qualifications, as well as prejudice against non-Finnish applicants.Ahmed (who requested his name be changed for professional reasons) is a 42-year-old Brit with many years' experience in building digital products for multinational, household-name companies.Yet six months of networking and applying for jobs in Helsinki, where he was trying to move for family reasons, proved fruitless."One recruiter even refused to shake my hand, that was a standout moment," he told AFP."There was never a shortage of jobs going, just a shortage of mindset," said Ahmed, who during his search in Finland received offers from major companies in Norway, Qatar, the UK and Germany, and eventually began commuting weekly from Helsinki to Dusseldorf.Recruiter Saku Tihverainen said shortages are pushing more companies to loosen their insistence on only employing native Finnish workers."And yet, a lot of the Finnish companies and organisations are very adamant about using Finnish, and very fluent Finnish at that," he said.- Changing priorities -For Helsinki mayor Jan Vaaavuori, four years of Finland being voted the world's happiest country in a UN ranking have "not yet helped as much as we could have hoped.""If you stop someone in the street in Paris or London or Rome or New York, I still don't think most people know about us," he mused.Mayor Vapaavuori, whose four-year term ends this summer, has turned increasingly to international PR firms to help raise the city's profile.He is optimistic about Finland's ability to attract talent from Asia in future, and believes people's priorities will have changed once international mobility ramps up again post-coronavirus.Helsinki's strengths, being "safe, functional, reliable, predictable -- those values have gained in importance," he said, adding: "Actually I think our position after the pandemic is better than it was before."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-happiest-country-seeks-it-professionals-from-india-101624381902927.html

He was a coward since day one," said the PPP leader.In an interview with Axios' on HBO, Khan said: "If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense.""...I said the concept of 'purdah'. Avoid temptation in society. We don't have discos here, we don't have nightclubs. It is a completely different society way of life here. So if you raise temptation in society to a point -- all these young guys have nowhere to go --- it has a consequence in the society," he also said.This comes two months after Imran Khan's comments on sexual violence drew severe backlash, where he had said that the rise in such violence in Pakistan, particularly against children, was caused due to "fahashi" (vulgarity).Official statistics in Pakistan have revealed that at least 11 rape incidents are reported in the country every day, with over 22,000 cases reported to the police in the last six years.However, only 77 of the accused have been convicted which comprises 0.3 per cent of the total figure, reported Geo News.Khan's latest controversial remarks have led to an outpouring of furious comments on social media as netizens termed his comments as "victim-blaming".Reacting to the comments, journalist Gharidah Farooqi described her reaction to the premier's words as "disgusted," "appalled" and "outraged", reported Dawn."Disgusted. Appalled. Outraged. Strongly condemnable. No, Mr PM Khan, women clothing is NOT responsible for temptation leading to rape/assault/violence. ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is victim-blaming and giving a pass to men. Don't insult victims. Don't justify rape as temptation," she tweeted.Another scribe, Shahmir Sanni, said: "What is most heinous about Imran Khan's justifications for rape, is that nearly every woman that has been raped in Pakistan has worn what he would prescribe as modest clothing. This has nothing to do with clothes, but just another man trying to escape accountability. It is sick."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-a-coward-bilawal-bhutto-slams-pak-pm-over-his-remarks-on-rape-101624375814550.html

The annual report has ranked 209 cities across five continents by measuring the comparative cost of more than 200 items, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods, and entertainment. The survey used New York City, ranked 14 on the list, as the base city and currency movements were measured against the US dollar.List of top 10 expensive cities mostly features global financial hubs like Hong Kong, which was the priciest last year, Tokyo, Shanghai, Zurich and Singapore. Mercer has cited Turkmenistan’s ongoing financial crisis as the reason for Ashgabat's high cost of living. Another outlier on the list is third-ranked Beirut which climbed 42 positions up the ranking due to a severe and extensive economic depression owing to several crises, including coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the Port of Beirut explosion in 2020.Mumbai remains India’s most expensive city at 78th rank but has dropped 18 places in this year’s ranking “due to a relatively weak Indian rupee in comparison with other cities in the ranking.” Other Indian cities on the list are New Delhi (117), Chennai (158), Bengaluru (170), and Kolkata (181).Also Read | Auckland tops Global Liveability Index 2021; Dhaka, Karachi in bottom 10.

22-06-2021||World||‘Zero tolerance for terrorism...’: India takes aim at Pakistan at UNSC debate||India on Tuesday took aim at Pakistan for impeding efforts to improve security and development in Afghanistan, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar calling for zero tolerance for cross-border terrorism and full transit rights for the war-torn country.Jaishankar didn’t name Pakistan in his statement at a UN Security Council debate on the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, but there was little doubt which country he was referring to IN his remarks. While calling for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to end a surge in violence, including targeted attacks on women, minorities and civil society activists, Jaishankar said India will welcome any move towards a genuine political settlement in Afghanistan.“For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its cross-border one,” he said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan. “It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country. Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.Durable peace in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said, requires “a genuine double peace” or peace within and around the country. The world community, he added, must deliver on its commitments to Afghanistan to ensure development and reconstruction. Also read: China raises new militias of Tibetan youth, deploys 1st batch in Chumbi Valley“For Afghanistan’s economic development, it is important to have unhindered access to the high seas. The international community should work towards the removal of artificial transit barriers imposed on Afghanistan and ensure full transit rights guaranteed to Afghanistan under bilateral and multilateral transit agreements without any hindrance,” he said.Pakistan has barred the movement of Indian goods through its territory to Afghanistan while allowing Afghan exports to India, despite strong objections from the government in Kabul over the years. To overcome such transit and transport-related problems, India has launched several air trade corridors between Afghan and Indian cities and developed Iran’s Chabahar port as an alternate access point to Afghanistan. New Delhi’s growing concerns over a recent surge in violence across Afghanistan, largely blamed on the Taliban, also figured in Jaishankar’s comments. He noted the UN secretary-general’s latest report on the situation in Afghanistan had made it clear the intra-Afghan talks hadn’t resulted in a reduction of violence. “On the contrary, violence has only increased, especially after May 1. The country has been witnessing targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, girl students, Afghan security forces, ulemas, women occupying positions of responsibility, journalists, civil rights activists and the youth,” he said.“It is, therefore, crucial that the international community and in particular, this council, presses for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian rights,” he added. India has backed all efforts to accelerate dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but if the peace process is to be successful, it is “necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, eschew the path to find a military solution, and fully commit towards reaching a political solution”, Jaishankar said. “I would like to reiterate our support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process. Any political settlement in Afghanistan must ensure that the gains of the last two decades are protected and not reversed,” he said, adding the constitutional and democratic framework must be preserved.Jaishankar also highlighted India’s recent steps to support Afghanistan during the transition period, including more than 550 community development projects covering all 34 provinces, an MoU for building the Shahtoot Dam to provide drinking water to Kabul, and the supply of 75,000 tonnes of wheat through Chabahar port to ensure food security amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zero-tolerance-for-terrorism-india-takes-aim-at-pakistan-at-unsc-debate-101624374640331.html

Even as they kept their guard up against the highly transmissible Delta variant, first found in India, at least nine countries have started reporting cases of mutated Delta plus variant strain.The Delta plus variant is also called B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 strain. Out of the details emerging about the Delta Plus variant, the most noticeable one is the fact that the new strain is resistant to the monoclonal antibodies cocktail.India on Tuesday said it has at least 22 cases of the Delta plus variant, which the government has classified as a variant of interest so far. The strain from which it has mutated from Delta has been listed as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Delta Plus variant of the Covid-19 variant is found in nine countries, including India which has reported 22 cases, the central government said on Tuesday.These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia.Delta variant, officials said is found in 80 nations, including India"In India, 16 of the 22 cases of Delta Plus variant have been found in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon (Maharashtra) and some cases in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh", Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary said.As many as 21 cases of the Delta Plus Covid variant, the mutant version of the Delta variant have been found in Maharashtra, health minister Rajesh Tope informed on Monday. Tope further informed that of the 21 cases, nine were reported from Jalgaon in Ratnagiri, seven were from Mumbai and one each from Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane.The Delta variant is considered to have driven the deadly second wave in India where the country witnessed a crisis with daily cases being clocked at more than 400,000, crematoriums running out of space and wood to cremate bodies and collapse of health infrastructure across states.Officials added that the severity and transmissibility of the Delta plus variant are not known yet."This is a variant of interest that has not yet been classified as a variant of concern. A variant of concern is in which we have understood that there are adverse consequences to humanity by an increase in transmissibility and severity. This is not known yet about the Delta plus variant," VK Paul, NITI Aayog Member (Health) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-plus-variant-traced-in-9-countries-uk-us-japan-china-on-list-101624366833126.html

Jeff Bezos along with his brother, Mark, and another person, presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado who won the bid for the third berth on the spaceship for a whopping $28million, will fly to space on July 20.The launch of the New Shepard booster, a launch vehicle named after Alan Shepard who made history by becoming the first American to fly to space, will be a landmark moment for US firms striving toward a new era of private commercial space travel. While Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips, a Reuters report in 2018 suggested that the space company was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations.But the announcement also prompted a user called “Ric G.” to start a petition titled ‘Do not allow Jeff Bezos to return to Earth’ on change.org, a popular US-based petition website. “Billionaire's should not exist...on earth, or in space, but should they decide the latter they should stay there,” reads the opening statement. The petition, which was started two weeks ago, has received over 75,000 signatures and has become one of the top-signed petitions on the website.Also Read | Rocket trip to space with Jeff Bezos sells at auction for $28 millionThose signing the petition have their own reasons to not allow Bezos back on Earth. “Being let back into earth is a privilege— not a right.

It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It's one Earth. I want to go on this flight because it's a thing I've wanted to do all my life. It's an adventure, it's a big deal for me,” said Bezos in the video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-sign-petition-to-stop-bezos-from-returning-to-earth-after-space-trip-101624368858020.html

That figure has climbed by more than half since 2019, stoked by conflict, climate change and economic shocks.A recent surge in prices for staples, coupled with depreciating currencies, is compounding food insecurity in countries including Nigeria, Lebanon and Zimbabwe. Global corn prices have nearly doubled from last year, and wheat costs are up by 30%, said the agency, which was the latest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.“I am heartbroken at what we’re facing in 2021,” said David Beasley, the WFP’s executive director. “I want to emphasize just how bad it is out there.

Covid cases have sharply declined in countries with high vaccination coverage but anti-vaxxers claim that such immunity may not last very long.Melissa Floyd, a self-described "informed consent advocate" and co-host of "The Vaccine Conversation" podcast, wrote on Twitter that natural immunity from infection always lasts longer than the immunity induced by vaccines. “For the few [vaccines] that last 10-15 years, natural antibodies would have lasted a lifetime (or close to it). There has never been a pathogen where artificial immunity outperformed natural immunity,” tweeted Floyd.Disinformation campaigns to undermine public confidence in Covid vaccines have surged online and authorities have been facing an onerous task to fight vaccine hesitancy. Quoting experts, USA Today said that both infection and vaccination are protective against coronavirus and scientists are yet to arrive at a conclusion whether vaccine-induced immunity lasts longer than the natural immunity given the limited time of virus’ existence.“It is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines. Whereas immunity from disease often follows a single natural infection, immunity from vaccines usually occurs only after several doses,” says Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on its website. However, it highlights that the difference between vaccination and natural infection is the price paid for immunity, citing long-term effects and death due to infection.A study conducted by a team of researchers from Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York found that immunity among people who contract Covid-19 remains stable up from six months to a year, and they get even better protection when vaccinated. The findings, published in Nature, offer among the first concrete clues that immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 may be long-lasting.Also Read | Immunity lasts at least a year after infection, gets stronger after jab: StudyCiting studies, virologist Sabra Klein told Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that people who have been infected can benefit significantly from vaccination. On the question of vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity, Klein stressed that vaccines are tested for their safety in ways that “we could never do with a natural viral infection.”“With infection, you don’t know how bad it’s going to be. By not getting vaccinated, you’re rolling the dice. You may become severely ill. You may have to be hospitalized. You may die,” Klein added.Highlighting the risk of long Covid, the virologist said that a teenage girl who got Covid didn’t have a lot of symptoms initially but now “she has all of the symptoms of long Covid”. “A year later, she is trying to maintain a somewhat normal teenage life with profound fatigue. She has never recovered fully from having Covid,” Klein was quoted as saying.“The claim that immunity from infection is always stronger than immunity from vaccines is [partly false], based on our research. While natural immunity tends to last longer than vaccine immunity, experts say it depends on the pathogen,” said USA Today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immunity-from-infection-or-covid-19-vaccine-which-one-lasts-longer-101624366027633.html

Only about 8.6% of its eligible population -- comprising people aged 40 years or more -- is fully vaccinated.Bangladesh on Tuesday locked down seven central districts surrounding the capital Dhaka to restrict public transport and human mobility. It reported 4,636 coronavirus cases on Monday, the most in a day since mid-April, raising the caseload to 851,668. The reported death toll is 13,626.Hasina said her administration has announced stimulus steps of about $15 billion, which will help the economy grow 6.1% in the year through June 30, one of the fastest paces in the world.“We have been trying to make a balance between lives and livelihoods,” she said. “Covid-19 is a litmus test for global solidarity.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/declare-covid-19-vaccine-public-good-says-bangladesh-s-sheikh-hasina-101624365486193.html
22-06-2021||World||Long Covid may help understand other chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s||There’s a lot at stake in the quest to understand so-called long Covid. It may come as a surprise to some, but lingering post-infection symptoms don’t only happen with SARS-CoV-2. And what we’re learning from studies of Covid long-haulers might eventually help us understand other diseases, from chronic fatigue syndrome to cancer to Alzheimer’s.“What we're seeing in Covid isn't really exactly new,” said epidemiologist Zihad Al-Aly, who is studying long Covid at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. “There are a lot of other viruses that produce long-term manifestations.”Before Covid came along, many previously healthy people developed debilitating symptoms or extreme exhaustion following viral infections. Such post-viral syndromes were inherently difficult to study, said NIH director of clinical neurology Avindra Nath. Many patients wouldn’t realize there was something wrong for some time after the initial infection, since it’s normal to feel wiped out for a couple of weeks of being sick.It isn’t yet clear which viruses are likely to cause chronic symptoms or which kinds of people are most at risk from them. Often lumped together as chronic fatigue syndrome, even the numbers are hard to pin down — an Institute of Medicine estimate ranges from 800,000 to 2.5 million cases in the U.S.About 75% are thought to have been triggered by a viral or bacterial infection, according to an article in the Washington Post by two people who have lived for years with the condition. One of them, Brian Vastag, had been a science reporter for the Washington Post before his illness, which started with a sudden fever in 2012. At least now, with long Covid, researchers know which virus has caused the problem. Al-Aly says he hopes what they learn from Covid long-haulers helps them understand chronic fatigue syndrome as well. And he hopes it will help change the way the medical establishment views all post-viral syndromes. “Because we don't fully understand it yet, there's a tendency by some in the medical establishment to disregard this as all in people’s heads.”The experts say between 10% to 30% of those infected with Covid will have some lingering problems. Many people who develop very severe Covid and survive after being in the ICU suffer damage to the heart, lungs, liver and blood vessels that can cause on-going symptoms.Then there’s the separate group of relatively young people — most often people in their late 30s to early 40s and more often women than men — who initially have mild cases of Covid but then go on to develop chronic fatigue and other symptoms that can stretch on for months. Some symptoms might even be permanent.Both kinds of cases are important. People who survived Covid-19 are 59% more likely to die within the following six months than people who were never infected, according to a study led by Al-Aly, which was published in April in the journal Nature, and detailed in this Bloomberg News story.While there are a lot of unknowns here, what is known is that some people do get better on their own, says NIH’s Nath. A few improved after getting the Covid-19 vaccines, he says, though many have relapsed since then. The ones who’ve had symptoms for more than six months are the least likely to recover.Nath says that rather than ordinary fatigue, many people with long Covid suffer from an extreme form of exercise intolerance, where even moderate exertion can deplete them for days. Others have lingering gastrointestinal problems, brain fog, chronic pain, anxiety and depression.At the NIH, he’s testing people reporting these post-viral symptoms — with physiological tests as well as brain scans — and preparing to start clinical trials on drugs that might help them.There are a couple of hypotheses for what causes long Covid. One is the possibility that the virus never really disappears from the body, but finds somewhere to hide. That can happen with other viruses — herpes viruses are a well-known example. The other possibility is that the immune system becomes imbalanced and attacks the body’s own tissues.Last week, researchers published a study aimed at assessing the magnitude of the problem by analyzing electronic health records. They determined that 23% of people who had recovered from Covid-19 went to the doctor for new medical conditions.The problem with that study is that there’s no control group — we don’t know how many people generally would have sought medical treatment during this time. More people may be visiting doctors now because so many “elective” medical visits were cancelled during the height of the pandemic, and fear made people reluctant to seek medical care even signs of heart attacks and strokes.Al-Aly said that his Nature paper did use control groups – comparing people post-Covid with people who hadn’t been infected as well as people who had been sick with influenza. Those studies revealed that Covid-19 infections were much more likely than flu to be associated with health problems — even death — weeks and months later.In the past, infectious diseases were considered something separate from chronic diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. But the distinctions have been falling. Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus, and a theory connecting infections to Alzheimer’s disease is gaining traction. Post-viral syndromes fell through the crack in the middle, but that’s rightly starting to change.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Faye Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and host of the podcast 'Follow the Science.'

The UN World Heritage Committee on Monday said in a draft report that “there is no possible doubt” that the network of colourful corals off Australia's northeast coast was “facing ascertained danger".Scientists say that the coral reef ecosystem has suffered three major bleaching events since 2015 due to severe marine heatwaves. The report recommended that the world's biggest coral reef ecosystem should be added to Unesco’s list of World Heritage in Danger when the committee considers that question in July.As many as 53 sites are currently on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The latest recommendation by the UN committee comes as a setback as Australia lobbied furiously for years to stay off the endangered list. The Great Barrier Reef losing its World Heritage Site status list could potentially reduce its attraction to tourists.Australia, one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita, has remained reluctant to commit to stronger climate action and its conservative government has cited jobs as a major reason to back the country's fossil fuel industries. It has not updated its climate goals since 2015. But the threat of losing the World Heritage Site could also impact thousands of jobs dependent on about 5 million people who visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.Also Read | Australia's new deputy PM casts shadow over 2050 net zero emissions ambitionAustralian environment minister Sussan Ley told reporters that the government has expressed “strong disappointment” and “bewilderment” at the proposal to Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay, adding that the country will oppose the listing.“This decision was flawed. Clearly, there were politics behind it...clearly, those politics have subverted a proper process and for the World Heritage Committee to not even foreshadow this listing is, I think, appalling,” Ley said, apparently hinting at China which chairs the Unesco committee.While Ley didn’t name Beijing, a government official told news agency Reuters that China has been responsible for the committee’s stance. "We will appeal, but China is in control," Reuters quoted the unnamed government official as saying.Australia’s relation with China has deteriorated in recent years, especially after Prime Minister Scott Morrison sought an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and was successful in getting a related resolution passed at the World Health Assembly in 2020.However, environmental groups said that the recommendation was made because Australia was not doing enough to protect the reef. "There is no avenue for any government to have any input. This recommendation is reached by world-renowned scientists," Richard Leck, Head of Oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature, Australia, told Reuters.The recommendation will now be considered by all 21 countries on the committee of which Australia is also a member. According to the convention, however, Australia will be unable to vote if the panel is unable to reach a consensus.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unesco-recommends-great-barrier-reef-be-listed-in-danger-irks-australia-101624354493692.html

That's the case for Laurel but also the team in New Zealand - they have followed the rules," Ardern told reporters in Wellington."The alternative is to have someone who followed the rules but then is denied the ability to participate."So, ultimately, I leave it to those bodies and that's the decision they have made and it's in keeping with the standard that has been set globally."Hubbard, who will be the oldest lifter at the Games, competed in men's weightlifting competitions before transitioning in 2013.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued guidelines in 2015 allowing transgender athletes to compete as women provided their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months before their first competition.Some scientists have said the guidelines do little to mitigate the biological advantages of those who have gone through puberty as males, such as bone and muscle density.Supporters of transgender inclusion argue the process of transition decreases that advantage considerably and that physical differences between athletes mean there is never a truly level playing field in sport.Australia's weightlifting federation tried to block Hubbard from competing in the women's event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games but has been supportive of her selection for Tokyo.Australian lifter Charisma Amoe-Tarrant, who will compete against Hubbard in the 87 kg division, wished Hubbard well."I have so much respect for her and ... hope we can all come together and enjoy the Olympics," the Nauru-born 22-year-old told reporters in Brisbane on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nz-pm-jacinda-ardern-backs-transgender-weightlifter-s-selection-for-tokyo-games-101624349004907.html

The daily positive rate of infections in Nepal stands at more than 24%, among the highest in the world at this time.The travel restriction was imposed after the climbing season began and there were fresh outbreaks in Nepal.Tsang, 44, who climbed Mount Everest in 25 hours and 50 minutes last month, said getting back home appeared harder than her ascent to the 8,848.86 metre (29,032 feet) peak.“I think the summit climb for me was possible and achievable,” she told Reuters at her hotel in Kathmandu. “But going back home (looks) hopeless. There is no way to go back.”Nepal officials say they have allowed two weekly flights from China, but these were not operational.The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu did not immediately respond to a Reuters email on the lack of flights."There are no flights (from Nepal) to any place in China or Hong Kong,” she said.Climbers from other countries have already returned on mainly chartered flights.China's Sun Yi Quan, 34, who climbed Everest thrice before but gave up on his fourth attempt in May due to a coronavirus outbreak at base camp, said his team of 13 climbers too had failed to get a flight back home.Kathmandu has been partially shut down since May due to the surge in Covid-19 with 622,640 infections and 8,772 deaths in he nation so far.Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, a senior official at the Seven Summit Treks company said more than 30 Chinese climbers were stranded in Kathmandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harder-than-everest-record-breaking-female-climber-stranded-in-nepal-101624344987210.html
22-06-2021||World||Nursing home deaths in US soared by 32% last year, says govt watchdog||Deaths among Medicare patients in nursing homes soared by 32% last year, with two devastating spikes eight months apart, a government watchdog reported Tuesday in the most comprehensive look yet at the ravages of Covid-19 among its most vulnerable victims.The report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that about 4 in 10 Medicare recipients in nursing homes had or likely had Covid-19 in 2020, and that deaths overall jumped by 169,291 from the previous year, before the coronavirus appeared.“We knew this was going to be bad, but I don't think even those of us who work in this area thought it was going to be this bad,” said Harvard health policy professor David Grabowski, a nationally recognized expert on long-term care, who reviewed the report for The Associated Press.“This was not individuals who were going to die anyway,” Grabowski added. “We are talking about a really big number of excess deaths.”Investigators used a generally accepted method of estimating “excess” deaths in a group of people after a calamitous event. It did not involve examining individual death certificates of Medicare patients, but comparing overall deaths among those in nursing homes to levels recorded the previous year. The technique was used to estimate deaths in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and in New York City after the first coronavirus surge last spring. It does not attribute a cause of death, but is seen as a barometer of impact.Death rates were higher in every month last year when compared to 2019. The report documented two spikes with particular implications for government policy and for protecting the most vulnerable in future outbreaks of life-threatening illnesses. In April of last year, a total of 81,484 Medicare patients in nursing homes died. Then eight months later, after lockdowns and frantic efforts to expand testing — but before vaccines became widely available — nursing home patients accounted for a staggering 74,299 deaths in December.“This is happening long after it was clear that nursing homes were particularly vulnerable,” said Nancy Harrison, a deputy regional inspector general who worked on the report. “We really have to look at that. Why did they remain so vulnerable?” Federal investigators are still drilling down to try to document the chain of causes and effects.Tuesday's report was the most comprehensive yet from the government because it included statistics for the early part of last year, during the initial coronavirus surge. Medicare did not require nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases and deaths occurring before May 8, more than four months into the pandemic year.In another new finding, the report showed that cases and deaths among Asian American patients tracked with the more severe impacts seen among Blacks and Latinos. Indeed, Asian Medicare enrollees in nursing homes saw the highest increase in death rates, with 27% dying in 2020 compared to 17% the previous year. For whites, the death rate grew to 24% in 2020 from 18% in 2019, a significant increase but not as pronounced.Death rates for Hispanic and Black patients were 23% last year, up from 15% in 2019.The inspector general's office based its analysis on Medicare billing data, also including patients in Medicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers. Medicare covers the vast majority of nursing home patients, and the report included long-term residents as well as those temporarily at a facility for rehab care.Health economist Tamara Konetzka of the University of Chicago, who also reviewed the report for AP, said building an estimate from individual death certificates would have faced another set of challenges. Especially in the first wave of the pandemic, many who died would not necessarily have been tested for Covid-19, for example.“By looking at excess deaths you can get away from some of the measurement issues and say how much worse things were in 2020 than in 2019,” explained Konetzka, who has testified before Congress on the impact of Covid-19 in nursing homes.The inspector general's findings about Asians highlight a riddle for researchers, said Konetzka. The reasons for higher cases and deaths among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians may not necessarily be tied to race and ethnicity. Instead, minority patients may be clustered in homes located in communities with more severe outbreaks.The report also found that low-income nursing home patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid together were much more likely to have gotten Covid-19. The infection rate for that group reached 56%, and 26% died.Some states suffered worse impacts. By the end of December more than half of the Medicare patients in nursing homes in Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana and New Jersey had or likely had Covid-19.Across the US, the coronavirus found ideal conditions to spread among frail nursing home patients living in close quarters. Many researchers believe it's likely staffers unwittingly brought the virus in from surrounding communities.Although facilities locked down in March of last year, government efforts to help were haphazard. The industry complained of chronic shortages of protective gear, including basics like masks and gowns.The Trump administration initially delegated responsibility for testing to states before belatedly marshaling more federal resources. HHS later laid the groundwork for vaccinations under the Trump administration, and the Biden administration followed through. As vaccination rates rose, nursing home cases plummeted, allowing facilities to again permit family visits.The country can't move on yet, said deputy inspector general Harrison. “Hopefully, Covid will go away,” she said. “But once that happens, there will always be infectious diseases, and we all need to ask ourselves what we can do to protect vulnerable nursing home residents going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-us-nursing-home-deaths-up-32-last-year-says-govt-watchdog-101624338579679.html

When yoga came into existence, there was no India as it was divided into various factions," Oli said while addressing a programme held at his residence on the occasion of International Yoga Day.He further said, "India that exists today wasn't there in the past. Divided into factions, India at that time was like a continent or subcontinent. Therefore, yoga originated in Nepal but we were unable to make it popular as we never gave credit to our saints who created it. We always spoke about the contributions of our professors."Beginning 2015, June 21 has been observed annually as the International Day of Yoga, following the concept's inception in 2014 at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In his address to the UN, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested observing June 21 as Yoga Day as this is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and also because the day has a special significance in many parts of the world.Last year, Oli had claimed Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, was actually in Nepal and hence, the deity, too, was from the country. "Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori, a city to the west of Birgunj, India claims that Lord Rama was born there. Therefore, we too have believed that deity Sita got married to Prince Rama of India," he claimedOli had also called India out for "cultural encroachment" by "creating a fake Ayodhya."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yoga-originated-in-nepal-kp-sharma-oli-s-latest-startling-claim-101624338203200.html

The self-imposed lockdown has caused further strain on an economy already battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling US-led sanctions over the country's nuclear weapons programme.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a political conference last week called for officials to brace for prolonged COVID-19 restrictions, indicating that the country isn't ready to open its borders anytime soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yet-to-find-a-single-case-of-covid-19-north-korea-tells-who-101624336537715.html

"Yesterday we were given hamburgers but I couldn’t eat it because there was a foul odor coming from the bread ... I really only eat popsicles and juice because that is the only food that I can trust."A 17-year-old girl from Guatemala also detained at Fort Bliss described sleeping in a large white tent with about three hundred girls, on cots stacked on top of each other.She said it was hard to sleep due to the rattling noise the tent’s metal beams made at night, according to a declaration dated April 28.

I expect their focus of their conversation will be to continue to discuss how we can work together to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorist groups who pose a threat to the US homeland,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday.Their conversation will also be about how they can work together to continue to implement humanitarian assistance, other assistance that the United States remains committed to, even as the US works to draw down its troops from Afghanistan.At the Pentagon, the Defense Department said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the military leadership "are constantly looking at the pace we're going at, and the capabilities we have, and the capabilities that we're going to need throughout to complete the withdrawal.Biden has directed the Pentagon to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by September 11 this year.The high-level meeting between Biden and Ghani will take place as the Taliban insurgents have in recent weeks captured dozens of new districts in Afghanistan and both sides are said to have suffered heavy casualties.The escalation in fighting between Afghan security forces and Taliban militants have dealt fresh blows to the US-brokered peace negotiations between Kabul and the insurgents.The US military exit from Afghanistan before September 11 stems from the February 2020 agreement Washington signed with the Taliban in return for counterterrorism guarantees and pledges the group would negotiate a political settlement to the war with the Afghan government.In April, President Biden announced that the US will withdraw all remaining troops from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, in an effort to end a deadly conflict that has cost trillions of dollars and the lives of more than 2,300 American troops.Biden has made it clear that a continued military strategy was no longer sustainable in Afghanistan."We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result," he said in a major policy speech on April 14 from the Treaty Room of the White House - where former president George W. Bush first informed the nation of US strikes on al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan in October 2001.In response to Biden's announcement, Afghan President Ghani said his country respects his American counterpart's decision to draw down their troops by September of this year and Kabul will ensure a smooth transition.Ghani pointed out that the Afghanistan National Defence and Security Forces have been carrying out most of the operations independently since the US-Taliban agreement of February 2020 to defend the people and the country."Our forces are capable of defending Afghanistan against current threats," the Afghan president said in a statement in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-looking-forward-to-meeting-aghanistan-s-ghani-white-house-101624327048670.html
22-06-2021||World||EU, UK slap new sanctions on entities, individuals related to Myanmar military coup||The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom on Monday slapped fresh sanctions on Myanmar state-owned entities and individuals related to the February 1 coup and the subsequent violent repression of peaceful protesters.According to an EU press release, the 27-member European bloc imposed sanctions on 8 individuals, 3 economic entities and the War Veterans Organisation in relation to the military coup staged in Myanmar/Burma on February 1.The individuals targeted by sanctions include ministers and deputy ministers, as well as the attorney general, who are responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law and for serious human rights violations in the country. The four entities are either state-owned or controlled by the Myanmar Armed Forces, contributing directly or indirectly to the military's revenues or activities."By targeting the gems and timber sectors, these measures are aimed at restricting the junta's ability to profit from Myanmar's natural resources, while being crafted so as to avoid undue harm to the people of Myanmar," said the EU in the release.The EU's restrictive measures, which now apply to a total of 43 individuals and 6 entities in Myanmar, include an asset freeze and a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities. A travel ban is also in effect for listed persons that prevents them from entering or transiting through EU territory.On the other hand, the UK imposed additional measures on the Myanmar Timber Enterprise and Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, two state-owned entities in Myanmar's extractive sector. These asset freezes will be enforced with immediate effect, and target the junta's ability to profit from pearl and timber, two high-value natural commodities that generate millions in revenue for the military regime.The measures announced today will target the Myanmar regime's economic interest with new designations against the State Administration Council (SAC), the junta's ruling body, who continue to undermine democracy and brutally suppress Myanmar's civilians.In a statement, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the move sends a clear message to the junta that the UK will not allow financial support that props up the military regime following the coup."Alongside our allies, we are placing sanctions on companies linked to Myanmar's military junta, targeting the finances of this illegitimate regime. The military has continued its subversion of democracy and brutal killing of civilians. We will continue to hold the Junta to account and sanction those responsible until democracy is restored," Raab said.He further said that the UK will also strengthen their Overseas Business Risk guidance to reiterate the message that UK businesses must undertake enhanced supply chain due diligence and should not enter into trading relationships that benefit the Myanmar military.This comes after the G7 leaders on Sunday strongly condemned the military coup in Myanmar and the subsequent violence committed by the security forces on civilians. The group called for the immediate release of those detained arbitrarily including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-slap-new-sanctions-on-entities-individuals-related-to-myanmar-military-coup-101624325197980.html

The report also noted that 26,425 grave violations were committed against children last year, including attacks on schools and hospitals.“More than 19,300 children affected by war last year were victims of grave violations such as killing, maiming or rape. Girls and boys have a right to life and health, free from violence and despair. We must protect them at all costs,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a tweet on Tuesday.More than 19,300 children affected by war last year were victims of grave violations such as killing, maiming or rape.Girls and boys have a right to life and health, free from violence and despair. We must protect them at all costs.https://t.co/c7u0ACXvV9 pic.twitter.com/ZJYKDLNoxuIn its report, the global body also said that the recruitment and use of children, killing and maiming were the most prevalent grave violations against children followed by denial of humanitarian access and abduction. While crimes of abduction grew by 90% in 2020, incidents of rape and other forms of sexual violence increased by 70%, the report also said.“The wars of adults have taken away the childhood of millions of boys and girls again in 2020. This is completely devastating for them, but also for the entire communities they live in, and destroys chances for a sustainable peace,” CAAC special representative Virginia Gamba said. “We can’t erase the past, but we can collectively work at re-building the future of these children, our own future; by putting the willpower, the efforts and the resources to end and prevent grave violations against children, and by supporting their sustainable reintegration and building a future free from conflict for all,” Gamba further added.Also read | UN rights chief seeks Xinjiang visit this year, says HK trials key testAccording to the report, one in four children affected by grave violations were girls, the report said. Girls were most affected by rape and other forms of sexual violence with 98% of incidents of sexual violence perpetrated against girls. “If boys and girls experience conflict differently and require interventions to better address their specific needs, what the data also showed is that conflict doesn’t differentiate based on gender,” Gamba said.The report also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic further complicated the UN’s efforts to reach out to children in situations of armed conflict. “The pandemic increased the vulnerability of children to abduction, recruitment and use, sexual violence and attacks on schools and hospitals, while isolation and measures put in place to combat the pandemic also complicated the work of United Nations child protection monitors and experts,” the report noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grave-violations-against-children-remained-alarmingly-high-in-2020-over-19-000-children-affected-un-report-101624323865426.html

As a result, the GDP growth is estimated to have contracted by 1.5 per cent in FY20.During the period, half of the working population saw either job or income losses, with informal and low-skilled workers employed in elementary occupations facing the strongest contraction in employment.Pakistan's economy has been growing slowly over the past two decades. The annual per capita growth has averaged only two per cent, less than half of the South Asia average, partly due to inconsistent macroeconomic policies and an under-reliance on investment and exports to drive economic growth, reported the Pakistani daily.The sectors in Pakistan that employ the poorest, such as agriculture, are expected to remain weak, and therefore poverty is likely to remain high, said the WB. The current account deficit is also projected to narrow to 0.8 per cent of GDP in FY21, as a wider trade deficit is offset by stronger remittances inflows.The public debt will remain elevated in the medium term, as well Pakistan's exposure to debt-related shocks, the WB concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poverty-in-pakistan-rose-to-5-4-in-2020-estimates-world-bank-101624322264469.html
22-06-2021||World||Denver: 3 killed in suburb shooting, including officer, suspect||A gunman is believed to have shot and killed an officer and another person in a shopping district in a Denver suburb Monday before being fatally shot by police, authorities said.An officer responded to a call at 1:15 p.m. about a suspicious incident near the library in the city of Arvada, and about 15 minutes later, a 911 call came in about shots fired and the officer hit, Deputy Chief Ed Brady said at a news conference.Another person believed to have been shot by the gunman was taken to a hospital and died, police said. The attacker also was shot and killed.Authorities didn't immediately describe the circumstances of the shooting but said no one else is believed to have been involved. No identities have been released yet.Earlier, police said there were two suspects.The shooting occurred in Olde Town Arvada, the city’s downtown district with shops, restaurants, breweries and other businesses. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is about 7 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver.It comes three months after a gunman opened fire and killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket in Boulder, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Arvada.The Arvada officer’s death, just the third in Police Department history, was especially painful after the mass shooting in nearby Boulder, Arvada Mayor Marc Williams said. Arvada police helped respond and investigate that attack, he said.“This is by far the saddest day for our Police Department,” Williams said. Police vehicles lined up for a procession planned to honor the officer who was killed, and some residents lined a street with flags.The mayor said he was in his car in the area shortly before 2 p.m. “when literally I saw 11 police cars with their flashing lights and sirens on race past me. I knew something serious had happened. I didn’t know how serious.”Arvada resident Brady Turner said he was pulling into the Army and Navy store in the area when he noticed police cars driving in behind him and a person on a stretcher being put into an ambulance in between the parking lot and the store. He said he took off in his car.“I just got out of there,” Turner said.About five minutes later, he heard gunshots near the library about a block away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denver-3-killed-in-suburb-shooting-including-officer-suspect-101624319492464.html

It doesn’t function as well," Foster said. “Their immune systems don’t recognize bacteria as easily. They sometimes get sick.”Foster said understanding what happens to the squid in space could help solve health problems that astronauts face.“There are aspects of the immune system that just don’t work properly under long-duration spaceflights," she said. "If humans want to spend time on the moon or Mars, we have to solve health problems to get them there safely.”The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) long as adults.The squid will come back to Earth in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sends-squid-from-hawaii-into-space-for-research-101624306398735.html

She said 107 people had been arrested under the law, including 57 formally charged, and that the first trials were due this week."This will be an important test of independence for Hong Kong’s judiciary in its willingness to uphold Hong Kong’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in accordance with the Basic Law," she said.Government officials in Beijing and Hong Kong say the national security law is needed to avert threats to national security, and that the rights and freedoms of ordinary Hong Kong people are being be protected."The High Commissioner is advised to stop making erroneous remarks against China, and refrain from interfering in China’s sovereignty and judicial independence," Liu said.Critics say the law is being used to crush dissent in the global financial hub, an assertion Beijing rejects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-seeks-xinjiang-visit-this-year-says-hk-trials-key-test-101624306006401.html
22-06-2021||World||Covid rebounds in US South as many junk vaccine||Covid-19 transmission is accelerating in several poorly vaccinated states, primarily in the South, and more young people are turning up at hospitals. The data present the clearest sign of a rebound in the US in months.In Missouri, Arkansas and Utah, the seven-day average of hospital admissions with confirmed Covid-19 has increased more than 30% in the past two weeks, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services. In Mississippi, the hospitalization rate is up 5% in the period.The jump in hospitalization is particularly jarring among 18- to 29-year-olds in the outlier states.The US has made extraordinary progress in its vaccine push, giving at least one jab to more than 53% of the population. But all the states with mounting transmission trail the national average, and Mississippi has given a single jab to just 35%. Young people are less likely to be vaccinated than older groups.In Arkansas, Missouri and Utah, reported Covid-19 cases mirror the concerning trends in hospitalizations. In other places -- namely, Mississippi -- they don’t. Testing has dropped off significantly, with the seven-day average nationwide plummeting 55% in the past three months, which makes case counts a less reliable indicator.Most Covid-19 projections expect subdued transmission during the summer, thanks in part to the seasonal nature of the virus. But the so-called Sun Belt surge last year showed that many Southern states can remain vulnerable as hot summer days drive people indoors in search of air-conditioning.Even for the worst-afflicted states, the situation is nowhere near as alarming as what residents survived as recently as February; absolute numbers of hospitalizations remain far lower. But the signs of an uptick come amid a jump in cases in the UK attributed to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-rebounds-in-us-south-as-many-junk-vaccine-101624305551469.html

Amazon said on Monday it was reviewing the draft rules and had no immediate comment, while Walmart's Flipkart did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Under the stricter proposals, e-commerce companies should not hold flash sales in India. These are hugely popular during festive season, but have faced anger among offline sellers who say they cannot compete with the deep discounts online.E-commerce firms must also ensure that none of their "related parties and associated enterprises" are listed as sellers on their shopping websites, and no related entity should sell goods to an online seller operating on the same platform.The changes could impact business structures used by Flipkart and Amazon in the fast growing Indian e-commerce market, industry sources and lawyers said.A Reuters investigation http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W in February showed Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers for years. Amazon holds an indirect stake in two of the top sellers on its website, but says it does not give any preferential treatment.Foreign e-commerce players must not make direct sales to consumers, and can only operate a marketplace for sellers.Amazon and Flipkart are also regulated under India's foreign investment rules for e-commerce, and it was not clear if the proposed consumer ministry rules will supersede them or not.The proposal, which is applicable to both Indian and foreign players, is open for public consultation until July 6, the Indian government statement said.The rules also call on companies to make suggestions of alternative products before customers make purchases "to ensure a fair opportunity for domestic goods.""This proposal basically changes the way e-commerce is structured. This is way beyond consumer rules - this is basically like an e-commerce industry policy," one e-commerce executive said, adding: "It will be extremely disruptive."Amazon and Flipkart are separately locked in a court battle with federal antitrust watchdog to stall an investigation into their business practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-complaints-over-amazon-and-flipkart-india-plans-tighter-e-commerce-rules-101624304725128.html

The tax credit will be $3,000 annually per child between the ages of 6 and 17.The payments are to be made monthly, a first for the program. People can register for the program even if they did not fully file their taxes.The program is slated to expire after one year, though Biden has proposed extending it through 2025 with the ultimate goal of making it permanent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-launches-public-push-for-child-tax-credit-101624304719498.html

He can now either resign or trigger a snap election.The motion of no confidence was filed on Thursday by the far-right Sweden Democrats, after the Left Party, which has been propping up the government, said it was planning such a motion itself in protest against a government plan to ease rent controls. The conservative Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats were quick to back the motion, which was passed by 181 MPs in the 349-seat parliament.Critics have described the constellation as an “unholy alliance” of parties at opposite ends of the political spectrum.After 11 unsuccessful no-confidence votes in modern Swedish political history, Lofven, who has previously distinguished himself by his ability to survive political crises, becomes the first head of government to be ousted in this way.Lofven, leader of the Social Democrats and PM since 2014, has a week to either announce a snap election or resign, leaving it up to the speaker of parliament, Andreas Norlen, to open negotiations with the parties to find a new prime minister.Speaking after the vote, Lofven said he had a week to speak with other parties and to evaluate his options. He added that his focus would remain doing “what is best for Sweden”. Should he leave it up to Norlen to find a new PM, many analysts feel there is a chance Lofven could be chosen again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/noconfidence-vote-brings-down-sweden-s-govt-101624303982225.html

Seen by experts as highly transmissible, the variant was first identified in India.Dongguan launched its citywide testing programme following two cases reported since Friday. City authorities told residents not to leave, except for essential reasons.Even then, those leaving must show negative test results within 48 hours of departure. Entrances on highways to other cities were closed, while shuttle buses between airports in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and a check-in terminal in Dongguan, were halted.

22-06-2021||World||US youngsters less likely to take Covid vaccine, says CDC. Why it's a problem||Indicating reluctance towards getting inoculated, younger American adults are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults, in what could hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.In a bid to avoid another Covid-19 related crisis that increases the burden on health infrastructure, CDC said more work is needed to increase vaccination rates among younger adults.About 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But US demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.According to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, of the 57% of American adults who received at least one vaccine dose by May 22, coverage was highest among people 65 or older and lowest among people aged 18 to 29.The vaccination data used by CDC spans from December 14, 2020, to May 22, 2021.The report points out that younger Americans also are more likely to be reluctant to get vaccinated because of concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness. This has stemmed from data of household surveys conducted from March to May 2021.Among the sections reporting the lowest rates of vaccination are lower-income, non-Hispanic Black adults aged 18–39 with lower levels of education who lacked health insurance and live outside of major cities, CDC said.Nearly one in four adults aged 18-39 said they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated during the survey period, the report said.Vaccine hesitancy is global problem nations have encountered but the health experts and scientists have underlined how crucial vaccines are in the race against time with mutating viruses.The vaccination drive in America began in December last year and early efforts were focused on specific high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and older adults. This was later expanded to all American adults aged 18 and older, beginning April 19.Offering workplace vaccination programs, paid leave for vaccination and mobile, walk-in clinics with flexible hours could help improve vaccination rates among younger adults, the CDC reported.Covid-19 deaths in the US have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms approached another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, as the outbreak loosens its grip, it has fallen down the list of the biggest killers.CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer’s disease than from Covid-19.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-young-adults-are-less-likely-to-take-covid-19-vaccine-cdc-explains-why-101624296096612.html
22-06-2021||World||Senior Qatari diplomat says Indian officials engaged in talks with Taliban||A senior Qatari diplomat, involved in the Afghan peace process, said on Monday that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban, confirming a development first reported by Hindustan Times. Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani, who is the Special Envoy of Qatar’s foreign minister for counter-terrorism and conflict resolution, told the webinar that he believed the Indian side was engaging with the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Afghanistan.HT had first reported on June 8 that India has opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, against the backdrop of the rapid drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan. The move marked a significant shift from New Delhi’s position of not engaging with the Taliban in any way.Al-Qahtani, who was participating in a virtual discussion organised by the Arab Center Washington DC on the theme “Looking towards peace in Afghanistan after the US-NATO withdrawal”, made the remarks while answering a question from an Indian journalist on Qatar’s perception of India’s role in the Afghan peace process.“I understand that there has been a quiet visit by Indian officials...to speak with the Talibans. Why? Because not everybody is believing that the Taliban will dominate and take over, because Taliban is a key component of, or should be or is going to be a key component of the future of Afghanistan,” Al-Qahtani said during a webinar, without giving details.“So, I see the reason behind having a dialogue or talks or reaching out to all parties in Afghanistan but it’s important to keep in mind that we are in a critical stage at this time, and I think if any meeting is going to take place, it should be for a major or main reason, which is to encourage the parties to solve their differences by peaceful means,” he added.Al-Qahtani said it was a “golden opportunity” for all stakeholders to take advantage of efforts to usher in peace in Afghanistan. He further said, “Otherwise, nobody is going to recognise – at least as far as Qatar is concerned we are not going to recognise any group or any system or any people who are going to take a country by force.”Also read: As FATF begins plenary meeting, reports emerge of surge in Taliban fund-raising in PakistanNoting that Afghanistan “should not become a place for a proxy [war] among any countries”, he said it was in the interest of both India and Pakistan to have a more stable Afghanistan.“We understand Pakistan is a neighbouring country, India is a country that...as far as we know, invested a lot economically in Afghanistan and they want Afghanistan to be more peaceful and stable,” he added.The Indian outreach is largely being led by security officials and has been limited to Taliban factions and leaders perceived as being outside the sphere of influence of Pakistan and Iran. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the first contacts with Mullah Baradar were established in Qatar, where the Taliban has a political office.External affairs minister S Jaishankar made three transit halts in Doha, Qatar, during his recent visits to Kuwait and Kenya. During the first halt on June 9, Jaishankar met Qatari National Security Adviser Mohamed Bin Ahmed Al Mesned, shortly before al-Qahtani held separate meetings with US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators the same day.During another transit halt on June 15, Jaishankar met Qatari foreign minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and minister of state for defence Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiya. He also held talks with US special envoy Khalilzad and exchanged perspectives on Afghanistan and the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senior-qatari-diplomat-says-indian-officials-engaged-in-talks-with-taliban-101624300537514.html
