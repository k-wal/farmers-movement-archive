The ASPCA alleges that the Agriculture Department has adopted “education and cooperation” efforts as a substitute for enforcement. The USDA refers to dealers as those who breed dogs or act as brokers in their sale or transport.The department has “imposed no statutory penalties against a dog dealer since 2017” despite evidence that more than 1,000 violations take place each year, the ASPCA says in the suit. In one case, a licensed dealer avoided punishment despite keeping dogs in housing with wire flooring that hurt some of them so badly they were unable to stand, the group says.It sued the Agriculture Department under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that its embrace of education initiatives in lieu of concrete penalties violates federal law. The agency’s inaction “has enabled licensed dog dealers to commit horrible abuses without any repercussions,” the ASPCA claims.The USDA referred a request for comment on the suit to its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is also named as a defendant. A spokesman for the service said he wouldn’t comment on pending litigation.The case is American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 21-cv-01600, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abusive-dog-dealers-escape-usda-penalties-says-animal-group-101623687271376.html

14-06-2021||World||At NATO, Biden says ready to talk China, Russia and soothe allies||President Joe Biden made his entrance at the NATO summit aiming to consult European allies on efforts to counter provocative actions by China and Russia while highlighting the US commitment to the 30-country alliance that was frequently maligned by predecessor Donald Trump.The summit Monday comes as Biden tries to rally allies for greater coordination in checking China and Russia, two adversaries whose actions on economic and national security fronts have become the chief foreign policy concerns in the early going of the Biden presidency.Biden shortly after arriving at the alliance's headquarters sat down with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and underscored the US commitment to Article 5 of the alliance charter, which spells out that an attack on one member is an attack on all and is to be met with a collective response.“Article 5 we take as a sacred obligation,” Biden said. “I want NATO to know America is there.”The White House said the communique to be signed by alliance members at the end of the NATO summit is expected to include language about updating Article 5 to include major cyber attacks — a matter of growing concern amid a series of hacks targeting the US government and businesses around the globe by Russia-based hackers.The update will spell out that if an alliance member needs technical or intelligence support in response to a cyber attack, it would be able to invoke the mutual defense provision to receive assistance, according to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.The president will begin his day meeting with leaders of the Baltic states on NATO's eastern flank regarding the "threat posed by Russia,” China and the recent air piracy in Belarus, according to Sullivan. He'll also meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Biden's itinerary in Europe has been shaped so that he would first gather with Group of Seven leaders for a three-day summit on the craggy shores of Cornwall and then with NATO allies in Brussels before his much-anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.At the G-7, leaders sought to convey that the club of wealthy democracies — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — is a better friend to poorer nations than authoritarian rivals such as China and Russia.The G-7 meeting ended with a communique that called out forced labor practices and other human rights violations impacting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province. The president declined to discuss private summit negotiations over the provision, but said he was “satisfied” with the communique, although differences remain among the allies about how forcefully to call out Beijing.Biden is focused on building a more cohesive bond between America and allies who had become wary of US leadership after enduring four years of Trump's name-calling and frequent invectives about the relevance of multilateral alliances like NATO.Trump complained that the NATO alliance allows “global freeloading” countries to spend less on military defense at the expense of the US and dismissed the alliance as “obsolete.”Biden offered a pointed rejoinder on Sunday, saying: “We do not view NATO as a sort of a protection racket. We believe that NATO is vital to our ability to maintain American security for ... the remainder of the century. And there’s a real enthusiasm.”When alliance members last met for a summit in England in December 2019, Trump grabbed headlines by calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “two-faced” and French President Emmanuel Macron “nasty."Trump lashed out after Trudeau was caught on a hot mic gossiping with other leaders about Trump turning photo opportunities into long news conferences. Ahead of the summit, Macron had declared NATO “brain dead" because of a void in US leadership under Trump.Biden has already acknowledged during his Europe tour that the alliance needs to ensure better burden sharing and needs more American leadership. He’s also highlighted NATO members' contributions in the war in Afghanistan, noting that “NATO stepped up” after America was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.The US and the alliance are winding down their involvement in the nearly 20-year war that killed tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 3,500 US and allied troops. The war also raised profound questions about whether NATO’s most ambitious effort was worth it.For now, NATO plans to leave civilian advisers to help build up government institutions. It’s unclear who will protect them. The alliance is also weighing whether to train Afghan special forces outside the country.NATO members are also expected to endorse the creation of a new cyber defense policy to improve coordination with countries impacted by the increasing frequency of ransomware attacks, a climate security action plan to reduce greenhouse gases from military activities in line with national commitments under the Paris agreement and a commitment to strengthen NATO’s deterrence to meet threats from Russia and elsewhere, according to the White House.Biden will meet with Turkey's president, Erdogan, on the summit sidelines.Biden has known Erdogan for years but their relationship has frequently been contentious. Biden, during his campaign, drew ire from Turkish officials after he described Erdogan as an “autocrat." In April, Biden infuriated Ankara by declaring that the Ottoman-era mass killing and deportations of Armenians was “genocide" — a term that US presidents have avoided using.The two leaders were expected to discuss Syria and Iran as well as what role Turkey can play on Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal, according to the White House. Also on the agenda: how Washington and Ankara “deal with some of our significant differences on values and human rights and other issues,” Sullivan said.The unsettled security situation in Libya, as well as overlapping concerns on China and Russia are also expected to be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-nato-biden-says-ready-to-talk-china-russia-and-soothe-allies-101623671962981.html

It let in new patients as beds become free."We only have 50 beds for Covid-19 cases, that's the main problem," Wali told Reuters.Afghanistan reported on Monday 1,804 new Covid-19 cases and 71 deaths from the disease.In all, it has had 93,272 cases and 3,683 deaths but doctors say many cases are likely being missed because of low rates of testing.Human rights group Amnesty International said last week the government needed to immediately procure more oxygen and vaccines."Afghanistan's Covid-19 case numbers have been steadily increasing," said Zaman Sultani, the group's South Asia researcher. "Without urgent international support to contain this surge, the situation could quickly spiral out of control."The country, with a population believed to be about 36 million, has administered about 1 million doses of vaccine, largely to front-line health workers and members of the security forces.Last week, Afghanistan received 700,000 doses of a Covid-19 vaccine made by China's Sinopharm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-hospitals-close-doors-to-new-patients-as-covid-19-surges-101623670762390.html

14-06-2021||World||Israel's new government gets to work after Benjamin Netanyahu ouster||For the first time in 12 years, Israelis on Monday woke up to a new government and a new prime minister, after Naftali Bennett secured the backing of parliament and ousted longtime leader Benjamin Netanyahu.The two were slated to hold a handover meeting later in the day, but without the formal ceremony that traditionally accompanies a change in government.Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, narrowly approved the new Bennett-led coalition government on Sunday, ending Netanyahu’s historic 12-year rule. The divisive former prime minister, the longest to hold office, will now serve as the opposition leader.David Bitan, a Likud lawmaker, told Kan public radio that Netanyahu was not holding the handover ceremony with Bennett because he feels “cheated” by the formation of the Bennett-Lapid government and “doesn’t want to give even the slightest legitimacy to this matter.”Under a coalition agreement, Bennett will hold office of the premier for the first two years of the term, and then Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, the architect of the coalition, will become prime minister.The new government was sworn in late on Sunday and set to work Monday morning, with ministers announcing appointments of new ministry directors. Outgoing President Reuven Rivlin, who finishes his term in office next month, hosted Bennett, Lapid and the rest of the Cabinet at his official residence in Jerusalem for the official photo of the new government. Bennett and Lapid declined to comments to the press.Topaz Luk, a Netanyahu aide, told Army Radio that the former prime minister will “fight this dangerous and horrible government" as opposition leader. “He’s full of motivation to topple this dangerous government as soon as possible,” Luk said.World leaders have congratulated Bennett on becoming the 13th person to hold the office of Israeli prime minister.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Bennett and Lapid on forming a government, tweeting that “this is an exciting time for the UK and Israel to continue working together to advance peace and prosperity for all.”Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shared close ties with Netanyahu, congratulated Bennett in a tweet in Hebrew, saying he “looks forward to meeting you and deepening the strategic relations between our countries.” Modi also voiced his “deep recognition” of Netanyahu’s leadership.Lapid, Israel’s new foreign minister and alternate prime minister, spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and “discussed the special relationship between the US and Israel," he wrote on Twitter.The United Arab Emirates, which established diplomatic relations with Israel last year as part of the so-called Abraham Accords orchestrated by the Trump administration, said in a statement that it was looking “forward to working together to advance regional peace, strengthen tolerance and coexistence, and embark upon a new era of cooperation in technology, trade, and investment.”Bennett, 49, a former ally of Netanyahu turned rival, became prime minister after the 60-59 vote in Knesset on Sunday. The motion passed after a member of the coalition was taken by ambulance from hospital to the parliament building to cast her vote, and despite an abstention by a member of the Islamist Raam party.He heads a diverse and fragile coalition comprised of eight parties with deep ideological differences, ranging from a small Islamist party to Jewish ultranationalists. Bennett said he is prioritizing mending the many rifts dividing Israeli society.Bennett's ultranationalist Yamina party won just seven seats in the 120-member Knesset in March elections. But by refusing to commit to Netanyahu or his opponents, Bennett positioned himself as kingmaker. Even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest the new coalition deal, he ended up with the post of premier.The Knesset vote capped a chaotic parliamentary session and ended a two-year period of political paralysis in which the country held four deadlocked elections. Those votes focused largely on Netanyahu’s divisive rule and his fitness to remain in office while on trial for corruption charges.Netanyahu has made clear he has no intention of exiting the political stage. “If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country,” he said Sunday.To his supporters, Netanyahu is a global statesman uniquely capable of leading the country through its many security challenges.But to his critics, he has become a polarizing and autocratic leader who used divide-and-rule tactics to aggravate the many rifts in Israeli society. Those include tensions between Jews and Arabs, and within the Jewish majority between his religious and nationalist base and his more secular and dovish opponents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-new-government-gets-to-work-after-benjamin-netanyahu-ouster-101623666061041.html

India will mark the 75th anniversary of Independence Day on August 15 next year.The statement was delivered on the floor of the provincial legislative assembly by minister of infrastructure Prasad Panda, an Indo-Canadian on behalf of minister of culture, multiculturalism and status of women Leela Aheer.Panda said he had shared the statement with Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau.“Most foreigners who have never visited India cannot really gauge how vast and how diverse the country is. The cuisine changes every 200 miles (321km) you travel in any direction; the language and the dialect are different every 300 miles (482km); and cultural nuances shift subtly as you travel across the length and breadth of the country. This makes each state in India unique,” Panda told Hindustan Times.He said that the ties that are developing between the province and India as tech majors like Infosys and Mphasis have recently established presence in Alberta. “There are tremendous synergies that exist between Canada and India. I believe that with a little common sense, some hard-nosed business acumen, and political will, we can forge an incredibly strong, mutually beneficial relationship,” Panda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-alberta-recognises-india-s-75th-independence-anniversary-celebrations-101623653623679.html

The Department of Defense announces,and improve interoperability with NATO, which included armed Mark VI patrol boats.Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine which triggered a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people.Tensions have flared again in recent months after the two countries traded blame for a surge in fighting in Ukraine's Donbass, and Russia, in what it called a defensive exercise, massed troops on its border with Ukraine and in Crimea.U.S. President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday he will stand up for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity ahead of a meeting between Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16.The Pentagon said the U.S. security assistance included capabilities "to enhance the lethality, command and control and situational awareness of Ukraine's forces".It would provide counter-artillery radars, counter-drone systems, secure communications gear, electronic warfare and military medical evacuation equipment.Ukraine's defense minister, Andrii Taran, said in a statement on Saturday the decision to provide the second part of the security package was "timely and reasonable".The country has received almost $2.5 billion in defense assistance from Washington between 2014 and 2021, Taran added, expressing gratitude "to our American friends for their enormous diplomatic, political and financial support".The U.S. assistance followed certification by the Pentagon that Ukraine "made sufficient progress on defense reforms this year," as required by U.S. law.During his term as U.S. president, Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives after it accused him of using U.S. aid as leverage to try to force Kyiv into smearing Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The Republican-led Senate later acquitted Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eying-russia-pentagon-to-send-ukraine-counter-drone-electronic-warfare-equipment-101623634950858.html
14-06-2021||World||Naftali Bennett, Israel's new prime minister, unlikely to change stance on Iran nuclear deal||Naftali Bennett became the new prime minister of Israel on Sunday, topping his predecessor and former ally Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year regime and ending a political crisis in the country that sparked four elections in two years. High up on Bennett's priority list as the new prime minister is coordinating with the United States on military and intelligence matters, the New York Times reported, adding that using Mossad, the country's spy agency, to sabotage the nuclear deal with Iran could still be on the table.Also Read: Who is Naftali Bennett, the ultra-nationalist leader poised to replace Netanyahu as Israel PM?The Iranian nuclear deal had long been a bone of contention within Israel's political and military establishment. Benjamin Netanyahu, former prime minister, had expressed his gripe with the original 2015 agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, pointing out that it neither gave Israel sufficient security from the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon nor did it cover significant issues like Iranian support to militias in neighbouring nations. Before being voted to the post of prime minister, Naftali Bennett had echoed similar sentiments, vowing to stop Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons. "The renewal of the nuclear agreement is a mistake," the New York Times quoted Bennett as saying at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, shortly before Sunday's vote.A religious Jew by birth, Bennett had long positioned himself to the right of Netanyahu but played the kingmaker recently by partnering up with centrist and left-wing parties, an unlikely combination that defines the contradictions in the 73-year-old nation. Even so, Bennett's stance regarding the Iran nuclear deal is unlikely to be much different from his predecessor, the Amerian daily said, adding that the new Israeli prime minister, however, might try to influence some terms of the new deal, something that Netanyahu had refused to do.Also Read: Biden welcomes new Israeli government led by Naftali Bennett, reaffirms supportNotably, the espionage operations of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, against the Iranian military establishment over its nuclear ambitions had continued even after Joe Biden was elected as the president of the United States of America and negotiations to rejoin the nuclear deal began. David Barnea, who was recently appointed as the director of Mossad, has said that Israel's Mossad will respond in "full force" if Iran continues with its nuclear program, hinting at the fact that the spy agency was well-aware of those officials within the Iranian military establishment associated with the nuclear program.Israel, under its new prime minister Naftali Bennett, is looking to minimise disagreements with the United States on the Iranian nuclear deal, the report added, noting it as a marked shift from the adversarial stand it pursued with the US under the Obama administration. To this end, Bennett is even likely to replace Gilad Ardan, a longstanding Netanyahu ally and current Israeli ambassador to Washington, with a man of his own, the daily added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/naftali-bennett-israel-s-new-prime-minister-unlikely-to-change-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-101623630214064.html
14-06-2021||World||Myanmar Junta to start Suu Kyi’s first trial since February coup||Myanmar’s ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi will be in court Monday as her first trial begins on charges brought by the military junta after it seized power earlier this year.Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint, who have been in detention since the Feb. 1 coup and face multiple charges, are expected to testify in person at a special court in the capital, Naypyidaw, according to the head of their legal defense team, Khin Maung Zaw. She is being tried for allegedly violating Covid-19 restrictions during last year’s election, as well as incitement and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies.On Tuesday, she’ll return to court to face two additional charges related to breaching the Natural Disaster Management Law and the Telecommunications Law, Khin Maung Zaw said by phone, adding that he expects verdicts on those charges by mid-August. He has described all the allegations against her as groundless.The trials are the latest push by the military to discredit Suu Kyi after her party won more than 80% of available seats in November’s national election, prompting the military to declare it tainted by widespread fraud even though international observers said it was mostly free and fair. The result was in line with another landslide victory in 2015, when Suu Kyi formed the country’s first civilian-led government in more than five decades.Since the coup, the military regime has struggled to contend with a shadow government set up by her allies, renewed civil conflict with armed ethnic rebels and international sanctions from the U.S. and its Western partners over a deadly crackdown on protesters that has killed more than 850 people. The military, also known as the Tatmadaw, moved the two civilian leaders in recent weeks from their residences in the capital to an unknown location.Suu Kyi, 75 also faces other criminal charges. On June 10, the junta charged her and other officials with corruption in the most serious of the seven cases against her so far, accusing her of bribery and illegally leasing property. As a senior government official she faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted in that case.Suu Kyi has long been the face of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, winning the Nobel peace prize while under house arrest for the better part of two decades prior to her release in 2010.

After the first escape, he was arrested in Italy in 2019 and extradited in 2020.At least 3,200 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. An estimated 38,000 were tortured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-detains-chile-dictatorship-fugitive-wanted-for-dozens-of-murders-101623629244845.html

Qureshi also claimed that India was trying to take Pakistan again to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for not implementing its verdict."Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (government) complicated the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav," Qureshi said on Sunday, according to news agency ANI, without explaining his comment.Kulbhushan Jadhav, the 51-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan. Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India has rejected the charges levelled against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.Also read | Pak rejects India’s assertion of pressurising Kulbhushan Jadhav’s lawyerIndia approached the Hague-based ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging his death sentence. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Parliament rushed through a bill that will help Kulbhushan Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court amid protests by the opposition, which accused the government of violating parliamentary principles. The bill is also aimed at allowing Jadhav to have consular access in line with the ICJ verdict.Qureshi said that opposition MPs who were against the bill to provide relief to Jadhav were “speaking the language of India”. “India wants Pakistan not to abide by the decision of the ICJ and the opposition also wants this,” he said.Law minister Farogh Naseem added the ICJ had asked Pakistan to enact legislation to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav. If the bill wasn’t passed, India could initiate contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ, Naseem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-complicated-by-previous-govt-qureshi-101623628937729.html

Biden flew to London after wrapping up his participation in a three-day summit of leaders of the world's wealthy democracies in Cornwall, in southwestern England. He arrived at the castle aboard the presidential helicopter and was ferried to the queen in a black Range Rover.The 95-year-old monarch greeted the Bidens in the castle’s quadrangle, where she waited beneath a covered dais that shielded her from the sun on one of the hottest days of the year so far in the United Kingdom. Assembled soldiers from the Queen’s Company First Battalion Grenadier Guards gave a royal salute and the Bidens placed their hands over their hearts as the U.S. national anthem was played.The president was then led across the grass for an inspection of the Guard of Honor. He wore a stern expression on his face after he had removed his trademark sunglasses, but when the 78-year-old Biden got to the end of the row, he smiled for the soldier in front of him who held up a sword. The queen and Jill Biden remained on the dais.Biden returned to the dais and he, the first lady and the white-gloved woman who has held the British throne for nearly 70 years watched the military march past before they went inside for tea. As they left the dais, Biden offered the queen an elbow. She declined and stepped down on her own power, using the handrail.The Bidens emerged from the castle just shy of having spent a full hour with the queen and boarded the helicopter for the return trip to London.At Heathrow Airport, Biden talked about the queen with his traveling press corps, saying she was “very gracious,” that she asked him about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping and that he had invited her to visit the White House.“I don’t think she’ll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother,” Biden said before he boarded Air Force One for his next stop, Brussels.It generally is frowned upon for anyone to reveal the contents of their private talks with the queen.Biden is the 13th American president to meet the monarch. President Lyndon B. Johnson is the only one who did not make her acquaintance while he was in office.She has welcomed four other US presidents to Windsor Castle, where she has been isolating during the coronavirus pandemic. They are Donald Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2016, George W. Bush in 2008 and Ronald Reagan in 1982.Biden's first time meeting the queen came in November 1982, when as a U.S. senator he traveled to the United Kingdom for a meeting of the British-American Parliamentary Group, the White House said Sunday. Biden was part of a group that met with the monarch during that visit.The queen has been riding out the pandemic at Windsor Castle, but also has begun getting out now and again after the April death of her husband, Prince Philip, at age 99.On Friday, she joined other royal family members, including Prince Charles and Prince William and their spouses, at a reception in Cornwall for the Group of Seven leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-gracious-queen-reminded-me-of-my-mother-joe-biden-101623626338636.html

The leaders agreed that they and their teams would consult closely on all matters related to regional security, including Iran," the White House said."United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel’s security," Biden said in an earlier statement. "My administration is fully committed to working with the new Israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region."By contrast, Biden did not speak to Netanyahu for nearly a month after the US president took office on Jan. 20.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also issued statements welcoming their counterparts in the new Israeli government.Bennett, a former defense minister and a high-tech millionaire, won by a thin 60-59 majority vote, and the coalition of left-wing, centrist, right-wing and Arab parties is likely to be fragile.Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, vowed to return to power soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-welcomes-new-israeli-government-led-by-naftali-bennett-reaffirms-support-101623622514487.html

Tedros made these remarks after taking part in the G7 summit by video conference on Saturday, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.“As you know, we will need cooperation from the Chinese side,” he said. “We need transparency to understand or know or find the origin of this virus... after the report was released, there were difficulties in data sharing, especially with raw data.”American President Joe Biden has also ordered a fresh US intelligence inquiry into the origin of the pandemic.Meanwhile, a fleet of 60 drones has been deployed in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou to keep people indoors and remind those going out to wear masks.

14-06-2021||World||Netanyahu’s tenure ends; Bennett is Israel’s new PM||After a record 12 years under Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel entered a new era on Sunday, voting in a motley coalition united by animosity towards “Bibi” and installing his one-time protege Naftali Bennett as the prime minister.Sixty members of the Knesset voted in favour of the ideologically divided alliance and 59 against, with one abstention.Bennett will serve as prime minister for two years, after which coalition architect, centrist Yair Lapid, will take over.Earlier in the day, Bennett said that renewing the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would be a major mistake. In a speech to parliament prior to the vote, Bennett said that Israel remains ready to act against Iran.“Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Bennett said. “Israel will not be a party to the agreement and will continue to preserve full freedom of action.” The strong comments maintain the confrontational policy by Netanyahu.Nonetheless, Bennett thanked President Joe Biden and the US administration for supporting Israel over the decades. Bennett’s new government was sworn into office late on Sunday.The Knesset voted in favour of the coalition put together by Lapid with the aim of terminating Netanyahu’s 12 years at the helm.Bennett, a former tech entrepreneur and a former defence minister, leads the right-wing Yamina Party, which has called for Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Bennett becomes Israel’s first premier to lead an openly religious lifestyle, with his small skullcap known as a kippa fastened to his head.He shares this ideology with Netanyahu, having served in several of the Likud leader’s governments. But in recent years tensions between the two arose and intensified, with Netanyahu making little effort to hide his disdain for Bennett.In late May, two months after Israel’s fourth inconclusive election in two years, Bennett allied himself with Lapid, paving the way for the improbable eight-party coalition.Bennett entered politics in 2005, and the next year became chief of staff to Netanyahu, who was then in the opposition. After leaving Netanyahu’s office, Bennett in 2010 became head of the Yesha Council.He took politics by storm in 2012, taking charge of the hard-right Jewish Home party, which was facing annihilation. He rebranded Jewish Home as the “New Right” Party, before forging the Yamina bloc in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-tenure-ends-bennett-is-israel-s-new-pm-101623618219136.html
14-06-2021||World||China takes a dig at G7, says it’s a ‘small group’||China on Sunday pointedly cautioned the G7 leaders that the days when “small” groups of countries decided the fate of the world was long gone, hitting back at the world’s richest democracies that have sought a unified position over tackling Beijing.“The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone,” a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London reportedly said.“We always believe that countries, big or small, strong or weak, poor or rich, are equals, and that world affairs should be handled through consultation by all countries.”In another development, the G7 advanced a plan to impose a global minimum corporation tax and a collective crackdown on avoidance, arguing that it would help tackle inequality.The G7 leaders endorsed an agreement struck by their finance ministers last week to adopt a minimum floor for corporation tax of 15%.Time to crack down on tax avoidance, says G7“With this, we have taken a significant step towards creating a fairer tax system fit for the 21st century, and reversing a 40-year race to the bottom,” the G7 said in its concluding statement.“Our collaboration will create a stronger level playing field, and it will help raise more tax revenue to support investment and it will crack down on tax avoidance.”The proposal, which now goes to G20 nations meeting in Italy next month, is aimed at snaring more taxes from revenue-hopping multinational companies, especially tech giants. US President Joe Biden welcomed the development, saying, “Too many corporations have been engaged in what are essentially tax savings, deciding that they would pay considerably less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-a-dig-at-g7-says-it-s-a-small-group-101623617959802.html
14-06-2021||World||G7 vows action on Covid, climate change||G7 leaders on Sunday vowed to start delivering one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines and to step up action on the climate crisis, in a US-led summit call that also took a hard line on China and Russia.In a final communique issued at their first physical summit in nearly two years, the leaders of the elite club stood by US President Joe Biden’s push to regain the West’s cohesion after Donald Trump’s tumultuous tenure.“We will harness the power of democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights to answer the biggest questions and overcome the greatest challenges,” Biden and his colleagues from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan said.G7 seeks investigation into origin of Covid-19The seven leaders scolded China over human rights in Xinjiang, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full and thorough investigation of the origin of the coronavirus in China.“We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms,” the G7 said. “We also call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 Covid-19 origin study including, as recommended by the experts’ report, in China.”Separately, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain wants further investigation into the origin of the pandemic. Speaking at the end of the summit, Johnson said , the world needs to “keep an open mind”.Biden, at a press meet on Sunday, said his fellow leaders agreed that “America is back at the table and fully engaged”. NATO’s mutual defence was a “sacred obligation” for the United States, he added, arguing that democracies were in a “contest with autocracies”.Johnson, host of the summit in St Ives, Cornwall, earlier described Biden as a “big breath of fresh air” and said on Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its “democratic values”.But the pledge on coronavirus vaccines for poorer nations fell far short of the 11 billion doses that campaigners say are needed to end the pandemic.Likewise, the G7’s pledges to deliver more aid for countries at the sharp end of the climate crisis, and to phase out fossil fuel investments, were decried as too little, too late ahead of a key UN summit in November. “This G7 summit will live on in infamy,” said Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at aid group Oxfam.Campaigners also complained the G7 failed to flesh out how it will pay for a newly agreed “Nature Compact” - aimed to protect 30% of land and oceans from despoliation by 2030.In another important pledge, the world leaders said they want to rapidly scale up technologies and policies that will accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity, including ending new government support for coal power by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-vows-action-on-covid-climate-change-101623617248613.html
14-06-2021||World||Netanyahu ousted as Israel PM, Parliament approves new coalition govt||Israel's parliament approved a new coalition government on Sunday that sent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into the opposition after a record 12 years in office and a political crisis that sparked four elections in two years.Naftali Bennett, the head of a small ultranationalist party, was sworn in as prime minister after a narrow 60-59 vote in parliament. But if he wants to keep the job, he will have to maintain an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and center.The eight parties, including a small Arab faction that is making history by sitting in the ruling coalition, are united in their opposition to Netanyahu and new elections but agree on little else. They are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the Palestinians and maintain good relations with the US without launching any major initiatives.Netanyahu sat silently during the vote. After it was approved, he stood up to leave the chamber, before turning around and shaking Bennett’s hand. A dejected Netanyahu, wearing a black medical mask, briefly sat in the opposition leader’s chair before walking out.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, remains the head of the largest party in parliament and is expected to vigorously oppose the new government. If just one faction bolts, it could lose its majority and would be at risk of collapse, giving him an opening to return to power.The country's deep divisions were on vivid display as Bennett addressed parliament ahead of the vote. He was repeatedly interrupted and loudly heckled by supporters of Netanyahu, several of whom were escorted out of the chamber.Bennett's speech mostly dwelled on domestic issues, but he expressed opposition to US efforts to revive Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.“Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Bennett said, vowing to maintain Netanyahu's confrontational policy. “Israel will not be a party to the agreement and will continue to preserve full freedom of action.”Bennett nevertheless thanked President Joe Biden and the U.S. for its decades of support for Israel.Netanyahu, speaking after him, vowed to return to power. He predicted the incoming government would be weak on Iran and give in to U.S. demands to make concessions to the Palestinians.“If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country in our way,” he said.Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears.“Even though it has a very narrow majority, it will be very difficult to topple and replace because the opposition is not cohesive," he said. Each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver, and for that they need “time and achievements."Still, Netanyahu "will continue to cast a shadow,” Plesner said. He expects the incoming opposition leader to exploit events and propose legislation that right-wing coalition members would like to support but can't — all in order to embarrass and undermine them.The new government is meanwhile promising a return to normalcy after a tumultuous two years that saw four elections, an 11-day Gaza war last month and a coronavirus outbreak that devastated the economy before it was largely brought under control by a successful vaccination campaign.The driving force behind the coalition is Yair Lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years, if the government lasts that long.He called off a planned speech to parliament, instead saying he was ashamed that his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents. In a brief speech, he asked for "forgiveness from my mother.”“I wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in Israel. Instead she, along with every citizen of Israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it’s time to replace you,” he said.The new government is expected to win a narrow majority in the 120-member assembly, after which it will be sworn in. The government plans to hold its first official meeting later this evening.It's unclear when Netanyahu will move out of the official residence. He has lashed out at the new government in apocalyptic terms and accused Bennett of defrauding voters by running as a right-wing stalwart and then partnering with the left.Netanyahu's supporters have held angry protests outside the homes of rival lawmakers, who say they have received death threats naming their family members. Israel's Shin Bet internal security service issued a rare public warning about the incitement earlier this month, saying it could lead to violence.Netanyahu has condemned the incitement while noting that he has also been a target.His place in Israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years — more than any other, including the country's founder, David Ben-Gurion.Netanyahu began his long rule by defying the Obama administration, refusing to freeze settlement construction as it tried unsuccessfully to revive the peace process. Relations with Israel's closest ally grew even rockier when Netanyahu vigorously campaigned against President Barack Obama's emerging nuclear deal with Iran, even denouncing it in an address to the U.S. Congress.But he suffered few if any consequences from those clashes and was richly rewarded by the Trump administration, which recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital, helped broker normalization agreements with four Arab states and withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal.Netanyahu has portrayed himself as a world-class statesman, boasting of his close ties with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also cultivated ties with Arab and African countries that long shunned Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.But he has gotten a far chillier reception from the Biden administration and is widely seen as having undermined the long tradition of bipartisan support for Israel in the United States.His reputation as a political magician has also faded at home, where he has become a deeply polarizing figure. Critics say he has long pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy that aggravated rifts in Israeli society between Jews and Arabs and between his close ultra-Orthodox allies and secular Jews.In November 2019, he was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. He refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup. Last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign.Netanyahu remains popular among the hard-line nationalists who dominate Israeli politics, but he could soon face a leadership challenge from within his own party. A less polarizing Likud leader would stand a good chance of assembling a coalition that is both farther to the right and more stable than the government that is set to be sworn in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-approves-new-govt-ending-netanyahu-s-historic-12-year-rule-101623607400258.html
