Harris has been tasked by President Joe Biden with taking on the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States.So far she has focused her efforts on improving economic and living conditions in the region. Her aides have repeatedly insisted her focus is distinct from the security issues that plague US officials trying to handle a spike in border crossings.But Republicans have seized on failures by both Harris and Biden to paint the administration as absent on what they’ve described as a crisis at the border. The issue overshadowed Harris’ first foreign trip earlier this month, to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met with both nations’ presidents and local officials and advocates to discuss economic and humanitarian solutions to the significant outmigration from both countries.But Harris and White House aides in Washington were forced to parry repeated questions from the press about why she left a border visit off the trip.Harris has noted that as a senator from California, she has visited the border in the past, and she has asserted that unless the root causes of migration are addressed the situation at the border will never be fixed.On her visit to Guatemala and Mexico this month, she urged Central Americans not to try to reach the US border. She tried to give people a sense of hope that would encourage them to stay home.US Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 180,000 encounters on the Mexican border in May, the most since March 2000. But the numbers were boosted by a pandemic-related ban on seeking asylum, which encouraged repeated attempts to cross the border because getting caught carried no legal consequences.Harris’ trip will come just days before former President Donald Trump is set to visit the border next week with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana and about a dozen members of the conservative Republican Study Committee he leads will also be joining the trip, another sign of how closely the party continues to align itself with Trump and the extent to which they see the border as a winning campaign issue.Trump immediately took credit for Harris' trip, speculating in a statement that the vice president would not have made plans to go if Trump hadn't been headed there himself.Republicans have tried to make Harris the face of the administration's policies, charging that she and Biden were ignoring the issue because both had yet to visit the border. Harris, during her trip to Latin America, told reporters she was focused on “tangible” results “as opposed to grand gestures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facing-criticism-kamala-harris-to-visit-us-mexico-border-area-over-migration-101624471513514.html
23-06-2021||World||China blames India for border tension||China has deployed troops at the border to prevent India from encroaching its territory, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday, adding that New Delhi’s aggressive policies are to blame for the ongoing tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The overall Sino-India ties should not be linked to the boundary dispute either, the ministry also said, reiterating its opinion that the disagreements on the border should be kept at its right place in the range of aspects in the relationship.The Chinese foreign ministry was reacting to a question on Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar’s comments on Tuesday where he said that the Chinese military deployment at the border and uncertainty if Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reduction remain challenges in bilateral ties.New Delhi has also repeatedly said that complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC and peace and tranquility in the border areas alone can lead to normalisation of ties in other spheres such as trade and investment - especially in context of Beijing’s repeated statements that the border question should be kept in its right place.In an interview with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Jaishankar said that the issue there is whether China would live up to the commitments it has made - written commitments it has made - about both countries not allowing a large armed force at the border.China’s “close-up deployment still continues, especially in Ladakh”, the Indian minister said.Beijing, however, stuck to its narrative of blaming New Delhi.“The military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a normal defensive arrangement. It is meant to prevent the encroachment or threat against China’s territory by relevant country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday.“For quite some time the Indian side has been increasing its military along the border and encroaching upon the Chinese territory. This is the root cause of the tense situation along the borders,” Zhao added. “We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations, and we don’t think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties.”India has earlier said that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops had transgressed across the LAC, triggering the friction in eastern Ladakh.New Delhi has told Beijing that given the seriousness of the Galwan Valley incident, it cannot be business as usual - and the border dispute cannot be swept under the carpet - until full disengagement is completed at friction points.India’s external affairs ministry has also spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.More than a year after the ongoing tension began, disengagement of troops is yet to be completed despite 11 rounds of military and seven rounds of diplomatic talks - under the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs - having taken place.China’s PLA has continued deployment of troops and military equipment along the LAC and has even inducted the army’s air defence units in its command chain in Western Theatre Command, establishing joint air defence system along the border for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-india-for-border-tension-101624471664659.html
23-06-2021||World||Delta plus in 11 countries, 197 cases: What we know about Covid variant so far||Delta plus variant of coronavirus in its further mutated form has sent a wave of alert and caution among health authorities across the globe.The mutated variant, experts point out, has increased transmissibility, higher binding capacity to the lung cells and resistance to monoclonal antibody treatment. The variant has mutated from Delta, termed as a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is known to have driven the deadly second wave in India in April and May this year.In a widespread crisis triggered by the Delta variant, lakhs were infected and thousands died in the country as families scrambled to procure drugs like Fabiflu and Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders.The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing Covid-19 disease is mutating continuously with an increase in the number of infections both across the world and in India.Health experts have already said the Delta plus variant could be a concern. The variant calls for a high watch and containment of the affected zone should be done to reduce the transmission.India on Wednesday confirmed 40 cases of the highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant and advised states to increase testing.All Delta sub-lineages are treated as variants of concern and properties of AY.1 are still being investigated. Delta plus is also known as 'AY.1' variant or B.1.617.2.1The variant frequency of AY.1 is low in India. Cases with AY.1 have been mostly reported from nine countries of Europe, Asia and America.WHAT IS DELTA PLUS?First reported in India, the variant "Delta Plus" was cited in the Public Health England bulletin on June 11.The variant is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first found in India and also carries the spike protein mutation called K417N which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.Scientists fear that the mutation combined with other existing features of the Delta variant could make it more transmissible."The mutation K417N has been of interest as it is present in the Beta variant (B.1.351 lineage), which was reported to have immune evasion property," Union health ministry said in a statement.The Delta plus variant is known to reduce the effectiveness of a cocktail of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist told Reuters.WHERE ALL IT HAS BEEN FOUND?As of June 16, at least 197 cases has been found in 11 countries -- Britain (36), Canada (1), India (8), Japan (15), Nepal (3), Poland (9), Portugal (22), Russia (1), Switzerland (18), Turkey (1), the United States (83).In India alone, around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.Britain said its first 5 cases were sequenced on April 26 and they were contacts of individuals who had travelled from, or transited through, Nepal and Turkey.No deaths were reported among the UK and Indian cases.MAJOR CONCERNS AROUND THE VARIANTMultiple studies are ongoing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against this mutation."WHO is tracking this variant as part of the Delta variant, as we are doing for other Variants of Concern with additional mutations," the World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters."For the moment, this variant does not seem to be common, currently accounting for only a small fraction of the Delta sequences ... Delta and other circulating Variants of Concern remain a higher public health risk as they have demonstrated increases in transmission," it said.But India's health ministry warned that regions where it has been found "may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing and priority vaccination."Authorities have spotlighted that Delta Plus can likely inflict another wave of infections on India after it emerged from the world's worst surge in cases only recently."The mutation itself may not lead to a third wave in India - that also depends on Covid-appropriate behaviour, but it could be one of the reasons," Tarun Bhatnagar, an Indian Council for Medical Research scientist told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-plus-in-11-countries-197-cases-what-we-know-about-covid-variant-so-far-101624450918846.html
23-06-2021||World||India Walton defeats Buffalo mayor in Democratic primary||India Walton, a socialist community activist, has defeated the four-term mayor of Buffalo in a Democratic primary, putting her on track to become the first woman to lead New York's second-largest city.The 38-year-old nurse and union leader captured a major political prize for the party's left wing with her victory over Mayor Byron Brown.The Associated Press called the race Wednesday after it became clear there weren’t enough absentee ballots for Brown to overcome Walton’s lead. She had declared victory Tuesday night.As her apparent upset win sunk in, Walton paced on a darkened Buffalo street, putting her hand to her forehead and bowing in disbelief in a moment captured on camera.“Mommy!” the 38-year-old nurse and union representative shouted into her phone. “I won! I’m the mayor of Buffalo!”Walton is all but assured to win the general election in November. There is no Republican candidate in the race.Walton was born in Buffalo’s economically depressed east side and became a working mother at 14. After earning her GED while pregnant, she went on to become a nurse in the same hospital where her twins were born.On the campaign trail, she said Buffalo’s much-talked-about renaissance of recent years, marked by the transformation of the city’s waterfront and medical campus, has passed too many residents by.“All that we are doing in this moment is claiming what is rightfully ours,” Walton told cheering supporters inside a city nightclub. “We are the workers. We do the work. And we deserve a government that works with and for us.”The victory in her first run for office came with the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America and the progressive People's Action in a campaign focused on affordable housing, health care and criminal justice reform.Asked by reporters if she identified as a socialist, she said, “Oh absolutely."“I’m just excited to be a part of this movement that is ushering progressive politics into Buffalo,” she told reporters. “Being the third-poorest mid-sized city in this country, we should be considering how we begin to eradicate concentrated poverty and disadvantage, and Democratic socialist leanings are a big step in getting us there.”Brown, who matched the record for Buffalo's longest-serving mayor and was endorsed by the Erie County Democratic Committee, did not immediately concede following a low-key campaign in which he largely ignored his challengers and declined Walton's request to debate.Both Brown and Walton are Black.A third candidate, Le’Candice Durham, finished last.Brown was a city council member and state senator before becoming mayor.Chris Kutalik Cauthern of DSA USA called Walton's victory “hugely significant” and the first mayoral victory of the growing and more focused “new DSA.”“(It's) the strength of Walton herself, her steady emphasis on working class politics, and the many volunteers in Buffalo who allowed a first-time candidate to beat a four-term incumbent,” he said in an email.One potential opponent for Walton in the general election, Scott Wilson, filed paperwork to appear as a candidate on an independent line, Better Buffalo, but his designating petitions are being challenged for falling short of signatures.Election officials are expected to rule on the matter Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-walton-defeats-buffalo-mayor-in-democratic-primary-101624470318422.html
23-06-2021||World||Heart issues after Covid-19 shots spike to 1,200 cases, says CDC||More than 1,200 cases of heart inflammation have been reported in people who received messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The numbers were reported at a Wednesday meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is weighing heart risks from the vaccines. The meeting is expected to be wide-ranging, with discussion of heart inflammation, booster shots and the use of mRNA vaccines in adolescents.More than 130 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with mRNA shots, according to the CDC, and there have been few reports of serious adverse effects. Two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimens made by Moderna Inc. and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE rely on the technology.Pfizer and BioNTech’s shot was cleared for those 12 to 15 years old in May. About 2 in 10 adolescents among that age group are now fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Initial safety findings from the U.S. health agency suggest real-world data is consistent with the results from the companies’ clinical trial prior to authorization.Shares of Pfizer were down 1.1% at 12:57 p.m. in New York trading, and BioNTech shares fell 5.2%. Moderna shares were also down 6.7%.The risk of heart inflammation following mRNA vaccination in adolescents and young adults age 12-39 is notably higher a few days after the second dose of the vaccine and in men. More data are needed to understand risk factors, treatment and long-term outcomes, according to the advisory committee.Since April, the CDC has seen a spike in reports of myocarditis along with pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane around the heart. The cases, while rare, have occurred mostly in male teens and young adults.“We’re observing this in younger age groups, mainly teens and early twenties,” said Tom Shimabukuro, a safety expert of CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, at the meeting. “This largely disappears when you get to older age groups.”Still, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that mRNA vaccines have been successful in preventing severe illness and death among young people.Speaking at the Milken Institute Future of Health Summit, Walensky added that the data presented at the advisory committee meeting will “overwhelmingly demonstrate that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heart-issues-after-covid-19-shots-spike-to-1-200-cases-says-cdc-101624469922408.html
23-06-2021||World||UK man jailed for sharing Christchurch mosque videos||A 38-year-old British man was on Wednesday jailed for terrorism offences after sharing explosives manuals and extremist videos, including one apparently celebrating the New Zealand mosque massacres, on right-wing chat groups.Michael Nugent of Surrey, southern England, ran a number of far-right chat groups on the Telegram app, using different identities to express his "hatred of ethnic minorities" and to share "terrorist-related documents with others", according to police.A judge at Kingston Crown Court in southwest London jailed him for three-and-a-half years."Nugent freely shared his abhorrent extremist views with others over a messaging app, and he passed on manuals detailing how to produce deadly weapons and explosive devices," said Metropolitan Police Commander Richard Smith.He also shared footage of the attack in Christchurch on the one-year anniversary of the atrocity in March last year and posted the manifesto of the perpetrator of the attack, Brenton Tarrant.Nugent was arrested on August 19, 2020 and initially charged with 12 Terrorism Act offences. A further six charges were subsequently added.He pleaded guilty to five counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and 11 counts of possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.Nugent pleaded not guilty to two counts of encouraging terrorism. The judge however ruled that even though there was sufficient evidence for a prosecution there was no public interest in proceeding on those charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-jailed-for-sharing-christchurch-mosque-videos-101624468380752.html
23-06-2021||World||'Likely link' between rare heart inflammation and Pfizer, Moderna vaccines: CDC||Rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults is likely linked to vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 shots, a group of doctors advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a presentation released on Wednesday.The Covid-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group said in their report that the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination with the mRNA-based shots in adolescents and young adults is notably higher after the second dose and in males.The CDC said in another report that the patients with heart inflammation following vaccination generally recover from the symptoms and do well.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting on Wednesday to assess the possibility of a link between the heart condition and the mRNA vaccines. VaST is a sub-group of ACIP.The CDC has been investigating cases of heart inflammation mainly in young men for several months. The Israeli health ministry earlier this month said it saw a possible link between such cases and Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine.The CDC earlier this month said it was still evaluating the risk from the condition and did not confirm a causal relationship between the vaccines and the heart issue.The agency, however, said a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 shots, with more than half the cases reported in people between the ages of 12 and 24.Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, said in a presentation that data from one of the agency's safety monitoring systems - Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) – suggests a rate of 12.6 cases per million in the three weeks after the second shot in 12- to 39-year-olds.ACIP will discuss the benefits of the mRNA vaccines versus the potential risk to adolescents and young adults from the heart condition, according to the agency's agenda. Although health officials in Israel have determined that there is likely a link between vaccination and the heart inflammation, concerns about the more infectious Delta coronavirus variant have prompted the country to urge 12-to 15-year olds get vaccinated.Pfizer, whose vaccine has been authorized for use in Americans as young as 12, previously said it had not observed a higher rate of heart inflammation than would normally be expected in the general population.Moderna had said it could not identify a causal association with the heart inflammation cases and its vaccine.Over 138 million Americans have so far been fully vaccinated with one of the two mRNA vaccines, according to CDC data as of Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/likely-link-between-rare-heart-inflammation-and-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-cdc-101624468801298.html
23-06-2021||World||Member of Oath Keepers to plead guilty to role in US Capitol attack||An alleged member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia is due to plead guilty on Wednesday to charges related to the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters.The man, Graydon Young, is one of 14 members of the Oath Keepers group charged with crimes including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding for taking part in the assault on Congress, which left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.A court filing said a "plea agreement hearing" is scheduled for Wednesday, but did not specify what charges to which the 54-year-old resident of Engelwood, Florida, will plead. Young is the brother of Laura Steele, 52, of Thomasville, North Carolina, who also faces charges in the case.More than 480 people have been arrested and charged with taking part in the unrest, which saw rioters smash windows, battle police inside and outside the Capitol and sent lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence into hiding.The riot followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud and disrupted the formal count by Congress of electoral votes in the race.Federal prosecutors said in court papers that on Dec. 3, Young emailed a membership application to the Oath Keepers' Florida chapter saying he was "looking to get involved in helping."Then, on Dec. 22, the indictment says, Young made plans to fly from Florida to North Carolina on Jan. 4, with a return trip on Jan. 8. On Dec. 26, prosecutors said, he wrote to a Florida company engaged in firearms and combat training: "I have joined Oath Keepers. I recommended your training to the team. To that effect, four of us would like to train with you."The indictment says Young and eight other indicted Oath Keepers, as well as others "known and unknown," pushed their way in a "stack" up the steps on the east side of the Capitol building.His plea hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday.As described by federal investigators, the Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, who "explicitly focus" on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/member-of-oath-keepers-to-plead-guilty-to-role-in-us-capitol-attack-101624468365408.html

The Chinese Academy of Sciences reportedly nominated the Wuhan Institute of Virology for conducting "the most comprehensive and systematic identification research on the aetiology of Covid-19.""The project's results have laid an important foundation and platform for the follow-up research on the origin, epidemiology, and pathogenic mechanism of the Covid-19 virus," the Chinese Academy of Sciences was quoted as saying in multiple reports.Shi Zhengli, who directs the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also received a special mention from the academy. Last year, Shi, known as batwoman for her work on coronaviruses in bats, said that Sars-CoV-2 was just “the tip of the iceberg” and called for an advanced study of the unknown viruses. However, the virologist has repeatedly dismissed the claims of a possible lab leak.Also Read | What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probeThe hypothesis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident has gained credence in recent weeks, with a renewed demand for a new “transparent” investigation into the virus origin. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which moved a laboratory on December 2, 2019, denied disruptions or incidents caused by the move.China has now been trying to put blame on the United States for the devastating pandemic after the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) published a study that showed at least seven people in five states were infected with Sars-CoV-2 weeks before the country reported its first official cases. Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has demanded the second phase of investigation into the origins of Covid-19 should be conducted in the United States."All bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny," state-run Global Times quoted Zeng as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-nominated-for-top-science-award-in-china-amid-virus-leak-suspicion-101624464991592.html

23-06-2021||World||UK high court rejects Nirav Modi’s appeal against extradition to India||The UK high court has turned down diamantaire Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India, leaving him with five days to mount a further appeal in what is expected to be a protracted legal process. In February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court cleared Nirav Modi’s extradition, finding him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam and dismissing his claims that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in India. UK home secretary Priti Patel subsequently approved the extradition in April. Nirav Modi had approached the UK high court to ascertain if there were any grounds for an appeal against Patel’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates’ Court order. This appeal was rejected by a high court judge on Tuesday. A UK high court official told PTI the permission to appeal was “rejected on paper”, leaving Nirav Modi with the option of making his case at an oral hearing in the high court through a renewed “leave to appeal” application that has to be filed within five days. It is believed Nirav Modi plans to make such an application, and a judge will then determine if the matter should proceed to a full appeal hearing. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Tuesday’s decision by the UK high court was just one step in what is set to be a protracted legal process. There is also speculation that Nirav Modi will have the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights after exhausting all his legal options in the UK. The 50-year-old businessman has been held at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London since March 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request. He is the second high-profile economic offender, after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya, whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020, though the British government has said his extradition is being held up by a “confidential legal issue”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the speedy extradition of both economic offenders during a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson in May. In its judgement in February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court had asserted that Nirav Modi has a case to answer and said that he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded PNB, laundered the money taken from the bank and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses. Nirav Modi’s argument that India has poor prison conditions was rejected by Westminster Magistrates’ Court, with the judge saying that conditions at Barrack Number 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Maharashtra, where he will be held, “are far less restrictive and far more spacious than the current regime he is being held in within the prison estate in our own jurisdiction”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-high-court-rejects-nirav-modi-s-appeal-against-extradition-to-india-101624459543637.html

She even posted the situation on her Facebook page to get the attention of the community and local media, thinking it was either a scam or someone was trying to clear their warehouse."When I first started receiving the packages, I called Amazon to try and give them back, but they explained to me that they were officially mine to keep since they had been delivered to my home," NBC News quoted Cannan as saying.Cannan wrote on Facebook that a woman had accused her of staging empty packages for “[five] minutes of fame”, adding that the woman must be fuming after a local news channel covered the story and showed the packages were full of silicone support frames to use inside face masks in both adult and children's sizes.Cannan said that her kids took packs of brackets to the school for their classmates and “found a use for 50 out of the 50,000 brackets.”Also Read | India e-commerce rules cast cloud over Amazon, Walmart and local rivalsAmazon was finally able to trace the original owner and told Cannan that she would have to keep the items already delivered along with over 1,000 boxes that were already in transit. After a few days of back-and-forth, Amazon finally agreed to take back the shipments and gave the family the option to donate, keep, or dispose of.“I want to apologize for the trouble this recent situation has caused you and your family. I can only imagine how this moment in time has impacted your lives,” Amazon’s executive customer relations wrote to Cannan, as per the screenshot of the email posted on her Facebook page.Cannan decided to use the brackets to create mask kits for patients at the local children's hospital.The story also made it to Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-gets-hundreds-of-packages-by-mistake-amazon-initially-refuses-to-take-back-101624457703083.html

23-06-2021||World||4 killed in car bomb attack short distance from Hafiz Saeed’s house in Lahore||Four people were killed and some 20 others, including policemen and children, injured when a car bomb went off a short distance from Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed’s home in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday. Among the injured were several policemen manning a checkpoint near the house of Saeed, currently serving a sentence in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail after his conviction for involvement in terror financing. The site of the blast was near Saeed’s residence at BOR Society in Johar Town neighbourhood. A building was severely damaged by the intense explosion, which blew out the windows of nearby structures and hit several cars. The windows and walls of Saeed’s house too were damaged. “As far as the question of the house of a high-value target is concerned, you would have seen there is a [police] picket near the house, and the car couldn’t get close to that house only because of the picket,” Punjab province’s police chief Inam Ghani told reporters at the site of the attack when he was asked if the blast was in any way aimed at Saeed’s house. “If there was no picket, the car could have gone anywhere. You should appreciate that they couldn’t get to any target because of the presence of the police. Our view is that the target was the police and they wanted to undermine law enforcement agencies,” he added. Ghani said there could have been a “major loss” if there had been no police post near Saeed’s house. There was no claim of responsibility for the blast and Ghani said officers were trying to ascertain whether the car bomb was triggered by a suicide attacker or detonated remotely. Ghani confirmed three deaths, and a police spokesman subsequently said a four-year-old child had succumbed to his wounds. Some of the injured, including children, were in critical condition, a spokesman for Jinnah Hospital said. Officials said many of the injured were hit by ball bearings packed into the bomb. Fahim Ahmad, a witness, told reporters that a car parked close to a house had exploded, setting ablaze other cars and motorcycles. Images and footage aired by TV news channels showed badly damaged vehicles and homes, including one building whose walls had collapsed. Additional police forces and bomb disposal teams reached the site soon after the incident. Saeed has for long had a residence in Johar Town. However, he is currently in jail after he was arrested and convicted last year in a string of terror financing cases. Last November, he was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of terror financing. Saeed has been designated a terrorist by the UN and the US, which has offered a $10 million bounty for him. The Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people but Saeed was never charged in connection with the carnage. Punjab province chief minister Usman Buzdar sought a report on the incident from the police chief. Pakistan’s interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed also sought a report on the incident from Punjab’s chief secretary and police chief. He said in a tweet that federal agencies were assisting the Punjab government in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-killed-in-car-bomb-attack-short-distance-from-hafiz-saeed-s-house-in-lahore-101624454983331.html

As of Wednesday, the Delta variant raised concerns in countries like France, Germany and Norway.The highly transmissible variant which the experts have termed to be more infectious than other variants is responsible for at least 9-10% of the total new confirmed cases in France, officials said. This is in sharp contrast to 2-4% of the cases seen last week in France.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal on Wednesday said that France is on a watch for countries that can prove to be risky, adding Russia to the list.Russia had been added to the list of countries considered by France as “high-risk” Covid zones, along with Namibia and Seychelles, Attal said.Germany is the second country on Wednesday to have upped its guard against the Delta Variant as Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country should not risk what it has achieved in its fight against the virus amid a rise in Delta variant cases."Germany's coronavirus infection levels are encouraging but cases of the Delta variant are rising and the country should exercise sound judgment so as not to risk what it has achieved," Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday."The pandemic is not over yet. We are still on thin ice," she told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.The third country on a lookout for cases driven by Delta variant is Norway. The health minister Bent Høie on Wednesday said the Covid-19 variant can become dominant in Norway next month.Hawaii in the US has signalled trouble due to the variant on Wednesday, confirmed the community spread of Covid-19 Delta variant.The island state has recorded two cases on Oahu and one on the Big Island involving travel from the US mainland. One case involves an Oahu resident with no travel history. The state Department of Health said it is “investigating to determine the extent of household and community transmission.”Acting State Epidemiologist Dr Sarah Kemble said of the four cases, only one person was vaccinated. Health experts say vaccines remain effective against the variant. Hawaii's vaccination rate is 57%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-wreaking-havoc-in-france-germany-norway-on-guard-101624450662898.html

I am now resigning from that post, just as I have done at all corporate boards other than Berkshire's," Buffett said in a statement.Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, co-founders of the foundation, filed for divorce in May after 27 years of marriage but pledged to continue their philanthropic work together.The 21-year-old foundation has become one of the most powerful and influential forces in global public health, spending more than $50 billion over the past two decades to bring a business approach to combating poverty and disease.Last year, Buffett reported donating more than $2 billion of stock in his investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway Inc , to the Gates Foundation as part of previously announced plans to give away his entire fortune before his death.The 90-year-old also said he was pledging $4.1 billion to philanthropy.

In a tweet, he called for NATO to cooperate with Ukraine in the Black Sea.Russia seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and considers areas around the peninsula's coast to be Russian waters. Western countries consider the peninsula part of Ukraine and reject Russia's claim to the seas around it.Russia's defence ministry, quoted by Interfax news agency, said the British ship had left Russian waters soon after the incident, having ventured as much as 3 kilometers (2 miles) inside. It said the confrontation occurred near Cape Fiolent, a landmark on the southern coast of Crimea near the port of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Russian Navy's Black Sea fleet."The destroyer had been warned that weapons would be used if it trespasses the border of the Russian Federation. It did not react to the warning," it said.A Russian bomber dropped four high explosive fragmentation bombs as a warning in the British destroyer's path, according to the Russian ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-forces-reportedly-fire-warning-shots-at-british-destroyer-in-black-sea-101624450496560.html

Google said that in the post-pandemic work model 60% of its employees will meet in offices on a few days of the week and 20% of its workers will be in new office locations. The rest of the ‘Googlers’ will be expected to work from home, according to the report. Google has close to 140,000 employees across the planet.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai reflected on the need for flexibility regarding remote work and changes of location as tech companies reopen their office premises abandoned during the pandemic.“We’ll move to a hybrid work week when most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas, and functions will help decide which day's team will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on-site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,” Pichai said in an email addressed to employees, according to a report by technology news website CNET.(with inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/googles-new-tool-shows-employees-projections-on-salary-based-on-location-101624448287376.html
23-06-2021||World||Biden to launch gun crime strategy, steer Covid funds for police||President Joe Biden will launch a comprehensive plan to curb gun crime, including by allowing states and municipalities to tap into coronavirus relief funding to hire police officers under certain circumstances.Biden will unveil the strategy in a speech on Wednesday, officials familiar with the plan said, speaking on condition of anonymity before the announcement. Measures include toughening rules for gun dealers, expanding summer programs for teenagers and doing more to hire people released from prison.Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland will also lead a meeting Wednesday at the White House on crime prevention. Among those scheduled to attend are New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul and the mayors of Baltimore, Maryland, and Miami-Dade County, Florida.Biden is initiating the effort as data show a continued increase in violent crime, one that carried through the pandemic, and as Congress continues to negotiate over police reform. Polls have also signaled growing unease over crime, a potential liability for Biden and Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Biden’s strategy on community safety goes hand-in-hand with the effort by allies to reach a deal on police reform.‘Bully Pulpit’“Yes, there needs to be reforms of police systems across the country; the president is a firm believer in that,” she said. “But there are also steps he can take, as president of the United States, to help address and hopefully reduce that crime. A big part of that, in his view, is putting in place gun safety measures, using -- even as Congress is not moving forward currently -- using the bully pulpit, but also using levers at his disposal, as president.”Cities across the U.S. have experienced increases in violent crime, a trend that Biden’s White House says has been unfolding for years.The plan that the president will discuss on Wednesday has five pillars, the officials said:Some progressive Democrats have also amplified calls to “defund the police,” or redirect money from law enforcement to other community programs. That movement has prompted Republican attacks, which Biden has tried to deflect by instead calling for more money for targeted policing programs.Biden had hoped for a deal on a police reform bill by late May. Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who has been heavily involved in the talks, said he thinks it’s “June or bust” to get an agreement.Psaki argued that Biden can move to quell crime without roiling the police reform talks. “Communities across the country who advocate and support police reform, they don’t see it as a mutually exclusive issue; neither does the president,” she said.A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released in May found that 36% of respondents at least somewhat approved of Biden’s handling of crime, while 44% at least somewhat disapproved. Nearly 50% of respondents said crime is a very big problem in the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-launch-gun-crime-strategy-steer-covid-funds-for-police-101624440441461.html

23-06-2021||World||Rap turns ‘100%’ patriotic in China for Communist party’s 100th birthday||Rap music, usually known for its anti-establishment lyrics and artistes’ rage against society, has turned 100% patriotic in China. The occasion is rather heavy, of course - marking the upcoming 100 years of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The song is called 100%, a 15-minute long single, meant to be an ode to China’s history under the CPC.The title, not unexpectedly, refers to both the 100th anniversary of the CPC and the 100 rappers who collaborated to release it, local media said. The idea behind releasing a patriotic rap song was to arouse patriotism among the Chinese youth through pop culture.Hip-Hop Fusion, the music company behind 100%, told the website SixthTon that the song “expresses the patriotic soul of each rapper”.State-run media highlighted the work of rappers from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibet in the song, the remote provinces where the Chinese government has been accused of large-scale human rights violation of minority ethnicities especially, the Uighurs and Tibetans.“Max Ma Jun, an artiste from northwest China’s XUAR expressed “loyalty to the country” and “respect for different voices” in his verse, whereas Buttons, a rapper from Qamdo in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region wrote in the song that ‘the spirit of five stars is imprinted on my chest’,”, the Global Times reported.“From impoverishment to brilliance, I have no regrets that I grew up in a Chinese family in this life,” raps one of the artistes JR Fog.“We used to look forward to the Red Army, a spring breeze all over the Earth. Keep tradition in mind, achieve socialism, as the red flag stays in my heart,” another artiste Colan sings.“New China must get lit,” sings another rapper HEAT J.Many of China’s best-known rappers are missing from the song’s list of collaborators.“Perhaps the biggest (artiste) is Jiang Yunsheng, one of the rising stars in the reality show Rap for Youth in 2020 and who now boasts a legion of over 2 million fans on the microblogging platform Weibo,” reported SixthTone.This is not the first time China’s propaganda apparatus has tried rap to reach out to the youth.In 2019, China’s official news agency, Xinhua, co-produced a rap video entitled Two Sessions: To the World from China to mark the annual session of the parliament - the National People’s Congress - and the country’s top political advisory body.In 2018, the CPC mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, released an animated rap video on Two Sessions, which included vox pop-style interviews with citizens and even a few foreigners.A series of events are being held across China to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC including an ongoing party-wide campaign on CPC history learning and education.On July 1, President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will deliver an important speech.Xi will also present the July 1 Medal and certificate to party members on the day for contributing to the CPC’s cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rap-turns-100-patriotic-in-china-for-communist-party-s-100th-birthday-101624437882730.html

The aircraft's operations were paused in August 2020, according to RadarBox.com.Operated by Antonov Airlines, the 84-metre huge aircraft took off from Gostomel Antonov Airport in Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Tuesday evening and flew towards West Asia, as per aviation news website Simple Flying.

This is reported to be the largest volume of cargo ever carried by plane, Simple Flying reported. The airline broke its record a week later after transporting even more supplies from China to France.

23-06-2021||World||Olympics organisers ban alcohol, defend allowing spectators to curb Covid spread||With 30 days to go until the start of an Olympic Games dogged by the coronavirus pandemic and by controversy, Tokyo Olympics organisers decided on Wednesday against selling alcohol at venues while defending plans to allow thousands of spectators.Organisers have pushed ahead with preparations for the Games, postponed from 2020 because of the pandemic, despite strong concerns among the Japanese public that hosting delegations from across the globe could result in further Covid-19 outbreaks.Media reports that organisers were considering allowing alcohol consumption in Olympics venues provoked a public outcry earlier this week, with the hashtag "cancel pandemic-hit-olympics-in-numbers the Olympic Games" garnering tens of thousands of tweets."Following experts' advice, the organising committee decided against selling and drinking alcohol drinks at the venues so as to prevent spread of infections," Tokyo Olympics President Seiko Hashimoto told reporters, adding that sponsor Asahi Breweries agreed with the decision to ban alcohol sales.Alcohol sales have been restricted in and around Tokyo after health officials warned drinking would encourage close contact, loud speaking and mingling in bars that could help spread the virus.Earlier, Hashimoto defended the organisers' decision to allow spectators into Olympic venues.Japanese medical experts have said banning spectators was the least risky option but also included recommendations on how best to host the Games if spectators were admitted.Organisers said on Monday up to 10,000 domestic spectators would be allowed into venues. Foreign visitors are banned."We decided that it would be better to do the best preparations we can for a Games with spectators," Hashimoto said at a media roundtable attended by Reuters on Tuesday, saying the decision was in line with the medical experts' recommendations."Of course, I understand that holding the event without spectators would lower the risk, but there is evidence that there have been no clusters at other events and tournaments," Hashimoto said.LIMITING CELEBRATIONSOrganisers said on Wednesday they would decide on whether to allow spectators at night sessions, taking infections into account, by July 12 when virus curbs are due to be lifted in Tokyo and some other areas.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has still not ruled out holding the Games without spectators if Tokyo is put back under a state of emergency, from which it only emerged on June 21. The Games' opening ceremony is set for July 23."The major challenge at the Tokyo Games is to curb a flow of people and limit a sense of celebration," Hashimoto said on Wednesday. "We are striving to make the Tokyo Games safe and secure, so it won't be full of celebration."Many Japanese remain sceptical about the possibility of holding even a scaled-down Games safely during a pandemic.In another blow to organisers' pledge that the Games will be safe, a member of the Ugandan delegation who arrived in Japan on the weekend tested positive for coronavirus despite having been vaccinated and testing negative for Covid-19 before arrival.The nine-strong delegation cancelled their plans to train and are currently quarantining in a hotel, local media reported.Hashimoto said the incident was proof of the effectiveness of the coronavirus measures in place."We were able to identify this person at the border precisely because we have the proper border measures in place," she said.But the arduous preparations for the Olympics also appeared to have taken its toll on organisers.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike was hospitalised on Tuesday after the metropolitan government said she would take the rest of the week off due to fatigue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/olympics-organisers-ban-alcohol-defend-allowing-spectators-to-curb-covid-spread-101624436298050.html

India, while exercising the Right of Reply to the statements made by Pakistan at the 47th session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) at the United Nations in Geneva, said that attacks on minorities are occurring on a daily basis.Cleric nabbed on religious conversion charges in Pakistan“The plight of minorities in Pakistan is evident from their shrinking size. Forced conversions’ have become a daily phenomenon in Pakistan. We have seen reports of minor girls belonging to religious minorities being abducted, raped, forcibly converted and married. More than 1,000 girls, belonging to religious minorities, are forcibly converted in Pakistan every year,” Pawan Badhe, first secretary in India’s permanent mission in Geneva said during the session.Pak Hindu lawmaker wants religious minorities to be termed as 'non-Muslims'Badhe also said that Christians, Ahmadiyyas, Sikhs and Hindus continue to face persecution in the hands of the majority. He said these communities face systematic persecution at the hands of the Pakistani government.Hindu temple in Pakistan vandalised, set on fire“Systematic persecution of minorities, including Christians, Ahmadiyyas, Sikhs, Hindus through draconian blasphemy laws, forced conversions and marriages and extra-judicial killings, has become a regular phenomenon in Pakistan. Holy and ancient sites of religious minorities in Pakistan are attacked and vandalised,” Badhe further added.Ethnic and religious minorities in PakistanSindhis are the largest ethnic minority group in Pakistan followed by Pashtuns, Mohajirs and Baluchis.

Over a 1,000kg of illegal drugs were seized, including 444kg of cocaine, 182kg of crystal meth, 427kg of marijuana, and 300 oxycodone pills. Police also seized 21 vehicles, including five tractor-trailers, 966,020 Canadian dollars in cash and a firearm.The tractor-trailers were being used to transport drugs between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Multiple law enforcement agencies participated in the operation, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police, York Regional Police, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), Windsor Police Service, Montreal Police, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, while Canadian police collaborated with the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.Of those arrested, nine are of Indian-origin: Gurbakhash Singh Grewal, 37, of Brampton, Amarbir Singh Sarkaria, 25, of Caledon, Harbaljit Singh Toor, 46, of Caledon, Harwinder Bhullar, 43, of Caledon, Sarjant Singh Dhaliwal, 37, of Kitchener, Gurveer Dhaliwal, 26, of Kitchener, Gurmanpreet Grewal, 26, of Kitchener, Sukhwant Brar, 37, of Brampton and Parminder Gill, 33, of Brampton.“The removal of this quantity of drugs destined for the streets of our respective communities has without question prevented countless overdoses, acts of drug-related violence like shootings, and other occurrences that diminish the quality of life for our citizens,” Toronto Police chief James Ramer said.“When such networks are operating across three countries, Canada, the US and Mexico, ongoing collaboration between agencies, including CBSA is vital,” York Regional Police chief Jim MacSween said.The name for the operation was derived from the first seizure, when Toronto police’s drug squad raided a tractor-trailer carrying a consignment of hair dryers.This follows another major bust announced in April this year. In an operation dubbed Project Cheetah, law enforcement led by the York Regional Police arrested and charged over two dozen people and seized about 2.3 million Canadian dollars ($1.86 million) worth of drugs which included 10kg of cocaine, 8kg of ketamine, 3kg of heroin and 2.5kg of opium. Investigators also seized 48 firearms and 730,000 in Canadian currency ($592,588).

23-06-2021||World||Bitcoin bounces back after tumbling below $30,000 threshold||woBitcoin extended gains in Asia trading Wednesday, bouncing back after earlier whipsawing investors with a dip below the $30,000 level.The largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 4.5% and was trading at $33,837 as of 9:38 a.m. in Hong Kong. The coin plunged 12% at one point during U.S. trading hours Tuesday to hit $28,824, which briefly took it into negative territory for the year. Prior to that, it hadn’t fallen below $30,000 since January.Bitcoin has lost more than 50% from its mid-April high of almost $65,000. The coin started 2021 trading around $29,000 following a fourfold increase in 2020.Such trading signals “that Bitcoin traders could find themselves in choppy waters for weeks to come,” said Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments.Chart-watchers said Bitcoin, which failed to stay above $40,000 last week, could have a tough time finding support in the $20,000 range following its drop below $30,000. Still, Bitcoin had prior to Tuesday breached $30,000 during at least five separate instances this year but recuperated to trade above that level each time.“Any meaningful break below $30,000 is going to make a lot of momentum players to throw in the towel,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Therefore, even if Bitcoin is going to change the world over the long-term, it does not mean it cannot fall back into the teens over the short-term.”It’s a remarkable comedown for the digital asset which just weeks ago was trekking higher amid a warmer embrace from Wall Street as well as retail investors. But negative attention about its energy use, brought on largely by Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, as well as a clampdown from China have pushed it lower in recent weeks.China’s latest broadside came Monday, when the nation’s central bank said it had summoned officials from the biggest lenders as well as AliPay to reiterate a ban on cryptocurrency services. Chinese officials are already trying to root out crypto mining operations.“Bitcoin’s continued sell-off has contributed to a negative outlook by traders driven by bearish news out of China,” said Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics provider Trade The Chain. “The mood among traders is now continuing to sour.”Exuberant rallies and quick drawdowns are not uncommon for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin underwent a renaissance in 2017, rising more than 1,000% that year, only to lose roughly 75% in the following year. And last year, it advanced 300%.“The most speculative part of the market is cryptocurrency,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance. “At the end of the day, what determines the value of Bitcoin is acceptance and more demand and supply. When you have a country like China come out against Bitcoin, that really hurts it’s global acceptance and that’s why you’re seeing the value deteriorate as much as it has.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-bounces-back-after-tumbling-below-30-000-threshold-101624414613796.html
23-06-2021||World||Saudis who killed Jamal Khashoggi received paramilitary training in US: Report||The four men - part of a Saudi kill team - who eliminated Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, received paramilitary training in the United States, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Tuesday. Citing documents and people familiar with the developments, NYT reported that the training was given under a contract approved by the US state department.The report said that the training was provided by Tier 1 Group, which is owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. The training included “safe marksmanship” and “countering an attack”, according to the NYT report, which quoted the company to say that it was devised to better protect Saudi leaders.The news report further points out that the American officials who approved the training knew the Saudis were involved in the crackdown.Responding to the NYT report, state department spokesperson Ned Price said the department cannot comment "on any of the licensed defence export licensing activity alleged in media reporting". Price also said US policy towards Saudi Arabia "will prioritise the rule of law and respect for human rights."Cerberus senior executive Louis Bremer confirmed his company's role in the training of four members of the Khashoggi kill team last year in written answers to questions from members of Congress as part of his nomination for a senior Pentagon job in former President Donald Trump's administration, according to NYT.But, NYT said, the lawmakers never received the answers because the Trump administration does not appear to have sent them to Congress before withdrawing Bremer’s nomination.Khashoggi, a US resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. A US intelligence report in February said the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill the journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-who-killed-jamal-khashoggi-received-paramilitary-training-in-us-report-101624414318964.html

Harris announced to cast her vote in favour of Ahuja on Tuesday after the Senate vote on this resulted in 50-50 votes on party lines."The Senate being evenly divided, the Vice President votes in affirmative,” Harris said. With this, she has so far cast the 6th tie-breaking vote as the Vice President this year.Also Read: Who is Kiran Ahuja, Biden's choice for the US Office of Personnel Management?Senator Dianne Feinstein said Ahuja has more than two decades of experience in public service and the philanthropic sector, including a senior role in OPM under former president Barack Obama.“She has a breadth of knowledge and experience that will serve her well in the role,” she said.“In particular I’m looking forward to working with her to resolve a critical pay disparity issue between state and federal wildland firefighters. State firefighter salaries can be as much as double that of their federal counterparts, making it difficult to hire and retain skilled federal wildland firefighters,” she added.Representing the view of the opposition Republicans, Senator James Lankford said he did not believe the head of HR of the federal government should be so outspokenly in favour of abortion and pushing the need for critical race theory training.“OPM has been plagued with paperwork backlogs, survivor benefit delays, cyber-security issues, and more. The leader of OPM should focus on addressing those issues, not divisive social justice policies and abortion,” he said.Ahuja served as the Chief of Staff to the Director of the US Office of Personnel Management from 2015 to 2017. She currently serves as the CEO of Philanthropy Northwest, a regional network of philanthropic institutions.She began her career as a civil rights lawyer at the US Department of Justice, litigating school desegregation cases, and filing the department’s first student racial harassment case. From 2003 to 2008, Ahuja served as the founding executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, an advocacy and membership organisation.During the Obama-Biden Administration, she spent six years as executive director of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, leading efforts to increase access to federal services, resources and programs for underserved Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs).Ahuja grew up in Savannah, Georgia, as a young Indian immigrant in the wake of the civil rights era, and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Spelman College and a law degree from the University of Georgia.“Throughout her career, Kiran Ahuja has built a tremendous record of championing federal personnel matters & remains a strong advocate for women of color,” said Senator Raphael Warnock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kiran-ahuja-confirmed-as-head-of-us-office-of-personnel-management-101624413621753.html
23-06-2021||World||Great Barrier Reef downgraded: Other UN World Heritage sites in danger||The World Heritage Committee under UNESCO has proposed to downgrade the status of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, recommending it to be added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger. The committee said it's recommendation is based on the detrimental impact of climate change.Irked by the decision, Australia said it will challenge UNESCO's draft recommendation. "For us to be singled out in a way that completely distorts the normal process was something we were very strong about. And we made the point that we will challenge this decision when it comes before the full committee later on in July," Environment minister Sussan Ley said, noting that the authorities were "blindsided by a sudden late decision".UNESCO's proposal also sparked an outcry among representatives of tourism businesses, as they fear the inclusion in the list of sites in danger will affect the industry.Here are the other places that risk losing their treasured heritage site status:VeniceUNESCO said that the city in Italy has been damaged by "overtourism", and recommended adding Venice to its endangered heritage list.The UN body acknowledged that the number of tourists have "drastically decreased" during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the damage has already been done and called for more sustainable tourism.BudapestThe Hungarian city, bisected by river Danube, has been put on the endangered list because of a major renovation of the Buda Castle quarter. The move is aimed at restoring the city's pre-World War 2 glory.But UNESCO argues that the reconstruction flouts international conservation norms and called for the work be halted.LiverpoolThe maritime city in England has faced the greatest fury of UNESCO, which has recommended taking Liverpool off the World Heritage list altogether.The reason for the harsh decision is the redevelopment of Liverpool's historic waterfront and northern dock area. UNESCO chided the city for failing to cap the heights for new buildings.Tanzania game reserveThe granting of logging rights inside the Selous Game Reserve has landed it in hot water with UNESCO. The UN had recently expressed alarm over the construction of a dam on the Rufiji river, the country's largest.Lamenting Tanzania's decision to forge ahead with the project, despite the ecological threat to the floodplain, UNESCO says the reserve's "outstanding" character has suffered "irreversible" damage and recommended that it be taken off the World Heritage list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/great-barrier-reef-downgraded-other-un-world-heritage-sites-in-danger-101624413178187.html

Both came back online using Iranian domain addresses Alalam.ir and Presstv.ir.The Justice Department said the 33 domains used by IRTVU are owned by a United States company and that IRTVU did not obtain a license from Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to utilizing the domain names.KH also did not obtain a license.Notices appeared earlier on Tuesday on a number of Iran-affiliated websites saying they had been seized by the United States government as part of law enforcement action.Iranian news agencies said the U.S. government had seized several Iranian media websites and sites belonging to groups affiliated with Iran such as Yemen's Houthi movement.The notices appeared days after a prominent hardliner and fierce critic of the West, Ebrahim Raisi, was elected as Iran's new president and after envoys for Iran and six world powers, including Washington, adjourned high-stakes talks on reviving their tattered 2015 nuclear accord and returned to capitals for consultations.The website of the Arabic-language Masirah TV, which is run by the Houthis, read:"The domain almasirah.net has been seized by the United States Government in accordance with a seizure warrant ... as part of a law enforcement action by the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement and Federal Bureau of Investigation."The site quickly opened up a new, working website at www.almasirah.com.Iran's Arabic language Alalam TV said on its Telegram channel: "U.S. authorities shut down Al-Alam TV's website."Notices also appeared on the website of Lualua TV, an Arabic-language Bahraini independent channel that broadcasts from Britain.U.S. prosecutors in October seized a network of web domains they said were used in a campaign by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to spread political disinformation around the world.The Justice Department said then it had taken control of 92 domains used by the IRGC to pose as independent media outlets targeting audiences in the United States, Europe, Middle East and Southeast Asia.The semi-official Iranian news agency YJC agency said on Tuesday the U.S. move "demonstrates that calls for freedom of speech are lies."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blocks-websites-linked-to-iranian-disinformation-101624412155076.html
23-06-2021||World||Australia hits out at threatened UN downgrade of Great Barrier Reef||Australia said Tuesday it will strongly oppose a UNESCO plan to list the Great Barrier Reef as being "in danger" over deterioration caused by climate change.The UN body released a draft report on Monday recommending the reef's World Heritage status be downgraded because of its dramatic coral decline, after years of public threats to do so."It's a warning to the international community and all of humanity that the coral ecosystem is in danger," Fanny Douvere, the head of UNESCO's World Heritage marine programme, told an online press briefing.The reef is one of seven sites threatened with being added to the endangered heritage list over ecological damage, overdevelopment, overtourism or security concerns.The Italian city of Venice, which has been overrun with tourists, and the waterfront of the English city of Liverpool, which is undergoing a major redevelopment, are among the other listings in UNESCO's sights.Environmental campaigners said the threat to the Great Barrier Reef's heritage status highlight Australia's lack of action to curb the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming.Environment Minister Sussan Ley said Australia would challenge the move, accusing UN officials of backflipping on their assurances ahead of the World Heritage Committee's 44th session in China next month, where the recommendation will be formally considered."Politics have subverted a proper process and for the World Heritage Committee to not even foreshadow this listing is, I think, appalling," she told reporters in Canberra.The UN body did not consider the billions of dollars spent attempting to protect the world's largest coral reef, she added.- 'From poor to very poor' -The committee's draft report did commend Australia's efforts to improve reef quality and its financial commitment.But it noted "with the utmost concern and regret... that the long-term outlook for the ecosystem of the property has further deteriorated from poor to very poor," referring to Australia's move to downgrade the reef's health status after back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.Ley said she had spoken to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay overnight Monday to express "very clearly our strong disappointment, even bewilderment".Placement on the UN body's in-danger list is not considered a sanction. According to UNESCO, some nations have their sites added to gain international attention and help to save them, but it is seen as a dishonour by others.UNESCO has recommended that a total of seven sites be added to the endangered list and that two sites -- Liverpool's waterfront and Selous game reserve in Tanzania, where poachers have run amok -- be stripped of their World Heritage status altogether.Australia has resisted calls to commit to a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country hoped to reach carbon neutrality "as soon as possible" without harming its commodity-dependent economy.The downgrade recommendation for the Great Barrier Reef prompted environmental groups to take aim at the Australian government's reluctance to take stronger climate action.- 'Shame' -The Climate Council said it brought "shame on the federal government, which is standing by as the reef declines rather than fighting to protect it"."The recommendation from UNESCO is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change," said WWF head of oceans Richard Leck.UNESCO's Douvere acknowledged that Australia had made "tremendous efforts" to shore up the reef."The Australian government cannot save the Great Barrier Reef by itself," she said, while adding that Canberra could act to improve water quality at the reef, which would increase its resilience to climate change.Aside from its inestimable natural, scientific and environmental value, the 2,300-kilometre-long (1,400-mile-long) reef was worth an estimated US$4.8 billion a year in tourism revenue for the Australian economy before the coronavirus pandemic.In December, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said climate change had pushed the reef into critical condition.Australian Marine Conservation Society environmental consultant Imogen Zethoven said the UNESCO report made clear that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was critical for the reef."Australia's climate record is more consistent with a 2.5-3.0 Celsius rise in global average temperature -- a level that would destroy the Great Barrier Reef and all the world's coral reefs," she said.The Great Barrier Reef has now suffered three mass coral bleaching events in the past five years, losing half its corals since 1995 as ocean temperatures have climbed.The reef has also been battered by several cyclones as climate change drives more extreme weather and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish -- which eat the coral -- in recent decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-hits-out-at-threatened-un-downgrade-of-great-barrier-reef-101624411864389.html

The decision to downgrade of the Great Reef's status was politically motivated and flawed, Australian environment minister Sussan Ley said, hinting at China which chairs the UNESCO committee.What did the UNESCO say?The UN body released a draft report on Monday recommending the reef's World Heritage status be downgraded because of its dramatic coral decline.The committee's draft report did commend Australia's efforts to improve reef quality and its financial commitment.But it noted "with the utmost concern and regret... that the long-term outlook for the ecosystem of the property has further deteriorated from poor to very poor," referring to Australia's move to downgrade the reef's health status after back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.What is the meaning of this?Placement on the UN body's in-danger list is not considered a sanction. According to UNESCO, some nations have their sites added to gain international attention and help to save them, but it is seen as a dishonour by others.UNESCO has recommended that a total of seven sites be added to the endangered list and that two sites - Liverpool's waterfront and Selous game reserve in Tanzania, where poachers have run amok - be stripped of their World Heritage status altogether.About the reef, the Climate Council said it brought "shame on the federal government, which is standing by as the reef declines rather than fighting to protect it".What are the repercussions?The downgrade recommendation for the Great Barrier Reef prompted environmental groups to take aim at the Australian government's reluctance to take stronger climate action.Environmental campaigners said the threat to the Great Barrier Reef's heritage status highlights Australia's lack of action to curb the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming."The recommendation from UNESCO is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change," said WWF head of oceans Richard Leck.Fanny Douvere, the head of UNESCO's World Heritage marine programme, said that that Canberra could act to improve water quality at the reef, which would increase its resilience to climate change.What will be Australia's next move?The country's environment minister Sussan Ley said that Australia would challenge the move, accusing UN officials of backflipping on their assurances ahead of the World Heritage Committee's 44th session in China next month, where the recommendation will be formally considered."Politics have subverted a proper process and for the World Heritage Committee to not even foreshadow this listing is, I think, appalling," she told reporters in Canberra. Ley said she had spoken to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay overnight Monday to express "very clearly our strong disappointment, even bewilderment".The UN body did not consider the billions of dollars spent attempting to protect the world's largest coral reef, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-great-barrier-reef-downgrading-and-its-impact-on-australia-101624411865580.html
23-06-2021||World||US betting on antiviral pills to treat Covid-19; to spend $3.2B on treatments||The United States is pouring $3.2 billion to speed development of antiviral pills to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and other dangerous viruses that could turn into pandemics.The new program will invest in “accelerating things that are already in progress” for Covid-19 but also would work to come up with treatments for other viruses, said Dr Anthony Fauci, US' top infectious disease expert.“There are few treatments that exist for many of the viruses that have pandemic potential. Vaccines clearly remain the centerpiece of our arsenal,” he said, including Ebola, dengue, West Nile and Middle East respiratory syndrome.The US has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, specifically for Covid-19 and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the coronavirus.Health experts have increasingly called for a convenient pill that patients could take themselves when symptoms first appear. Some drugmakers are testing such medications, but initial results aren’t expected for several more months.Last week, the US said it would purchase 1.7 million doses of an experimental antiviral pill from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, if it is shown to be safe and effective. Early research suggests the drug may reduce the risk of hospitalization if used shortly after infection by stopping the coronavirus from quickly reproducing. It did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease.Several other companies, including Pfizer, Roche and AstraZeneca are also testing antiviral pills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-betting-on-antiviral-pills-to-treat-covid-19-to-spend-3-2b-on-treatments-101624409937319.html
23-06-2021||World||Hunger, drought, disease: UN climate report reveals dire health threats||Hunger, drought and disease will afflict tens of millions more people within decades, according to a draft UN assessment that lays bare the dire human health consequences of a warming planet.After a pandemic year that saw the world turned on its head, a forthcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), seen exclusively by AFP, offers a distressing vision of the decades to come: malnutrition, water insecurity, pestilence.Policy choices made now, like promoting plant-based diets, can limit these health consequences -- but many are simply unavoidable in the short term, the report says.It warns of the cascading impacts that simultaneous crop failures, falling nutritional value of basic foods, and soaring inflation are likely to have on the world's most vulnerable people.Depending on how well humans get a handle on carbon emissions and rising temperatures, a child born today could be confronted with multiple climate-related health threats before turning 30, the report shows.The IPCC's 4,000-page draft report, scheduled for release next year, offers the most comprehensive rundown to date of the impacts of climate change on our planet and our species.It predicts that up to 80 million more people than today will be at risk of hunger by 2050.It projects disruptions to the water cycle that will see rain-fed staple crops decline across sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 40 percent of rice-producing regions in India could become less suitable for farming the grain.Global maize production has already declined four percent since 1981 due to climate change, and human-induced warming in West Africa has reduced millet and sorghum yields by up to 20 and 15 percent respectively, it shows.The frequency of sudden food production losses has already increased steadily over the past 50 years."The basis for our health is sustained by three pillars: the food we eat, access to water, and shelter," Maria Neira, director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organization, told AFP."These pillars are totally vulnerable and about to collapse."- Emerging hotspots -Even as rising temperatures affect the availability of key crops, nutritional value is declining, according to the report.The protein content of rice, wheat, barley and potatoes, for example, is expected to fall by between six and 14 percent, putting close to 150 million more people at risk of protein deficiency.Essential micronutrients -- already lacking in many diets in poorer nations -- are also set to decline as temperatures rise.Extreme weather events made more frequent by rising temperatures will see "multi-breadbasket failures" hit food production ever more regularly, the report predicts.As climate change reduces yields, and demand for biofuel crops and CO2-absorbing forests grows, food prices are projected to rise as much as a third at 2050, bringing an additional 183 million people in low-income households to the edge of chronic hunger.Across Asia and Africa, 10 million more children than now will suffer from malnutrition and stunting by mid-century, saddling a new generation with life-long health problems -- despite greater socioeconomic development.As with most climate impacts, the effects on human health will not be felt equally: the draft suggests that 80 percent of the population at risk of hunger live in Africa and Southeast Asia."There are hotspots emerging," Elizabeth Robinson, professor of environmental economics at the University of Reading, told AFP."If you overlay where people are already hungry with where crops are going to be most harmed by climate you see that it's the same places that are already suffering from high malnutrition."- Water crisis looming -It doesn't end there.The report outlines in the starkest terms so far the fate potentially awaiting millions whose access to safe water will be thrown into turmoil by climate change.Just over half the world's population is already water insecure, and climate impacts will undoubtedly make that worse.Research looking at water supply, agriculture and rising sea levels shows that between 30 million and 140 million people will likely be internally displaced in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America by 2050, the report says.Up to three quarters of heavily tapped groundwater supply -- the main source of potable water for 2.5 billion people -- could also be disrupted by mid-century.The rapid melting of mountain glaciers has already "strongly affected the water cycle", an essential source for two billion people that could "create or exacerbate tensions over water resources", according to the report.And while the economic cost of climate's effect on water supply varies geographically, it is expected to shave half a percent off global GDP by 2050."Water is one of the issues that our generation is going to confront very soon," said Neira."There will be massive displacement, massive migration, and we need to treat all of that as a global issue."- 'Fault lines' -As the warming planet expands habitable zones for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying species, the draft warns that half the world's population could be exposed to vector-borne pathogens such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus by mid-century.Risks posed by malaria and Lyme disease are set to rise, and child deaths from diarrhoea are on track to increase until at least mid-century, despite greater socioeconomic development in high-incidence countries.The report also shows how climate change will increase the burden of non-communicable illnesses.Diseases associated with poor air quality and exposure to ozone, such as lung and heart conditions, will "rise substantially", it says."There will also be increased risks of food and water-related contamination" by marine toxins, it adds.As with most climate-related impacts, these diseases will ravage the world's most vulnerable.The Covid-19 pandemic has already exposed that reality.The report shows how the pandemic, while boosting international cooperation, has revealed many nations' vulnerability to future shocks, including those made inevitable by climate change."Covid has made the fault lines in our health systems extremely visible," said Stefanie Tye, research associate at the World Resources Institute's Climate Resilience Practice, who was not involved in the IPCC report."The effects and shocks of climate change will strain health systems even more, for a much longer period, and in ways that we are still trying to fully grasp."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunger-drought-disease-un-climate-report-reveals-dire-health-threats-101624410392258.html
23-06-2021||World||Concerns raised about China at UN||More than 40 countries led by Canada voiced grave concerns at the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday about China’s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet - triggering a fierce backlash from Beijing.The widely anticipated joint statement had been in the pipeline for several days and was delivered on day two of the 47th session of the council in Geneva.“We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region,” Canada’s ambassador Leslie Norton said.The statement was backed by Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and the US, among others. Beijing must allow UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet and other independent observers “immediate, meaningful and unfettered access” to Xinjiang, and end the “arbitrary detention” of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, it said.“Credible reports indicate that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang and that there is widespread surveillance disproportionately targeting Uighurs and members of other minorities and restrictions on fundamental freedoms and Uighur culture,” it said.The statement cited reports of torture or cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment, forced sterilisation, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced separation of children from their parents. China denies mistreating the Uighurs and insists it is simply running vocational training centres designed to counter extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerns-raised-about-china-at-un-101624410111587.html
23-06-2021||World||Nations relying on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines now see spike in cases: Report||Countries like Mongolia, Seychelles and Bahrain relied on Covid-19 vaccines made by China to combat the coronavirus pandemic, but are now battling a surge in infections, according to a report in New York Times (NYT).Examples from several countries suggest that the Chinese vaccines may not be very effective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, particularly the new variants, the NYT report said.In Seychelles, Chile, Bahrain and Mongolia, about 50 to 68% of the populations have been fully inoculated with Chinese vaccines, outpacing the United States, according to Our World in Data, quoted by the NYT. However, they are also among the top 10 countries with the worst Covid-19 outbreaks."If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern. The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this," Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, told the leading US daily.Seychelles, which relied mostly on Sinopharm, reported more than 716 Covid-19 cases per million. Mongolia, relying on Chinese aid, quickly rolled out an inoculation program and eased restrictions, vaccinating 52 per cent of its population. However, it recorded 2,400 new infections on Sunday, a quadrupling from a month before.Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first two countries to approve the Sinopharm shot, even before late-stage clinical trial data was released. Since then, there have been extensive reports of vaccinated people falling ill in both countries, NYT reported.In a statement, however, China's foreign ministry said it did not see a link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines. It cited the World Health Organization (WHO) as saying that vaccination rates in certain countries had not reached sufficient levels to prevent outbreaks, and that countries needed to continue to maintain controls, according to NYT."Relevant reports and data also show that many countries that use Chinese-made vaccines have expressed that they are safe and reliable, and have played a good role in their epidemic prevention efforts," the ministry said.While the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of more than 90%, China's Sinopharm vaccine has an efficacy rate of 78.% and the Sinovac vaccine has an efficacy rate of 51%.Despite the spike in Covid-19 cases, officials in both the Seychelles and Mongolia have defended Sinopharm, saying it is effective in preventing severe cases of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-relying-on-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-now-see-spike-in-cases-report-101624408699575.html
23-06-2021||World||EU launches antitrust probe against Google||The EU launched a wide-ranging antitrust probe against internet giant Google on Tuesday over concerns that it is using its technology to keep out rivals in the lucrative online advertising market.The case opens yet another front by the European Commission against the search engine giant, which has already received eight billion euros ($9 billion) in fines for its anti-competitive practices.The investigation will “assess whether Google has violated EU competition rules by favouring its own online display advertising technology services”, a statement from the EU executive said.The probe narrows in on an important component of Google’s profit-making machine: more than 80% of the giant’s revenue in 2020 came from advertising, or $147 billion.“We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete” in display ad technology, said EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager.At issue is Google’s largely unnoticed, but highly dominant technologies that serve as an intermediary or broker between advertisers and publishers online.Google owned technologies include services such as AdX, Doubleclick or AdSense that power much of the EU’s display advertising market for web pages and apps, which the commission estimated to be worth about 20 billion euros in 2019.The business was at the heart of a recent case in France - brought by News Corp, French daily Le Figaro and Belgium’s Groupe Rossel - that saw Google fined 220 million euros ($267 million).It is also central to blockbuster cases in the US where state prosecutors accuse the company of rigging the ad-tech market and snuffing out rivals.As in the other cases, the EU will try to determine whether Google gave preferential treatment to its own ad inventory technologies AdX and Doubleclick, but will also look at other aspects of the ad-tech business.Crucially, the probe will also look into Google’s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party “cookies” on its Chrome browser, a move that has angered some publishers and advertisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-against-google-101624408135081.html

In proportion to its population, Colombia is reporting the fourth worst death toll in Latin America and Caribbean, and the sixth for the number of cases.US set to miss July 4 goalThe administration of US President Joe Biden on Tuesday conceded it won’t meet its goal of administering one or more doses of a Covid vaccine to 70% of American adults by July 4. “We think it’ll take a few extra weeks to get to 70% of all adults with at least one shot,” said Jeffrey Zients, head of the White House Covid response team.North Korea has told the WHO that it has tested more than 30,000 people for the coronavirus through June 10, but has yet to find a single infection. Health experts doubt North Korea’s claim that it has not had a single case of the coronavirus.Abu Dhabi has reportedly started offering free coronavirus vaccines to tourists flying into the emirate, a move that could help revive the UAE’s struggling tourism industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorest-countries-out-of-jabs-who-101624407883913.html
23-06-2021||World||China’s bid to join trade pact raises alarms, says US lawmaker||China’s efforts to join a regional trade deal that originally aimed to exclude Beijing “should set off alarm bells” in Washington, where a growing number of lawmakers are calling for the U.S. to re-assert its influence in Asia, according to a key U.S. senator overseeing trade.“If you aren’t at the table, you may well end up on the menu,” Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who chairs the Senate finance subcommittee on international trade, told a hearing on Asia-Pacific trade policy Tuesday. “We need to take China’s interest seriously and begin the hard work of developing a comprehensive policy toward re-engagement with our allies in this part of the world.”The U.S. had originally envisioned the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership as an economic bloc to balance China’s growing power, with then-President Barack Obama saying in 2016 that Washington, not China, should write the regional rules of trade. His successor Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2017, describing it as a “potential disaster” for the U.S., and Japan led the revised and renamed pact to a conclusion the following year.Bloomberg News reported last month that officials from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and possibly other nations have held technical talks with Chinese counterparts on details of the CPTPP. China announced in February it had held informal talks with some of the members, but didn’t release details.Carper and John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is the committee’s ranking member, in May wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai asking her to provide direction on engaging with allies in the Asia-Pacific region -- and calling Trump’s decision to withdraw from the trade pact a “missed opportunity” to strengthen U.S. leadership there.“Our national security must come first,” Cornyn said at the hearing. “We have to identify smart, democratic measures that take into account the unfair trade practices, the human-rights and censorship abuses deployed by our adversaries, while making targeted investments in trade relations with our allies that abide by rules-based international trading system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-bid-to-join-trade-pact-raises-alarms-says-us-lawmaker-101624404619325.html
23-06-2021||World||US likely to miss July 4 Covid-19 vaccination target||The White House on Tuesday acknowledged that President Joe Biden's administration is likely to fall short of his stated goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of American adults with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine by July 4."We set 70 per cent of adults as our aspirational target. We have met or exceeded it for most of our population. This is a remarkable achievement... Today, nearly 80 per cent of people 65 and older are fully vaccinated... For Americans who are 40 years old and over, 75 per cent have received at least one shot. For Americans 30 and older, we have met the President's goal of one shot. That's right, we have met the President's 70 per cent goal of all Americans 30 and over," he said.Zients added that the nation has much to do in the age group of 18-26 as they have been less eager in receiving the jab. "However, with the Delta variant now spreading across the country and infecting younger people worldwide, it's is more important than ever that they get vaccinated," he added.The White House Covid-19 response coordinator further said that it will take "a few extra weeks" to get 70 percent of all adults 18 and over with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, adding that the administration would meet Biden's second July 4 goal of getting 160 million Americans fully vaccinated "no later than mid-July."According to The Hill, Biden has received much more positive ratings for his coronavirus response than his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. He had announced last week that 300 million coronavirus vaccine shots had been administered in his first 150 days.Meanwhile, the White House is planning a large outdoor gathering on July 4 for military members, first responders and essential workers that will mark the progress against the deadly pandemic."The virus is in retreat in communities across the country. We are entering a summer of joy, a summer of freedom. This is cause for celebration and that's exactly what Americans will be able to do on July 4. Celebrate independence from the virus," said Zients during the briefing.According to the Covid response coordinator, 16 states and Washington have already met Biden's target for adults 18 and above, but some red states have lagged behind in vaccination rates.On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that vaccine rates for younger Americans have not reached those for older adults. All adults age 18 and up became eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines in mid-April, The Hill reported.The new Delta variant has also added urgency to the White House's efforts to get more Americans vaccinated."It's a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people. But the good news is, we have the solution. The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated," Biden said in remarks from the White House last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-likely-to-miss-july-4-covid-19-vaccination-target-101624404631218.html
23-06-2021||World||Nearly 900 Secret Service employees caught Covid-19: Officials||Roughly 900 US Secret Service employees tested positive for the coronavirus, according to government records obtained by a government watchdog group.Secret Service records show that 881 people on the agency payroll were diagnosed with Covid-19 between March 1, 2020 and March 9, 2021, according to documents obtained by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. More than 11% of Secret Service employees were infected.Secret Service spokesperson Justine Whelan said Covid-19 testing of employees was pro-active with more than 25,000 tests being administered."The Secret Service’s essential law enforcement mission required agency employees to remain in continuous contact with the public during the pandemic," Whelan said. “Now and throughout the pandemic, the Secret Service was fully prepared and staffed to successfully meet these challenges.”The records received through a Freedom of Information Act request did not include the names or assignments of those who tested positive. But more than half — 477 — worked in the special agent division, which is responsible for protecting the president and vice president, as well as the families of these leaders and other government officials.CREW noted that the Trump administration took actions that risked exposure to Secret Service workers, but it could not verify a direct connection to possible infections because the identities of those infected remains private.After President Donald Trump contracted Covid-19, he took a drive in his presidential vehicle as Secret Service personnel drove and protected him. The former president also held multiple large rallies and events, including the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, despite restrictions on public gatherings.The Secret Service employs approximately 3,200 special agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division officers, and more than 2,000 other technical, professional and administrative support personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-900-secret-service-employees-caught-covid19-101624392775766.html
23-06-2021||World||American Airlines cut hundreds of flights as summer season starts||American Airlines will cut hundreds of flights over the next three weeks to avoid overloading its operation as demand for summer air travel rises faster than once expected.Spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said Tuesday that the cuts could average 50 to 60 flights a day the rest of June and between 50 and 80 a day in the first half of July. That is potentially more than 1% of its schedule.On Tuesday, the airline had scrubbed 130 flights and more than 200 others were delayed by afternoon Central time, according to tracking service FlightAware.Jantz said the cuts are “building in additional resilience and certainty to our operation.” She said American is making the most cuts on routes where it has multiple flights to provide backup options for rebooking passengers on other planes.Leisure travel is picking up as more Americans get vaccinated against Covid-19 and states continue to ease travel restrictions. More than 2 million travelers passed through airport security checkpoints Sunday and again Monday, with Sunday’s crowds marking the highest number in 15 months, although still below 2019 levels.American and other US airlines have been barred from furloughing workers during the pandemic as a condition of billions they received in federal aid to help cover payrolls. However, American encouraged thousands of workers to quit or retire and now finds itself with a smaller staff as travel demand approaches pre-pandemic levels.Jantz said American has employees on reserve, but bad weather at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina can cause crews to exceed federal limits on how long they can work. She said the airline is also affected by labor shortages at vendors that provide catering drivers and people who push wheelchairs.The cutbacks come after American moved aggressively to restore service that was cut during the pandemic. American had scheduled around 5,800 flights a day through July, about 87% of its schedule for the same period in 2019, according to data from aviation researcher Cirium.The airline industry’s difficulties this month haven’t been limited to American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas. Last week, technology problems caused Dallas-based Southwest Airlines to delay several thousand flights and cancel hundreds more. More than 400 Southwest flights were running behind on Tuesday, according to FlightAware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-cut-hundreds-of-flights-as-summer-season-starts-101624392677698.html
23-06-2021||World||Nursing home deaths up 32% in 2020 amid pandemic: Watchdog||Deaths among Medicare patients in nursing homes soared by 32% last year, with two devastating spikes eight months apart, a government watchdog reported Tuesday in the most comprehensive look yet at the ravages of Covid-19 among its most vulnerable victims.The report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that about 4 in 10 Medicare recipients in nursing homes had or likely had Covid-19 in 2020, and that deaths overall jumped by 169,291 from the previous year, before the coronavirus appeared.“We knew this was going to be bad, but I don't think even those of us who work in this area thought it was going to be this bad,” said Harvard health policy professor David Grabowski, a nationally recognized expert on long-term care, who reviewed the report for The Associated Press.“This was not individuals who were going to die anyway,” Grabowski added. “We are talking about a really big number of excess deaths.”Investigators used a generally accepted method of estimating “excess” deaths in a group of people after a calamitous event. It did not involve examining individual death certificates of Medicare patients but comparing overall deaths among those in nursing homes to levels recorded the previous year. The technique was used to estimate deaths in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and in New York City after the first coronavirus surge last spring. It does not attribute a cause of death but is seen as a barometer of impact.Death rates were higher in every month last year when compared with 2019. The report documented two spikes with particular implications for government policy and for protecting the most vulnerable in future outbreaks of life-threatening illnesses. In April of last year, a total of 81,484 Medicare patients in nursing homes died. Then eight months later, after lockdowns and frantic efforts to expand testing — but before vaccines became widely available — nursing home patients accounted for a staggering 74,299 deaths in December.“This is happening long after it was clear that nursing homes were particularly vulnerable,” said Nancy Harrison, a deputy regional inspector general who worked on the report. “We really have to look at that. Why did they remain so vulnerable?” Federal investigators are still drilling down to try to document the chain of causes and effects.Responding to the report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that nearly 80% of nursing home residents and more than 55% of staff are now vaccinated, and the agency is working to protect health and safety. CMS sets standards for nursing homes.The two main nursing industry groups, the American Health Care Association and LeadingAge, said the grim statistics reflect the consequences of society and government not placing a high enough priority on the needs of frail elders. That “showed once again how ageism can result in policies that treat older people as expendable,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit homes.Tuesday's report was the most comprehensive yet from the government because it included statistics for the early part of last year, during the initial coronavirus surge. Medicare did not require nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases and deaths occurring before May 8, more than four months into the pandemic year.In another new finding, the report showed that cases and deaths among Asian American patients tracked with the more severe impacts seen among Blacks and Latinos. Indeed, Asian Medicare enrollees in nursing homes saw the highest increase in death rates, with 27% dying in 2020 compared to 17% the previous year. For whites, the death rate grew to 24% in 2020 from 18% in 2019, a significant increase but not as pronounced.Death rates for Hispanic and Black patients were 23% last year, up from 15% in 2019.The inspector general's office based its analysis on Medicare billing data. It also included patients in Medicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers. Although Medicare does not cover long-term care, the vast majority of nursing home patients are elderly, and Medicare does cover their medical needs. The report included both patients who live in nursing homes as well as those temporarily at a facility for rehabilitation.Health economist Tamara Konetzka of the University of Chicago, who also reviewed the report for AP, said building an estimate from individual death certificates would have faced another set of challenges. Especially in the first wave of the pandemic, many who died would not necessarily have been tested for Covid-19, for example.“By looking at excess deaths you can get away from some of the measurement issues and say how much worse things were in 2020 than in 2019,” explained Konetzka, who has testified before Congress on the impact of Covid-19 in nursing homes.The inspector general's findings about Asians highlight a riddle for researchers, said Konetzka. The reasons for higher cases and deaths among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians may not necessarily be tied to race and ethnicity. Instead, minority patients may be clustered in homes located in communities with more severe outbreaks.The report also found that low-income nursing home patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid together were much more likely to have gotten Covid-19. The infection rate for that group reached 56%, and 26% died.Some states suffered worse impacts. By the end of December more than half of the Medicare patients in nursing homes in Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana and New Jersey had or likely had COVID-19.Although nursing homes locked down in March of last year, government efforts to help were haphazard. The industry complained of chronic shortages of protective gear, including basics like masks and gowns.The Trump administration initially delegated responsibility for testing to states before belatedly marshaling more federal resources. HHS later laid the groundwork for vaccinations under the Trump administration, and the Biden administration followed through. As vaccination rates rose, nursing home cases plummeted, allowing facilities to again permit family visits.The country can't move on yet, said deputy inspector general Harrison. “Hopefully, Covid-19 will go away,” she said. “But once that happens, there will always be infectious diseases, and we all need to ask ourselves what we can do to protect vulnerable nursing home residents going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nursing-home-deaths-up-32-in-2020-amid-pandemic-watchdog-101624392148740.html
23-06-2021||World||UK, EU close to truce in Brexit trade dispute: Official||British and European officials are increasingly optimistic they will avert a post-Brexit trade war, believing the two sides will strike a truce in the dispute over checks on goods moving into Northern Ireland.The British government has asked the European Union to extend the grace period before a ban comes into force on the sale of chilled meats and fresh sausages into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.No deal has been done yet and European officials wants to hear how the British government will use any extension to the June 30 deadline, with EU diplomats due to discuss next steps at a meeting Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.The issue of trade rules for Northern Ireland sparked heated clashes between the two sides in recent weeks and overshadowed the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, southwest England, this month.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has threatened unilaterally to suspend the rules if the EU refuses to back down, and the EU has warned it will respond with legal action if he does.Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron argued face-to-face about the transport of sausages within France and the UK, and British media have labeled the clash the “sausage wars.”Last week, UK minister David Frost said the government was becoming increasingly concerned that the dispute could undermine fragile political stability in Northern Ireland at a highly sensitive time.In recent days, the EU has been reviewing the UK’s formal written request for an extension to the grace period. Officials on both sides now believe it’s likely that an extension to the current grace period will be granted.The UK has opted not to introduce some checks on goods crossing into Northern Ireland, saying the EU’s strict approach to enforcing the rules is hurting local communities. The EU, which is Britain’s largest trading partner, says the UK is failing to implement the terms of the Brexit deal Johnson signed less than two years ago.Under the terms of the Brexit accord, Northern Ireland -- unlike the rest of the UK -- remained under the EU’s customs and single market rules to avoid creating a visible border with the Irish Republic, a move that would risk reviving sectarian conflicts.The EU wants a permanent settlement and is keen to avoid rolling grace periods becoming the norm. European officials say grace periods were designed to allow time for businesses and authorities to come into compliance with the Northern Ireland protocol, which was part of the UK’s separation agreement with the bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-close-to-truce-in-brexit-trade-dispute-official-101624392137761.html
23-06-2021||World||Joe Biden says will 'bring every resource' to manage busy storm season||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration needs to “bring every resource to bear" to deal with natural disasters as huge swaths of the country have already endured extreme weather with the summer season just starting.The president said he plans to meet next week with western governors to discuss preparation for heat, drought and wildfires.“I insist on being ready for whatever comes our way," Biden told reporters ahead of an emergency preparedness briefing from Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the White House homeland security adviserThe White House was spotlighting preparedness as the Western US has experienced extreme heat and wildfires and the Atlantic Ocean has already seen three named storms, including Tropical Storm Claudette. The storm killed at least 14 people in Alabama.A tornado swept through communities in heavily populated suburban Chicago late Sunday, damaging more than 100 homes, toppling trees, knocking out power and causing multiple injuries.Biden announced in May that he’s doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change.The $1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the weather-related disasters cost the US. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.This year has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states, and officials expect that an ongoing severe drought in the West will fuel another destructive summer of wildfires following one of the worst fire years on record in 2020.Forecasters predict a busy hurricane season along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, but perhaps not as severe as 2020’s record-shattering year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-will-bring-every-resource-to-manage-busy-storm-season-101624391913845.html
23-06-2021||World||Microsoft joins Apple in exclusive $2 trillion club||Microsoft Corp. took its place in the history books as just the second US public company to reach a $2 trillion market value, buoyed by bets its dominance in cloud computing and enterprise software will expand further in a post-coronavirus world.Its shares rose as much as 1.1% to $265.64 on Tuesday in New York, enough for the software company to join Apple Inc. as one of only two companies trading at such a lofty value. Saudi Aramco eclipsed that threshold briefly in December 2019, but currently has a market value of about $1.9 trillion.Since taking the reins in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has reshaped the Redmond, Washington-based company into the largest seller of cloud-computing software, counting both its infrastructure and Office application cloud units. Microsoft is also the only one of the biggest U.S. technology companies that has so far evaded the recent wave of scrutiny from increasingly active American antitrust regulators, giving it a freer hand in both acquisitions and product expansion.Microsoft has gained 19% so far this year, outperforming Apple and Amazon.com Inc., as investors piled into the stock on expectations of long-term growth for both earnings and revenue, and expansion in areas like machine learning and cloud computing. The company’s third-quarter results, released in late April, topped expectations and demonstrated strong growth across its business segments.The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index outperformed the S&P 500 Index on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that inflation will be short lived. Both benchmarks rose to session highs after Powell’s comments with the Nasdaq 100 up 1.1% and the S&P 500 up 0.7%.“Microsoft checks all the boxes: it is in the markets that investors favor, it offers strong and sustainable growth, and it remains very well positioned to capitalize on the long-term secular trends we see in technology,” said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. A $2 trillion valuation “is warranted, given how it has pivoted toward the cloud, and it remains attractively valued even given the strong performance.”Co-founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft created the personal-computer software industry and dominated the market for PC operating systems and Office software for years. As internet browsers like Netscape grew in importance in the 1990s, Microsoft raced to introduce its own product that it bundled with Windows software. That led to a bruising antitrust lawsuit, filed in 1998 by the US government, with a federal judge finding the company guilty in 2000.Though Microsoft avoided a breakup of its business, the penalty the government originally sought in the antitrust case, the next decade saw the software maker largely miss the advent of mobile software, social media and internet search, falling behind newer rivals such as Google and nimbler ones like Apple. With a series of strategic shifts, in the past seven years Nadella has restored Microsoft to the vanguard of technology with a focus on cloud, mobile computing and artificial intelligence.While it took Microsoft 33 years from its IPO to reach its first $1 trillion in value in 2019, the next trillion only took about two years amid a surge in popularity in tech stocks before the Covid-19 pandemic and during the health crisis. Apple made Wall Street history when it reached $2 trillion last year.Among US names, the pair are trailed by Amazon, which has a market cap of nearly $1.8 trillion, and Alphabet Inc., which is valued around $1.6 trillion.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than 90% of analysts recommend buying Microsoft, while none has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. The average price target points to upside of about 11% from current levels.Growth DriversMicrosoft’s cloud-computing business has been a central force behind the advance. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the Intelligent Cloud business accounted for 33.8% of Microsoft’s 2020 revenue, making it the largest of the three major segments for the first time, and up from 31% in 2019. The division showed revenue growth of 24% last year, compared with the 13% growth in Productivity and Business Processes, and the 6% growth of Microsoft’s More Personal Computing unit.Nadella’s strategic moves had put Microsoft in a position to benefit from business trends that arose during the global pandemic. Lockdowns and remote work accelerated a shift to the company’s meeting software and pushed clients to speed up modernizations of software networks and applications around the cloud. The software maker’s Xbox gaming subscriptions also lured users looking for diversion during months stuck at home.As workers return to the office, Microsoft has tried to push new ideas for managing meetings where some attendees are in person and some remote, and has been hawking features to boost wellness and productivity for workers that the company says are burned out by the tribulations of the past year.“At a high level, the two core pillars of Microsoft’s bull narrative — Microsoft 365 and Azure — are well understood by the investment community,” William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in May. “What is perhaps less appreciated is how over the last 15 years Microsoft has expanded its IT wallet share through expanding into new product areas” and taking market share. The wallet share doubled from 2006 to 2020, and “we believe it can double again over the next decade,” it wrote.Wall Street is also positive on the company’s M&A strategy. It recently announced that it is buying speech-recognition pioneer Nuance Communications Inc. The company also tried to acquire Discord Inc. for $12 billion, but the video-game chat company rejected Microsoft’s offer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-joins-apple-in-exclusive-2-trillion-club-101624391043393.html

23-06-2021||World||Covid-19 Delta variant gains steam in undervaccinated US counties||Early evidence suggests that the highly contagious delta variant, which has prompted concern worldwide as it leads to new surges of Covid-19 across the globe, is spreading in undervaccinated pockets of the US.The genomics firm Helix analyzed about 20,000 samples from Covid-19 tests across more than 700 US counties. It found that cases of the variant first documented in India appear to be growing far faster in counties with lower vaccination rates than in areas that have higher rates.The ongoing spread of the variant in pockets of low vaccine uptake are troubling because they create more opportunities for the virus to thrive and mutate. The longer the virus spreads, the more chances it has to create easier inroads into human cells, and potentially take on deadlier forms.“Delta is driving surges around the world, and I suspect it’s going to be the same here,” said William Lee, the vice president of science at Helix. Delta is growing more than twice as fast as gamma, the variant first seen in Brazil, in undervaccinated communities.Meanwhile, the gamma variant, which appears better at evading vaccines, was found to be more prevalent in counties with higher inoculation rates. The Helix research, which hasn’t yet been subject to peer review, is to be published in an upcoming pre-print online.So far, more than 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a recent Bloomberg News analysis found that broad, national numbers often obscure more troubling patterns at the local level.Less than 25% of the population is fully vaccinated in at least 482 counties, Bloomberg found in an analysis of 2,700 US counties.Helix, which has been working to track the spread of variants through its Covid-testing program, looked at samples collected through its testing program prior to mid-June that it then sequenced. It then compared the county of residency of the patient against the CDC’s county-level vaccination data, dividing its samples into two roughly equal groups based on the vaccination rates of the counties they are from.In one group, the number of fully vaccinated people in the county was above 28.5%, in the other it was below. By doing that, the company found that delta cases was rising faster among people who live in counties with lower vaccination rates.The alpha variant, first found in the U.K., has been the dominant strain in the US But the “gamma and delta have gained a strong foothold and may soon push alpha out,” Helix’s Lee said.Younger AmericansIn a new report issued by the CDC on Monday, the agency found that among those 18 to 39 years old, vaccine safety and effectiveness were both commonly cited barriers to vaccination.The agency said it is especially important to reduce hesitancy among younger Americans, who have been among the demographic groups least likely to take the vaccine. Polling has also suggested that there is significant hesitancy among rural populations, Republican voters and people of color.Polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that there are still a large number of holdouts in the US, with about 13% of Americans planning to avoid the vaccine no matter what, another 12% saying they are waiting before making a decision, and 7% saying they’ll get vaccinated only if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-gains-steam-in-undervaccinated-us-counties-101624389096097.html
23-06-2021||World||India calls for UN-led ‘comprehensive and permanent’ ceasefire in Afghanistan||India on Tuesday called for a UN-led “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” in Afghanistan in view of a recent escalation in violence, saying peace talks have not delivered the desired result and the country has witnessed targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, women, journalists and civil rights activists.“It is therefore crucial that the international community and, in particular, this council presses for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian lives,” India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar said during a UN Security Council debate on the situation in Afghanistan.“We support a leading role for the United Nations, since that would help improve the odds for a lasting and durable outcome,” he said.The minister reiterated India’s calls for immediate dismantling of terrorist safe havens and disruption of terrorist supply chains. “There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its cross-border one,” Jaishankar said.The UN secretary general’s report on the situation in Afghanistan submitted last week noted that “security incidents remained at high levels, with the number of civilian casualties increasing by 29% in the first quarter of 2021 in comparison with the same period in 2020”. The report said that though Afghanistan has continued to try to “foster unity around the peace process”, efforts to reinvigorate the negotiations have slowed following the postponement of talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul because the Taliban want to wait until US and Nato troops have left the country.Foreign troops are in the process of exiting Afghanistan with a deadline of September 11 announced by US President Joe Biden for complete withdrawal. Biden is scheduled to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, who leads the High Council for National Reconciliation, at the White House on Friday amid growing concern about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan.“As we’ve said from the very beginning, while there is a schedule, we are mindful that that schedule could fluctuate and change as… conditions changed too,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Monday in response to a question about the Taliban’s advances in Afghanistan. He added, “It is a dynamic situation and we said from the outset that we’re going to treat it as such… if there need to be changes made to the pace or to the scope and scale of the retrograde on any given day or in any given week, we want to maintain the flexibility to do that.”As a key stakeholder in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, India has been concerned about the post-withdrawal situation and has called for urgent efforts to ensure that the gains made over two decades of the presence of foreign troops are not squandered.Reiterating India’s longstanding support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process, Jaishankar said, “If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, eschew the path to find a military solution, and fully commit towards reaching a political solution. A tangible demonstration of this commitment is required.”The minister recalled the development work done by India in Afghanistan since 2001 - more than 550 community development projects; a recent MoU to build the Shatoot dam; operationalisation of the Chabahar Port in Iran; and humanitarian assistance of 75,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan via that port.Also, India sent across Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan, bilaterally as well as through the Covax global distribution facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-un-led-comprehensive-and-permanent-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-101624387903610.html
23-06-2021||World||Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine effective against Delta variant found in India||AstraZeneca Plc's Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the highly transmissible Delta Covid-19 variant, first identified in India, an official from the company said on Tuesday. The drug's efficacy against Kappa, another variant found in India, has also been proven, the official said. A study by Oxford University investigated the ability of monoclonal antibodies in Sera from recovered people and from vaccinated people to neutralize the Delta and Kappa variants, a statement from the company said.Drugmakers across the world are rushing to test the efficacy of drugs against the emerging variants of Covid-19 which are proving to be deadlier than the first strain of virus found to have infected humans. An analysis by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta variant.The latest Oxford study results are built on the recent analysis by PHE, the company said.The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said on Friday.A World Health Organization epidemiologist on Monday pointed out how Covid-19 vaccines are showing signs of reduced efficacy against the Delta variant of coronavirus variant. However, the vaccines are still found to be effective at preventing severe illness and death.The WHO official added that in the future, there might be a "constellation of mutations" which means vaccines are likely to lose their potency against fighting the coronavirus.The Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and considered one of the drivers of the second wave in the country and also in several others including the UK.The highly transmissible variant of the virus is listed as the fourth variant of concern by the WHO. The variant, as latest as Monday, poses a threat to the United Kingdom where the daily cases have shot up to more than 10,000 again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-effective-against-delta-variant-found-in-india-101624387169002.html
23-06-2021||World||70% Americans above 30 years partially vaccinated: White House||In sync with United States President Joe Biden's vaccination goal for the nation, more than 70% of Americans above the age of 30 have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the White House said on Tuesday. This milestone comes close on the heels of the US falling short of reaching the July 4-goal of vaccinating all American adults by Independence Day.The US administration under Biden is now eyeing to vaccinate 70% of Americans above 27 with at least one dose by July 4. In a revamped strategy, the White House will now focus on vaccinating younger Americans in 18-26 age group, who have proved to be least likely to get a vaccine when it's available for them.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday pointed towards the reluctance among younger American adults for getting vaccine doses, as they are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults. This is likely to hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.About 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But US demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.Biden's vaccination goal, the White House said, is less important than the pace of the nation's reopening. The US is exceeding by its own internal projections as the major push to vaccinate every citizen which is visible in the overwhelming majority of the nation's most vulnerable people who are fully vaccinated. In another marker, fresh infections and deaths in the US are at their lowest rates since the earliest days of the pandemic.However, the nationwide rate of new vaccinations has dropped off precipitously over the past month even as shots have become more available, with fewer than 300,000 Americans now getting their first dose per day on average.A report from US CDC, Americans at the highest risk for complications from Covid-19 are overwhelmingly vaccinated. Only 53% aged 25-39 have received one dose. Among those 18-24, it's 47%.“What we’ve seen, as we’ve dug into the data, is that there is a big gap between individuals 25 and over, and 18 to 25,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. “That means that’s an area we need to continue to work on."Vaccine hesitancy is a global problem nations have encountered but the health experts and scientists have underlined how crucial vaccines are in the race against time with mutating viruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-americans-of-above-30-partially-vaccinated-white-house-101624375692317.html
