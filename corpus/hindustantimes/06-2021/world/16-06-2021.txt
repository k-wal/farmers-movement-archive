Prime minister Johnson's Downing Street office said it would not engage with every allegation made by Dominic Cummings, who left the office late last year.In a blog posting, Cummings intensified his criticism of Johnson and health minister Matt Hancock over their handling of the pandemic, less than a month after accusing the government of being responsible for thousands of avoidable Covid-19 deaths.Despite questioning Johnson's fitness for his role as prime minister and castigating the government's fight against Covid-19, Cummings' criticism has yet to seriously puncture the British leader's ratings in opinion polls.In his posting on Wednesday, Cummings posted screenshots of the conversations, which he said were with the prime minister, in which Johnson responded to Cummings' complaints about the slow progress of Hancock's efforts with the words "Totally (blanked expletive) hopeless".Cummings said people should ask Johnson why he had kept Hancock in his position if he thought so little of him.Johnson's spokesman said he had not asked the prime minister directly about the new allegations, and declined to comment on the authenticity of the exchange."I don't plan to engage with every allegation made. The prime minister has set out that we will hold a public inquiry next year, the health secretary has given hours of evidence to the parliamentary committee and I have taken a number of questions on this issue previously," he told reporters."Our focus is on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the road map, distributing vaccines and delivering on the public's priorities."'CRACKERS'The deputy leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Angela Rayner, said the "questions raised today go to the heart of the prime minister’s direct and personal responsibility for the UK’s shocking death toll".In seven hours of questioning by a parliamentary committee last month, Cummings had said it was "crackers" that Johnson was prime minister and aired particular disdain for Hancock, accusing him of repeatedly lying in government meetings.Hancock rejected the allegations and some in the Conservative Party say that Cummings has an axe to grind after being forced from his post.But in his latest blog, Cummings goes into how he remembers day-to-day decisions and underlines his criticism of the prime minister, who he accused of taking things offline "as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' ... before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room".He again said Johnson wanted to leave office, saying he "had a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election".Johnson's spokesman quoted the prime minister's words when similar allegations were raised, calling them "utter nonsense".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/totally-hopeless-boris-johnson-lambasted-his-health-minister-ex-adviser-says-101623858667534.html

Biden was addressing a press conference after the high-stake historic meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. Biden says he told Putin he will always raise issues of 'fundamental human rights,' including Navalny, jailed Americans.Pressing hard on human rights and making it a key highlight of his address, Biden said "human rights is always going to be on the table"."How could I be the president of the United States and not speak out about human rights? It's not just about going after Russia, but it about who we are," Biden said. On being asked about what happens if opposition leader and critic of Russian government Alexei Navalny dies, Biden warned of devastating consequences. Biden said there is no substitute for face-to-face meeting between two leaders. Biden underlined the discussions during his first summit with Putin as "positive", but warned his Russian counterpart that Washington would not tolerate interference in US democracy."The tone of the entire meeting... was good, positive," Biden told reporters after the summit in Geneva, stressing though that he "made it clear that we will not tolerate attempts to violate our democratic sovereignty or destabilise our democratic elections and we would respond."On the other hand, Putin countered the conversation and defended Navalny's prison sentence. Deflecting repeated questions about mistreatment of Russian opposition leaders, Putin highlighted the domestic turmoil in the US, including the Black Lives Matter protests and the January 6 Capitol insurrection.Marking a key development, the Russian President Putin, who addressed the reporters first among the two leaders said he and US President have agreed in a “constructive” summit to return ambassadors to their posts, lowering tensions and beginning consultations to replace the last remaining treaty between the two countries limiting nuclear weapons.Putin said there was “no hostility” during the talks that wrapped up more quickly than expected.Stretching for a little over three hours with just one break in between, the summit saw the two global leaders agreeing in principle to begin consultations on cybersecurity issues, even though Putin continued to deny US allegations that the Russian government was responsible for a spate of recent high-profile hacks against business and government agencies in the United States and around the globe.The two sides had said they expected to meet for four to five hours but spent less than three hours together, including an opening meeting with just the two presidents and each one's top foreign aide.Biden and Putin plunged into the face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders say relations between their countries are at a low point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-no-agenda-against-russia-but-for-america-after-summit-with-putin-101623862585221.html
16-06-2021||World||Putin satisfied with Biden’s ‘killer’ comment explanation; diplomats to return||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that the Kremlin and Washington have agreed to return ambassadors to each other's capitals after they were withdrawn earlier this year. Speaking at a news conference after meeting with US President Joe Biden in Geneva, Putin said the ambassadors will return to their posts and take up their functions, adding that the question of when the diplomats would return to their post is a “purely technical one.”US-Russia relations have deteriorated for years, and the strained bilateral ties further soured when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer". Biden’s remark prompted Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The United States recalled its ambassador in April. Putin also said that he was satisfied with Biden’s explanation over “killer” comments.Also Read | Chaos at Biden-Putin summit as US, Russian reporters yell, shove to enter roomBiden and Putin met at a stately 18th-century mansion in Geneva for a high-stakes summit amid heightened tension between the two rival nations. Their official meetings were broken into two rounds and ended earlier than initially predicted by officials. Both sides had played down the prospect of any major breakthroughs at the summit and the two leaders had decided to hold separate press briefings, unlike the last meeting between Putin and former President Donald Trump after their summit in Helsinki.On the question of the recent spate of cyberattack cutting across sectors in the United States, Putin said the two countries are going to begin consultations on cybersecurity. “We believe that cyberspace is extraordinarily important. In general, and in particular for the US, and to the same extent for Russia,” he said. However, Putin claimed that Russia was also a victim of cyberattacks.“We encounter this every year...In the US, I don't think that the US administration is particularly interested in organising that or looking into it. All they do is make insinuations. What we need is expert consultations between us. We agreed to that, in principle, Russia is prepared for that,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-satisfied-with-biden-s-killer-comment-explanation-diplomats-to-return-101623861785854.html

In February, Navalny was given a 2 1/2-year prison term for violating the terms of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivated.Speaking Wednesday after a summit with US President Joe Biden in Geneva, Putin said Navalny received his due punishment for violating the terms of his probation, adding that he was aware that he was facing a prison sentence when he returned to Russia.“He deliberately moved to be arrested,” Putin said, sticking to his habit of not mentioning Navalny by name.Last week, a Moscow court outlawed the organisations founded by Navalny by labeling them extremist, the latest move in a campaign to silence dissent and bar Kremlin critics from running for parliament in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-deserved-prison-sentence-says-putin-101623861027837.html

But during the Covid-19 pandemic it fell into disrepair and collapsed in March.Members of the affected communities, such as the Huinchiri, decided to rebuild the 30-meter (98.43 ft) long bridge in the traditional Incan style: by weaving it.Teams of workers, starting from both sides of the ravine and balancing on giant main ropes that had been stretched over the river, worked towards the center putting in place smaller ropes as barriers between the handrail ropes and the walkway's floor."Last year because of the pandemic, it wasn't strengthened ... That is why at the beginning of this year the bridge fell," said Cusco Regional Governor Jean Paul Benavente."But now it is like an answer to the pandemic itself. From the depths of the Peruvian Andean identity, this bridge is strung up across the Apurimac basin and we can tell the world that we are coming out if this little by little."Also Read | Peru: Artist portrays pain and suffering from Covid-19 pandemic in 100 drawingsIn 2013, Unesco recognized the skills and traditions associated to the reconstruction of the Q'eswachaka bridge as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.Peru is rich in ancient treasure. It has hundreds of sites that date back thousands of years and span dozens of cultures, including the ancient Incan empire that was in power when Spanish explorers arrived in the early 1500s."This is history. More than 500 years of a paradox in time. The Q'eswachaka, this Incan living bridge, is really an expression and cultural manifestation," added Benavente."This is community, in this particular case, the Huinchiri community from the Quehue district is currently working to string up this bridge that connects villages, but that also connects traditions and connects culture."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peruvians-re-weave-500-year-old-incan-string-bridge-frayed-in-pandemic-101623852715412.html

Nasa flight engineer Shane Kimbrough and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet exited the space station and set their spacesuits to battery power at 8:11am ET (5:41pm IST), marking the start of a six and a half hour spacewalk to install the first two of six ISS Roll-Out Solar Arrays (iROSAs).The new solar arrays had arrived at the station in the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft as part of the company’s commercial resupply services mission to the station. Nasa said that though the current solar arrays are functioning well, they have begun to show signs of degradation since they were designed for 15-year service life.The US space agency live-streamed the spacewalk as the astronauts from Nasa and ESA worked to replace the solar arrays. In a 40-second clip shared by Nasa, ESA astronaut Pesquet can be seen using a Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) to break bolts on the carrier housing the new solar arrays, with a breathtaking view of Earth in the background.“Breathtaking views from today's spacewalk as astronauts @Thom_astro and @astro_kimbrough continue their work to install and deploy the first of the new solar arrays,” tweeted International Space Station from its official handle.An amazing view of @Thom_Astro using a Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) to break bolts on the carrier housing the @Space_Station's new solar arrays. @Astro_Kimbrough is at a different worksite routing harnesses for a future task. pic.twitter.com/3iUUbCNqQ2Also Read | Nasa says newly-discovered exoplanet could have water clouds and a ‘tail’The original solar arrays were deployed in December 2000 and have been powering the space station for more than 20 years. The new set of solar arrays will be positioned in front of six of the current arrays to increase the space station’s total available power from 160 kilowatts to a maximum of 215 kilowatts, as per Nasa. The International Space Station completed 20 years of continuous human presence in November 2020.“In that time, 244 people from 19 countries have visited the orbiting laboratory that has hosted nearly 3,000 research investigations from researchers in 108 countries and areas,” Nasa said in a statement.The next spacewalk is scheduled for Sunday, June 20.

16-06-2021||World||In first summit with Biden, Putin sees 'a lot of issues'||With deep disagreements likely and expectations of solving them low, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down in a lakeside Geneva villa on Wednesday for their first summit since Biden took office.Both have said they hope their talks can lead to more stable and predictable relations, even though they are at odds over everything from arms control and cyber-hacking to election interference and Ukraine.Putin and Biden shook hands on arrival before going inside."Mr President, I'd like to thank you for your initiative to meet today," Putin said, sitting next to Biden, adding: "U.S. and Russian relations have a lot of issues accumulated that require the highest level meeting."Biden said they would try to determine areas of cooperation and mutual interest. "It is always better to meet face to face."Aides had earlier downplayed hopes for the summit."We're not expecting a big set of deliverables out of this meeting," a senior U.S. official told reporters, saying the leaders were expected to talk for four or five hours."I'm not sure that any agreements will be reached," said Putin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov.The first round of talks - which included Biden, Putin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - lasted almost two hours, officials said.Talks resumed after a break, with Moscow's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, who was recalled to Russia in March, among those present.Relations between Moscow and Washington have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and U.S. charges - denied by Moscow - of meddling in the 2016 election that brought Donald Trump to the White House.They sank further in March when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer", prompting Russia to recall ambassador Antonov to Washington for consultations. The United States recalled its ambassador in April.The senior US official said the United States was looking at "areas where working together can advance our national interests and make the world safer".Peskov said the two presidents would "need to determine how to proceed with the heads of the diplomatic missions", according to Russian news agencies.While the issues may be vexing, the immediate surroundings of Villa La Grange, an elegant mansion set in a 30-hectare (75-acre) park overlooking Lake Geneva, will be serene.The summit perimeter was under heavy police guard.ARMS CONTROLArms control is one domain where progress has historically been possible despite wider disagreements.In February, Russia and the United States extended for five years the New START treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.The senior US official said Biden would also define areas of vital national interest where Russian misconduct would bring a response. Biden signed an executive order in April giving Washington wide latitude to impose sanctions on Moscow.In a sign of the strain in ties, the talks will not include any meals, and Putin, 68, and Biden, 78, are expected to hold separate news conferences rather than a joint one."No breaking of bread," said the senior US official.Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat, told Reuters Putin wanted Russia to be treated with respect, as members of the Soviet Politburo were in the 1960s-1980s, with "a symbolic recognition of Russia's geopolitical parity with the US"."In exchange, they (Moscow) would be willing to cut back on some of the loony stuff," Frolov said. This might mean "no poisonings, no physical violence, no arrests/kidnappings of US and Russian nationals; no interference in domestic politics".Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank, set the bar low for Wednesday's talks."The principal takeaway, in the positive sense, from the Geneva meeting would be making sure that the United States and Russia did not come to blows physically, so that a military collision is averted," he said.In contrast to Trump, whose 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki included a meeting accompanied only by interpreters, Biden and Putin are not expected to have any solo dealings.Standing beside Putin in Helsinki, Trump refused to blame him for meddling in the 2016 US election, casting doubt on the findings of his own intelligence agencies and sparking a storm of domestic criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-first-summit-with-biden-putin-sees-a-lot-of-issues-101623855256490.html

It remains unclear whether they will do a prisoner exchange deal, though Putin said beforehand he was open to one.Here are some of the individuals who could be freed if such a swap was agreed.Paul Whelan, 51Washington has demanded the release of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine convicted of espionage last June and sentenced to 16 years in jail. Whelan has denied spying and says he was set up in a sting operation.Moscow said that Whelan, who holds US, British, Canadian and Irish passports, had been caught red-handed with classified information in a Moscow hotel room where agents from the Federal Security Service detained him on Dec. 28, 2018.Whelan said he was in Russia for a wedding and on holiday and set up by a Russian man he thought was a friend.Whelan, who is being held in a high-security prison eight hours drive from Moscow, denounced the proceedings against him last June as a "sham trial". Russia has sent mixed signals as to whether it would be ready to free him in a deal.Also Read | Biden, Putin shake hands to kick off Geneva summit. Top 5 issues likely to be discussedTrevor Reed, 29The United States has criticised the trial of Trevor Reed, another former U.S. Marine jailed for nine years last July, as the "theater of the absurd" and lacking serious evidence.Russia convicted Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, of endangering the lives of two police officers who had detained him in August 2019 when he grabbed an officer who was behind the wheel of a car, causing the vehicle to swerve dangerously.Reed said he could not remember the events because he was drunk when detained after leaving a party in Moscow, but denied the charge in court after hearing what he said was the flimsy evidence presented during the trial and the investigation's failure to obtain video evidence that could prove his innocence.In comments which upset his family, Putin, in an NBC interview before the summit, described Reed as "a drunk" and "a troublemaker.""As they say here, he got himself shitfaced and started a fight. Among other things, he hit a cop," said Putin.Viktor Bout, 54The United States is holding Viktor Bout, a Russian arms trafficker serving a 25-year prison sentence for plotting to sell missiles to people he thought were Colombian rebels.Bout, subject of a book called “Merchant of Death” and inspiration for a film “Lord of War” starring Nicolas Cage, was arrested in Thailand in 2008.US authorities said he had agreed to sell arms to US undercover agents posing as Colombian guerrillas planning to attack American soldiers.Bout, who protested his innocence, was convicted in 2011 and Russia has long sought his release.He is now in a prison in Marion, Illinois, and only eligible for release in January 2030.Also Read | Chaos at Biden-Putin summit as US, Russian reporters yell, shove to enter roomKonstantin Yaroshenko, 52Russia has long urged Washington to release pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who is serving 20 years in the United States for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the country.

I don't know how many years, 15, maybe 20 years. And there also the problem seems to be a common crime.

"The health situation is improving faster than we had anticipated, everywhere in mainland France."Across the Channel in Britain, whose vaccination programme is far ahead of France's, a plan to lift most remaining restrictions has been put back a month to July 19 because of the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the virus, which is more infectious, can render vaccines less effective against mild disease, and may put more unvaccinated people in hospital.The variant accounts for the bulk of new infections in Britain, but French Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Tuesday it only represented 2-4% of confirmed cases in France.He warned that if the Indian variant became dominant in France, it could lead to another wave of infections.Castex said pressure on French hospitals had decreased significantly. The number of people in intensive care units was down by 116 to 1,952 on Tuesday, according to health ministry data.France's seven-day moving average of new cases, which was above 40,000 two months ago, stood at 3,500 on Tuesday. French health experts say the pandemic can be considered under control if the rate is below 5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-starts-returning-to-normal-after-covid-19-outbreak-ends-night-curfew-101623849704101.html

16-06-2021||World||'Two great powers': Biden, Putin plunge into hours of talks||With stern expressions and polite words before the cameras, President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin plunged into hours of face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders agree that relations between their countries are at an all-time low.Biden called it a discussion between “two great powers” and said it was “always better to meet face to face.” Putin, for his part, said he hoped the talks would be “productive.”The meeting in a book-lined room had a somewhat awkward beginning — both men appeared to avoid looking directly at each other during a brief and chaotic photo opportunity before a scrum of jostling reporters.Biden appeared to suggest that he can take the Russian leader at his word, nodding his head when asked by a reporter if Putin can be trusted. The White House later sent out a tweet insisting that the president was “very clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally.”Putin ignored shouted questions from reporters, including if he feared jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.The two leaders did shake hands — Biden extended his hand first and smiled at the stoic Russian leader — moments earlier when they posed with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who welcomed them to Switzerland for the summit.The two are expected to meet for four to five hours of wide-ranging talks.For months, they have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden has repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, a disregard for democracy with the jailing of Russia's foremost opposition leader and interference in American elections.Putin, for his part, has reacted with whatabout-isms and obfuscations — pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn't been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.Now, the pair are meeting for the first time face-to-face as leaders. In advance, both sides set out to lower expectations.Even so, Biden said it was an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find “stability and predictability" in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America's fiercest adversaries.“We should decide where it’s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that," Biden told reporters earlier this week. “And the areas where we don’t agree, make it clear what the red lines are."Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no breakthroughs were expected and that “the situation is too difficult in Russian-American relations.”“However, the fact that the two presidents agreed to meet and finally start to speak openly about the problems is already an achievement," Peskov said several hours before the summit's start.Arrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated by both sides.Biden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.Putin and his entourage arrived first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva’s biggest park. Next came Biden and his team. Putin landed in Geneva on Wednesday shortly before the scheduled start of the meeting; Biden — who was in Europe for a week of meeting with allies — arrived the day before.The three spent a moment together in front of the cameras, but only Parmelin made remarks.Biden and Putin were first holding a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side will have a translator.The meeting will then expand to include five senior aides on each side.After the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.Biden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China's Xi Jinping during his rise to power.He has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an “autocrat,” and conventional politicians like Canada's Justin Trudeau.But with Putin, who he has said has “no soul," Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent. Biden this week suggested that he is approaching his meeting with Putin carefully.“He’s bright. He’s tough," Biden said. “And I have found that he is a — as they say...a worthy adversary."The White House held on to hope of finding small areas of agreement.No commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.Both ambassadors will be in Geneva during Wednesday's meeting.Biden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control by holding “strategic stability” talks — a series of government-to-government discussions meant to sort through the many areas of disagreement and tension on the national security front.The Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched alarming attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.The Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won't engage Biden. But the senior Biden administration official said there “is no issue that is off the table for the president," suggesting Navalny will come up.The meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump's 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.Biden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn't unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon a rriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn't sweating his big meeting.“I am always ready,” Biden said.___Associated Press video journalist Daniel Kozin contributed reporting—-This story has been corrected to show that Geneva is not Switzerland's capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-great-powers-biden-putin-plunge-into-hours-of-talks-101623847417987.html

There was no word of Israeli casualties.The incident follows a rise in tensions after a Jewish nationalist march in Jerusalem on Tuesday drew the launch of incendiary balloons across the Gaza border and retaliatory Israeli air strikes.The Israeli military said the Palestinian woman "attempted to ram into a number of IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers" near the Palestinian village of Hizma, northeast of Jerusalem."After the car-ramming attempt, the assailant exited her vehicle with a knife drawn ... The soldiers responded with fire towards the assailant and neutralised her," the military said in a statement.There has been a rise in violent incidents in the West Bank in recent weeks.Last Thursday, Israeli special forces killed an Islamic Jihad militant and two Palestinian security men in an exchange of fire in the northern West Bank city of Jenin.Two Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on Friday and Saturday, the first during a clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank and the second while wielding a knife at military checkpoint near Jerusalem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-woman-shot-dead-in-west-bank-after-attempted-attack-israeli-army-101623841063352.html

Top 5 issues likely to be discussed||US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday shook hands at a stately 18th-century mansion in Geneva, kicking off a high-stakes summit amid heightened tension between the two rival nations. Opening the summit, Putin said he hopes for a 'productive' meeting, while Biden stressed 'it is always better to meet face to face.'"I know you've been on a long journey and have a lot of work," Putin said."Still the US and Russia...relations have a lot of issues accumulated that require the highest level meeting and I hope that our meeting will be productive," he added.Ahead of the meeting, Putin said last Friday that Russia’s bilateral relationship with the US has hit its nadir, noting that Biden is a “radically different” person than his predecessor, Donald Trump. During a press conference after the G7 summit in England, Biden admitted that the bilateral ties with the Kremlin are at a low point.US-Russia relations have deteriorated for years, particularly after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its intervention in Syria, and the alleged interference in US elections, a charge Moscow has denied. The strained bilateral ties further soured when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer", prompting Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for consultations.Also Read | '5 hours, no meals': What Biden-Putin marathon summit maybe likeBoth sides have played down the prospect of any major breakthroughs at the summit and the two leaders won’t hold a press conference standing side-by-side. When asked about why the US president didn’t choose to stand side-by-side with Putin and call out Russia’s disruptive actions, Biden said that it is not a “contest about who can do better in front of a press conference to try to embarrass each other.”"We're not expecting a big set of deliverables out of this meeting," a senior US official told reporters, saying the duo are expected to talk for four or five hours.Here are the top 5 issues Biden and Putin are expected to discuss:Cyberhacking: Launched by criminal syndicates based in Russia, the recent spate of ransomware attacks cutting across sectors in the US has been one of the most critical issues for the Biden administration. The US president is expected to underscore Washington’s plan to respond to such attacks.Election interference: A landmark report by the US intelligence community claimed that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 presidential elections, detailing a massive disinformation push in favour of Donald Trump. In October last year, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said that Russia had obtained voter information ahead of the presidential elections to influence public opinion. While Russia has dismissed these reports, Biden is likely to raise the concern with Putin during the marathon meeting.Also Read | Joe Biden suggests 'autocrat' Putin's Russia might be weaker than it seemsHavana Syndrome: More than 130 US officials have been impacted by the “mysterious” episodes that precipitated unexplained brain injury known as ‘Havana syndrome’, according to a New York Times report. The officials afflicted by Havana syndrome include US diplomats, spies and defence officials who were on overseas assignments. Quoting sources in the Pentagon, the report hinted at the possible involvement of Russian military intelligence agency GRU behind some of these episodes. The issue may come up during the summit.Ukraine: The issue of Ukraine is also likely to come up as a recent military build-up in the area around eastern Ukraine triggered a strong response from the West. The United States had then warned of “consequences”. White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said at a daily briefing that the US was in close consultation with its allies in the region over Russia’s troop movements.Human Rights: According to a CNN report, Biden will raise the issue of human rights but it is not confirmed whether the US president would discuss the opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who was poisoned in a flight and was later jailed in Russia following his return from Germany after receiving treatment in Berlin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-shake-hands-to-kick-off-geneva-summit-top-5-issues-to-come-up-101623844946855.html
16-06-2021||World||Large methane leak detected over South Africa coal mining region||A cloud of methane was detected by satellite near coal mines in South Africa, drawing attention to a lesser-known environmental risk that comes from using the dirtiest fossil fuel.The potent greenhouse gas — methane traps roughly 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide in its first two decades in the atmosphere — was emitted at an estimated rate of 65 metric tons an hour on May 10, according to Kayrros SAS. The Paris-based analytics company found the leak by parsing European Space Agency satellite observations. It was the worst plume of methane Kayrros detected in the data over Africa this year.The cloud was spotted about 125 kilometers (78 miles) east of Johannesburg in an area where Sasol Ltd. has several coal mines as well as chemical and fuel operations. Sasol said it didn’t record any elevated methane levels that day and that emissions from its mining operations “are highly diluted and dispersed over a wide geographical area.” Anglo American Plc said its open-cast Isibonelo mine located nearby is “highly unlikely to emit the levels” estimated by Kayrros.While coal is falling out of favor as an energy source because of the large amount of CO₂ generated as it’s burned, mining the fossil fuel also causes methane emissions because companies sometimes release the gas trapped underground to lower the risk of explosions. Methane can continue leaking after mines have been closed or abandoned. The industry is expected to generate about 10% of methane emissions caused by humans by the end of the decade, according to the Global Methane Initiative. The problem can be mitigated if miners capture the gas and use it for power generation, coal drying or as supplemental fuel for the boilers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It makes sense for companies to take the extra steps because they help boost production and increase revenues. That’s especially true in South Africa, which still depends on coal to generate more than 80% of its electricity.If the May 10 release lasted an hour at the rate estimated by Kayrros it would trap roughly the same amount of heat as about 260,000 cars driving at 60 miles an hour, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The satellite data didn’t show the duration of the leak.The estimated rate correlates with a 3% concentration of methane in the air, Sasol said. The company immediately shuts down operations when any of its sensors register a level of 1% due to the highly combustible environment. Sasol said its analyzers didn’t record readings greater than 0.05% on average that day. South Africa’s Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries didn’t respond to queries about the event.Kayrros also found two other plumes in the vicinity on May 27, which it estimated had emissions rates of more than 40 tons of methane per hour.The findings are the latest in a series of leaks that have been spotted in countries including Canada and Bangladesh. Scientists are just beginning to pinpoint the biggest sources of methane and existing data isn’t yet globally comprehensive. Observations from space can be seasonal due to cloud cover, precipitation and varying light intensity. Satellites can also have difficulty tracking offshore emissions and releases in higher latitudes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/large-methane-leak-detected-over-south-africa-coal-mining-region-101623837006359.html

In an article shared on WeChat, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua compiled more than 10 tweets ridiculing the US embassy announcement about donation, and wrote, "Would this be selected for the Worst Public Relations Award of the Year?"The US and China have been competing for global influence by garnering goodwill from vaccine donation commitments to desperate governments amid a global shortage. While the United States announced large scale vaccine donations after administering Covid shots to the majority of its adult population, China got a head start by donating domestically made vaccines to emerging countries.Last week, US President Joe Biden pledged to donate 500 million doses of Pfizer Covid vaccine to 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries and the African Union, on top of 80 million doses it has already pledged to donate by the end of June. The White House said it will be the largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country.Also Read | Joe Biden says US to donate 500 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, urges global leaders to joinOn Monday, the US Embassy to Port of Spain said on Twitter that its Covid-19 vaccines donation to Trinidad and Tobago includes 80 vials of Pfizer shots.

The unnamed Australian woman said that the rape occurred when she, along with a group of her friends, was visiting New York City to celebrate New Year’s Eve in 2015, reported Bloomberg as part of a wider investigation into safety standards of the vacation rental company.The victim and her friends picked up the keys to the Airbnb property, popular with tourists in New York where most short-term rentals are illegal, from a nearby shop, according to Bloomberg. The report suggests that a stranger, identified by police as 24-year-old Junior Lee, allegedly raped her at knifepoint after she had returned to the property on her own following the new year celebration.Police caught the suspect and found three incriminating items, including a set of keys to the apartment. Lee, who has been charged with predatory sexual assault, has pleaded not guilty but remains in custody. After the alleged attack, safety agents at Airbnb relocated the victim in a hotel, flew her mother overseas from Australia and offered to cover any health or counselling costs, reported Bloomberg.Also Read | Airbnb CEO says travel never going back to the way it was before pandemicThe duplicate keys retrieved from the suspect posed a particular problem for Airbnb and since the attack, the company, according to BBC, has not overhauled its rules on keys and where the apartment hosts may leave them.Bloomberg said that Airbnb wrote a check for $7 million to the victim in one of the biggest payouts the company has ever made and, as part of the settlement, the Australian woman cannot blame or sue Airbnb or the apartment host.However, Airbnb spokesperson Ben Breit, in a statement to New York Post, insisted that the survivors of sexual assault can speak freely about their experiences as part of the settlements the company has reached, including the Manhattan case.“We proactively reached out to the NYPD after the attack to offer our assistance for their investigation, and we helped get her into a hotel. The priority for our company and our executives was supporting the survivor and doing right by someone who had endured trauma,” the New York Post quoted the representative as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airbnb-paid-tourist-7-million-after-she-was-raped-in-new-york-rental-report-101623835413383.html
16-06-2021||World||North Korea: Kim warns of 'tense' food situation, longer Covid lockdown||wNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned about possible food shortages and urged the country to brace for extended Covid-19 restrictions as he opened a major political conference to discuss national efforts to salvage a broken economy.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency also said Wednesday that Kim called for discussions on how the North should deal with the “current international situation,” though it did not mention any specific comments from Kim about the United States or South Korea.North Korea has so far ignored the allies’ calls to resume nuclear negotiations that have stalled for two years following the collapse of Kim’s ambitious summitry with former President Donald Trump, It was derailed by disagreements over exchanging relief from crippling U.S.-led sanctions with denuclearization steps by the North.The North’s economy has deteriorated amid pandemic border closures, which choked off trade with China, while devastating typhoons and floods last summer decimated crops.Monitors assessing the situation in North Korea have yet to see signs of mass starvation or major instability, but some analysts say conditions could be aligning for a perfect storm that undercuts food and exchange markets and triggers public panic. The Korea Development Institute, a South Korean government think tank, said last month the North could face food shortages of around 1 million tons this year.During the plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee that opened Tuesday, Kim urged officials to find ways to boost agricultural production, saying the country’s food situation "is now getting tense.”KCNA said Kim also “set forth the tasks for the state to maintain perfect anti-epidemic state” — suggesting North Korea would extend its pandemic lockdown despite the stress on its economy.While the report was short on specifics, the party meeting does provide more clues about how serious food and consumer goods shortages are becoming in North Korea, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.“Extended pandemic border restrictions are taking a toll on the economy as price and exchange rate indicators appear to be worsening,” he said.Experts widely doubt North Korea's claim that it has not had a single Covid-19 case, given its poor health infrastructure and porous border with China, its major ally and economic lifeline.Kim had called for the party meeting to review national efforts to rebuild the economy in the first half of the year. While addressing “unfavorable” conditions and challenges on Tuesday, Kim also expressed appreciation over what he described as improvements, claiming that the country’s industrial output rose 25% from last year, KCNA said.The report said the Central Committee meeting will continue but did not specify until when.North Korea held its first ruling party congress in five years in January, when it laid out development plans for the next five years. At that meeting Kim urged the country to be resilient in their struggle for economic self-reliance, He also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of the chemical and metal industries.Experts say those sectors are crucial to revitalizing industrial production that has been undercut by sanctions and the suspension of imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-kim-warns-of-tense-food-situation-longer-covid-lockdown-101623834542418.html

But more are staying single and those who marry are having fewer children.The average number of children born to a resident female, who has been married, aged 40 to 49 years dropped to 1.76 in 2020, from 2.02 in 2010.The median age of the resident population, which includes citizens and permanent residents, increased to 41.5 years in 2020 from 37.4 years in 2010, the latest census showed.Authorities have also been accelerating immigration restrictions since the 2011 general elections when the ruling People's Action Party polled a record low share of the popular vote, hurt by citizens' anxiety over an influx of foreigners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-records-slowest-decade-of-population-growth-rate-since-1965-101623830390363.html
16-06-2021||World||5 fuel rods broken in Taishan nuclear power plant, no radiation leak: China||A Chinese nuclear power plant near Hong Kong had five broken fuel rods in a reactor but no radioactivity leaked, the government said Wednesday in its first confirmation of the incident that prompted concern over the facility's safety.Radiation rose inside the No 1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong province but was contained by barriers that functioned as planned, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on its social media account.The Hong Kong government said it was watching the plant and asking officials in Guangdong for details after its French co-owner on Monday reported increased “noble gases” in the reactor. Experts said that suggested fuel rods broke and leaked radioactive gas produced during nuclear fission.Noble gases such as xenon and krypton are byproducts of fission along with particles of cesium, strontium and other radioactive elements.“There is no problem of radioactive leakage to the environment,” the ministry statement said. It said radiation in the reactor coolant increased but was within the “allowable range."The protective envelope on about five of the reactor's 60,000 fuel rods is damaged, the ministry said. It said such damage was inevitable due to manufacturing and other problems and was well below the level the facility was designed to cope with.The ministry said regulators would oversee measures to control radiation levels within the reactor but gave no details.The Taishan plant, which began commercial operation in December 2018, is owned by China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group and Electricite de France. A second reactor began operating in September 2019.They are the first of a new type called European Pressurized Reactors designed by Framatome, of which Electricite de France is the majority owner. Two more are being built in Finland and France.The ministry denied a report by CNN that regulators increased the level of radiation allowed outside the power plant to avoid shutting it down. The ministry said regulators reviewed a report about higher radiation levels in the reactor.China is one of the biggest users of nuclear power and is building more reactors at a time when few other governments plan new facilities because the cost of solar, wind and other alternatives is plunging.Chinese leaders see nuclear power as a way to reduce air pollution and demand for imports of oil and gas, which they deem a security risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-fuel-rods-broken-in-taishan-nuclear-power-plant-no-radiation-leak-china-101623829743874.html
16-06-2021||World||Defence minister should be fired, Canada’s opposition demands||Canada’s opposition has demanded that defence minister Harjit Sajjan either resign or be removed from his post by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as an institutional crisis related to sexual misconduct in the military continues to roil the country.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, leader of the opposition Erin O’Toole said the military was “literally falling apart” under Sajjan’s watch and he should “do the honourable thing and resign”. The Conservative Party leader also described Sajjan as an “incompetent minister” who has lost the confidence of the military.That demand came after controversies over sexual misconduct in the military continue to trouble Sajjan. The latest episode involved major-general Dany Fortin who was removed in mid-May from his position as vice-president for logistics and operations with the Public Health Agency of Canada, due to an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct that occurred three decades earlier. Fortin had led Canada’s vaccination programme after being seconded to the PHAC last November. Now, his lawyers have filed a case in a court alleging improper interference into the military chain of command with Sajjan, health minister Patty Hajdu and Trudeau, along with the senior-most bureaucrat in the country, the Clerk of the Privy Council, taking the decision for political reasons.As Fortin’s legal team challenged the government, lieutenant general Mike Rouleau, the second-in-command in the Canadian Armed Forces or CAF, resigned after it was discovered he went golfing with retired general Jonathan Vance, the former chief of staff. In fact, the entire controversy started with reports of Vance’s alleged sexual misconduct. Vance resigned in January amidst allegations of impropriety of a sexual nature and is facing an investigation.Sajjan has come under severe criticism in this matter after the military ombudsman of the time revealed that the defence minister was informed of the then CAF, Vance’s alleged “improper conduct” with a subordinate in 2018. In May, an adviser to Trudeau testified before the House of Commons defence committee that she was aware of the allegations. There were accusations that Sajjan did not act against Vance due to their long relationship, as they both served together in Afghanistan.Vance’s successor admiral Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service.Sajjan has defended himself, as he continued to do on Tuesday. When confronted with O’Toole’s harangue, he said, “We take all allegations very seriously, as I did and brought the immediate information to the appropriate officials.”Those explanations have done little to dampen criticism of Sajjan in the media and by the opposition, as O’Toole tweeted on Tuesday, “The behaviour of minister Sajjan is disgraceful to the institution we both once served. He has covered up sexual misconduct in the CAF and has lost the respect of members of the CAF. It’s time for the prime minister to show some leadership and fire his defence minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defence-minister-should-be-fired-canada-s-opposition-demands-101623823389547.html

He added that the country aims to get two-thirds of residents their first dose by early July, provided supplies arrived as planned.Singapore recently doubled the gap between doses in order to allow more people to get their first jabs of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. All Singapore citizens age 12 and above are currently eligible to book vaccine appointments, and the last remaining group -- non-citizens 39 and under -- will be able to register for their jabs in the coming weeks, the government has said.“Vaccination remains a key enabler and its ability to help Singapore re-open safely can only be felt when we can collectively achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination,” the Ministry of Health said in a statement June 10. “Further relaxations such as for group and event sizes, capacity limits, distancing requirements, mask-wearing and travel will be introduced when a sufficient proportion of the population has been fully vaccinated, especially for those who are vaccinated.”While the government has not explicitly stated what those vaccination reopening triggers will be, it expects half of the population to be fully vaccinated by August and 75% fully vaccinated by October.“We are now vaccinating about 49,000 doses on a daily basis. And we have the capacity to maintain this acceleration of our vaccine rollout provided our supplies are steady and continue to arrive,” Singapore Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said at a press briefing last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-singapore-nearly-50-residents-vaccinated-says-health-ministry-101623819371960.html
16-06-2021||World||China to launch spaceship with 3 astronauts on June 17||China is expected to launch a manned spacecraft with three astronauts on board at 9.22 am on Thursday from the Gobi desert, an official at the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said.The Shenzhou-12 - Divine Vessel in Chinese - manned spaceship will be launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, the CMSA announced on Wednesday.On board will be three male astronauts, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, chosen after a rigorous array of tests.The three astronauts will be taken into space for the construction of China’s space station, the Xinhua news agency said. “After entering orbit, the spaceship will conduct a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the in-orbit space station core module Tianhe, forming a complex with the core module and the cargo craft Tianzhou-2.”The astronauts aboard Shenzhou-12 will be stationed in the core module and remain in orbit for three months.The Shenzhou-12 crew will live on Tianhe, “Harmony of the Heaven”, a cylinder 16.6m long and 4.2m in diameter.Tianhe is the first module that will eventually form China’s own three-module space station, which it began building in April.Shenzhou 12 will be the third of 11 missions to complete China’s space station.The planned three-month stay would break China’s record of 30 days, set by the 2016 mission – China’s last crewed flight - of Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng to a prototype station.Of the three astronauts, two are considered veterans in China’s space travel history.Nie, 56, will board the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft for his third flight, following his first during the Shenzhou-6 mission in October 2005 and second flight of Shenzhou-10 in June 2013.Liu, 54, will join Nie in the upcoming mission after his first trip to space in September 2008 during the Shenzhou-7 spaceship mission.Both Nie and Liu were fighter pilots with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force.The third crew member, Tang Hongbo, 46, was selected from the second batch of astronauts in 2011.“China selected its first batch of 14 astronauts in the mid-1990s. Since 2003, it has sent six astronauts into space, including Yang Liwei, the country’s first astronaut, and Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first space walk in September 2008,” Global Times reported.The backup crew members for the Shenzhou 12 mission include one woman astronaut - Wang Yaping, who was part of the Shenzhou-10 mission in 2013.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).The launch and docking of Tianzhou-2 was carried out a month after Tianhe, the first part of the space station Tiangong, “Heavenly Palace” in Chinese, was launched.In late April, China sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.The Tianhe, which was sent to orbit by a rocket, can provide electricity and accommodate three astronauts for up to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-launch-spaceship-with-3-astronauts-on-june-17-101623817149264.html
16-06-2021||World||Internal dissensions, estranged army and economic crisis spell trouble for Imran Khan||The pandemonium in Pakistan National Assembly (PNA) during a debate on budget on Tuesday with treasury and opposition benches hurling objects and shouting expletives reflects the inability of the Imran Khan government to stem the rising political chaos in the country.Even though the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) government is unlikely to face any credible political threat from either opposition alliance PDM or PML-N, which itself is embroiled in an internal tussle, it is the infighting within the ruling party coupled with economic crisis and rampant corruption which are weighing the ruling party down.Senior politician from Pakistan's Punjab province, and a key member of the PTI, Jahangir Tareen, broke away from the ruling party in May, forming his own splinter group with around 35 like-minded lawmakers from national and provincial assemblies. Tareen, who has been implicated in a corruption case, is considered close to the country's military junta. A businessman and sugar tycoon, Tareen is known to have wooed many a politicians to join Khan’s party, helping him win the elections that made him the prime minister in 2018.Another worrying factor for PM Khan is the involvement of members of the government in the Rawalpindi Ring Road scam. It has been alleged in local news reports that billions of dollars were made in property deals as part of the project since its conception in 2017. This has severely dented the credibility of Imran Khan’s anti-corruption crusade and the promised vision of Naya Pakistan.Despite all this, the Pakistan government put the current opposition leader in the National Assembly, Shahbaz Sharif, on a no-fly list. Sharif had a court order allowing him to travel abroad for medical reasons. Investigation agencies have also been directed to reopen a decade-old corruption case against Sharif brothers, which had been decisively closed by the court. Shahbaz Sharif has served as chief minister of Punjab and has close ties with the military.Apart from this, spiralling inflation, cries of misgovernance and growing unpopularity of the PTI government has put strains on the military's relationship with Imran Khan.The government's claims about a 3.9% growth rate of the country's GDP has been challenged by the opposition and has called it fraudulent. Fact is that Pakistan’s economy continues to be bogged down with repayment pressures on account of external debt as a result of which Islamabad has sought restructuring of USD 3 billion debt from China and the circular debt of the power sector includes USD 1.3 billion arrears of the Chinese power companies.To add to the discomfort of the Imran Khan government is the internal security situation with increasing terror activities - mainly in Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh and Punjab. Baloch insurgents continue to attack security forces, their alleged informants and workers of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project. Sunni terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawah, Jaish-e-Mohammed and their affiliates continue to operate freely in public with impunity.Khan has made counter moves to consolidate his political standing by scuttling the military's efforts to engage the opposition and even whipping public sentiments on relations with India in direct contravention of the Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s nuanced efforts to tone things down between the two countries. As a result, hybrid arrangement remains in a state of suspended animation and the military's stake in Imran Khan is steadily declining with diminishing returns.What caused a serious dent in the relation between the military and the civilian government is the ruling dispensation's showcasing of success stories in the foreign policy sphere such as the May 7-9 visit by Imran Khan to Saudi Arabia on the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The visit was held under the watchful eyes of Pakistan army chief General Bajwa, who reached Saudi Arabia earlier on May 4, but the fact was underplayed.There was also a lot of noise in the local media over Islamabad’s pro-active role in support of Palestine in the Israel-Palestine conflict. On the other hand an important meeting between Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf and US NSA Jake Sullivan in Geneva was played down despite the fact that the former offered special economic incentives to US in a bid to reach out to the Biden administration. The early withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan will be a major concern for Islamabad as the cross border attacks in KP and Balochistan are likely to increase as both the Taliban and the Afghan government are going to battle it out for Kabul on Durand Line. The spill-over of the forthcoming battle for Kabul will add to instability in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internal-dissensions-estranged-army-economic-crisis-spell-trouble-imran-khan-101623812883632.html

She undertook the historic flight in 1963.Tereshkova became a national heroine at the tender age of 26 when she made that flight.She was born to Vladimir Aksyonovich Tereshkov, a sergeant in the Soviet Army, and Yelena Fyodorovna Tereshkova in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, on March 6, 1937.Tereshkova’s father died in the Finnish Winter War during World War II, when she was two years old. After that, her mother moved the family to Yaroslavl, seeking better employment opportunity and took up a job at the Krasny Perekop cotton mill.Tereshkova enrolled at school in 1945 at the age of eight. In 1953, she left school and began working but continued education by correspondence courses.Tereshkova developed interest in parachuting quite early and trained in skydiving at the local aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22, on May 21, 1959.Thanks to her training in parachuting, Tereshkova was among the five women who were selected for the cosmonaut programme in 1961. After Yuri Gagarin’s historic space trip, the Soviet government was keen to send women to space. And Tereshkova fitted the bill.She attended an extensive 18-month programme wherein the candidates learned the nuances of space travel.She was chosen to pilot Vostok 6. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky took off on Vostok 5 on June 14, 1963 and two days later, Tereshkova too blasted off.She logged more than 70 hours in space and made 48 orbits of the Earth. On June 19, 1963, Tereshkova’s spacecraft re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and she successfully parachuted for 20,000 feet.A few years ago, Tereshkova expressed her willingness to make a one-way trip to Mars. She said that Mars is her favourite planet. The Russian cosmonaut had been part of the group who studied the possibility of going to the Red Planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/june-16-when-valentina-tereshkova-became-first-woman-to-go-to-space-58-yrs-ago-101623811629095.html

The University of Illinois-Chicago received $40 million from the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.“Ms. Scott’s extremely generous donation will advance the lives of students who are poised to make great contributions to our city, our state and our world,” said UIC Chancellor Michael D. Amiridis. "Her gift is a vote of confidence in the mission of public higher education and in UIC.”City College officials say the money is the largest single private donation ever given Kennedy-King. The donation is part of $2.7 billion given to 286 organizations by Scott.Forbes Magazine has reported Kennedy-King College, which serves a largely African-American student body, is considered one of the top 10 community colleges in the country as determined by Academic Influence.“We are dedicated to realizing the full potential of each one of our talented students,” said Kennedy-King College President Greg A. Thomas, adding college officials are deeply grateful to Ms. Scott for the gift.Located in Chicago’s South Side Englewood neighborhood, Kennedy-King serves nearly 5,000 students, offering culinary and hospitality, construction technology and creative arts classes.The donations announced Tuesday is the third round of no-strings-attached, major philanthropic gifts Scott has made. Scott’s wealth, estimated by Forbes at roughly $60 billion, has only grown since she divorced from Bezos in 2019 and walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon. She has pledged to give away a majority of her wealth during her lifetime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-ex-wife-scott-gives-millions-to-2-chicago-colleges-101623803332129.html

Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state that would include the West Bank and Gaza.Prior to Tuesday's march, Israel beefed up its deployment of the Iron Dome anti-missile system in anticipation of possible rocket attacks from Gaza.But as the marchers began to disperse after nightfall in Jerusalem, there was no sign of rocket fire from the enclave.The procession was originally scheduled for May 10 as part of "Jerusalem Day" festivities that celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem.At the last minute, that march was diverted away from the Damascus Gate and the Old City's Muslim Quarter, but the move was not enough to dissuade Hamas from firing rockets towards Jerusalem, attacks that set off last month's round of fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-carries-out-airstrikes-in-gaza-first-time-since-end-of-last-month-s-fighting-101623802972017.html

During the sitting of the House, members of the treasury benches created chaos on the floor and even abused other parliamentarians, according to a video of the incident. The proceedings of the lower house were adjourned by the Speaker after the incident.The chaos broke out when Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif addressed the House.According to the video, which is now going viral, Sharif was greeted by jeers, slogans and whistles from the treasury members as soon as he started speaking."Imran Khan Niazi promised 10 million jobs. Where are those jobs?" asked Sharif. "Where are the USD 300bn that was supposed to be brought back to the country from abroad?"Continuing to lash out at the government, he said that PM Imran Khan's claims of eliminating corruption from Pakistan were hollow."Pakistan is suffering from the worst form of corruption today," he said. "No act of posting or transferring someone these days is done without an element of corruption these days," added Shahbaz.He criticised the government's budget, saying that it had failed to provide relief to the masses from unemployment and inflation, Geo News reported citing the video.The lawmakers were then seen fighting on the floor of the House and throwing copies of the budget.After this, the proceedings of the House were adjourned for the day. "The Sitting of the National Assembly has been adjourned to meet again on Wednesday, the 16th June, 2021 at 2:00 p.m," National Assembly of Pakistan wrote in a tweet.The budget was presented by Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Tarin earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaos-breaks-out-in-pakistan-parliament-over-imran-govt-s-budget-proposals-101623800726946.html

Korea's Kim says food situation 'tense' due to pandemic, typhoons||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said the country's economy improved this year but called for measures to tackle the "tense" food situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic and last year's typhoons, state media said on Wednesday.Kim chaired a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's central committee on Tuesday to review progress on major policies and craft measures to resolve economic issues, according to the official KCNA news agency.The committee set goals and tasks to achieve its new five-year economic plan outlined at its previous session in February, including increased food and metal production.Kim said the overall economy had improved in the first half of the year, with the total industrial output growing 25% from a year before, KCNA said.But there was "a series of deviations" in the party's efforts to implement the plans due to several obstacles, he said, singling out tight food supplies."The people's food situation is now getting tense as the agricultural sector failed to fulfil its grain production plan due to the damage by typhoon last year," Kim said.The party vowed to direct all efforts to farming this year and discuss ways to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, KCNA said.Kim called for steps to minimise impacts of natural disasters as a lesson from last year and key to attain this year's goal.In January, Kim said his previous five-year economic plan had failed in almost every sector, amid chronic power and food shortages exacerbated by sanctions, the pandemic and floods.He also the protracted pandemic required the party to step up efforts to provide food, clothing and housing for the people, KCNA said.North Korea has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 cases, a claim questioned by Seoul officials. But the reclusive country has imposed strict anti-virus measures including border closures and domestic travel restrictions.COVAX, a global initiative for sharing Covid-19 vaccines with poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses to North Korea but the shipment has been delayed amid protracted consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-kim-says-food-situation-tense-due-to-pandemic-typhoons-101623799848963.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden names big tech critic Lina Khan as FTC chair||President Joe Biden named Lina Khan chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, an unexpected move that puts one of the most prominent advocates of aggressive antitrust enforcement against US technology giants in charge of the agency.News of Khan’s appointment came hours after the Senate confirmed her for a seat on the FTC by a vote of 69-28. She will take over the agency from Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who has been a commissioner for three years and had been expected by some to be tapped by Biden to lead the agency permanently.Khan’s elevation to chairwoman marks her rapid rise to the top of US antitrust enforcement. Currently a professor at Columbia Law School, just a few years ago she was a law student at Yale University. Now the 32-year-old is in charge of one of two agencies responsible for policing competition in the US The other is the Justice Department’s antitrust division.“It is a tremendous honor to have been selected by President Biden to lead the Federal Trade Commission,” Khan said in a statement after she was sworn in. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the public from corporate abuse.”As chairwoman, Khan will need a majority of the five-member agency to make enforcement decisions, but she will have significant control over the staff who conduct the agency’s competition and consumer-protection investigations. She will join two Democrats -- Slaughter and Rohit Chopra -- who have long sought to pursue a more aggressive antitrust agenda.Khan rose to prominence with a 2017 research paper on Amazon.com Inc. that she wrote as a law student at Yale University. The paper casts the online retail giant as a harmful monopoly and argues that the company employs practices that should provoke a rethink of antitrust enforcement in the US.Her work put her at the forefront of an anti-monopoly movement known as the New Brandeis School that says the traditional playbook for policing mergers and anticompetitive conduct has failed, leading to concentrated economic and political power across the economy.Once on the fringes of antitrust thinking, support for breaking up tech firms and calls for overhauling antitrust laws have gone mainstream. Last week, House lawmakers introduced a series of bills that would put new restrictions on how tech firms operate and in some cases force them to exit certain businesses.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who called for breaking up tech companies when she was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president, praised Khan’s appointment, calling her a “fearless champion for consumers.”“Consolidation is choking off competition across American industries,” Warren said in a statement. “With Chair Khan at the helm, we have a huge opportunity to make big, structural change by reviving antitrust enforcement and fighting monopolies that threaten our economy, our society, and our democracy.”Still, Khan has her detractors. When she first emerged as a possible candidate for the FTC, Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah called her views on antitrust “wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law.”Tech-funded advocacy organizations were quick to criticize Khan’s confirmation. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and other tech companies, accused Khan of “antitrust activism” that it said will politicize the FTC and harm America’s economic exceptionalism.“Khan has a strong career in persuading the American left of her proposed reforms to antitrust law, but the job of an FTC commissioner is to enforce antitrust laws as they are, not as the commissioner wishes they would be,” Carl Szabo, NetChoice’s general counsel, said in a statement.Slaughter said she looked forward to working with Khan to ensure “that markets work for all people.”Khan’s nomination in March and the appointment of her Columbia colleague Tim Wu as White House adviser on competition policy signaled President Joe Biden was preparing to take a tougher approach to antitrust enforcement. But nearly five months into his administration, Biden has yet to nominate a leader for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC. Biden didn’t announce his intent to name Khan chairwoman when he nominated her.Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, which would consider Biden’s choice for the antitrust division, said in an interview that she hopes the administration nominates someone for the position soon.“The fact they put in Tim Wu and Lina Khan really shows that they’re interested in seriously taking on these issues,” she said.The FTC’s Democratic majority with Slaughter, Chopra and Khan may be short-lived. Biden nominated Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He is still awaiting Senate confirmation after the Senate Banking Committee in March split on his nomination along party lines.At her confirmation hearing, Khan told lawmakers that antitrust enforcers need to scrutinize the power that large technology companies have over digital markets, from app stores to online journalism. She called out the dominance that Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have over app stores on mobile devices, saying terms like Apple taking 30% of the revenue earned by some developers can’t be justified.“The source of the power is the fact that you have basically these two main options, and so that gives these companies the power to really set the terms in this market,” she said. “Certain terms and conditions really lack any type of beneficial justification.”After law school, Khan worked at anti-monopoly think tank Open Markets Institute and as an adviser to Chopra at the FTC. She was also counsel to the House antitrust committee, which last year concluded an investigation of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook Inc.Khan was one of the authors of the panel’s report on the investigation, which accused the tech firms of abusing their roles as gatekeepers in the digital economy and in the process eroding innovation, entrepreneurship, privacy and consumer choice. It also included a series of recommendations for reforms to antitrust laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-big-tech-critic-lina-khan-as-us-ftc-chair-amid-antitrust-probe-101623799829365.html
16-06-2021||World||'Lawless... now pitied around world': Trump on Texas-Mexico border ahead of visit||Former US president Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he will visit the US border with Mexico in a move to contrast his tough stance against immigration with successor Joe Biden's more humane approach.Trump said in a statement that he would join Texas Governor Greg Abbott to visit "our nation's decimated southern border" on June 30."The Biden administration inherited from me the strongest, safest, and most secure border in US history and in mere weeks they turned it into the single worst border crisis in US history," he said."We went from having border security that was the envy of the world to a lawless border that is now pitied around the world."Trump is taking advantage of data showing the Biden administration, promising a more humane approach to migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America, has struggled to fend off hundreds of thousands attempting to cross the border in recent months.From March to May more than 530,000 people were apprehended and pushed back into Mexico after attempting to cross without legal immigration papers, according to the Customs and Border Protection.There is no official estimate on how many did get through, but the sheer number of attempts suggests a rise in successful crossings, CBP officers have said.And Republicans have sought to damage Biden's popularity by highlighting what they call a crisis at the border.Abbott meanwhile announced that he would resume building a Trump-planned wall along the border after Biden stopped the project.Texas "will do what Biden REFUSES to do - protect our citizens along the southern border," Abbott tweeted Tuesday.Trump's announcement was the latest sign that, since leaving the White House on January 20, Trump intends to keep challenging the Democrat by holding out the possibility of running again in 2024.With a strong sway over the Republican voter base, Trump has flexed his influence since leaving office, appearing at a major Republican conference in February, and joining a local candidate's event in North Carolina and a party fundraiser in Florida since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawless-now-pitied-around-world-trump-on-texas-mexico-border-ahead-of-visit-101623798118860.html

16-06-2021||World||New study says Covid was in US in Dec 2019||At least seven people in five US states were infected with the coronavirus weeks before those states reported their first cases, a new government study has shown.The development came at a time when the US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic surpassed 600,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.In the study, participants who reported antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 were likely exposed to the virus at least several weeks before their samples were taken, as the antibodies do not appear until about two weeks after a person has been infected, the researchers said.The results build on findings from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that suggested the virus may have been circulating in the US in late December 2019, before the first Covid-19 case was detected on January 19, 2020. The positive samples came from Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and were part of a study of more than 24,000 blood samples taken for a National Institutes of Health research programme between January 2 and March 18, 2020.The WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that Covid-19 was moving faster than the vaccines, and said the G7’s vow to share a billion doses with poorer nations was simply not enough.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca said its antibody cocktail was only 33% effective in preventing Covid symptoms in people exposed to the virus as part of a study to find a way to tackle the virus.In Pakistan, taking a cue from Punjab province, the Sindh government has announced it will block the mobile SIM cards of those who refuse to take the Covid-19 vaccines, according to a media report on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-study-says-covid-was-in-us-in-dec-2019-101623794072494.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin face off in Geneva||Buoyed by days of partnership-building sessions with allies, US Joe Biden arrived in Geneva on Tuesday for the most tense part of his first European tour as president - talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden is seeking to restore European ties that were strained under former president Donald Trump, who dismissed the value of Nato and other US alliances and sought out Putin.Biden this week held long days of meetings with leaders at G7, Nato and US-EU summits, where he secured joint communiques expressing concern over Russia and China, and then helped preside over a breakthrough agreement easing a US trade dispute with Europe.Biden’s Wednesday meeting with Putin is his most highly anticipated. He has called Putin a “worthy adversary” and has said he is hoping to find areas of cooperation. But he’s also warned if Russia continues its cyberattacks, “we will respond in kind”.According to an administration official granted anonymity to disclose internal discussions, Biden is hoping to find some areas of agreement with Putin, including returning envoys back to Washington and Moscow. Both countries are now without a senior diplomat.Before Biden left Brussels, US officials announced a major breakthrough with the European Union in a 17-year trade dispute centered on rival subsidies for aircraft manufacturers.The two sides reached terms on how much of a government subsidy each can provide for its aircraft manufacturing giant - Boeing in the US and Airbus in the EU. The announcement came as Biden met European Council president Charles Michel and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-face-off-in-geneva-101623793641564.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden nominates 9 envoys to high-profile ambassador postings||President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled picks for several high-profile ambassadorial postings, tapping career diplomats steeped in foreign policy experience — as well as political allies and aviation hero ”Sully” Sullenberger.The picks include former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar as ambassador to Mexico and former Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides as ambassador to Israel. Retired airline pilot C.B. ”Sully" Sullenberger, most famous for negotiating the emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River with no fatalities, has been named to serve as US representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.The announcement comes as Biden is on the tail end of an eight-day European trip that included stops in the United Kingdom for a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders and Belgium for a gathering of the 27 NATO countries and the US-EU summit. The trip culminates in Geneva on Wednesday with a highly anticipated meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, where the leaders are to discuss rising tensions between their countries.As a candidate, Biden declined to rule out appointing political donors to ambassadorships or other posts if he was elected. But he pledged that his nominees, regardless of their contributor status, would be the “best people” for their posts — suggesting he would move away from former President Donald Trump’s heavy reliance on political appointees and rely more on the State Department’s well of career foreign service officers.More than 43% of Trump’s ambassadorial appointments were political appointees, compared with 30.5% for Barack Obama and 31.8% for George W. Bush, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Biden hopes to keep political appointments to about 30% of ambassador picks, according to the White House.“Nobody, in fact, will be appointed by me based on anything they contributed,” Biden promised last year.All the nominees must receive Senate confirmation before they can assume their roles.Biden's other picks include:—Julie Jiyoon Chung, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to serve as ambassador to Sri Lanka.—Sharon Cromer, who currently serves as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission Director at the U.S. Embassy, Accra, Ghana, to serve as ambassador to Gambia.—Troy Fitrell, currently the director of the Office of West African Affairs at the State Department, to serve as ambassador to Guinea. He has served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassies in Ethiopia and Mauritius, as deputy director of the Department’s Office of Southern African Affairs, and as deputy director of the Office of International Security Cooperation in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.—Marc Ostfield, a 30-year veteran of the State Department, to serve as ambassador to Paraguay. Ostfield is currently the ombudsman of the State Department.—Julianne “Julie” Smith, a former Obama administration national security aide currently serving as a senior adviser to the Secretary of State, to serve as permanent representative on the NATO council. She served as deputy national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president.—Cynthia Telles, a clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, to serve as ambassador to Costa Rica. Telles also was a prominent fundraiser for the Biden White House campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nominates-9-envoys-to-high-profile-ambassador-postings-101623787992843.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to pick Lina Khan for US Federal Trade chair: Report||President Joe Biden will name Lina Khan, an antitrust researcher who has focused on Big Tech's immense market power, to chair the US Federal Trade Commission, sources said on Tuesday.Khan, who was confirmed to the FTC as a commissioner on Tuesday with strong bipartisan support, is respected by progressive antitrust thinkers who have pushed for tougher antitrust laws or at least tougher enforcement of existing law.Khan, who most recently taught at Columbia Law School, was on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, and helped write a massive report that sharply criticized Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc for allegedly abusing their dominance.The decision to tap her followed the selection of fellow progressive and Big Tech critic Tim Wu to join the National Economic Council.She joins the commission as the federal government and groups of states have an array of lawsuits and investigations into Big Tech companies. The FTC has sued Facebook and is investigating Amazon. The Justice Department has sued Alphabet's Google.In 2017, she wrote a highly regarded article, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," for the Yale Law Journal which argued that the traditional antitrust focus on price was inadequate to identify antitrust harms done by Amazon.In addition to antitrust, the FTC investigates allegations of deceptive advertising.On that front, Khan will join an agency which is painfully adapting to a unanimous Supreme Court ruling from April which said the agency could not use a particular part of its statute, 13(b), to demand consumers get restitution from deceptive companies but can only ask for an injunction. Congress is considering a legislative fix.Khan previously worked at the FTC as a legal adviser to Commissioner Rohit Chopra, Biden's pick to be director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-pick-lina-khan-for-us-federal-trade-chair-report-101623787928031.html
16-06-2021||World||Wall Street ends lower, jittery investors eye Fed report||Wall Street's main indices ended lower on Tuesday, as data showing stronger inflation and weaker US retail sales in May unnerved investors who were already jittery as they await the results of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.Assurance from the Fed that rising prices are transitory and falling US Treasury yields have helped ease some concerns over inflation and supported US stocks in recent weeks. All eyes are now on the central bank's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.Data showed an acceleration in producer prices last month as supply chains struggled to meet demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy. A separate report showed US retail sales dropped more than expected in May."There was a bit of a reaction to the economic data we got, which, for the most part, shows that the economy is starting to wean itself off stimulus, the recovery is slowing down a little, and inflation is continuing to grow," said Ed Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA."We're seeing some very modest weakness, and it'll be choppy leading up to the Fed decision. Right now, the Fed is probably in a position to show they are thinking about tapering, but they're still a long way from actually doing it."The Fed is likely to announce in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond buying program, but will not start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll of economists found.The benchmark S&P 500, the blue-chip Dow Jones and the tech-focused Nasdaq have all gained so far this year, largely driven by optimism about an economic reopening.However, the S&P 500 has been broadly stuck within a range, despite recording its 29th record-high finish of 2021 on Monday, versus 33 for all of last year.Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91.92 points, or 0.27%, to 34,301.83, the S&P 500 lost 8.29 points, or 0.19%, to 4,246.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.29 points, or 0.71%, to 14,072.86.The majority of the 11 major S&P sectors slipped. The energy index rose as oil prices hit multi-year highs on positive demand outlook.The communication services sector ended lower, having hit a record intraday high earlier in the session.In corporate news, Boeing Co gained after the United States and the European Union agreed on a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies involving the planemaker and its rival Airbus.Having slumped 19% on Monday, Lordstown Motors Corp shares rallied after comments from the electric truck manufacturer's president on orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wall-street-ends-lower-jittery-investors-eye-fed-report-101623787431976.html
16-06-2021||World||California, first to shut in pandemic, fully reopens||California, the first state in America to put in place a coronavirus lockdown, has turned a page on the pandemic.The nation's most populated state lifted most of its restrictions Tuesday, meaning no more state rules on social distancing or capacity limits at restaurants, bars, supermarkets, gyms, stadiums or anywhere else.And masks — one of the most fraught symbols of the pandemic — are no longer mandated for vaccinated people in most settings, though businesses and counties can still require them.Gov. Gavin Newsom celebrated the milestone by hosting a lottery-style selection of 10 winners who will get $1.5 million each simply for being vaccinated. It was the grand finale to the nation’s largest vaccine incentive — $116 million in Covid-19 lottery jackpots and cash card giveaways.“Finally we are here, June 15th, to turn the page," Newsom declared from a stage at Universal Studios Hollywood during festivities to mark what he called the “full reopening” of the state's economy.The Democratic governor pointed to the more than 40 million doses of vaccine administered and the resulting plunge in cases as the reason for the reopening.“Foundationally, that's why we're here today,” Newsom said.Just in time for summer, California wants to send the message that life is getting much closer to normal. The economy is fully reopened for the first time in 15 months and people can largely return to pre-pandemic lifestyles.Fans can cheer maskless at Dodgers and Giants baseball games. Disneyland is opening to all tourists after allowing just California residents since April. People can pack indoor bars and nightclubs from the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles to the Castro in San Francisco.Tourism was among the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic and now wants to make up for a lost time.“In terms of our incredible cities, our iconic attractions, the industry is ready to roll out the red carpet to visitors in California, around the nation and even the world," said Caroline Beteta, president and CEO of Visit California.Pandemic highs and lows saw California go from being a success story to the U.S. epicenter of the virus. As the first in the country to impose a statewide lockdown in March 2020, California’s businesses were just starting to reopen last June when cases started rising and restrictions were imposed again.By summer's end, a darker reality set in as California hurtled toward a deadly winter surge. Shutdowns, curfews and harrowing images from overwhelmed hospitals became the norm as the state set records almost daily for infections and deaths.More people tested positive for the virus in California (3.8 million and counting) and more people died (63,000 plus) than anywhere else in the country, although the nation’s most populous state had a lower per capita death rate than most others.California now has one of the lowest rates of infection in the country, below 1%. That dramatic drop in infections combined with an increasing number of vaccinated residents — over 70% of adults have had at least one dose — led Newsom to announce in April that most Covid-19 restrictions would be lifted June 15.The reopening doesn’t necessarily mean people will immediately flock to places and events they once packed or that businesses will opt to return to full capacity immediately. But a palpable feeling of anticipation has replaced the anxiety, frustration and sadness that ushered in summer 2020.For Angie Barragan, who was born in Los Angeles and visited last week from Las Vegas, so many things that were once normal feel new, awkward and amazing: strolling in public without a mask, socializing for the first time in ages.“It’s kind of learning how to be a human again,” she said as she shopped and strolled on LA's historic Olvera Street, a restored Mexican marketplace once clogged with tourists. “But it’s great to be among people.”The reopening doesn’t mean the pandemic is over, Newsom has repeatedly stressed as an explanation for retaining his statewide emergency declaration.Some public health measures will stay for “megaevents.” People attending indoor concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings of more than 5,000 people will have to show proof that they are vaccinated or have a recent negative Covid-19 test. Those going to outdoor events with more than 10,000 people are “strongly encouraged” to do the same.While fully vaccinated people will no longer be required to wear masks in most places, those who are unvaccinated are expected to, but it won’t be enforced. Businesses have three choices: operate on an honor system, require customers to show proof of vaccination or require everyone to cover their face.Many question if the honor system will work, including the California Nurses Association, which said the new rules essentially call on businesses and essential workers to be the vaccination police.“This is not a sound public health strategy," said Sandy Rending, a president of the association, which is calling on people to keep masks on indoors and in crowds.For now, masks are still required in places like public transit, airports, health care settings and indoor school classes.While applauding the reopening, some business owners said ever-shifting mask rules are confounding.“We’re excited — and a little confused,” said Tom La Torre, owner of Sabella & La Torre Restaurant at Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco, a tourist haven that transformed into a ghost town during the pandemic.Until now, his restaurant was limited to 50% capacity.“That will be nice to fill the place up. However, we are still confused about the mask mandate,” La Torre said.It’s also unclear if people will come.For Rita Torres, a retired university administrator in Oakland, the last 15 months were “mindboggling.” She has missed dancing at live concerts and hugging her girlfriends at weekly happy hours. But for her, the reopening is just another day.“Deep down, I want to rejoice,” Torres said, but she’s going to take it slow. “Because it’s kind of like, is it too soon? Will we be sorry?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-first-to-shut-in-pandemic-fully-reopens-101623786433271.html
16-06-2021||World||Chinese man commits $20 million fraud on coronavirus aid programs, pleads guilty||A Chinese man who prosecutors say tried to get $20 million in federal aid for distressed businesses pleaded guilty Tuesday to two criminal charges.Muge Ma entered the plea in Manhattan federal court to bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, admitting the fraud that authorities say he carried out from his luxury Manhattan condominium.Judge Richard M. Berman noted that it was the first hearing conducted in his courtroom since the coronavirus forced a shutdown of most in-court proceedings in March 2020.Ma, 37, has remained incarcerated as a flight risk since his May 2020 arrest, when prosecutors said he had applied to at least five banks for over $20 million in government-guaranteed loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The programs were intended for businesses harmed by coronavirus shutdowns.Authorities said he falsely claimed to be paying hundreds of employees millions of dollars in wages through two companies he controlled. To support the claims, he submitted fraudulent bank, tax, insurance and payroll records and provided banks with links to websites that described the companies as “global,” prosecutors said.They said he also falsely asserted that he was a U.S. citizen, though he did have lawful permanent resident status.“In truth, Ma appears to be the only employee of either company and he had no legitimate claim to the funds for which he applied,” U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a release.“Small businesses are facing uncertainty and unprecedented challenges, the least of which should be opportunists attempting to loot the federal funds meant to assist them,” she added.According to prosecutors, a bank approved and disbursed over $800,000 in loan funds for one of Ma's companies, although the money was frozen during the investigation. They said another $650,000 in loans had been approved and a $10,000 loan advance had been provided.A sentencing agreement with prosecutors that Ma signed Tuesday recommends he be sentenced to between six and seven years in prison, including a two-year mandatory prison sentence on the aggravated identity theft charge. Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 22.Ma's plea deal with prosecutors contained language that made it seem that Ma's deportation was very likely, if not mandatory, but his lawyer, Peter Katz, told Berman that the words were common in legal documents, regardless of the crimes.“In our opinion, he won't be," Katz said of deportation. Still, he added: “He understands it is a possibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-man-commits-20-million-fraud-on-coronavirus-aid-programs-pleads-guilty-101623785434073.html

Between 3,000 and 3,500 police and other forces are being deployed in the usually sleepy Swiss lakeside city.The authors represented among the thousands of books at the villa include Charles Pictet de Rochemont, a Swiss diplomat who prepared the Swiss declaration of permanent neutrality - itself likely a factor in the choice of Geneva for the summit.(Reporting By Steve Holland and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Writing by Arshad Mohammed in Saint Paul, Minn.; Editing by Howard Goller)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-hours-no-meals-what-biden-putin-marathon-summit-maybe-like-101623778049680.html
16-06-2021||World||AstraZeneca antibody cocktail fails to prevent Covid-19 in large trial||AstraZeneca said on Tuesday a late-stage trial failed to provide evidence that its Covid-19 antibody therapy protected people who had contact with an infected person from the disease, a small setback in its efforts to find alternatives to vaccines.The study assessed whether the therapy, a cocktail of two types of antibodies, could prevent adults who had been exposed to the virus in the past eight days from developing Covid-19 symptoms.The therapy, AZD7442, was 33% effective in reducing the risk of people developing symptoms compared with a placebo, but that result was not statistically significant — meaning it might have been due to chance and not the therapy.The Phase III study, which has not been peer-reviewed, included 1,121 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States. The vast majority, though not all, were free of the virus at the start of the trial.Results for a subset of participants who were not infected to begin with was more encouraging but the primary analysis rested on results from all participants."While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442," AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the polymerase chain reaction tests which diagnose Covid-19.The company is banking on further studies to revive the product's fortunes. Five more trials are ongoing, testing the antibody cocktail as treatment or in prevention.The next one will likely be from a larger trial testing the product in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer or an organ transplant, who may not benefit from a vaccine.TARGETED ALTERNATIVESAZD7442 belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies produced by the body to fight off infections.Similar therapies developed by rivals Regeneron, Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline with partner Vir have been approved by US regulators for treating unhospitalised Covid patients.Regeneron is also seeking US authorisation for its therapy as a preventative treatment.European regulators have recommended antibody treatments by GSK, Celltrion, Eli Lilly and Regeneron for used in early-stage patients who are at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19. The EU watchdog made the endorsement to support the use by member states ahead of an EU-wide marketing authorisation.But the AstraZeneca results are a small blow for the drug industry as it tries to find more targeted alternatives to Covid-19 inoculations, particularly for people who may not be able to get vaccinated or those who may have an inadequate response to inoculations.The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has faced a rollercoaster of challenges with the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine, is also developing new treatments and repurposing existing drugs to fight the virus.AstraZeneca also said on Tuesday it was in talks with the US government on "next steps" regarding a $205 million deal to supply up to 500,000 doses of AZD7442. Swiss manufacturer Lonza was contracted to produce AZD7442.Shares in the company were largely unchanged on the London Stock Exchange.The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-antibody-cocktail-fails-to-prevent-covid-19-in-large-trial-101623782052267.html
16-06-2021||World||US Covid deaths at 600,000 equal to 2019 cancer toll in America||The US death toll from Covid-19 topped 600,000 on Tuesday, even as the vaccination drive has drastically brought down daily cases and fatalities and allowed the country to emerge from the gloom and look forward to summer.The number of lives lost, as recorded by Johns Hopkins University, is greater than the population of Baltimore or Milwaukee. It is about equal to the number of Americans who died of cancer in 2019. Worldwide, the Covid-19 death toll stands at about 3.8 million.The milestone came the same day that California and New York lifted most of their remaining restrictions, joining other states in opening the way, step by step, for what could be a fun and close to normal summer for many Americans.“Deep down I want to rejoice,” said Rita Torres, a retired university administrator in Oakland, California. But she plans to take it slow: “Because it’s kind of like, is it too soon? Will we be sorry?”With the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December, Covid-19 deaths per day in the US have plummeted to an average of around 340, from a high of over 3,400 in mid-January. Cases are running at about 14,000 a day on average, down from a quarter-million per day over the winter.The real death tolls in the US and around the globe are thought to be significantly higher, with many cases overlooked or possibly concealed by some countries.President Joe Biden acknowledged the approaching milestone Monday during his visit to Europe, saying that while new cases and deaths are dropping dramatically in the US, “there’s still too many lives being lost,” and “now is not the time to let our guard down.”The most recent deaths are seen in some ways as especially tragic now that the vaccine has become available practically for the asking.More than 50% of Americans have had at least one dose of vaccine, while over 40% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But demand for shots in the US has dropped off dramatically, leaving many places with a surplus of doses and casting doubt on whether the country will meet Biden's target of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. The figure stands at just under 65%.As of a week ago, the US was averaging about 1 million injections per day, down from a high of about 3.3 million a day on average in mid-April, according to the CDC.At nearly every turn in the outbreak, the virus has exploited and worsened inequalities in the United States. CDC figures, when adjusted for age and population, show that Black, Latino and Native American people are two to three times more likely than whites to die of Covid-19.Also, an Associated Press analysis found that Latinos are dying at much younger ages than other groups. Hispanic people between 30 and 39 have died at five times the rate of white people in the same age group.Overall, Black and Hispanic Americans have less access to medical care and are in poorer health, with higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. They are also more likely to have jobs deemed essential, less able to work from home and more likely to live in crowded, multigenerational households.With the overall picture improving rapidly, California, the most populous state and the first to impose a coronavirus lockdown, dropped state rules on social distancing and limits on capacity at restaurants, bars, supermarkets, gyms, stadiums and other places, ushering in what has been billed as its “Grand Reopening” just in time for summer.Disneyland is throwing open its gates to all tourists after allowing just California residents. Fans will be able to sit elbow-to-elbow and cheer without masks at Dodgers and Giants gamesIn New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that 70% of adults in the state have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and he announced that the immediate easing of many of the restrictions will be celebrated with fireworks.“What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,” he said.He said the state is lifting rules that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow cleaning protocols, take people’s temperature or screen them for Covid-19 symptoms. Businesses will no longer have to restrict how many people they can allow inside based on the 6-foot rule.For the time being, though, New Yorkers will have to keep wearing masks in schools, subways and certain other places.Massachusetts on Tuesday officially lifted a state of emergency that had been in effect for 462 days, though many restrictions had already been eased, including mask requirements and limits on gatherings.The first known deaths from the virus in the US were in early February 2020. It took four months to reach the first 100,000 dead. During the most lethal phase of the disaster, in the winter of 2020-21, it took just over a month to go from 300,000 to 400,000 deaths.With the crisis now easing, it took close to four months for the US death toll to go from a half-million to 600,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-deaths-at-600-000-equal-to-2019-cancer-toll-in-america-101623780749035.html
