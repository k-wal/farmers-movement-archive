He said he himself had just received a top-up, after being fully vaccinated a year ago.The third doses being offered are a repeat of the first dose of the two-shot Sputnik V vaccine, he said.Several Russian officials and members of the business elite, as well as some members of the public, have already been securing third and fourth doses of Sputnik V, Reuters reported in April.The question of how long a vaccine offers protection against Covid-19 will be vital as countries gauge when or whether revaccination will be needed, and Russia's findings will be closely watched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-drives-moscow-surge-kremlin-blames-vaccine-hesitancy-nihilism-101624038102873.html
18-06-2021||World||Palestinians call off 1 million dose vaccine exchange with Israel||The Palestinian Authority called off an agreement whereby Israel would transfer 1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to it in exchange for a similar number later this year, hours after the deal was announced on Friday.The Palestinians said the doses, which Israel began shipping to the occupied West Bank, are too close to expiring and do not meet their standards. In announcing the agreement, Israel had said the vaccines “will expire soon” without specifying the date.Palestinian officials had come under heavy criticism on social media after the agreement was announced, with many accusing them of accepting subpar vaccines and suggesting they might not be effective.Israel said Friday it will transfer around 1 million doses of soon-to-expire coronavirus vaccines to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for a similar number of doses the Palestinians expect to receive later this year.Israel, which has fully reopened after vaccinating some 85% of its adult population, has faced criticism for not sharing its vaccines with the 4.5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.The disparity has played out across the globe as the bulk of vaccines went to wealthy countries. As those countries have made progress containing their own outbreaks, they have recently begun pledging supplies for poorer countries that were left behind for months.The new Israeli government, which was sworn in on Sunday, said it would transfer Pfizer vaccines that will expire soon, and that the Palestinian Authority would reimburse it with a similar number of vaccines when it receives them from the pharmaceutical company in September or October. Up to 1.4 million doses could be exchanged, the government said in a statement.“We will continue to find effective ways to cooperate for the benefit of people in the region,” Foreign Minister Yair Lapid tweeted after the deal was announced.COGAT, the Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in the occupied territories, said it had coordinated the delivery of the first 100,000 doses to the West Bank on Friday.The Palestinians portrayed the agreement differently, saying Pfizer had suggested the transfer as a way of speeding up its delivery of 4 million doses that the PA had already paid for in an agreement reached directly with the drug company.“This is not an agreement with Israel, but with the Pfizer company," Palestinian Health Minister Mai Alkaila said earlier Friday, before the deal was called off, according to the official Wafa news agency.At a press conference Friday evening, she said Alkaila said that health officials who inspected the vaccines found they “did not meet standards and so we decided to return them.”Government spokesman Ibrahim Milhim said that Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh has ordered the cancelation of the agreement and return the vaccines to Israel. He said the Palestinians would not accept “about-to-expire” vaccines from Israel.Israel has carried out one of the most successful vaccination programs in the world, allowing it to fully reopen businesses and schools. This week, authorities lifted the requirement to wear masks in public, one of the last remaining restrictions.Rights groups have said that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide vaccines to the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation, pointing to interim peace agreements reached with the Palestinians in the 1990s.Those agreements say the PA, which has limited autonomy in parts of the occupied West Bank, is responsible for health care but that the two sides should cooperate to combat pandemics. Israel has offered vaccines to the more than 100,000 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank who work inside Israel, as well as Palestinians in east Jerusalem.Gaza is ruled by the Islamic militant group Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and Western countries. Israeli officials have suggested linking any supply of vaccines to Gaza to the return of two Israeli captives and the remains of two soldiers held by Hamas.The PA has said it is acquiring its own supplies through agreements with private companies and a World Health Organization program designed to aid needy countries.To date, around 380,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and around 50,000 in Gaza have been vaccinated. More than 300,000 infections have been recorded in the two territories, including 3,545 deaths.Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want a state in all three territories. There have been no substantive peace talks in more than a decade.___Associated Press writer Areej Hazboun in Jerusalem contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-call-off-1-million-dose-vaccine-exchange-with-israel-101624037475891.html
18-06-2021||World||AstraZeneca, EU bitter battle over vaccine supply ends, victory declared||The European Union fell short of its court demands to receive millions more doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine after a Brussels court ruled in a dispute over supply shortfalls.AstraZeneca must supply 80.2 million doses of the shot by Sept. 27, only about 10 million more doses than Astra said it has already sent the EU. The European Commission had asked for 120 million vaccine doses cumulatively by the end of June and a total of 300 million doses by the end of September, the company said.Astra and the EU have been locked in a bitter fight over vaccine supplies this year after the company failed to meet its contracted targets due to issues including problems scaling-up manufacturing at a site in Belgium.At a court hearing last month, the EU said Astra should pay 10 euros ($12) a day for each overdue vaccine. The EU had asked the court to order Astra to supply 20 million more doses than it planned to deliver by the end of June. If the court backed the EU, the company could have faced as much as 200 million euros a day in penalties for those shots.“In fewer than twelve months, AstraZeneca has worked extremely hard to develop an effective vaccine at no profit and is the second-largest supplier to the EU’s 27 member states,” the company said in a statement.The court also ruled that the European Commission had no exclusivity or right of priority over other contracting parties. Friday’s interim order will be followed by a full ruling on the merit of the claim at a later date.DamagingFriday’s ruling did criticize Astra’s handling of the vaccine rollout in the EU. The judges ruled that the company “intentionally chose to not use all means at its disposal to produce and deliver the contested vaccines.”“The choice to monopolize the Oxford Biomedica site in the UK and deprive the EU of a manufacturing site that was clearly foreseen seems all the more damaging,” the court ruled.Meanwhile, the EU trumpeted the decision as proof AstraZeneca under-delivered on its promises.“AstraZeneca is clearly not freed from its contractual obligations,” a lawyer for the commission said at a briefing for journalists after the verdict was made public.The company “already said during the proceedings that it intended to deliver the 300 million doses at the latest by the end of the year, but AstraZeneca remains bound to make its best contractual efforts to do it as soon as possible,” the lawyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-eu-bitter-battle-over-vaccine-supply-ends-victory-declared-101624027058441.html
18-06-2021||World||California launches digital Covid-19 vaccine pass. Here's how it works||California officials on Friday unveiled a website to access or download a digital copy of Covid-19 immunization records, though they stressed the state would not make it mandatory to carry the vaccine credentials.Businesses will be able to verify the authenticity of digital "vaccine cards" by scanning a QR code on them using an app that a nonprofit group is expected to launch this month. The nearly 20 million immunized Californians can access their data at myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov."It's an optional tool to use," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan.California opened up from Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday, with masks, social distancing and capacity limits no longer required at most venues for those who are vaccinated. But businesses are largely operating on the honor system and not "carding" people.Still, state officials said the e-pass could help in some circumstances, such as for travel.Other states have barred shops and offices from requiring proof of vaccination, deriding "vaccine passports" as an intrusion on civil liberties.California's technology department developed its new website using technology known as Smart Health Cards, which originated at Boston Children’s Hospital. Walmart Inc this week also adopted Smart to support people who were vaccinated at its stores.The approach contrasts with New York state, which paid IBM to develop a records app called Excelsior Pass, as well as a companion app for verification. Over a million people downloaded their records onto New York's app, but few businesses have required them.California's Los Angeles County has offered digital Covid-19 vaccine records for months through startup Healthvana. Millions of users have taken advantage, said Healthvana Chief Executive Ramin Bastani.Users may experience glitches with California's new system, because their entered names, birthdates and contact information must match immunization records. Rick Klau, the state's chief tech innovation officer, said only about 90% of records include contact information and some of it may be outdated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-launches-digital-covid-19-vaccine-pass-here-s-how-it-works-101624036237675.html
18-06-2021||World||Juneteenth holiday gets cheer from Black Americans, say more work ahead||Black Americans rejoiced after President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday, but some said that, while they appreciated the recognition at a time of racial reckoning in America, more is needed to change policies that disadvantage too many of their brethren.“It’s great, but it’s not enough,” said Gwen Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Kansas City. Grant said she was delighted by the quick vote this week by Congress to make Juneteenth a national holiday because “it's been a long time coming.”But she added that “we need Congress to protect voting rights, and that needs to happen right now so we don't regress any further. That is the most important thing Congress can be addressed at this time.”At a jubilant White House bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, Biden agreed that more than a commemoration of the events of June 19, 1865, is needed. That’s when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas — some 2 1/2 years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves in Southern states.“This day doesn’t just celebrate the past. It calls for action today,” Biden said before he established Juneteenth National Independence Day. His audience included scores of members of Congress and Opal Lee, a 94-year-old Texas woman who campaigned for the holiday.Biden singled out voting rights as an area for action.Republican-led states have enacted or are considering legislation that activists argue would curtail the right to vote, particularly for people of color. Legislation to address voting rights issues, and institute policing reforms demanded after the killing of George Floyd and other unarmed Black men, remains stalled in the Congress that acted swiftly on the Juneteenth bill.Other people want the federal government to make reparations or financial payments to the descendants of slaves in an attempt to compensate for those wrongs. Meanwhile, efforts are afoot across the country to limit what school districts teach about the history of slavery in America.Community organizer Kimberly Holmes-Ross, who helped make her hometown of Evanston, Illinois, the first US city to pay reparations, said she was happy about the new federal holiday because it will lead more people to learn about Juneteenth.But she would have liked Congress to act on anti-lynching legislation or voter protections first.“I am not super stoked only because all of the other things that are still going on,” said Holmes-Ross, 57. “You haven’t addressed what we really need to talk about.”Peniel Joseph, an expert on race at the University of Texas at Austin, said the US has never had a holiday or a national commemoration of the end of slavery. Many Black Americans had long celebrated Juneteenth.“Juneteenth is important symbolically, and we need the substance to follow, but Black people historically have always tried to do multiple things at the same time," Joseph said.Most federal workers will observe the holiday Friday. Several states and the District of Columbia announced that government offices would be closed Friday.Juneteenth is the 12th federal holiday, including Inauguration Day once every four years. It's also the first federal holiday since the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday was added in 1983.Before June 19 became a federal holiday, it was observed in the vast majority of states and the District of Columbia. Texas was first to make Juneteenth a holiday in 1980.Most white Americans had not heard of Juneteenth before the summer of 2020 and the protests that stirred the nation's conscience over race after Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer, said Matthew Delmont, who teaches history at Dartmouth College.He said the new federal holiday “hopefully provides a moment on the calendar every year when all Americans can spend time thinking seriously about the history of our country.”The Senate passed the bill earlier this week by unanimous agreement. But in the House, 14 Republicans voted against it, including Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. Roy said Juneteenth deserves to be commemorated, but he objected to the use of “independence” in the holiday's name.“This name needlessly divides our nation on a matter that should instead bring us together by creating a separate Independence Day based on the color of one's skin,” he said in a statement.Added Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who also voted against the bill: “We have one Independence Day, and it applies equally to all people of all races.”The sentiment was different in Texas, the first state to make Juneteenth a holiday.“I'm happy as pink,” said Doug Matthews, 70, and a former city manager of Galveston who has helped coordinate the community's Juneteenth celebrations since Texas made it a holiday.He credited the work of state and local leaders with paving the way for this week's step by Congress.“I'm also proud that everything started in Galveston,” Matthews said.Pete Henley, 71, was setting up tables Thursday for a Juneteenth celebration at the Old Central Cultural Center, a Galveston building that once was a segregated Black school. He said the Juneteenth holiday will help promote understanding and unity.“All holidays have significance, no matter what the occasion or what it’s about, but by it being a federal holiday, it speaks volumes to what the country thinks about that specific day,” said Henley, who studied at the school before it was integrated and is president of the cultural center.He said his family traces its roots back to enslaved men and women in the Texas city who were among the last to receive word of the Emancipation Proclamation.“As a country, we really need to be striving toward togetherness more than anything,” Henley said. “If we just learn to love each other, it would be so great.”Holmes-Ross recalled first learning about Juneteenth in church in Evanston, a Lake Michigan suburb just outside Chicago. Over the years, she said she made sure her three children commemorated the day with community events including food, dancing and spoken word performances.She said it was about more than a day off for her family and expressed hope that it would be for others, too.“We were intentional about seeking out Black leaders and things we could celebrate as African Americans,” Holmes-Ross said. “Hopefully, people do something productive with it. It is a day of service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/juneteenth-holiday-gets-cheer-from-black-americans-say-more-work-ahead-101624027078416.html

18-06-2021||World||UK PM Johnson faces embarrassing defeat as party loses out at election||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered an embarrassing defeat in a election on the outskirts of London on Friday, when his governing Conservative Party lost a previously safe parliamentary seat to the Liberal Democrats.The Conservatives had comfortably held the leafy, affluent Chesham and Amersham constituency in southern England since its creation in 1974, capturing more than 50% of the vote on every occasion. At the last poll in 2019, Conservative Cheryl Gillan, who died this year, won by a majority of 16,223 votes.Since a divisive referendum in 2016, Brexit has helped reshape Britain's political landscape, with people switching party loyalties in a way not seen for generations. Support for the Conservatives has surged in northern England.On Wednesday, Sarah Green, the candidate for the Liberal Democrats - a centrist, pro-European Union party - won a majority of 8,028 votes over the Conservative candidate. The main opposition Labour Party came fourth, with 1.6% of the vote, its worst showing in decades.Johnson said it was a "disappointing result", suggesting there were "particular circumstances" in the area and "it was a bit bizarre" to suggest his party were on the back foot."We are a great one-nation party and we will continue with our mission to unite and level up because that is the best way to deliver jobs, prosperity across the whole country," he told reporters.But Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said it was a sign of things to come, with his party ousting the Conservatives from traditional strongholds in England's affluent south."Across the south, the Tory Blue Wall is beginning to crumble," he said in a statement. "Here and in great swathes of the country, only the Liberal Democrats can beat the Conservatives and breach their Blue Wall."NEW NORTH/SOUTH DIVIDE?The result may cause some nervousness in the Conservative Party, which has targeted traditional Labour-supporting voters in northern England but, according to some of its lawmakers, has increasingly ignored its strongholds in the south.Johnson's parliamentary seat is just 10 miles away, in West London.While governing parties often lose out at so-called by-elections, the Lib Dems focused their campaign on local issues, such as the new High Speed 2 rail link between London and northern England which cuts through the area.The Conservatives have also been criticised about changes to planning laws, which some fear could mean more building of homes over green fields, something Johnson said was a misunderstanding as the government wanted construction on brownfield sites."I think there's some misunderstanding about the planning reforms, perhaps even some wilful misunderstanding," he said."What we want is sensible plans to allow development on brownfield sites ... but I do think young p||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-faces-embarrassing-defeat-as-party-loses-out-at-election-101624025659445.html

"The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa, unprotected by vaccines."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-covid-variant-becoming-globally-dominant-says-who-official-101624026164258.html

From staple foods to non-staples, from meat to vegetables, the menu design is of high quality and appetising for astronauts. Famous stir-fried Chinese dishes like shredded pork with garlic sauce and Kung Pao chicken are both on the menu,” the news agency Xinhua said.“There are even Sichuan dishes, fish-flavoured pork shreds…(and) ice cream and desserts,” the paper.cn said in a report.The three will also have the option to choose from instant food, beverages, condiments, and functional foods.The food available in the “space canteen” has been developed and produced in strict accordance with the aerospace food standards, the report said.Not only is balanced nutrition critical in what the astronauts eat, what is also equally important is to make eating convenient.The food available to them can be eaten in one bite: The items are small, solid, bone-less, and entirely edible without residues to reduce meal waste as much as possible.What’s more, lest the astronauts get bored with eating the same dishes every day, the meals have been designed in such a way to ensure that the same dish is not repeated in days.Required appliances are in place as well.“The dining area is equipped with a food heating device, refrigerator, water dispenser and folding table. In the exercise area, the treadmill and spin bike provide them options to maintain physical health,” the Xinhua report said.“The waste and human excrement will be stored in Tianzhou-2, which will eventually depart from orbit and burn up on re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-varieties-of-food-available-to-3-chinese-astronauts-101624015584938.html

The two charged executives would appear in court on Saturday morning.Over 100 people have been arrested under the new security law which China imposed on Hong Kong nearly a year ago to stamp out dissent in the wake of huge pro-democracy protests.More than 60 have been charged and the vast majority have been denied bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-hong-kong-newspaper-executives-charged-under-security-law-say-police-101624005552756.html
18-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Half of Germany's population vaccinated with first dose||Germany has reached a milestone in its effort to overcome the coronavirus pandemic with more than half of the population at least partially inoculated.As of Friday, 50.1% of German residents have had at least one dose and 29.6% are fully immunized against Covid-19, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a press briefing in Berlin.After initially prioritizing the elderly and people at greater risk, Germany opened up immunization to all adults as well as children as young as 12 earlier this month. The step was facilitated by more deliveries of vaccines, especially from Mainz-based BioNTech SE.Following struggles to control a third wave of the pandemic, Germany has been easing lockdown measures amid declining infections. The country on Friday reported 10.3 cases per 100,000 people over the previous seven days. The figure had peaked at almost 170 in late April.The Economy Ministry said Monday that progress in vaccinations and the accompanying decline in infections will help spur Germany’s revival in coming months after a 1.8% contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter.“Signs of recovery are increasing,” the ministry said, citing an improving climate in both manufacturing and services. “The German economy is gradually overcoming the third wave and there is a spirit of optimism,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-half-of-germany-s-population-vaccinated-with-first-dose-101624004949565.html
18-06-2021||World||Canada: mRNA Covid-19 vaccines preferred choice for both jabs||Canadian health authorities have announced fresh guidelines stating that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are now the “preferred” jabs for both the first and second dose even if the first was administered using AstraZeneca (AZ), which is manufactured in India under the Covishield brand name.These were among the updated recommendations issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI).In its recommendations, NACI said the mRNA vaccines should be preferred unless “is inaccessible or there is a contraindication, for example, an allergy to an mRNA vaccine or its components”. Only in the latter circumstances should a viral vector vaccine, like AZ, be offered.It also endorsed vaccine interchangeability, basically that doses can now be mixed with those receiving the first dose of AZ now being given the second dose as an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.NACI said that “emerging evidence” from studies in Germany have suggested a “potentially better immune response, including against variants of concern, when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine”. Similarly, it said, evidence suggested that such mixing “has a good safety profile”.However, those who received their first jab of AZ can still opt for the same to complete the vaccination series. “Getting two doses of the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine provide good protection against Covid-19 disease,” NACI said.“NACI is also recommending that for anyone who received a first dose of AstraZeneca/Covishield, an mRNA vaccine is now preferred for the second dose. Since NACI first looked at mixed vaccine schedules, new evidence is starting to emerge suggesting immune responses are better when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by an mRNA vaccine as a second dose,” NACI chairperson Dr Shelley Deeks said.These announcements have followed continued concern over a rare side-effect of the AZ vaccine, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT, which can lead to blood clotting with low platelet counts, and can sometimes prove fatal if not treated in time.However, adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines are also being looked at as NACI said rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining) following such vaccination “have been reported in Canada and internationally, including in Israel and the United States”.“No clear association between myocarditis/pericarditis and mRNA Covid-19 vaccines has been established in Canada. This may change as more evidence emerges and Canada administers more second doses of mRNA vaccines,” the NACI added, though it also said cases have so far been “mild and resolved with medical treatment”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-preferred-choice-for-both-jabs-101624004964318.html

It passed 169 votes in favour and 151 against, mainly from the ruling Liberal Party members, according to Global News.The motion said that “given that the Minister of National Defence has clearly lost the respect of members of the Canadian Armed Forces, including those at the highest ranks, for”, amongst other things, “engaging in a cover-up of sexual misconduct allegations in the Canadian Armed Forces”, the House “formally censures the Minister of National Defence to express the disappointment of the House of Commons in his conduct”. The CTV News reported that in his response, Sajjan accused the motion of being little more than an “attempt to wage personal and partisan attacks”.Earlier, leader of the opposition Erin O’Toole said, that Sajjan had “clearly lost the respect of members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and the moral authority to implement the changes needed to eliminate sexual misconduct in our military”.Speaking in the House of Commons this week, O’Toole said the military was “literally falling apart” under Sajjan’s watch and he should “do the honourable thing and resign” or, alternately Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should fire him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-house-of-commons-censures-defence-minister-101624003104327.html

The new Covid-19 variant, which was first detected in August last year, accounts for around 81% of the cases reported since April in the country, according to WHO. Moreover, the Lambda Covid-19 variant is now prevalent in as many as 29 countries, most notably in South America where it is believed to have originated.According to a report by Xinhua news agency citing World Health Organization officials, the Lambda Covid-19 variant has been dubbed a global 'variant of interest' due to its elevated presence in South America.The variant was also reported in countries like Chile, where it accounts for 32% of all submitted sequences in the preceding 60 days. The Lambda variant was also reported in neighbouring countries in South America, such as Argentina and Ecuador. WHO suspects mutations present in the Lambda Covid-19 variant might show increased transmission and resistance to antibodies.Meanwhile, the Delta Covid-19 variant, first identified in India, was classified as a "variant of concern" by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this week. Previously, the Delhi Covid-19 strain was only considered a "variant of interest" by the US CDC, but its status was changed to a "variant of concern" after assessing the Delta variant's high transmissibility, among other factors. Along with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19, a few other variants circulating in the United States have also been classified as 'variants of concern', a CDC statement published on Tuesday read. These include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) Covid-19 variants.The Delta variant, which was dubbed a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 10, accounts for around 9.9% of all Covid-19 cases in the United States, the CDC estimates. However, to date, no variants of high consequence have been identified in the country, the public health body explained in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lambda-covid-19-strain-who-finds-new-variant-of-interest-in-south-america-101623989602402.html

The current president, Hassan Rouhani, is widely supported but is forbidden under the constitution from serving a third four-year term. That he might be succeeded by Khamenei's conservative ally fueling public apathy and sparking calls for a boycott in the Islamic Republic, reported the Associated Press.Also Read: Iran presidential election today, likely to be won by hardline judgeIran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cast the first vote just after 7am (0230 GMT) at a specially installed ballot box at a mosque adjoining his offices in the capital, according to updates provided by the news agency AFP. He then urged Iran's nearly 60 million eligible voters to follow suit, saying: "The sooner you perform this task and duty, the better. Everything that the Iranian people do today until tonight, by going to the polls and voting, serves to build their future."Polls close at midnight (1930 GMT), and possibly two hours later, with results expected around noon Saturday.What a potential Raisi win means for IranKhamenei's ally, Ebrahim Raisi, is seen as the dominant front-runner in a field of just four candidates. If elected, he would be the first serving Iranian president sanctioned by the US government even before entering office over his involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988, as well as his time as the head of Iran’s internationally criticized judiciary — one of the world’s top executioners.It also would firmly put hard-liners in control across the Iranian government as negotiations in Vienna continue over trying to save Tehran’s tattered nuclear deal with world powers as it enriches uranium to the closest point yet to weapons-grade levels. Tensions remain high with both the U.S. and Israel, which is believed to have carried out a series of attacks targeting Iranian nuclear sites and assassinating the scientist who created its military atomic program decades earlier.Iran's nuclear deal and the ultraconservative campOutgoing president Hassan Rouhani's key achievement was the landmark 2015 deal with world powers under which Iran pledged to limit its nuclear programme and refrain from acquiring the atomic bomb in return for sanctions relief. But high hopes for greater prosperity and a reopening to the world were crushed in 2018 when then-US President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord and launched an economic and diplomatic "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.As old and new US sanctions hit Iran, trade dried up and foreign companies bolted. The economy nosedived and spiralling prices fuelled repeated bouts of social unrest which were put down by security forces.Iran's ultraconservative camp -- which deeply distrusts the United States, labelled the "Great Satan" or the "Global Arrogance" in the Islamic republic -- attacked Rouhani over the failing deal. They swept parliament early last year and now look set to claim the presidency in the nationwide poll that will also elect municipal and other officials.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-votes-for-new-president-with-an-eye-on-nuclear-deal-hardliner-cleric-tipped-to-win-101623985235967.html
18-06-2021||World||US embassy in Afghanistan goes into lockdown amid Covid-19 spike||The US Embassy in Afghanistan ordered a near-complete lockdown Thursday because of a massive spike in coronavirus cases among employees.Already on uncertain footing due to the imminent withdrawal of American forces from the country, the embassy in Kabul ordered remaining staffers into virtual isolation to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has already killed at least one person, sent 114 into quarantine and forced several people to be medically evacuated.The embassy said in a notice to employees that almost all group activities, including work meetings and recreational gatherings, are banned because intensive care units at military medical facilities in Afghanistan are at full capacity and the number of cases has forced it to establish temporary Covid-19 wards to care for patients requiring oxygen.It said the restrictions would remain in place until the chain of transmission is broken. Violators will be removed from the country on the next available flight. The notice said 95% of the cases involved people who have not been vaccinated or fully vaccinated against the virus and urged all staff to take advantage of available vaccines at the embassy.“We must break the chain of transmission to protect one another and ensure the mission’s ability to carry out the nation’s business,” the acting U.S. ambassador, Ross Wilson, said in the notice. “Restrictions will continue until the chain of transmission is broken.”“We are all in this together and rely on your cooperation during this difficult time,” he said. “We can only return to normal operations with the cooperation of everyone.”The restrictions confine all personnel at the Kabul embassy to their living quarters except to get food alone or to exercise or relax outside by themselves. This requirement bans all sports and means personnel must stay at least 20 feet from others unless they are wearing a mask.The announcement was distributed to journalists and others by the American Foreign Service Association, the union that represents US diplomats.“At a time when the US military withdrawal is accelerating, attacks on Afghan and coalition forces are intensifying and the US is seeking to establish a stable and positive presence in Afghanistan after the withdrawal, the damage to our national security and national interests is potentially grave,” the association said of the outbreak.It also issued a call for the Biden administration to require all staffers at all US embassies and consulates abroad to be vaccinated against Covid-19 as a condition of their employment.The State Department acknowledged that Afghanistan is suffering an “intense third wave of Covid-19 cases” and that the embassy had “adjusted" operations to deal with an outbreak among employees for health and safety reason but declined to discuss specifics.Spokesman Ned Price told reporters that vaccines are available to all staffers and encouraged, but said there was no current requirement to be vaccinated.Staffing levels at the Kabul embassy have already been significantly reduced pending the completion of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan, which President Joe Biden has ordered to be complete by the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.All personnel who had jobs that did not require their physical presence at the embassy had been sent to other locations to telework in April shortly after Biden's announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-afghanistan-goes-into-lockdown-amid-covid-19-spike-101623979314858.html
18-06-2021||World||Iran presidential election today, likely to be won by hardline judge||Iranians choose a president on Friday in a contest likely to be won by a judge fiercely loyal to the religious establishment, although large numbers of people are expected to ignore the vote due to discontent with economic hardship and hardline rule.With uncertainty surrounding Iran's efforts to revive its 2015 nuclear deal, and growing poverty at home after years of US sanctions, voter turnout is seen by Iranian analysts as a referendum on the leadership's handling of an array of crises.Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, 60, a close ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is favourite to succeed the incumbent Hassan Rouhani, forbidden under the constitution from serving a third four-year term.A win for the Shi'ite cleric would confirm the political demise of pragmatist politicians like Rouhani, weakened by Washington’s decision to quit the nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions in a move that stifled rapprochement with the West.But it would not disrupt Iran's bid to revive the agreement and break free of tough oil and financial sanctions, Iranian officials say, with the country's ruling clerics aware their political fortunes rely on tackling worsening economic hardship."Raisi's main challenge will be the economy. Eruption of protests will be inevitable if he fails to heal the nation's economic pain," said a government official.Khamenei on Wednesday appealed for a large turnout, saying such a show of strength would reduce foreign pressure on the Islamic Republic.Official opinion polls suggest turnout could be as low as 41%, significantly lower than in past elections.ProtestsUnder pressure over rising inflation and joblessness, the clerical leadership needs a high vote count to boost its legitimacy, damaged after a series of protests against poverty and political restrictions across Iran since 2017.Raisi's main rival is a pragmatist technocrat, former central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati, who says a win for any hardliner will result in yet more sanctions imposed by outside powers. Iran could hold talks with longtime arch-foe the United States if Washington adhered to "positive coexistence" with Tehran, he said in the election campaign.Raisi has crucial backing from Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful institution which over the years has opposed reformist initiatives, overseen the suppression of protests, and used proxy forces to assert Iran's regional influence.The mid-ranking cleric says he backs Iran's talks with six major powers to revive the nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions.But Raisi, who shares Khamenei's suspicion of detente with the West, says only a powerful government can implement any revival of the pact.Accused by critics of human rights abuses stretching back decades -- allegations his defenders deny -- Raisi was appointed by Khamenei to the high-profile job of judiciary chief in 2019.A few months later, the United States sanctioned him for human rights violations, including the executions of political prisoners in the 1980s and the suppression of unrest in 2009, events in which he played a part, according to human rights groups.Iran has never acknowledged the mass executions, and Raisi himself has never publicly addressed allegations about his role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-presidential-election-today-likely-to-be-won-by-hardline-judge-101623979060114.html

18-06-2021||World||Juneteenth, now a federal holiday, marks end of slavery in the US. Here's all you need to know||Juneteenth, a new federal holiday on June 19 that commemorates the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans in the United States, was authorised by US president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris on Thursday. "Juneteenth marks both a long hard night of slavery subjugation and a promise of a brighter morning to come," Biden said after signing the federal holiday bill into law, "The day is a reminder of the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take."Also Read: US Congress declares holiday for Juneteenth, marking end of slaveryJuneteenth will be the eleventh federally recognised holiday in the US, coming nearly four decades after the last one which honoured American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, reported news agency Reuters. The bill to recognise June 19 as the Juneteenth federal holiday was backed by both the Democrats as well as several of the Republicans in the US Congress, the agency added. It received overwhelming support at the US House of Representatives on Wednesday, after clearing the Senate unanimously.Juneteenth on June 19: History and significanceSlavery in the United States carries a long and painful history. European colonists first forcibly brought enslaved Africans by ship to the British colonies that became the United States in the 1600s; millions of people were legally owned there until the 13th Amendment passed in 1865.June 19 was chosen for the Juneteenth federal holiday since it marks, in many ways, the freedom for enslaved Black Americans in one of the most remote slave states in the US following the American Civil War. On this day in 1865, Union Army general Gordon Granger informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they had been freed two and a half years prior by the order of the then US President Abraham Lincoln.Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 during the Civil War had officially outlawed slavery in all the states which had rebelled against the Union, including Texas. However, the enforcement of the proclamation was slow and more often than not depended on the advancement of Union troops. News reached particularly late in the slave states, where the presence of Union troops was low, and Texas was one of the most of these states which had seen an expansion of slavery in the years prior. Thus, June 19, 1865, is seen as the day when the light of emancipation reached even the darkest of depths in the United States.Juneteenth: Reception in the US"Great nations don't ignore their most painful moments... they embrace them," US president Joe Biden told a room filled with about 80 members of Congress, moments after signing the bill into law that recognised Juneteenth as a federal holiday. Other community leaders and activists, including 94-year-old Opal Lee, who campaigned for decades to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, were also present in the room.Also Read: US President Joe Biden to honour the forgotten victims of Tulsa race massacreUS vice-president Kamala Harris acknowledged that the White House, the seat of power of the US government, is a "house built by enslaved people". She said that the holiday would be an occasion to "reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to action."In the Republican camp, there were several who backed the Juneteenth bill in Congress, while others opposed it and said that declaring a separate holiday for Juneteenth would "needly confuse or divide Americans".However, while celebrities and politicians commemorate the declaration of Juneteenth as a federally recognised holiday, there are some who express apprehension regarding the same. "It's important to commemorate emancipation and to encourage everyday Americans to reckon with the history of slavery... but there is always a danger with these sort of things so they can be performative," Reuters quoted Matthew Delmont, a professor of history at Dartmouth College who specializes in African-American history and civil rights. He said that Juneteenth might just, unfortunately, turn out to be a "failure" if its purpose remains limited only as a date in the calendar, without translating to any meaningful legal action on police brutality on Black Americans, voting rights, and the racial wealth gap in the US.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/juneteenth-june-19-federal-holiday-joe-biden-united-states-america-slavery-all-you-need-to-know-101623973313572.html
18-06-2021||World||Trump says India devastated by Covid-19, China must pay for its spread||Donald Trump, the former US president, has said India has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and called for China to pay $10 trillion to the United States for allegedly being responsible for the spread of Covid-19 across the world. Trump has been blaming China for the coronavirus pandemic and said that Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.“Look at what's going on in India now. You know, they used to say, look how well India was doing, because they were always looking for an excuse -- look how well India is doing. The fact that India has just been devastated now, and virtually, every country has been devastated,” Trump said, according to news agency PTI.Also Read | ‘Everyone, so-called enemy’ saying I was right about coronavirus’ origin in Wuhan: Donald TrumpIndia battled the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April overwhelming the health infrastructure in most states with hospitals reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. However, the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths have come down in the past few weeks in June.Trump said China should pay more as compensation to the world. “The number (compensation) is much higher than that. But there's only so much they can pay. And that's to us (United States). The number is bigger throughout the world. Look, countries have been destroyed over what they did, and whether by accident or not. And I would hope that it was an accident. I hope that it was through incompetence or an accident,” Trump said in response to a question.Also read | Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claims“But, when you look, whether it was by an accident, whether it was -- whatever it is, this -- you look at these countries. They will never, ever be the same. Our country was hit so hard. But other countries were hit much harder,” he said as he went on to cite India, which is currently experiencing the worst ever public health crisis.“I think that's one of the reasons that I feel it's very important to find out where it came from, how it came. I think I know. I mean, I feel certain about it. But certainly, China should help. Right now, their economy and our economy are the two economies that are coming back the fastest,” he argued.The origin of the coronavirus pandemic has become a source of political tension between China and the US, with much of the recent focus on the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan where the outbreak was first identified in late 2019. China has been criticised for its lack of transparency when it comes to disclosing data about early cases as well as the viruses studied at WIV.Also read | What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probeAccording to a joint study published in March by China-World Health Organization (WHO), Covid-19 most likely originated in the country's wildlife trade, with the virus passing into humans from bats via an intermediary species. But China has said that Covid-19 entered the country from overseas via contaminated frozen food, while a number of foreign politicians are also calling for more investigations into the possibility it leaked from a laboratory.The chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zeng Guang, told state-owned tabloid the Global Times that attention should shift to the United States, which was slow to test people in the early stages of the outbreak, and is also the home of many biological laboratories. "All bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny," he was quoted as saying by the Global Times.According to the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker on Thursday, the number of coronavirus disease cases globally stands at 177,136,569 and 3,835,123 people have died from it.(With PTi inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-india-devastated-by-covid-19-china-must-pay-for-its-spread-101623975069857.html
