McAfee had said he would call her in his last call, the widow has said.John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software, was found dead in his cell in a jail near Barcelona, a government official confirmed on Wednesday.The Spanish authorities have rushed to swiftly conduct the autopsy on McAfee's body. However, the officials maintain that everything found at the scene of death points to death by suicide.“His last words to me were 'I love you and I will call you in the evening,'” Janice McAfee said shortly after she recovered her late husband's belongings outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona.“Those words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,” Janice said. The widow of the 75-year-old has sought a “thorough investigation” in her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur's death.Embroiled in a tax evasion controversy, McAfee was arrested last year in October from the Barcelona airport on a warrant issued by Tennessee prosecutors who were pushing for a software master's imprisonment for 30 years on the alleged charges of tax evasion running to more than $4 million in taxes.McAfee's death came a day before the Spain National Court had announced its decision to extradite him to the US, which would have resulted in criminal proceedings against him. However, the decision of the court was not final.Tennessee prosecutors charged 75-year-old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.Janice has alleged that McAfee's death is a result of politically motivated charges. “We had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,” the 38-year-old Janice McAfee told reporters. “I blame the US authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.”Authorities have said McAfee's autopsy could take "days or weeks".The couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee met Janice in 2012 in Miami. The two formalised their relationship into a marriage and had several children from previous relationships, Janice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-last-words-to-me-were-i-love-you-mcafee-was-not-suicidal-says-widow-101624634874202.html

China defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said that China believes in its complete reunification and expressed Beijing’s opposition towards Washington-Taipei military ties.Guoqiang said that China remains firmly opposed to any official exchanges or military contacts between the US and Taiwan and asked Washington to ‘sever all military ties with Taiwan’.“The complete reunification of China is a historical necessity and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is an unstoppable trend. The common aspirations of the people are peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence’ is a dead-end road and seeking it means war,” the statement quoting Guoqiang said.Guoqiang reminded the US to fully understand China’s development and growth by external focus and asked the US to abide by the one-China principle. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has recently ramped up political and military pressure.Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu said that the nation needs to prepare for a possible military conflict due to China’s increasing intimidation tactics. Taiwan reported several incursions into its airspace by Chinese warplanes. Guoqiang also said that the People Liberation Army (PLA) dispatched multi-type aircrafts to conduct exercises in the Taiwan Strait. He highlighted that the move was necessary in response to the current situation across the Taiwan Strait and China’s need to safeguard its sovereignty. In retaliation, the US stepped up its support to Taipei.The G7 leaders issued a statement earlier condemning Beijing over its human rights abuses and highlighted the need for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The US navy continues to conduct transits through the Taiwan Strait on a monthly basis.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-means-war-china-warns-us-over-military-ties-with-taipei-101624636053348.html

Pakistan has also failed to adequately investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups, the FATF observed.Despite its efforts to get out of the list, Pakistan has been on the watchdog's list for three years now. A primary reason why Pakistan has not been able to spare the global scrutiny is that it has not tackled the money laundering and terror financing flagged by the FATF.Landing on the 'grey list' for 3 years now, Pakistan will continue to not get any respite in accessing finances in the form of investments and aid from international bodies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Here is what Pakistan should do in order to drop its name from FATF list:-Pakistan, as it suggested, has to implement its plans to investigate and prosecute leaders and commanders of all the eight terror groups that have been named by FATF in the past – the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.Pakistan was asked by the global watchdog in October to deliver on all 27 points by this February but the country was not taken off the FATF list.According to an Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab, Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF' decision to thrice place the country on its grey list since 2008, reported ANI.The grey-listing events of Pakistan from 2008 to 2019 has resulted in total GDP losses worth USD $38 billion, the report "Bearing the cost of global politics -- the impact of FATF grey-listing on Pakistan's economy" said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-pakistan-should-do-to-get-off-the-fatf-list-10-points-101624623876849.html

Hancock has however dismissed talks of his resignation, reported Bloomberg.“I accept that I breached the social-distancing guidance in these circumstances,” Hancock said in an official statement.“I have let people down and am very sorry,” he added.A British tabloid published images of Hancock and Coladangelo embracing in the Department of Health’s London headquarter from May 6, while a deadly mutant strain of the virus was going around. The UK government relaxed lockdown norms allowing intimate contact from members outside one’s own household from May 17.The images, which have since been circulated widely on social media, appear to be screenshots of grainy CCTV footage, depicting Hancock and his aide in a close embrace. The opposition Labour Party raised questions about appointment processes in the government and the use of taxpayer’s money in ruminating government personnel, after reports emerged of Coladangelo being paid 15,000 pounds a year for her role as the non-executive director at the department of health.“Today’s revelations about the Health Secretary raise serious questions about the use of taxpayers’ money, appointment processes and why yet again Covid guidance was broken,” tweeted chair of the labour party Anneliese Dodds“Matt Hancock’s position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him,” she added.Hancock said he’s focusing on working on getting the UK ”out of the ongoing pandemic” and asked for privacy for himself and his family while dealing with a personal matter. “I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter,” said the statement released by his office.Hancock has repeatedly come under fire for his handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to have referred to Hancock as “hopeless” to his ex-advisor Dominic Cummings. The health secretary who heads the National health service has also been accused of rewarding contracts to firms he owned shares in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-secretary-apologises-for-breaking-covid-19-norms-after-pictures-of-embracing-aide-emerge-101624625925667.html
25-06-2021||World||Pakistan remains on FATF’s grey list||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to adequately investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups. The decision was announced at the conclusion of the multilateral watchdog’s five-day virtual plenary meeting under the German presidency of Marcus Pleyer. However, FATF noted that Pakistan had completed all but one of the 27 items in the action plan drawn up for the country to tackle money laundering and terror financing when it was placed in the list of nations under increased monitoring or the grey list in 2018. “The FATF encourages Pakistan to continue to make progress to address as soon as possible the one remaining CFT (counter-terrorist financing)-related item by demonstrating that TF (terrorist financing) investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN designated terrorist groups,” the body said in an announcement. Experts pointed out the sole remaining action item was significant as Pakistan has given few indications that it plans to investigate and prosecute leaders and commanders of all the eight terror groups that have been named by FATF in the past – the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Also Read | As part of SCO framework: India proposes plan against Pak terror groupsSo far, Pakistani authorities have only investigated and prosecuted senior leaders of the LeT and JuD, including LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and several of his senior aides. Saeed and a few of his aides are currently serving sentences given to them after they were found guilty in a string of terror financing cases last year. However, no action has been taken against leaders of the JeM, such as its chief Masood Azhar, despite the group being linked to several high-profile terror attacks in recent years, or the Afghan Taliban, which has stepped up fund raising on Pakistani soil in recent weeks against the backdrop of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan. FATF said Pakistan should continue addressing “strategically important” deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes by enhancing international cooperation by amending the country’s mutual legal assistance (MLA) law and demonstrating that assistance is being sought from foreign countries in implementing designations under UN Security Council resolution 1373. Pakistan should also demonstrate that “supervisors are conducting both on-site and off-site supervision commensurate with specific risks associated with DNFBPs (designated non-financial businesses and professions), including by applying appropriate sanctions where necessary” and that “proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are applied consistently to all legal persons and legal arrangements for non-compliance with beneficial ownership requirements”, the watchdog said. FATF said Pakistan must also demonstrate an increase in money laundering investigations and prosecutions, and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with the country’s risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze and confiscate assets, and that DNFBPs are being monitored for “compliance with proliferation financing requirements and that sanctions are being imposed for non-compliance”. The watchdog noted that “Pakistan’s continued political commitment has led to significant progress across a comprehensive CFT action plan”. FATF recognised Pakistan’s progress and noted that since February this year, the country “has made progress to complete two of the three remaining action items on demonstrating that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are imposed for TF convictions and that Pakistan’s targeted financial sanctions regime was being used effectively to targeted terrorist assets”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-on-fatf-s-grey-list-101624624315404.html

The Trump administration, however, filed several charges against Assange, and in 2019, charges against him were expanded to include espionage, punishable by a total of 175 years in prison. As of February, the US Justice Department continued to seek his extradition from the UK.Moris, who is a lawyer by profession, stated that Biden has to stop prosecuting Assange if the US wants to be known for defending global press freedom."They can't maintain this prosecution against Julian while saying that they defend a global press freedom." Moris told ReutersAlso Read: After John McAfee's death, Edward Snowden has a warning for Julian AssangeMoris has also urged the UK government to press the Biden administration to drop its call for extradition, stating that Assange would not survive being imprisoned in the US. "I think there's no doubt that Julian wouldn't survive an extradition,"Moris and Assange met during his time at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum for almost seven years. They share two children together. After Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno withdrew his country’s support Assange was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police in 2019 and he has been detained at Belmarsh ever since.Concerns for Assange’s well-being should he be extradited has mounted since antivirus mogul John McAfee died by apparent suicide in a prison in Barcelona. McAfee is said to have taken the extreme step following news of his extradition to the US on tax evasion charges.President Biden had referred to Assange as a “high-tech terrorist” in 2010, during his tenure as the vice president in the Obama administration.

25-06-2021||World||Airlines frustrated with 'uncertainty' over UK's plans to ease travel restrictions||Airlines and holiday providers on Friday expressed frustration with the UK's plans to ease travel restrictions, saying uncertainty about how and when the new rules will be implemented make it difficult for people to book summer vacations.The government on Thursday expanded its “green list” of safe travel destinations, allowing people to visit without having to self-isolate for 10 days after returning to Britain. However, all but one of the new additions were also placed on a watchlist, meaning the quarantine requirement may be re-imposed at short notice.Transportation authorities also said they intend to relax travel restrictions by allowing fully vaccinated travelers to visit higher-risk destinations, including the U.S. and most of the European Union, without having to self-isolate. They expect to implement this change “later in the summer.”“The UK has already fallen behind the EU's reopening, and a continued overly cautious approach will further impact economic recovery and the 500,000 U.K. jobs that are at stake,” said Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, which offers mainly long-haul flights to destinations such as New York, Los Angeles and Barbados.Airlines and hospitality companies have pressured the government to ease travel restrictions imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19 following the U.K.'s successful vaccination program. The pandemic has devastated Britain's travel industry, with the number of people flying through London's Heathrow Airport, the nation's busiest, plunging 73% last year.The government has created a traffic light system to manage the reopening of air travel. Destinations with low levels of COVID-19 and high levels of vaccination are placed on the “green list,” which allows pleasure trips and doesn't require self-isolation on return to Britain. Only essential travel is permitted to “amber list” countries, but travelers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return home. The government has banned most travel to destinations on the “red list,” and anyone arriving from one of these countries faces a 10-day quarantine in a government-approved hotel at their own expense.The lists are updated every three weeks.The Department for Transport said Thursday night that the expansion of the green list and plans to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated travelers were the result of the successful vaccination program. Almost 61% of U.K. adults are fully vaccinated, and 83% have received at least one dose.But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said caution was still required.“It won't be quite like it was in 2019 and the old days, but we are moving in a positive direction,” Shapps told Sky News.Public health authorities are concerned about the possibility that travelers may spread potentially more dangerous variants of COVID-19 to the U.K. from countries with low vaccination rates. The delta variant, first identified in India, has already become the dominant version of the virus in Britain.Regardless of U.K. policy, officials in the European Union are considering imposing a quarantine on British travellers because of their concerns about the delta variant which is 40% to 60% more transmissible than previous versions of COVID-19. In minutes released from government meetings earlier this month, experts said the delta variant also may be linked to a higher risk of hospitalization, although “numbers are still small” and there is no evidence the variant is more deadly.Diana Holland, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said the government needs to change its approach to provide greater certainty for the travel industry and consumers.“The traffic light system is simply not fit for purpose,” she said. “It is impossible for a multibillion-pound industry to make plans for the future when the rug can be pulled from under them every three weeks.”The government on Thursday added more than a dozen countries and territories to its green list, including the popular holiday destinations of Malta, Madeira and the Balearic Islands. All of the destinations except Malta were placed the watch list.The changes, which take effect at 4 a.m. June 30, will expand the green list to 27 countries and territories.The newly added countries are: Malta, Madeira, the Balearic Islands, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada.Britain also added six countries to the red list, including the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Uganda. That brings the number of countries covered to 56.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-frustrated-over-uncertainty-with-uk-s-plans-to-ease-travel-restrictions-101624619979594.html
25-06-2021||World||Covid-19 may have been spreading in China since Oct-Nov 2019: New study||The coronavirus linked to Covid-19 may have been spreading in China as early as October 2019, a new study has found, pushing the date back by weeks before the first case was officially identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Officially, the first Covid-19 case is said to have been identified on December 8 and linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market.But, the new study by researchers from Britain’s University of Kent pins the most likely date on November 17, saying that it had spread globally by January, 2020.The paper was published on June 24 on the PLOS Pathogens journal.“Our results suggest that the virus emerged in China in early October to mid-November, 2019 (the most likely date being November 17), and by January, 2020, had spread globally,” the researchers said, adding that it suggests a much earlier and more rapid spread than is evident from confirmed cases.The research estimates that the virus spread beyond China by January 2020 with the estimated first case being in Japan on January 3, 2020 and followed by Thailand on January 7, 2020.The researchers added that the virus is likely to have left eastern Asia and arrived in Europe, with an estimated first case on January 12, 2020 in Spain; South Korea is next on the list where the virus appeared on January 14.Following the spread to Europe, the virus appears to have spread to North America with an estimated first case being in the United States on January 16, making it the fifth country, the research suggests.China has maintained that it has shared all relevant data on the origin of the Covid-19 virus during the investigation conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Chinese foreign ministry has been on a diplomatic overdrive suggesting that WHO should investigate the origin in other countries including in the US.“After the outbreak of the pandemic, China took the lead to support the WHO in conducting research on origin-tracing on a global scale…Experts on both sides jointly made field trips, analysed a large number of statistics, issued an authoritative study report, and reached many significant conclusions. This joint study actively promoted the origin-tracing globally,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in May.Doubts over the origin, however, remain, and new studies have raised new questions.In a paper released on a preprint platform this week, Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle recovered deleted sequencing data from early Covid-19 cases in China.“The data showed that samples taken from the Huanan market were “not representative” of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of a progenitor sequence circulating earlier, which spread to other parts of China,” Reuters reported in a story.“Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how COVID-19 began in Wuhan?” said Alina Chan, a researcher with Harvard’s Broad Institute, writing on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-may-have-been-spreading-in-china-since-oct-nov-2019-new-study-101624617894574.html
25-06-2021||World||Hong Kong: Ex-cop John Lee named No 2 official as China fortifies security||China is prioritising security in all its recent legal and political overhaul in Hong Kong, as is once again apparent in a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday which saw security secretary John Lee - former long-time police officer -- being appointed to the city’s No. 2 spot. According to political commentators, this is just the latest in a series of steps that Beijing is taking to crack down on the city's pro-democracy protests, a measure that is essential to the Chinese ruling party's long-term plans for the Asian financial center.Security Secretary John Lee -- a former long-time police official -- has been promoted to the chief secretary for administration, Hong Kong’s top official, Carrie Lam, told a news conference Friday alongside Lee and other security officials receiving promotions. China’s cabinet approved the appointments Wednesday, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The next day a campaign led by Lee forced Apple Daily, the city’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, to shut down.Lee, 63, will replace Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, and Police Commissioner Chris Tang, 55, move into the security secretary’s role. Raymond Siu, 55, a deputy police commissioner who joined the force in 1988, will take over Tang’s position at the law enforcement agency.David Webb, a prominent Hong Kong investor who has put funds into Apple Daily’s parent, Next Digital Ltd., said the government missed an opportunity to appoint a stronger team to repair the financial hub’s battered economy. “Instead, Hong Kong is starting to look more like a police state, with the No. 2 positions now being filled by a hardliner whose recent achievement is to cripple a newspaper,” Webb said in a text message.China has carried out an unprecedented campaign to curb dissent in Hong Kong, led by national security legislation handed down on June 30 last year in response to a wave of unrest. The closure of Apple Daily, which was under pressure after Lee used the security law to freeze the company’s assets as part of the city’s prosecution of company founder Jimmy Lai, represented one of the biggest blows yet to the local democracy movement.The U.K. and the U.S. condemned the newspaper’s closure, with President Joe Biden calling it a “sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world.” Lee, one of several Hong Kong officials sanctioned by the Trump administration for their role in implementing the security law, has been a vocal proponent of the legislation.“The relevant remarks by the U.S. politician are totally groundless,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday at a regular briefing in Beijing, without directly naming Biden.“The law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong focuses on cracking down on a handful of anti-China, destabilizing forces who seriously endanger national security,” Zhao said. “The law protects the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the vast majority of Hong Kong residents, including press freedom.”The new team will be charged with overseeing a series of elections in the coming months under a Beijing-led revamp that, among other things, created a panel to vet candidates for “patriotism.” Lam, who hasn’t yet said whether she’ll see a second term when her first expires next year, has also been tasked by Beijing to pass local legislation expanding the city’s powers to police national security.“Because the government is going through the enforcement stage of the national security law, I won’t be surprised if the government wants to put people well versed with law enforcement in senior positions,” Regina Ip, who served as the city’s security secretary two decades ago and is a current member of the Executive Council that advises Hong Kong’s leader, told Bloomberg Television before the formal announcement.The chief secretary’s post has been a springboard to higher office: two of the city’s four chief executives since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 first served in the role. The appointment of a law-enforcement officer to the top administrative post, marked a shift for the former British colony, which has long been dominated by career civil servants like Lam.“There is definitely no change in the role and responsibility of the chief secretary,” Lam told reporters Friday. “The mere fact that a particular candidate is coming from a particular background doesn’t mean that the job will fit him by asking him only to perform in an area that he is most familiar with. That’s not the situation.”Senior appointments are made at the recommendation of the Hong Kong government but need final approval from Beijing. Xinhua didn’t explain why the State Council, China’s cabinet, announced the appointment two days after it was approved.Lee has sought to broaden the scope of the security law by formally stating that police surveillance of communications comes under its scope, potentially giving the authorities broader powers to intercept the information.“The implementation of the security law turned Hong Kong from chaos to governance,” he said in the Friday morning news conference. “The ‘patriots-ruling-Hong Kong’ principle and improvement of the electoral system put an end to chaos and times of destruction, opening up a new chapter of development and effective governance.”In a press conference following the arrest of five top Apple Daily executives last week, Lee said residents must distance themselves from the suspects or “you will pay a hefty price.” He earlier warned that prominent Hong Kong activists who had fled overseas to evade the security law -- such as former politicians Nathan Law and Ted Hui -- would be pursued for life.Lee’s appointment “may be a proactive strategy to elicit loyalty from the police force,” said Dongshu Liu, an assistant professor of Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.“The police force has become much more important for maintaining social order and implementing the national security law,” Liu said. “You appoint someone who has been a policeman their entire career -- that’s a symbol of the increasing power of the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-ex-cop-john-lee-named-no-2-official-as-china-fortifies-security-101624609142090.html
25-06-2021||World||They are out there? US to release the most anticipated report on UFOs||The United States is set to release a landmark report on UFO sightings over the years. Though no specific date has been announced for the release of the report, local media outlets believe that it could be made public as soon as June 25. It was expected to be delivered by the end of June.The office of the director of National Intelligence will be releasing the report before Congress and it includes the work of a US navy-led task force established by the Pentagon in August 2020 to examine "unidentified aerial phenomena" (UAP) incidents. The Pentagon in recent years has confirmed the authenticity of several videos from naval aviators showing enigmatic "aerial phenomena" exhibiting speed and manoeuvrability, unknown to the usual human knowledge.The much-anticipated report will mark a turning point for the US military after decades of being dismissive of the observations of unidentified flying objects and "flying saucers." "We take reports of incursions into our airspace – by any aircraft, identified or unidentified – very seriously, and investigate each one," Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough said, according to Reuters.What to expect?On June 3, a report by the New York Times said that US intelligence officials have found no evidence that a series of unidentified aerial phenomena observed by the navy's aviators in recent years were alien spacecraft. The newspaper based its report on senior Biden administration officials, who were briefed ahead of the report's release.The report also found that the vast majority of more than 120 UAP incidents over the past two decades - many observed by personnel aboard US navy aircraft and warships - did not originate from any American military or other advanced government technology. The sightings remain unexplained and "have mystified scientists and the military," the officials said in the report.'Tic Tac' breath mintsA retired US navy lieutenant commander Alex Dietrich also recalled a sighting of UAP resembling large "Tic Tac" breath mints in 2004, according to Reuters. During a routine training mission with the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the southern California coast in November 2004, Dietrich and her then-commanding officer, fellow pilot David Fravor, were asked by another warship to investigate radar contacts in the area moving in an inexplicable fashion.Dietrich recalled that the oblong object lacked "any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion." Dietrich said she believes the episode was "analyzed in a professional, sober way" by the military chain of command after she and her colleagues were debriefed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-are-out-there-us-to-release-the-most-anticipated-report-on-ufos-101624607222370.html

Edward Snowden, the former NSA consultant and data privacy advocate, has tweeted that Julian Assange "could be next"."Europe should not extradite those accused of non-violent crimes to a court system so unfair - and prison system so cruel - that native-born defendants would rather die than become subject to it.

George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis sparked worldwide outrage against racial violence and triggered a massive "Black Lives Matter movement" in the country.The HCTF is investigating vandalism, discovered this morning, to the new George Floyd statue that was unveiled at 1545 Flatbush Ave. in Brooklyn @NYPD70Pct this past weekend. If you have any information, you are urged to DM @NYPDTips or call them @ 1-800-577-TIPS. pic.twitter.com/7e2vjbrr3DAccording to multiple reports by local media, black paint was thrown on the bust of Floyd. The group, considered to be a white right-wing hate group, also painted "PatriotsFront.Us" at the pedestal with white paint. It was discovered vandalised at around 7:20am local time.The New York Police said they are investigating the vandalism. "The HCTF is investigating vandalism, discovered this morning, to the new George Floyd statue that was unveiled at 1545 Flatbush Ave. in Brooklyn @NYPD70Pct this past weekend. If you have any information, you are urged to DM @NYPDTips or call them @ 1-800-577-TIPS," NYPD tweeted.A Democrat and New York City Council Member Farah Louis immediately condemned and called it a "shameful act" and "hate crime" in a statement on Thursday. Louis also asserted that the action will not deter "the efforts to achieve racial justice and equality." Louis also said that her office is working with the artist, Chris Carnabuci, to repair the damage.This came after police in Newark said that they are investigating the defacing of another Floyd bust at City Hall in New Jersey. This was vandalised overnight. The 700-pound bronze statue also had the name of the same hate group painted in white on the front.Floyd was killed last year by a police officer during an arrest. Derek Chauvin, one of four police officers who were at the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, while Floyd gasped for breath. A video of the incident recorded by a local teen triggered a huge outrage in the country after it went viral on social media. As he was dying, Floyd said "I can't breathe" which was used as a rallying cry during subsequent protests across the country and globally.The police officer was found guilty of murder in April this year by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-statues-vandalised-by-white-supremacist-group-101624592435736.html

"Results infer that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in early October to mid-November, and by January, had spread globally," a study by researchers of Britain's University of Kent said. "The model suggests a likely timing of the first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17," the research paper that was published in the PLOS Pathogens journal said.The study suggested a much earlier and more rapid spread of the contagion than is evident from the confirmed cases. This comes after a scientific paper released on Wednesday revealed that over a dozen of coronavirus test sequences that were obtained during the early months of the pandemic were deleted from an international database used to track the evolution of the virus.Also read | China deleted Covid data ‘gold mine’ in possible cover-up: StudyThe report was authored by Jesse Bloom, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.Critics reiterated that the deletion of the data from the international database shows China's further attempt to cover up the origin of Covid-19. "Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how Covid-19 began in Wuhan?" asked Alina Chan, a researcher with Harvard's Broad Institute, on Twitter. "That's the question you can answer for yourselves," Chan added.The first official case of Covid-19 in China was recorded to have occurred in December 2019 and was linked to Wuhan's Huanan seafood market. However, some early cases had shown no known connection with Huanan, implying that the virus was already circulating before it reached the market.The data in the report by Bloom showed that samples taken from the seafood market were " not representative" of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of the progenitor sequence that was in circulation earlier and spread to other parts of China.Moreover, a joint study published by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) in March-end also acknowledged that there could have been sporadic human infections prior to the Wuhan outbreak in December 2019.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-emerged-in-china-in-october-2019-study-101624585897030.html

The in-person extradition hearing of Tahawwur Rana, at the request of the Indian government, was held in the court of magistrate judge Jacqueline Chooljian in Los Angeles. Chooljian on Thursday ordered the defense attorneys and prosecutors to file additional documents by July 15.Rana, whose ankles were shackled, wore a white jumpsuit and black glasses, as well as a mask at the hearing, according to AP. Rana’s two daughters attended the hearing. They declined to comment, as did his lawyers.Also read | Biden admin urges US court to certify India's request to extradite Tahawwur RanaIndia alleges that Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley to assist the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba in the orchestration of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people, including six Americans, and injured more than 200.Prosecutors say Rana’s immigration law centre in Chicago, as well as a satellite office in Mumbai, was allegedly used as a front for their terrorism activities between 2006 and 2008. Rana’s attorneys said their client was not aware of Headley’s terrorism plot and was merely trying to help his childhood friend and set up a Mumbai business office.They also said Headley is a serial liar who has deceived the US government multiple times in several criminal cases and his testimony should not be viewed as credible. The attorneys alleged that Headley had used Rana to further his terrorism efforts without Rana’s knowledge.Also read | Will keep spotlight on epicentre of global terrorism: Jaishankar on 26/11 anniversaryHeadley, 60, was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. Rana has opposed his extradition to India, arguing that he has already been convicted by a US court in Chicago.US prosecutors, however, failed to prove that Rana had directly supported the Mumbai attacks. Rana’s defense attorneys, in court papers, say because he has been acquitted of the Mumbai-related charges in the US, extraditing him to India would be tantamount to double jeopardy.Ajmal Kasab was the only one of the 10 terrorists who survived and went on trial.

25-06-2021||World||Pakistan's Imran Khan under fire for remarks linking rape to women's attire||Pakistan' prime minister Imran Khan's controversial comments earlier this week, linking women's clothing choices to sexual violence, has erupted a sea of controversies in the country. Civil society groups and activists in Pakistan have cried out in outrage over the prime minister's remarks which pinned the blame for rape and sexual assault squarely on women themselves. Noting that these remarks are indicative of "victim-blaming", human rights campaigners have called for a public apology from the prime minister. Incidentally, the latest controversial remarks from Imran Khan are the second time in the last two months where he drew severe condemnation for reducing sexual violence to a mere act of 'temptation'.Also Read | 'Spoke with Bill Gates last night': Imran Khan on Pakistan’s polio eradication programmePakistan's prime minister Imran Khan, in an interview with Axios' on HBO earlier this week, said, "If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense." Khan also talked about the concept of 'purdah' - a religious and social practice of female seclusion in some orthodox Muslim communities - as a means to avoid 'temptation' in society."... I said the concept of 'purdah'. Avoid temptation in society. We don't have discos here, we don't have nightclubs. It is a completely different society way of life here. So if you raise temptation in society to a point -- all these young guys have nowhere to go --- it has a consequence in the society," he said.Decrying prime minister Imran Khan's comments linking women's attire to rape, as many as 16 civil society organisations in Pakistan demanded a public apology from him and said that it was an inexcusable statement from the head of government."We demand an immediate public apology from the Prime Minister and assurances that his highly flawed perception of how and why rape occurs does not inform the government's attempts to tackle what is a serious and prevalent crime in Pakistan," read a statement by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).Also Read | ‘Forced conversions, rapes of women daily occurrence in Pakistan’: India at UNHRCOther civil society organisations in Pakistan also voiced similar concerns at a press conference held in Karachi on Thursday and said that prime minister Imran Khan would do well to understand that rape is an act of power, not a lack of sexual control. In addition to HRCP, these groups include -- the Women's Action Forum, Tehrik-e-Niswan, Aurat March, the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research, and others."Even a cursory glance at the news should make it painfully clear that survivors of sexual violence can include women, girls, men, boys, and transgender persons--and that such acts can occur in schools, workplaces, homes, and public spaces. Gender, age and attire do not 'prevent' rape any more than the time of day or the relationship between survivor and perpetrator," the statement from the civil society groups added.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-imran-khan-under-fire-for-remarks-linking-women-s-attire-to-rape-101624578200899.html
25-06-2021||World||WHO estimates Covid vaccine boosters needed yearly for most vulnerable: Report||The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to Covid-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO's Covid-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.Vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its "indicative" baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document.A spokesperson for Gavi said COVAX was planning to take a wide range of scenarios into consideration.The document, which is dated June 8 and is still a "work in progress," also predicts under the base case that 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signalling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and "transition away from some technology platforms" as potential drags on supplies next year.It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world's largest volume of Covid-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.Worst case scenarioThe scenarios will be used to define the WHO's global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerges on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi's estimates.This gap could widen next year under the WHO's most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could once again push poorer nations to the back of the queue.In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-estimates-covid-vaccine-boosters-needed-yearly-for-most-vulnerable-report-101624561816418.html
