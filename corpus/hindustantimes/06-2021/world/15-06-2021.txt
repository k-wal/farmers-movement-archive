15-06-2021||World||Gunman kills 2, then self at Alabama fire hydrant factory||A worker killed two people and wounded two more at an Alabama fire hydrant factory early Tuesday before killing himself, police said.The shootings — which happened at about 2:30 a.m. at a Mueller Co. plant in Albertville — add to a slew of homicides around the country, and weren't even the worst of the morning. Several hours later, gunfire in Chicago claimed twice as many victims.In the Alabama case, a manhunt ended when the shooter's body was found inside a car in Guntersville, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from the factory, shortly after daybreak. Multiple weapons were found inside the vehicle, Albertville Police Chief Jamie Smith said at a news conference.Smith said the suspect appears to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What prompted him to kill and maim his coworkers wasn't immediately clear, the chief said. He called the shooting “completely unprovoked.”The chief identified the dead men as Michael Lee Dobbins and David Horton, and the shooter as Andreas Horton. He said they were not related, and had "no ties other than co-workers."Cody Windsor, a Mueller employee who was at home at the time, told the AP that he knew both Hortons, but also didn't know what might have prompted the shootings.Windsor said friends working the overnight shift told him the shooting happened in a part of the plant where fire hydrants and pipes are painted, and that an announcement about an active shooter was made over a PA system at the factory, which occupies several buildings over a large area near a railroad track, with fire hydrants stored on racks outside.Windsor said he and David Horton, a foundry helper who could do most any job in the plant, were buddies at work and often hung out together during breaks, he said. “We’d sit in our cars and listen to music,” he said. “Andy” Horton, Windsor said, was quiet and recently went through the death of his mother.“We work together and we bond together. We’re here as much as we are at home,” said Windsor. From now on, he said, he might be nervous “that somebody is going to walk in the door and shoot you.”Ann Walters told Al.com that Dobbins was her grandson, and that he had been working at the factory for nearly a year, saving up to buy a home and a car. “He was a perfect gentleman, everybody will tell you. He was good to everybody and put his family first,” she said.The chief read a statement from the company, which said “Mueller Water Products is shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific tragedy.”“Our entire focus is on the health and well being of our colleagues and we are committed to providing help and support to their families,” the company statement said.Mueller Co., based in Cleveland, Tennessee, is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Mueller Water Products Inc., which calls itself a leading maker of water distribution and measurement products in North America. More than 400 people work at the plant in Albertville, giving the city in northwest Alabama its nickname of “Fire Hydrant Capital of the World.”The growing gun violence nationwide has police and criminal justice experts concerned. Within hours of the Alabama gunfire Tuesday, four women were killed and four other people were wounded in a pre-dawn shooting at a home in Chicago, police said. The toll from this past weekend included two people killed and at least 30 others wounded in mass shootings in Chicago, the Texas capital of Austin, and Savannah, Georgia.Law officers had hoped that last year's spike in homicides would subside as the nation emerges from coronavirus restrictions, but they remain higher than they were in pre-pandemic times.“There was a hope this might simply be a statistical blip that would start to come down,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “That hasn’t happened. And that’s what really makes chiefs worry that we may be entering a new period where we will see a reversal of 20 years of declines in these crimes.”Albertville is a tight-knit community, and its people will come together to support the victims' families, city spokeswoman Robin Lathan said.“Everyone is absolutely heartbroken and devastated,” she said. “The Mueller Company is part of the lifeblood of who we are in the city of Albertville. It’s just a devastating blow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-2-then-self-at-alabama-fire-hydrant-factory-101623777721601.html

And now's not the time to let our guard down. Please get vaccinated as soon as possible."The massive vaccination campaign has been pushed by US health authorities since the authorization of the first vaccines in December, and peaked in April, with up to more than four million shots a day.But the pace has slowed rapidly since then, and unvaccinated people still remain vulnerable to the disease.Just over 52 percent of the US population, or 174 million people, have already received at least one dose of one of the three vaccines authorized in the country, according to health officials.Biden has set a goal of 70 percent of adults to have received at least one shot by the national holiday of July 4, but the program may fall short of that goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-cross-600-000-mark-johns-hopkins-101623776824315.html

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that 70% of adults in New York have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a threshold he said the state would celebrate by easing many of its remaining social distancing rules and shooting off fireworks.“What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,” Cuomo told an invitation-only crowd at the World Trade Center in Manhattan.Effective immediately, he said, the state is lifting rules that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow cleaning protocols or take people's temperatures or screen them for recent Covid-19 symptoms.Businesses will no longer have to follow social distancing rules, or limit how many people they can allow inside based on keeping people 6 feet (2 meters) apart.Some rules will remain: New Yorkers, for now, will continue to have to wear masks in schools, subways, large venues, homeless shelters, hospitals, nursing homes, jails and prisons.Cuomo, a Democrat, said there would be fireworks displays around the state to celebrate.It's unclear how many more people have to get vaccinated to reach herd immunity, which is when enough people have immunity that the virus has trouble spreading.It's unclear what that threshold is for the coronavirus, though many experts say it’s 70% or higher. Just half of all 20 million residents in New York are fully vaccinated, according to federal data as of Monday.Over the past seven days, New York has been averaging around 450 new coronavirus cases a day, the lowest level since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-lifts-more-covid-19-rules-as-it-hits-vaccination-mark-101623776384839.html

He was executed on Tuesday in Dammam, a statement from the Ministry of Interior said.Saudi authorities said last year that they would stop sentencing to death people who committed crimes while minors, who would instead serve up to 10 years in juvenile detention, and would apply this retroactively.However, the March 2020 royal decree was never reported by state media nor published in the official gazette as would be normal practice. The state-backed Human Rights Commission told Reuters in February that the ban only applied to a lesser category of offence under Islamic law known as "ta'zeer."Darwish was convicted for "ta'zeer" offences.In his charge sheet, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Darwish was accused of "participating in armed rebellion," "seeking to disturb security by rioting" and "sowing discord", among others.The evidence cited included a picture "offensive to the security forces", a signed confession and his participation in more than ten "riot" gatherings in 2011 and 2012.But the documents don't specify the exact months of the alleged offences, and rights groups say Darwish was 17 at the time of his alleged participation in many of the protests. His case should have been reviewed under the reformed law, they say.Anti-death penalty charity Reprieve and Amnesty International said his confession was obtained under duress and that he recanted his confession, which he said was obtained through torture, in court.The Saudi Arabian government media office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Reprieve said Darwish's family received no advance notice and only found out he had been executed by reading the news online."How can they execute a boy because of a photograph on his phone?," his family said in a statement. "Since his arrest, we have known nothing but pain. It is a living death for the whole family."Human rights groups and western lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns about the implementation of the reforms.Earlier this month, a group of British MPs urged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ask for a commutation of Darwish's sentence on a visit to Riyadh, in a letter seen by Reuters.In a statement following Raab's visit and meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the UK foreign office said Raab had raised human rights concerns "notably around justice reform".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-executes-man-for-offences-rights-groups-say-he-committed-as-minor-101623775470193.html
15-06-2021||World||Did Trump want FBI to probe if satellites manipulated votes? Here’s what new emails suggest||The new emails from the US department of justice (DOJ) and White House officials show how then-President Donald Trump’s allies pressured Jeffrey Rosen, then-deputy attorney general, to consider baseless allegations of voter fraud and at the same time elevated him to lead the DOJ. Minutes after Trump’s staff started sending emails with phoney voter fraud information to Rosen, the Republican leader announced that the No. 2 at the DOJ would serve as acting attorney general, according to the new documents disclosed by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.On Tuesday, Carolyn B. Maloney, the chairperson of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, released new documents showing Trump’s efforts to pressure the DOJ to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The documents obtained by the committee show that in December 2020 and early January 2021, Trump, his chief of staff, and outside allies repeatedly put pressure on senior DOJ officials to advance unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud, “with the apparent goal of keeping President Trump in power despite losing the 2020 election.”“These documents show that President Trump tried to corrupt our nation’s chief law enforcement agency in a brazen attempt to overturn an election that he lost,” Maloney said in a statement.On December 29, 2020, Trump’s White House assistant emailed Rosen, then-principal associate deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, and acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall, attaching a draft legal brief to file in the Supreme Court. The draft complaint demanded that the Supreme Court “declare that the Electoral College votes cast” in six states that Trump lost “cannot be counted,” requesting the Court to order a “special election” for the outgoing president in those states.Also Read | US Justice dept opens probe into Trump's seizures of Democrats, journalists dataEmails further confirm that Trump met with Rosen, then-assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, and other DOJ officials on December 31, 2020, and January 3, 2021. During these meetings, Trump reportedly pressured them to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to the committee. The documents have substantiated recent reports that Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows pressured DOJ officials to investigate conspiracy theories.Meadows emailed Rosen a translation of a document from an individual in Italy claiming to have “direct knowledge” of a plot by which American electoral data was changed in Italian facilities “in coordination with senior US intelligence officials (CIA)” and loaded onto “military satellites.” The individual claimed that the true data, as well as sources within the conservative wing of the Italian secret service, confirmed that Trump was “clearly the winner” of the 2020 presidential election.Meadows sent Rosen a YouTube link referencing the Italy conspiracy. Rosen forwarded the email to Donoghue, who responded: “Pure insanity.”Rosen then explained to Donoghue that he was asked to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) meet a person who, he learnt, was working with Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the DOJ official refused the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pure-insanity-trump-allies-wanted-to-know-if-satellites-manipulated-votes-101623772579142.html
15-06-2021||World||Taiwan reports largest incursion by Chinese air force, nuclear-capable bombers involved||As many as 28 aircraft of the Chinese air force entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) on Tuesday in the largest reported incursion to date, the island's government said. Taiwan has frequently complained about repeated Chinese incursions, which has increased in the past few months.Beijing has become more assertive on the reunification of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems”, which has threatened Taiwan’s claim of sovereignty. While the self-ruled island republic considers itself as sovereign, China claims Taiwan as Beijing’s territory under its one-China policy.According to Taiwan’s ministry of defence, the Chinese incursion involved 14 J-16 and six J-11 fighters, as well as four H-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft. The latest incursion is the largest since the defence ministry began regularly reporting PLA activities in Taiwan's ADIZ last year. The previous record was of 25 aircraft reported on April 12.The ministry said that air patrol troops were dispatched to respond to the incursion and warn away the Chinese aircraft. Radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity, the ministry added.Also Read | China warns Japan after its PM refers to Taiwan as a ‘country’In the past, China has described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and to deal with "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States. On the other hand, the West is wary of China’s growing economic clout and expansionist behaviour in the region. The United States, which like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, has watched with alarm the stepped-up tensions with Beijing.The Group of Seven richest democracies on Sunday issued a joint communique underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. They also raised serious concerns over the situation in the East and South China Seas, strongly opposing any unilateral attempts to change the status quo and increase tensions, which was dismissed by China as “slander”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-largest-incursion-yet-by-chinese-air-force-101623768328115.html

But this could change everything," said Precious, 38, who did not wish to give her full name.She had spent the night digging, with her teenage son and baby daughter.The boy clutched a transparent crystal the size of a ping pong ball."They are not tired, we are looking for money," Precious exclaimed.Dreaming of 'Dubai' Rumour has it that the Cullinan, which weighed over 3,000 carats uncut, was lying only a few metres below ground and dug up with a pocketknife.The rough stone yielded nine major diamonds used to adorn the British crown jewels, as well as almost 100 minor brilliants.Johannesburg resident Thulani Manyathi, 36, travelled to KwaHlathi from the impoverished township of Alexandra with his four young daughters."We are going to live in Dubai. I want a house with double storage, this is going to change our life," Manyathi told AFP, fingering a cluster of stones in his pocket."No school today," he added. "We are digging for diamonds."There is talk of "foreigners" buying the stones for a few hundred rands in the nearby town of Ladysmith.But experts say it is highly unlikely the stones will turn out to be valuable."These are not diamonds, people here are just wasting their time," said 18-year-old Bhekumuzi Luvuno, skeptically inspecting one of the stones he unearthed overnight.Authorities over the weekend asked diggers to leave the area, citing coronavirus restrictions, but to no avail.The government on Tuesday sent a team of geological and mining experts to the area, now pckmarked with holes, to collect stones for analysis.Police cars are monitoring the area to keep the crowds in check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-stones-spark-diamond-rush-in-poor-south-african-region-101623766673712.html

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Monday said that about 2,300 passengers refused to comply with the federal facemask mandate.In May, US authorities lifted the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals following a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, they are still required to wear a mask on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. Masks are also required in US transportation hubs such as airports and stations.The FAA has proposed civil penalties ranging from $7,500 to $15,500 against four airline passengers for violating in-flight guidelines and federal regulations. According to the FAA, the passengers allegedly interfered with flight attendants who instructed them to obey cabin crew instructions and various federal regulations.Also Read | US aviation administration tells airlines to use extreme caution when flying over BelarusOne of these four passengers reported by airlines inserted her finger into her nose in response to a flight attendant’s direction to wear her mask, the FAA said. She allegedly yelled, used profanity and refused to read a warning note that a flight attendant issued to her. As a result, the captain had to divert the Cancun-bound flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The FAA has proposed a $10,500 fine against the JetBlue Airlines passenger.The FAA alleges that a passenger onboard an Alaska Airlines flight from Boise, Idaho, to Los Angeles, California, smoked an e-cigarette in the aeroplane lavatory, which activated the lavatory smoke detector system. The passenger walked through the cabin without a face mask over his mouth and nose and repeatedly ignored flight attendants’ instructions to wear his facemask properly.Following its policy, the FAA has not identified individuals against whom it has proposed civil penalties. The passengers have 30 days after receiving the FAA’s enforcement letter to respond to the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3000-unruly-us-air-travellers-reported-in-2021-faa-proposes-penalty-101623764513261.html

15-06-2021||World||Domestic workers hit worse in Covid, lost far more jobs than others: UN||The pandemic has taken a harsh toll on domestic workers who have lost far more jobs than others despite a decade-old international pact guaranteeing their rights, the UN said Tuesday.In a fresh report, the International Labour Organization warned that working conditions for many of the world's 75.6 million domestic workers had not improved since the adoption in 2011 of a convention entitling them to the same protections as other workers.And the situation has been made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit domestic workers -- the majority of whom are women -- far harder than those in most other professions.Also read | UN says Covid-19 pandemic created an 'unparalleled' employment crisisWith eight out of 10 domestic workers globally working in the informal sector, many had no labour or social protections to fall back upon when the crisis hit."The impact on domestic workers was very much stronger than it was on other parts of the workforce, so that meant that these workers lost their jobs in greater numbers or saw their hours of work reduced to a greater extent than other parts of the workforce," ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters."The crisis has highlighted the urgent need to formalise domestic work to ensure their access to decent work," he said.At the height of the crisis, job losses among domestic workers ranged from five to 20 percent in most European countries, while the losses were between 25 and 50 percent in the Americas, the report showed.Job losses among other employees were less than 15 percent in most countries.'Deeper human impact'Since many domestic workers are migrants who rely on their employment for the right to remain in the country they live in, and many are live-in employees, a loss of employment could also mean a loss of their residency permit and lodgings.Also read: UN stands ready to step up support to India, says Guterres on Covid outbreak"Behind the aggregated numbers, I think there is a deeper human impact which accentuates even more the suffering involved in the labour market impact of the Covid-19 pandemic," Ryder said.More than three quarters of all domestic workers are women, and the vast majority are employed in two regions: the Asia-Pacific region which is home to about half of the world's domestic workers, and another quarter found in the Americas.There has been some progress since the adoption of the Domestic Workers Convention, now ratified by 32 countries, with the number of domestic workers who are wholly excluded from the scope of labour laws and regulations cut by 16 percentage points in 10 years.But the ILO report showed that a full 36 percent of domestic workers remain wholly excluded from such laws, most of them in the Asia-Pacific region and in the Arab states.The UN agency cautioned though that even where domestic workers have been included in labour and social protection laws, "implementation remains a significant issue."The report showed that fewer than one in five domestic workers, just 18.8 percent, enjoy effective employment-related social protection coverage."It is more and more important that we redouble our efforts to ensure that the workforce concerned has access to decent work as much as any others," Ryder said."It should not be an invisible workforce, it should not be an undervalued workforce, it should not be an unrecognised workforce."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/domestic-workers-hit-worse-in-covid-lost-far-more-jobs-than-others-un-101623758498168.html
15-06-2021||World||Fungal infection detected in Covid-19 patients in Oman||Oman announced on Tuesday that its doctors have detected a potentially fatal fungal infection afflicting some coronavirus patients, the first such known cases on the Arabian Peninsula as the sultanate faces a surge in Covid-19 infections that has swamped its hospitals.The country's Health Ministry reported that three Covid-19 patients in Oman have become infected with mucormycosis, a life-threatening condition commonly known as “black fungus,” which has spread quickly among virus patients in hard-hit India.Although relatively rare, the disease has raised alarm among authorities that its sudden increase could complicate efforts to combat Covid-19. It wasn't immediately clear what condition the three patients were in.Oman health officials warned earlier this week that the sultanate faces an acute shortage of beds amid the spread of highly transmissible virus variants, a lagging vaccine rollout and relaxed movement restrictions.The fungal condition became a growing cause of concern during India’s devastating coronavirus surge. Other countries, including Egypt, have reported scattered cases in recent months as infections spiked. Black fungus existed in India before the virus wave, but it stoked fears as it took hold in thousands of infected or recently recovered Covid-19 patients.Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. Sometimes, doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.The fungal infection preys on patients with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions, particularly diabetes, as well as overuse of certain over-the-counter coronavirus medication, like steroids. Uncontrolled blood sugar can put immunocompromised people at a higher risk of contracting the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fungal-infection-detected-in-covid-19-patients-in-oman-101623758514153.html

Northrop Grumman’s Minotaur 1 rocket was scheduled to be launched at 7am ET (4.30pm IST) carrying three national security payloads for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the agency that oversees the nation's fleet of spy satellites.However, the launch has been delayed due to storms in the area.According to Nasa, the mission, named NROL-111, will be the third small launch for a US Space Force mission, set up during the Trump administration, and the NRO’s second dedicated launch from Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia in the last 12 months. The US space agency said that while the Nasa Visitor Center at Wallops will not be open for this launch, it may be visible, weather permitting, to the US East Coast residents.“Viewing locations on Chincoteague Island include Robert Reed Park on Main Street or Beach Road spanning the area between Chincoteague and Assateague Islands,” Nasa said in a statement.Also Read | Nasa says newly-discovered exoplanet could have water clouds and a ‘tail’Countdown preparations for the Minotaur 1 rocket launch, including the rollback of the launch pad’s mobile gantry, will resume once the bad weather subsides. Space enthusiasts can also follow the Live coverage of the mission countdown on the Wallops YouTube site. As Nasa Wallops website, the Live coverage will now start at 8.30 ET (6pm IST).Northrop Grumman’s Minotaur 1 rocket, a 69-foot tall launch vehicle, consists of two solid-fueled motors from decommissioned Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as the lower stages and two solid-fueled commercial solid rocket motors as upper stages.A department of defense agency is responsible for developing, acquiring, launching, and operating America’s intelligence satellites to meet the national security needs of the nation.According to a Fox News report, the Minotaur 1 rocket should be visible from New York City for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift-off.

During an interview with Fox News, Yeonmi Park, who graduated from Columbia University, drew parallels between the so-called 'cancel culture' in US universities and Kim Jong Un’s regime, saying she couldn’t believe she was sitting “in North Korea's classroom or in America's classroom.”Yeonmi claimed that North Korean children are instructed to equate the term and persona of "American" with "bastard", and memories of that society came flooding back when she enrolled at Columbia University in New York City's Morningside Heights. She further claimed that the professors at Columbia blamed the United States for the problems in Africa and Asia, which she “couldn’t believe.”"Literally every professor was saying the problems that we have in today's world is because of White men [and] how they colonised Africa [and] Asia, that's how they mess up everything and they are the ones who needs to be blamed -- and I couldn't believe it,” Yeonmi told Fox News.Also Read | Once ‘deeply-moved’ by K-Pop, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls it ‘vicious cancer’The North Korean escapee said she found a lot of similarities between America, a democracy, and North Korea, a country under totalitarian dictatorship, including “anti-Western sentiment, collective guilt and suffocating political correctness.” Expressing shock and confusion on issues surrounding gender and language, Yeonmi said that every class asked students to announce their preferred pronouns."English is my third language. I learned it as an adult. I sometimes still say 'he' or 'she' by mistake and now they are going to ask me to call them 'they'? How the heck do I incorporate that into my sentences?" she asked rhetorically."Even North Korea is not this nuts. North Korea was pretty crazy, but not this crazy," she added.The 27-year-old Columbia graduate said that after being sold into sex slavery and placed on Kim Jong Un’s “killing list”, she escaped North Korea and presumed she was in a free society in the United States. "My enemy used to be Kim Jong Un: I have been on Kim Jong Un's killing list of people for many years because I spoke out, and my original family got punished but now ironically enough, so many Marxists and Communists and Maoists and Leninists are now are sending me death threats," she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-north-korea-not-this-nuts-defector-after-graduating-from-us-university-101623751367106.html
15-06-2021||World||After NATO, Biden turns to EU for renewal of transatlantic ties||U.S. President Joe Biden will seek to end one front in a Trump-era trade war when he meets European Union leaders on Tuesday by agreeing a truce in a transatlantic dispute over aircraft subsidies that has dragged on for 17 years.At the summit with EU institution leaders in Brussels, Biden is aiming for a reset in ties after four years under predecessor Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on the EU and promoted Britain's departure from the bloc.Biden and the EU side are set to remove tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods from EU wine to U.S. tobacco and spirits for five years. The tariffs were imposed on a tit-for-tat basis over mutual frustration over state subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing and European rival Airbus."I am very positive that we will find an agreement on the Airbus-Boeing issue today in conversation with our American friends," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference. Biden will meet von der Leyen and the EU's chairman Charles Michel, who represents EU governments.Biden told NATO leaders "America is back" at a news conference in Brussels late on Monday. He is seeking European support to defend Western liberal democracies in the face of a more assertive Russia and China's military and economic rise."We're facing a once in a century global health crisis," Biden said, while adding "Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic solidarity."Also Read | NATO declares China is a ‘security challenge’According to an EU-U.S. draft final summit statement seen by Reuters, Washington and Brussels will commit to ending another row over punitive tariffs related to steel and aluminium.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai discussed the aircraft dispute in her first face-to-face meeting with EU counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis on Monday ahead of Tuesday's U.S.-EU summit. The pair are due to speak on Tuesday afternoon.Freezing the trade conflicts would give both sides more time to focus on broader agendas such as concerns over China's state-driven economic model, diplomats said.The EU-U.S. summit starts at around midday Central European Time. Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken earlier met with Belgian King Philippe, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes. On Wednesday, he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.The summit draft statement to be released at the end of the meeting said they had "a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living and keep them safe, fight climate change, and stand up for democracy and human rights".There are no firm new transatlantic pledges on climate in the draft summit statement, however, and both sides will steer clear of setting a date to stop burning coal.The EU and the United States are the world's top trading powers, along with China, but Trump sought to sideline the EU.After scotching a free-trade agreement with the EU, the Trump administration focused on shrinking a growing U.S. deficit in goods trade. Biden, however, sees the EU as an ally in promoting free trade, as well as in fighting climate change and ending the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-nato-biden-turns-to-eu-for-renewal-of-transatlantic-ties-101623749654345.html
15-06-2021||World||China urges NATO to stop exaggerating 'China threat theory'||China's mission to the European Union urged NATO on Tuesday to stop exaggerating the "China threat theory" after the group's leaders warned that the country presented "systemic challenges".NATO leaders on Monday had taken a forceful stance towards Beijing in a communique at United States President Joe Biden's first summit with the alliance."China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security," NATO leaders had said.The new US president has urged his fellow NATO leaders to stand up to China's authoritarianism and growing military might, a change of focus for an alliance created to defend Europe from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.The NATO statement "slandered" China's peaceful development, misjudged the international situation, and indicated a "Cold War mentality," China said in a response posted on the mission's website.China is always committed to peaceful development, it added."We will not pose a 'systemic challenge' to anyone, but if anyone wants to pose a 'systemic challenge' to us, we will not remain indifferent."In Beijing, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said the United States and Europe had "different interests," and that some European countries "will not tie themselves to the anti-China war chariot of the United States".G7 nations meeting in Britain over the weekend scolded China over human rights in its Xinjiang region, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full investigation of the origins of the coronavirus in China.China's embassy in London said it was resolutely opposed to mentions of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which it said distorted the facts and exposed the "sinister intentions of a few countries such as the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-nato-to-stop-exaggerating-china-threat-theory-101623748854139.html
15-06-2021||World||'Won't cooperate in probe over anti-drugs deaths': Philippine president Duterte||Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will never cooperate with a possible International Criminal Court investigation into the thousands of killings under his anti-drugs crackdown, his spokesman said Tuesday, calling an international inquiry insulting to the country’s justice system.But human rights activists welcomed the possible investigation as a long-awaited step toward justice and accountability. A leading Duterte critic, jailed opposition Sen. Leila de Lima, said the Philippine leader may now be harboring fears of “being dragged in chains to the Hague” to be tried as “an enemy of mankind.”Outgoing ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Monday that a preliminary examination found reason to believe crimes against humanity had been committed during Duterte's crackdown on drugs between July 1, 2016, and March 16, 2019.The dates cover the period between when Duterte launched his police-enforced crackdown shortly after winning a six-year presidential term and when he withdrew the Philippines from the court. Critics said at the time he was trying to avoid accountability.More than 6,000 mostly poor drug suspects have been killed, according to government pronouncements, but human rights groups say the death toll is considerably higher and should include many unsolved killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen who may have been deployed by police.Duterte has denied condoning extrajudicial killings of drug suspects although he has openly threatened suspects with death and has ordered police to shoot suspects who dangerously resist arrest.Bensouda said she has sought authorization to open a formal investigation. The court's judges have 120 days to decide on her request.Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, blasted Bensouda’s move as “legally erroneous,” saying the ICC, as an international court of last resort, could only intervene if a country’s judiciary and prosecutorial system fail to work and investigate domestic crimes. Roque cited many pending murder and other cases involving the government’s campaign against illegal drugs which were being tried by Philippine courts.“It’s an insult to all Filipinos for a foreigner like Bensouda and fellow Filipinos to say that our legal institution in the Philippines are not working and not dispensing justice,” Roque told a news conference. “How dare you say that the Philippine legal system is not working.”Roque said political “enemies” of Duterte and his administration filed the complaints before the ICC, adding “we will never cooperate because we are no longer a member.”Bensouda, however, stressed the court has jurisdiction over crimes alleged while the Philippines was still a member of the court.Rights activists welcomed Bensouda’s conclusion. Amnesty International said her announcement “is a much-awaited step in putting murderous incitement by President Duterte and his administration to an end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-cooperate-in-probe-over-anti-drugs-deaths-philippine-president-duterte-101623744918730.html
15-06-2021||World||India to expedite Amazon, Flipkart antitrust probe as tech focus intensifies: Report||India's antitrust watchdog plans to expedite a restarted probe into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour at Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc's Flipkart, as it intensifies scrutiny of big-tech firms, two people close to the matter said.The comments come as major US technology firms including Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc are at loggerheads with the government over issues such as data privacy bills and policies some industry executives have called protectionist.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) initiated a probe in January last year on the basis of a complaint alleging Amazon and Flipkart promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and that deep discounts stifled competition.The companies have denied wrongdoing.Near-immediate legal challenges from the pair stalled the probe for over a year until a court last week allowed it to resume, having dismissed arguments that the CCI lacked evidence.Though Amazon and Flipkart are likely to appeal, the CCI plans to demand information from them related to the allegations "as quickly as possible", said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The investigation "will be expedited", the person said. Such investigations in India typically take months to complete.Amazon declined to comment. Flipkart and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.PriorityThe CCI is speeding up all cases involving big technology firms, including by deploying additional officers for some cases and working to more stringent internal deadlines, said the two people, who are familiar with the watchdog's thinking."Cases involving digital firms are getting a priority at CCI as they can have significant impact on the economy and Indian startups," said one of the people.Last year, the CCI began reviewing allegations of Google abusing the position of its Android operating system in the smart TV market, and is likely to soon order a comprehensive antitrust investigation, the people said.Google declined to comment.Such a probe would be the third against Google, with the Alphabet Inc unit already battling cases relating to Android as well as its payment app.The CCI is also investigating practices at MakeMyTrip Ltd and privacy policy changes at Facebook's WhatsApp.Preferential treatmentThe probe into Amazon and Flipkart is restarting at a time when both are battling accusations from offline retailers that their complex business structures allow them to circumvent foreign investment rules for e-commerce.In February, a Reuters investigation based on Amazon documents showed the e-tailer for years gave preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its Indian platform. While arguing to restart the probe, the CCI told a court in Karnataka state that the Reuters report corroborated evidence. Amazon, which has said it "does not give preferential treatment to any seller", told the court it disagreed with the Reuters report.The antitrust body will examine the Reuters report and could use it as part of its investigation, one of the people said."The CCI's plan to move faster on such cases is in line with other antitrust regulators globally that are investigating digital markets like e-commerce and online search, which are dynamic and evolving fast," said an Indian antitrust lawyer who represents tech firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-expedite-amazon-flipkart-antitrust-probe-as-tech-focus-intensifies-report-101623741982448.html
15-06-2021||World||Canada: Indian-origin ex-minister ‘sorry’ for backing proposed anti-Muslim bill||A former Canadian minister of Indian origin has publicly apologised for having supported in the past a proposed bill that would have banned Muslim women in the country from wearing the niqab, a face-covering veil, while taking their citizenship oath.Conservative Party MP Tim Uppal, a Sikh, was the minister of state for multiculturalism in the government of then PM Stephen Harper in 2015 when he had backed the controversial bill.His apology has come at a time when terror charges have been slapped on Nathaniel Veltman, a 20-year-old who had mowed down four members of a Muslim family in the city of Hamilton in Ontario on June 6 in an act of Islamophobia. Uppal is currently an MP from Edmonton Mill Woods.Uppal’s mea culpa has come following the attack. In a Facebook post, he said he was the spokesperson for the proposed bill in 2015, but after his party was defeated in that year’s general election by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, he spoke with Canadians outside the “partisan political bubble” and realised “how this ban and other campaign announcements during the 2015 election alienated Muslim Canadians and contributed to the growing problem of Islamaphobia”.He posted, “When it came to these policies, I should have used my seat at the table to push against divisiveness that promoted the notion of the other. I regret not being a stronger voice and sincerely apologise for my role.”Referring to the Hamilton attack, he said it has been “a devastating week for many. We are mourning as a nation for a family that was so brutally attacked and destroyed by a terrorist”.The apology came as a federal prosecutor imposed terror charges on Veltman, who drove his truck over the family when they had been out for an evening walk. The charges were upgraded on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-indian-origin-ex-minister-sorry-for-backing-proposed-anti-muslim-bill-101623739488611.html
15-06-2021||World||US out, Taliban ride on violence, situation critical in Afghanistan||May 2021 was a bloody month in Afghanistan with the strife torn country getting more volatile and politically unstable. Taking advantage of the commencement of the final drawdown of the US-led international forces, the ultra-conservative Sunni Taliban have intensified its efforts to capture more areas with its ties with Al-Qaeda intact and the so-called Islamic State Khorasan Province acting in harmony with the Islamist forces.The disruptive role of Pakistani deep state is adding fuel to the fire with Islamabad continuing its support to Taliban’s terror tactics. The peace process has failed to deliver any positive outcomes and has little or no hope of doing so in future. The chaos and uncertainty in Afghanistan is likely to worsen further and also impact regional peace in the Indian sub-continent as the terror factories will go full steam after September 2021 after the American and international troops leave the country. This will bring an end to two decades of peace-keeping efforts in the region.By September 11, 2,500 troops of the United States will be completely out of Afghanistan and around 7,000 non-US forces from mainly NATO countries - along with Australia, New Zealand and Georgia - are also planning to leave by that date.Since the announcement of the withdrawal of US forces, violence has been rising and efforts to broker a peace settlement between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban have slowed.The rise in violenceThere has been an over two-and-half fold increase in terrorism-linked fatalities in the country in May in comparison to April, 2021. According to government figures, 4,375 such deaths have been reported in Afghanistan as compared to 1,645 in April. This was the highest fatality count recorded in a month since March, 2020.The security forces too suffered a three-fold surge in fatalities - from 388 in April to 1,134 in May.The Afghan national defence and security forces, which will take over the efforts to maintain peace in the country after international forces are gone, have suffered disruptions in supply of essentials like ration, shortage of ammunition and witnessed 26 of their bases surrendered to the Taliban last month.The coordinated attacks, which have increased in the last few months, have caused a high number of casualties and led to displacement of more than 1,000 families from Ghazni, Helmand and Zabul provinces. The continued Taliban attacks also pose serious threats to five provincial capitals: Pul-e-Khumri (Baghlan); Kunduz city (Kunduz); Kandahar city (Kandahar); Lashkargah (Helmand); and Tjrinkot (Uruzgan).At least 80 people were killed and more than 160 injured in the attack near the Sayed Ul-Shuhada High School in Kabul on May 8. The attack took place as students started to make their way home.Support to TalibanIn the beginning of May, Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib hinted that Al-Qaeda was playing a key role in keeping the Taliban’s war machine active in Afghanistan. He also said that both Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province were carrying out their activities in harmony with the Taliban.A week later, First Vice President Amrullah Saleh asserted that the Taliban continued to operate ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ with Al-Qaeda. Saleh highlighted the elimination of Al-Qaeda elements by Afghan National Defence and security forces to prove his point.Pakistan continues to play the gameWhat has been a cause of concern for the Afghan government is the support the terrorists are getting from neighbour Pakistan. One of the provincial governors raised the issue of the presence of Pakistani nationals fighting alongside Taliban militants.Underlining that the Taliban received weapons and ammunition supplies from Pakistan, Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib termed the outfit as a "slave of the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)".In an interview on May 15, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani reiterated that Pakistan was supporting the Taliban. But Pakistan's Foreign Office described it as an "irresponsible statement" and a "baseless allegation".In a statement, Pakistani Army Chief of Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa reiterated to President Ghani last month that "a peaceful Afghanistan means a peaceful region in general and a peaceful Pakistan in particular"."We will always support 'Afghan led-Afghan owned' Peace Process based on mutual consensus of all stakeholders," the statement said.Expediting the peace processPresident Ashraf Ghani said last month that he has been pushing the formation of an all-party 'Supreme State Council' to carry forward the peace process as well as the resistance to the Taliban. Ghani has met a number of leaders on the structure and composition of the council but it has not been constituted yet.The council was supposed to be formed last year. The efforts have now been expedited, and local reports in Afghanistan say that an 18-member list has been prepared for the Supreme Council.Against the backdrop of a spurt in violence in the Northern Provinces of Takhar, Baghlan and Daykundi, Tajik leader Ahmad Massoud (son of former mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud) stated in Kabul on May 5, that if the Taliban continued to seek a military solution, the Afghan mujahideen groups would be prepared for a confrontation with the outfit. Massoud also underscored that, given the foreign troop withdrawal, the Taliban had no justification for war.Hazara leader Mohammad Karim Khalili, anticipating a deterioration of the security situation in the Hazarajat area (Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Uruzgan and Wardak Provinces), was making efforts to prepare resistance militias against the Taliban. With the resistance to Taliban rising in erstwhile Northern Alliance areas, Afghanistan seems headed for another round of bloody civil strife with innocents the only victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-out-taliban-rides-on-violence-situation-critical-in-afghanistan-101623737176287.html

She said there is no evidence and lamented the filth being poured "on an innocent scientist".“How on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?” she told the New York Times in rare comment to the media on the issue. “I don’t know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,” she further wrote in her response sent through a text message.In a March 2020 article in Scientific American, Shi said that the genetic code of the virus that causes Covid-19 doesn’t match any of her lab’s samples. She also told the World Health Organization (WHO) team, which visited China to find out the cause of the origin of Covid-19, that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies.US President Joe Biden last month ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including the lab leak theory.The leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory.But it has gained increasing traction recently, fueled by reports that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan.But Shi said in a research paper published in November last year that the workers' pneumonia-like symptoms were caused by a fungal infection. Shi and her team also said in research published that they had retested 13 serum samples from four of the patients and found no sign they had been infected with Sars-CoV-2.The Wuhan Institute of Virology houses a lab with a biosafety rating of "P4" - the highest possible - which is determined by the level of danger and resulting security measures posed by the pathogens studied there. P4-level pathogens include those that cause diseases such as Ebola.The P4 lab is Asia's first and was built at a cost of $42 million, opening in 2018.The institute studies some of the world's most dangerous diseases and previously conducted extensive investigations into the links between bats and disease outbreaks in China.Its scientists helped shed light on the Covid-19 pathogen in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-china-s-top-virologist-shi-zhengli-denies-lab-leak-theory-101623733575573.html

15-06-2021||World||Joe Biden promises to lay down 'red lines' to Russia's Vladimir Putin||US President Joe Biden said Monday he would lay down "red lines" to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at their upcoming meeting, after rallying NATO allies to face up to challenges from Moscow and Beijing.Speaking after his first NATO summit since being elected, Biden insisted: "I'm not looking for conflict with Russia, but that we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities."Biden also called Putin "tough" and "a worthy adversary" ahead of their hotly anticipated meeting in Geneva on Wednesday.The warning to the Kremlin leader came as Biden pressed to renew Washington's transatlantic ties with allies after years of tensions under his predecessor Donald Trump.At Biden's urging, NATO leaders agreed to work together against the "systemic challenges" posed by China's aggressive policies as the alliance fleshed out its nascent approach to Beijing.China's increasingly assertive actions in building a nuclear arsenal as well as space and cyber warfare capabilities threatens the international order, they said in a statement.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the allies would seek to cooperate with China on global issues like climate change, as European capitals wanted.But, in a nod to Washington's growing concern, he warned: "China's growing influence and international policies present challenges to Alliance security.""Leaders agreed that we need to address such challenges together as an alliance, and that we need to engage with China to defend our security interests," he said.In the summit communique, the leaders told Russia that there would be no quick return to "business as usual".Russia's military build-up and provocative behaviour on NATO's eastern frontier "increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond".'Right balance'On China, Biden is picking up from where Trump left off by getting NATO to start paying attention to Beijing.But European allies have been wary that an increase of focus on China could distract NATO from its major priority -- Russia.German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that alliance members should not "overestimate" the dangers posed from Beijing."We have to find the right balance," she said. "China is a rival on many issues, but at the same time it is also a partner on many issues."French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that NATO should not spread itself too thin and "skew" the relationship with China."NATO is a military organisation, the subject of our relationship with China is not only military," he said, stressing NATO's north Atlantic focus.AfghanistanLooming large in the background for the summit was also the scramble to complete NATO's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan after Biden surprised partners by ordering US troops home by September 11.Biden discussed with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an offer from Ankara to keep troops in the country to secure Kabul airport -- provided the US gave support.Erdogan announced no firm deal on the issue -- or any progress on the thorny dispute over Turkey's purchase of Russia's S-400 missile system.But Erdogan insisted that he had held "fruitful and sincere" talks with his US counterpart.The final NATO summit statement did not mention Turkey's role at the airport, but did stress that the alliance would continue to pay to keep the facility open.Much of the summit Monday was dedicated to trying to forge a way forward by greenlighting a 2030 reform plan to revitalise an alliance that Macron warned in 2019 was undergoing "brain death".Allies endorsed a new cyber defence policy to tackle rising threats and agreed for the first time that an attack in space could trigger the Article 5 collective defence clause.They also committed to increasing the alliance's budget and spending more on "common funding" -- but details remained sparse after opposition to increased spending led by France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-promises-to-lay-down-red-lines-to-russia-s-vladimir-putin-101623709822394.html
15-06-2021||World||Vehicle plows into Minnesota protesters, killing 1: Police||A woman was killed and three other people were injured when a vehicle drove into demonstrators during a protest in the Minneapolis neighborhood where a Black man was fatally shot this month during his attempted arrest by members of a federal task force, police said Monday.The crash happened at about 11:40 pm Sunday in Minneapolis' Uptown neighborhood. Witnesses said the driver of an SUV struck a parked car, tossing it into the crowd of demonstrators. Police spokesman John Elder did not confirm that account, and said authorities are still investigating.Police said protesters pulled the driver from his vehicle and witnesses told police that demonstrators began striking him. The driver was taken into custody and was being treated for injuries at a hospital. Authorities have not released his name or the names of the three people who were injured.The brother of the woman who died identified her as Deona M Knajdek. Garrett Knajdek told the Star Tribune his sister would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on Wednesday. He said she had 11- and 13-year-old daughters, and was actively involved in issues surrounding social justice.“She constantly (was) sacrificing herself for everyone around her,” he said, “no matter the cost, obviously.”Police said the driver’s motive was not immediately known, but that a preliminary investigation indicated drugs or alcohol may have been a contributing factor. A 35-year-old St. Paul man was booked into the Hennepin County Jail early Monday on suspicion of criminal vehicular homicide, driving after a license was canceled and providing false information to police. The man, who hasn't been formally charged, has multiple convictions for driving while impaired, according to online court records.A witness told Minnesota Public Radio that the SUV was going very fast and appeared to accelerate as it got closer to demonstrators who had blocked off a street. D.J. Hooker said the driver struck a car parked across one of the traffic lanes, sending that car flying.“There was one line of barriers and then a second barrier, and he sped up. He sped up. He went even faster as he approached us. You could hear it ... start going even faster as he got close to us,” Hooker said. He told Minnesota Public Radio News, “the car went through the air and it hit a young woman.”Another witness, Brett Williams, said Knajdek was thrown into a stop light.Her mother, Deb Kenney, asked for prayers for the driver's family.“The emotion we need to have right now is we need to be grateful that Deona was here and she shared it all with us,” Kenney said, according to KARE-11. “She wouldn’t want us to be angry at that man. She would have let it go in a minute, and said, what could we have done for him? What would have made a difference for him?”She added: "She was here on her own accord, she chose to do this. She wanted to make that impact.”Kenney said she hopes people don’t stop protesting because of her daughter's death, but she said demonstrators should make sure they are staying safe.Other injuries and deaths have been reported involving vehicles at protests across the U.S. as people have increasingly taken to streets to press their grievances. In Minneapolis, marching onto freeways has become a common tactic in recent years. Last year, a semitrailer rolled into a crowd marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway following George Floyd's death. No one was seriously injured.In response to such protests, Republican politicians in several states, including Oklahoma, Florida and Iowa, have sought legal immunity for drivers who hit protesters.There had been ongoing protests in Uptown, about 2 1/2 miles (4 kilometers) south of downtown, since the June 3 shooting of Winston Boogie Smith Jr., a 32-year-old father of three, by members of a federal U.S. Marshals Service task force. The Uptown area includes a mix of trendy restaurants, shops and theaters popular with the city’s younger professionals, many of whom live in apartments and condominiums in the area.The city of Minneapolis has been on edge since Floyd’s death under an officer’s knee and the more recent fatal police shooting of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb.Smith was killed earlier this month. According to authorities, members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for allegedly being a felon in possession of a gun. The Marshals Service said in a statement that Smith, who was in a parked vehicle, didn’t comply with law enforcement and “produced a handgun resulting in task force members firing upon the subject.” State investigators said evidence showed he fired the gun from inside his vehicle.Smith died at the scene. A 27-year-old woman who was a passenger in Smith's vehicle said she never saw a gun on Smith or in the vehicle, her attorneys said last week — contradicting authorities' account about Smith's actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vehicle-plows-into-minnesota-protesters-killing-1-police-101623708600769.html
15-06-2021||World||UK delays lockdown easing by a month||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed his plans to lift Covid-19 lockdown restrictions by a month on Monday, warning that the more infectious Delta variant meant if he did nothing thousands more people might die.Under the final stage of a plan outlined by Johnson in February, he had hoped to lift most social restrictions on June 21, meaning pubs, restaurants, nightclubs and other hospitality venues could fully reopen. That much-anticipated step was pushed back to July 19.“I think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,” Johnson told a news conference. “As things stand, and on the evidence that I can see right now. I’m confident that we will not need more than four weeks.”S Africa rejects 2mn jabsSouth Africa’s vaccine roll-out has been hit by further delays as it will have to discard at least 2 million Johnson & Johnson shots produced in the country.The vaccines were found by the US Food and Drug Administration to be unsuitable for use due to possible contamination of their ingredients at a Baltimore plant. South Africa was expecting to use them to inoculate its health care workers and people aged 60 and older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-delays-lockdown-easing-by-a-month-101623706649997.html
15-06-2021||World||NATO declares China is a ‘security challenge’||NATO leaders targeted China in a strongly worded warning on Monday, declaring the nation poses a constant security challenge, is trying to undermine world order and is working on nuclear missile development at a worrisome pace.In a summit statement, the leaders said that China’s goals and “assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security”. The warning to China comes as US President Joe Biden has stepped up his effort to rally allies to speak in a more unified voice about China’s human rights record, its trade practices and its military’s assertive behaviour that has unnerved US allies in the Pacific.While the 30 heads of state and government avoided calling China a rival, they expressed concern about what they said were its “coercive policies”, the opaque ways it is modernising its armed forces and its use of disinformation.China takes a dig at G7, labels its role ‘sinister’China denounced a joint statement by the G7 leaders that rebuked Beijing as a gross interference in the country’s internal affairs.China’s embassy in London said it was dissatisfied and opposed to mentions of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan that distorted the facts and exposed the “sinister intentions of a few countries such as the US”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-declares-china-is-a-security-challenge-101623706332615.html

Right now, the virus is moving faster than the global distribution of vaccines."More than 10 thousand people are dying every day... these communities need vaccines, and they need them now, not next year."While people in many wealthy nations are enjoying a return to a sense of normalcy thanks to high vaccination rates, the shots remain scarce in less well-off parts of the world.In terms of doses administered, the imbalance between the G7 and low-income countries, as defined by the World Bank, is 73 to one.Many of the donated G7 doses will be filtered through Covax, a global body charged with ensuring equitable vaccine distribution.Run by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance and CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, it has to date shipped more than 87 million vaccine doses to 131 countries -- far fewer than anticipated.70% targetThe WHO wants at least 70 percent of the world's population vaccinated by the next G7 meeting in Germany next year."To do that, we need 11 billion doses. The G7 and G20 can make this happen," said Tedros.Medical charity Doctors Without Borders questioned how sincere the G7 was in pursuing vaccine equity."We need to see more clarity around the actual number of doses donated, and exactly how long it's going to take to translate their pledges into real impact and access," the medical charity's Hu Yuanqiong told AFP.As well as dose sharing, the G7 anti-pandemic battle plan includes commitments to avert future pandemics -- slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines to under 100 days, reinforcing global surveillance and strengthening the WHO.But observers voiced scepticism at their willingness to follow through on the last point especially."I will believe (that) point when the contributions to WHO are increased," tweeted Ilona Kickbusch, founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva.$16 billion call Others stressed the need to quickly resolve the issue of Covid vaccine patent protections, to boost production.Full-fledged negotiations towards a possible suspension of intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines, as well as other medical tools needed to battle the pandemic, have just begun at the World Trade Organization after months of contentious debate.G7 leaders "say they want to vaccinate the world by the end of next year, but their actions show they care more about protecting the monopolies and patents of pharmaceutical giants," lamented Max Lawson, Oxfam's head of inequity policy.Human Rights Watch agreed."Focusing on vaccines and making charitable donations are not enough," Aruna Kashyap, Human Rights Watch's senior counsel for business and human rights, told AFP."The G7's failure to unequivocally support a temporary waiver of global intellectual property rules is deadly status quo."WHO and partners also highlighted the desperate need for funds to overcome the pandemic.More than $16 billion (13.2 billion euros) is still needed this year to fully fund efforts to speed up production and access to Covid-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against Covid.That figure represents less that one percent of annual global defence expenditure, the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan pointed out."Surely we can afford one percent of that to save lives and bring this pandemic to an end."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-quicker-than-vaccines-warns-who-as-g7-vows-to-share-doses-101623695635330.html
15-06-2021||World||Lot of work remains to be done to tackle land degradation: Modi at UN meet||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated the need for the world to come together to combat land degradation as a “collective responsibility” as it threatens the very foundations the societies and economies are built on and called for more actions saying, “a lot of work lies ahead of us”.Virtually delivering a keynote address at a high-level meeting at the United Nations on land degradation and drought, Modi went on to detail steps and measures India is taking at home to address the situation and helping other developing nations in the spirit of South-South cooperation.“It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse the damage to land caused by human activity,” the prime minister said, in his capacity as the president of the 14th Session of the Conference of Parties of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).If left unchecked, land degradation “will erode the very foundation of our societies, economies, food security, health, safety and quality of life,” he said further, and added that the world must “reduce the tremendous pressure on land and its resources. Clearly, a lot of work lies ahead of us”.The United Nations has estimated that one-fifth of Earth’s land area - which is more than 2 billion hectares - is degraded, including more than half of all agricultural land. And 12 million hectares of land is lost to desertification, land degradation and drought each year. In all, nearly, 95% of calories from food come from soil, yet top soil erosion has accelerated by tenfold due to human activity. The world loses 24 billion tons of fertile soil annually due to dry-land degradation, with significant negative impacts on food production and economic activity.The high-level dialogue launched on Monday will assess progress made in this fight against land degradation and propose a way forward at the end of the UN Decade for Deserts and the Fight against Desertification, and the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s commitment to the cause linking it to the “importance (India gives) to land and (considers) the sacred earth as our Mother”.Modi said India has taken the lead to highlight land degradation issues at international forums and pointed to the “Delhi Declaration” of 2019, which had called for “better access and stewardship over land” and emphasise gender-sensitive transformative projects.Over the last 10 years, India has added around three million hectares of forest cover, which, he said, enhanced the cumulative forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area, he said, adding, “We are on track to achieve our national commitment of land degradation neutrality.”India is also working to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, which would help create an additional carbon sink - natural assets that absorb carbon dioxide - of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. “We believe that restoration of land can start a cycle for good soil health, increased land productivity, food security and improved livelihoods,” the prime minister said, and went on to speak of “novel” efforts under way in the Banni region in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, which is marked by degraded land and lack of rain. India is restoring land there by developing grasslands.Modi then turned to assistance India is providing to others to deal with land degradation, which, he said, poses a special challenge to the developing world. “In the spirit of South-South cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies,” he added. India is setting up a centre of excellence “to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lot-of-work-remains-to-be-done-to-tackle-land-degradation-modi-at-un-meet-101623695206528.html
