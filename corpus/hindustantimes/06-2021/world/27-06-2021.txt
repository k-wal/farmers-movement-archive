He lashed out at his successor, President Joe Biden, and reiterated false claims about losing in a rigged 2020 election.“We won the election twice and it’s possible we’ll have to win it a third time. It’s possible,” Trump said at the rally in Wellington, Ohio, a state he won comfortably in 2016 and 2020. He lost the overall election in 2020, but continues to call it a victory and the reference to possible success in 2024 a “third time”.Trump hasn’t yet announced his intention to run again, but has hinted it several times, signaling that he is not prepared yet to end his unconventional tryst with US politics.He is seeking to tighten his grip on the Republican Party as its strongest and most popular leader around, disbursing endorsements to supporters and punishment to recalcitrant Republicans who have either opposed him, criticised him or voted to impeach him.Saturday’s rally was intended, among other things, to support Max Miller, a former Trump White House aide who is challenging sitting Republican member of the House of Representatives Anthony Gonzalez, one of the 10 Republican congress members who voted to impeach Trump for the January 6 Capitol riot.Trump has vowed to campaign against all 10 in the 2022 elections in which Republicans are seeking to wrest both chambers of congress - the Senate and the House - from Democrats who control them now with razor-thin majorities.They are evenly matched in the Senate, where US vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaker vote gives Democrats the edge.“We will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,” Trump said at the rally.Trump portrayed his successor, President Biden, as weak and as someone who is endangering America’s strength and compromising its advantages abroad by returning to the agreements he had walked out of - such as the Paris accord on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-teases-possible-2024-run-at-his-1st-big-rally-since-leaving-white-house-101624818548932.html

Few details have been provided by authorities on the charges against the women or on sporadic trials that have been closed to the public.Their release follows that of prominent activist Loujain al-Hathloul in February who had served half of her custodial sentence on broad cybercrime and counterterrorism charges. She still faces a five-year travel ban.Human Rights Watch welcomed the report by ALQST on Twitter of the release of Badawi and Sadah: "These brave women should have never been detained in the first place. They should have been appreciated for leading change in Saudi Arabia."Badawi received the United States' International Women of Courage Award in 2012 for challenging the Saudi male guardianship system, and was among the first women who signed a petition calling on the government to allow women to drive and to vote and run in local elections.Sadah, from the restive Shi'ite-majority Qatif province, has also campaigned to abolish the guardianship system.CrackdownThe women's rights activists were detained before and after the kingdom in 2018 lifted a ban on women driving as part of social reforms that have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent that has also netted clerics and intellectuals.Badawi's former husband is serving a 15-year jail sentence for human rights activism. Her brother Raif Badawi, a prominent blogger, is serving a 10-year sentence on charges of insulting Islam and for cyber crime.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has taken a tough stance over Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which came under the spotlight after the October 2018 murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.Washington in February released an intelligence report implicating de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Khashoggi's killing. The prince denies any involvement.In April, the State Department voiced concern about the sentencing of a Saudi aid worker by a counterterrorism court to 20 years in prison followed by a 20-year travel ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-releases-two-women-activists-detained-3-years-ago-says-rights-group-101624806269610.html

US forces had invaded the country following the September 11 twin tower attack, and Pakistan had joined the “war on terror” providing assistance in exchange of American support.The foreign minister’s admission comes a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan told reporters that Pakistan will be sealing its border, the Durand Line, with Afghanistan if the Taliban attempts to take over the country with their military might.“What if [the] Taliban try to take over Afghanistan through [the] military? Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict. Secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees,” Khan said.The Durand Line which separates Pakistan and Afghanistan has become a contentious issue for both countries ever since Pakistan started fencing it during Khan’s tenure. Afghanistan claims this geopolitical boundary drawn by British Colonial administrator Sir Henry Mortimer Durand in 1893 has no “legal sanctity”.Pakistan on its part is hopeful that this 2,640 Kilometer long fenced barrier will deter a refugee influx of ethnic Pashtuns into the country if the Taliban take over. In 1989, after the Soviet Union had withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan a bloody civil car had broken out in the country, forcing millions of Afghans to cross over to Pakistan. Khan and his government, fearing a similar wave of refugees post US withdrawal, are racing against time to finish fencing its border hoping to keep history from repeating itself.Khan criticised the decision to withdraw troops claiming that the leverage Pakistan had over the Taliban has been diminished by US withdrawing troops. “...reason is that the moment the United States gave a date of exit, Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so, therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-will-shut-its-border-with-afghanistan-in-national-interest-if-taliban-takes-over-post-us-withdrawal-101624813032555.html

Hopeful patients have bombarded doctors with their queries after FDA approved Biogen’s Aduhelm for Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. Alzheimer’s patients want to know whether the drug might be right for them.“It's not a simple yes or no,” said Dr Alireza Atri, a neurologist at the Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Arizona.Doctors are still trying to figure out who should receive the drug which does not reverse mental decline but, at best, slows the disease marginally. The approval of Aduhelm itself was controversial and triggered a swift backlash from many experts. Three experts even resigned from an FDA committee over the agency’s decision to approve a medicine that only slowed the mental decline in one study that was marred by hard-to-interpret results.Also Read | Exercise training may prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease, says studyAduhelm is the first Alzheimer's medication in nearly 20 years and has been granted conditional approval based on its ability to get rid of harmful clumps of plaque in the brains of patients with early forms of the disease. The approval, however, isn't limited to those early patients and anyone with Alzheimer's, at least theoretically, could get prescribed the drug.“Currently available therapies only treat symptoms of the disease; this treatment option is the first therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s," Patrizia Cavazzoni, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement after the approval.Many providers have said that it will take weeks or months before they are ready to give the drug as insurers still need to determine which patients to cover for the expensive treatment that could cost more than $50,000 a year. Doctors worry that emotions will affect decisions by patients and families in seeking the drug.“People are desperate. It's a really horrible disease,” said Stanford University's Dr Michael Greicius, but added that he has no plans to prescribe Aduhelm.“I don't think there's sufficient evidence that it works, and there's plenty of evidence that it can harm patients,” he said, questioning the efficacy of the FDA-approved medicine.Also Read | Covid-19 linked with Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive impairment: StudyGreicius said he plans to lay out a “compelling and compassionate” case for not providing the drug to his patients but he worries that some patients may simply turn to other doctors to get the prescription.Apart from the side effects of Aduhelm, doctors worry that an earlier diagnosis combined with the drug's incremental benefit may simply prolong the hardships of those caring for someone with Alzheimer's.“It could turn out that it actually increases your caregiver burden if it's just slowing things down a little bit,” said Dr Suzanne Schindler of Washington University in St. Louis. “I think it's going to be really disappointing for a lot of people.”(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-are-desperate-fda-approved-alzheimer-s-drug-causes-worry-for-doctors-101624809608466.html
27-06-2021||World||Death toll in Florida condo collapse rises to 9, over 150 still unaccounted for||The death toll from the collapse of a Florida beachfront condo building has risen to nine as search-and-rescue efforts continue, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Sunday.One person died in the hospital, and workers pulled four more bodies from the wreckage, the mayor said.Scores of rescue workers remained on the massive pile of rubble, working to find survivors among the more than 150 people who remain unaccounted for. Four of the dead have been identified and next of kin notified, the mayor said.Four days after Thursday's collapse, more than 150 people remain unaccounted for in Surfside, and authorities and loved ones fear the toll will go much higher.As rotating teams of rescuers used heavy machinery and power tools to clear the rubble from the top and tunnel in from below, the Noriega family hoped that their 92-year-old matriarch, Hilda Noriega, had somehow survived.When Mike Noriega heard that part of the condominium tower where his grandmother lived had collapsed, he rushed with his father to the scene. They arrived at a nightmarish 30-foot pile of broken concrete and mangled metal, the remains of the 12-story building known as Champlain Towers South.But among the flying debris, they stumbled across mementos that bore witness to Hilda’s life on the sixth floor: an old picture of her with her late husband and their infant son, and a birthday card that friends from her prayer group sent two weeks earlier with the acronym “ESM,” Spanish for “hand-delivered,” scrawled across the yellow envelope with a butterfly etching.“There was a message in the mess of all this,” said Mike Noriega, who last spoke with his grandmother the day before the disaster. “It means not to give up hope. To have faith.”Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett sought to assure families Sunday that rescuers were working nonstop. “Nothing else on our mind, with the only objective of pulling their family members out of that rubble,” he told ABC’s “This Week.”“We’re not going to stop doing that -- not today, not tomorrow, not the next day. We’re going to keep going until everybody’s out.”The Noriega family described Hilda as a fiercely independent and vivacious retiree — in Mike's words, “the youngest 92-year-old I know ... 92 going on 62.”Hilda Noriega had called Champlain Towers South home for more than 20 years. But six years after her husband's death, she was ready to leave. The condo was for sale, and she planned to move in with family.She loved living near the ocean and friends, but “when you lose a spouse, you want to be surrounded by family ... and she wanted to spend more time with her family and grandchildren,” said Sally Noriega, Hilda's daughter-in-law.Hilda Noriega was a loving person who built a life with her husband and raised a family after coming to the U.S. from Cuba in 1960, her daughter-in-law said.“She was just one of those people who from the first time she met a person she instantly loved that person, and that person instantly loved her,” Sally said.Carlos Noriega, Hilda's son and police chief of nearby North Bay Village, was one of the emergency responders atop the pile.The Noriegas don't entirely know what to make of the treasured mementos found amid the chaos, but Sally said: “We are a family of faith. We’ll just leave it at that.”They are among dozens of anguished families awaiting word on the fate of loved ones. The wait has been agonizing.The atmosphere inside a hotel ballroom where around 200 family members were being briefed by authorities Saturday was tense, two people present told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.The two said families frustrated with the slow pace of recovery efforts had demanded they be allowed to go to the scene and attempt a collective shout — an attempt as much to find survivors as a cathartic farewell to those who had died.The mayor said Saturday that the identification of three bodies had dropped the number of people unaccounted for down to 156, and crews also discovered other unspecified human remains. The remains are being sent to the medical examiner, and authorities are gathering DNA samples from family members to aid in identification.A video posted online showed an official briefing families. When he said they had found remains among the rubble, people began sobbing.Late Saturday, four of the victims were identified, as Stacie Dawn Fang, 54; Antonio Lozano, 83, and Gladys Lozano, 79; and Manuel LaFont, 54.Burkett said a city official had led a cursory review of the nearby Champlain Towers North and Champlain Towers East buildings but “didn’t find anything out of the ordinary.”The news came after word of a 2018 engineering report that showed the building, which was built in 1981, had “major structural damage” to a concrete slab below its pool deck that needed extensive repairs, part of a series of documents released by the city of Surfside.Further documentation showed the estimated cost of the repairs would total over $9 million. That included more than $3.8 million for garage, entrance and pool remediation and nearly $3.2 million for fixes to the exterior façade.While officials said no cause for the collapse early Thursday has been determined, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a “definitive answer” was needed in a timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-florida-condo-collapse-rises-to-9-over-150-still-unaccounted-for-101624809839490.html

These reactions come days after Kim’s appearance on state television following months of absence from the public eye."Seeing respected general secretary (Kim Jong Un) looking emaciated breaks our people's heart so much," a North Korean citizen told the state broadcaster, reported Reuters."Everyone is saying that their tears welled up," he added.Reports of Kim’s weight loss began to do the rounds after footage of North Koreans watching a clip of plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea held on June 17 on a giant screen in an unspecified location was broadcasted on the official state television channel, reported Reuters.North Korea analysts who studied the footage closely said Kim appeared to have lost weight as the strap of his expensive watch appeared tighter and his face looked significantly thinner. The 37-year old who is around 5ft 8 inches tall and weighs 140 kilograms may have lost as much as 10-20 kilograms, reported the Associated Press.Also Read: US has 'wrong' expectation for dialogue: Kim Yo JongKim, who is himself fond of liquor and smoking, comes from a family with a history of heart disease. Both his father and grandfather who ruled North Korea before him succumbed to heart issues.

Yo-jong is also believed to be her brother’s successor.Hong Min, a senior scholar at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification, told the Associated Press that the apparent weight loss can also be a sign of the Supreme Leader’s attempts to improve his lifestyle. Min insisted that if his health was indeed failing he would not make an appearance in public to address an important plenary meeting of his party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-koreans-are-heartbroken-over-kim-jong-un-s-recent-weight-loss-101624804135176.html

Many EU member states have started issuing the digital “vaccine passport” that will enable Europeans to move freely for work or tourism. The immunity passport will serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), or recently tested negative for the virus, or has the natural immunity built up from earlier infection.While the European Union had earlier said that member states should issue the certificates regardless of the type of Covid-19 vaccine, the technical specifications of the ‘Green Pass’ indicate that obligation would be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization.”At present, four vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that can be used in the EU member states: Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson).Also Read | Can Indians travel to Germany, South Korea, US? Check latest visa, vaccine rulesCovishield, a version of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), has not been approved by the EMA for the European market. The EU green pass will only recognise the Vaxzervria version of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is manufactured in the UK or other sites around Europe.The recipients of Covishield largely include Indians and citizens of low- and middle-income countries who were immunised with vaccines distributed by the WHO co-sponsored COVAX initiative.However, member states have the option to accept other vaccination certificates in case the travellers have received Covid-19 vaccines not approved by the EMA.According to the website schengenvisainfo.com, Iceland will allow restriction-free entry to those who have been vaccinated with one of the vaccines authorised by the EMA or the WHO. Apart from the EMA-approved vaccines, the UN health agency has included Covishield, CoronaVac, and Sinopharm under its Emergency Use List.On the other hand, France has clarified that it will facilitate easy entry for those vaccinated with one of the EMA-approved vaccines, and not others, like the Russian and Indian vaccines.EU leaders expect to have vaccinated around 70% of the adult population in the region when the digital certificate will be available for use. The vaccination certificate is not a substitute for a travel document and holders must also provide a passport or identity card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covishield-excluded-from-new-eu-covid-green-pass-even-after-who-approval-101624803271741.html

Sir Peter Horby, the chairman of the UK’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the modelling of the Alpha variant, first detected in Kent, allowed scientists to predict its transmissibility and spread.“That same modelling for the Delta variant would suggest that that’s a more transmissible strain, it will be very difficult to control and so I think we will see it spreading in Europe, unfortunately,” Horby, also a professor of emerging infectious diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said.The UK government faced criticism for not implementing stronger border measures to check the spread of the Delta variant earlier this summer. Britain expanded its travel “red list” only after the second wave of coronavirus, believed to be largely driven by the Delta variant, had started wreaking havoc in India.Also Read | Bangladesh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variantWhen asked whether a delay in stronger border measures allowed the Delta variant to become the dominant strain, Horby said that it’s clear that the variant, first detected in India, started to spread within the UK after its introductions from other countries.“So I think there is a case to be said that that did happen and stronger border measures may have delayed that, may even have prevented it. But there is an obvious trade-off that policymakers and politicians have to make between absolute complete restrictions and stopping various viruses coming in,” Horby told BBC.World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said that the Delta variant, first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 countries, adding that it is the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far”.Britain has already extended the full reopening of businesses by four weeks and countries across the world, including Bangladesh, Australia, and Israel, have started imposing restrictions due to the fresh surge. More than 70% of coronavirus cases in Portugal’s Lisbon region are from the Delta variant, which is said to be rapidly spreading to other parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-will-spread-across-europe-says-expert-amid-virus-surge-101624796224818.html

Speaking to Geo News, Chaudhry stressed that Pakistan considers Osama bin Laden a terrorist and al-Qaeda as a terrorist outfit.Addressing Pakistan’s national assembly in June last year, Imran Khan had termed bin Laden, who was killed in 2011 by US special forces in Abbottabad, a “martyr.” "I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him," Khan had said.Pakistan was not informed in advance when the US Navy Seals carried out Operation Neptune Spear to eliminate Osama bin Laden under cover of darkness in Abbottabad. Bin Laden was accused of engineering a number of terror attacks worldwide, particularly targeting the American installations including the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Also Read | Osama bin Laden supported, funded Nawaz Sharif: Ex-Pak envoy Abida HussainImran Khan had come under fire from opposition leaders for portraying bin Laden as a “martyr.” "He destroyed my nation, and [Khan] is calling him a martyr," former foreign minister Khawaja Asif had then blasted Khan in the parliament. Imran Khan’s remark on the slain al-Qaeda terrorist resurfaced after a year following Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s recent interview with TOLO News."He [Imran Khan] was quoted out of context. And, uh, you know, a particular section of the media played it up," Qureshi said.When the foreign minister was pressed by the interviewer whether he disagreed that bin Laden was a martyr, he took a brief pause and said, "I will let that pass."Qureshi also deflected blame from the Taliban for the surge in violence in neighbouring Afghanistan. “You try and create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration. Aren't there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler?” said Qureshi, suggesting that Islamic State and the Afghan government were responsible.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-calling-osama-bin-laden-martyr-was-slip-of-tongue-says-pak-minister-101624791534542.html

The 50-page document was discovered with the help of an anonymous tip to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The UK government said that it was investigating how the documents landed there, adding that an internal inquiry had been launched into the matter.Also Read | How Matt Hancock footage got leaked to press, UK to investigateAccording to news agency AFP, the documents found at the bus stop contained 50 pages of top-secret information about Britain's ministry of defence, including a possible military presence in Afghanistan at the end of NATO operations there. Primarily, however, the papers dealt with the Russian reaction to the passage of a British warship through Ukrainian waters off the coast of Crimea.The warship in context is a British navy destroyer named the HMS Defender, which is sailing close to the coast of Crimea, as per the BBC. Russia had annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014, so it saw the British destroyer's presence in the Black Sea as a violation of its territorial waters and fired a series of warning shots in retaliation, the broadcaster added.It is to be noted that Russia's annexation of Crimea has still not been recognised by a vast majority of the international community. The UK, however, had denied any malintent and said the ship was simply making "an innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law."Also Read | UK liaison officer at Indian navy facility that monitors threats in Indian OceanNow, the retrieved documents seem to show that Britain already knew the kind of reaction it would provoke from Russia and yet continued to pursue its course, lest an alternate route made Moscow think of the UK as "being scared/running away". The papers also revealed that by letting the warship take this route, the UK government was, after all, hoping to gain an opportunity to "engage with the Ukrainian government... in what the UK recognises as Ukrainian territorial waters."The secret documents retrieved at the Kent bus stop were reported lost from the Ministry of Defence last week, the government said, adding that investigation is underway into the matter. "It shouldn't be able to happen," Brandon Lewis, minister for Northern Ireland, was quoted as saying. "It was properly reported at the time... there's an internal investigation into that situation," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-government-s-top-secret-defence-documents-found-at-bus-stop-in-kent-101624788619838.html

While the 90 million-strong member CPC has gone back to one leader party, especially after the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, experts warn that continuation of Xi after two terms could potentially be “very destabilising” for the party in the future.In a deviation from normal practice, CPC did not name a successor to the General Secretary during the second tenure of the party leadership, and the Chinese president is expected to remain as their paramount leader during the reshuffle of the party’s governing bodies at the twice-a-decade Party Congress next year.South China Morning Post said in its report Friday that the twice-a-decade Party Congress next year will shed light on how he plans to tackle succession. According to the Hong Kong-based daily, the succession plan could prove to be Xi’s biggest challenge and will shape the party for decades to come.Also Read | China inaugurates 1st fully electrified bullet train near Indo-Tibetan borderDeng Xiaoping, the moderate “paramount leader” of CPC who guided the party till 1997, invented a collective leadership structure that accommodated all groups and sections within the party. But Xi, unlike his predecessors, did not endorse a successor at the end of his first term in 2017 and observers suggest that the emergence of a new leadership line-up next year remains highly unlikely.Amid global adversity in the wake of a pandemic, Xi’s supporters project his leadership as the need of the hour for the country but, according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, that could spell trouble for the party. “When succession finally looms, it can potentially be very destabilising if the structure and/or process is not clear and well defined,” Tsang told the Washington Post.Also Read | Rap turns ‘100%’ patriotic in China for Communist party’s 100th birthdayNis Gruenberg, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told SCMP that though Xi has bought more time to establish his vision of the party-state by abolishing term limits, he has also inserted “enormous uncertainty” into the leadership system, “which...could destabilise the leadership system as soon as Xi...has gone.”Xi has solidified his own leadership position but potentially pushed the country towards a destabilising succession crisis, according to a joint report by the Centre for Strategic International Studies in the US and the Lowy Institute in Australia. The report, published earlier in April, suggests that China’s political path is shrouded in great uncertainty.“The global impact of a twenty-first century succession crisis would be immense,” the think-tanks said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-continuation-in-power-could-be-destabilising-for-party-experts-101624787129652.html

According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, it is likely that the US president's wife, First lady Jill Biden, will be making the trip on her own. Japan is looking forward to hosting her for the opening ceremony on July 23 and a possible meeting with prime minister Yoshihide Suga afterward, the newspaper added, without specifying its sources.Notably, US president Joe Biden has oft confirmed his support for Japanese prime minister Suga in holding the 2020 Tokyo Olympics this year, despite the threat of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic looming in the air. Japan is the United States' major ally in Asia, and it seems like Biden intends relations to remain cordial, with an eye on furthering diplomacies in the Korean peninsula.The 2020 Summer Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8 later this year, the reason behind the delayed date being Covid-19 related restrictions last time. It was originally slated to take place from July 24 to August 9 in 2020.Although Japan has said that the multi-sport event will not allow spectators, there are persistent worries among medical experts and public health professionals that holding the Tokyo Olympics could once again trigger a fresh wave of infections in the East Asian island nation.

He was replaced by Sajid Javid, former chancellor of the exchequer, marking the second high profile exit in the Boris Johnson-led government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-matt-hancock-footage-got-leaked-to-press-uk-to-investigate-101624786717713.html
27-06-2021||World||Don't copy Bollywood: Imran Khan's advice to Pakistani filmmakers||Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan has urged the country's filmmakers to focus on creating new and original content instead of just blatantly imitating Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry. Speaking at a short film festival in Islamabad, Khan said that mistakes were made initially as the Pakistani film industry was "influenced" by Bollywood, resulting in a culture that continued the practice of copying and adopting another nation's culture."So the most important thing I want to say to young filmmakers is that according to my experience of the world, only originality sells -- the copy has no value," Imran Khan said, according to the Dawn newspaper in Pakistan. He further emphasised the importance of originality and urged the Pakistani film industry to come up with new ways of thinking.Referring to the influence of Hollywood and Bollywood in Pakistan's popular culture, Imran Khan said people in the country do not purportedly watch local content unless it has a commercial spin. "So my (advice) to young filmmakers is to bring your own original thinking and don't fear failure," he was quoted as saying. "It is my life's experience that the one who is afraid of defeat can never win."Imran Khan's statements come amid the backdrop of Pakistan intending to revise its perception in the world. Speaking about Pakistan's "image" as perceived globally, Khan said that the country is misrepresented as "soft" due to a sense of inferiority and defensiveness ranging back to the so-called 'war on terror'. "The world respects those who respect themselves," said Imran Khan, adding that Pakistaniyat should be promoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-copy-bollywood-imran-khan-s-advice-to-pakistani-filmmakers-101624778426292.html
27-06-2021||World||Sajid Javid named UK health secretary after Matt Hancock quits over controversial 'affair'||Matt Hancock has resigned as the health secretary of the United Kingdom, news agencies reported on Sunday, after a massive public outcry over controversial photographs which exposed the British health minister kissing and embracing his top aide in office, flouting all coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols that he himself swore to uphold. Sajid Javid, former chancellor of the exchequer, was named as Hancock's replacement, news agency Bloomberg reported.Also Read | UK minister Matt Hancock, who broke Covid-19 rules by kissing aide, resignsSajid Javid, who has previously served two terms in the UK cabinet -- first as the chancellor of the exchequer and later as the home secretary -- walked back into the office of state on Saturday, this time as the health minister. He now holds the prime responsibility of taking on the reigns of the country's medical infrastructure amid what is arguably the toughest of recent medical crises -- the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only does Javid have to steer the United Kingdom out of what will hopefully be the final stages of the pandemic, but he will also need to catch up on a vast backlog of ministry operations, reported The Guardian, adding that an anxious health sector is keeping a close watch on this transition.Matt Hancock, in his resignation letter to UK prime minister Boris Johnson a day prior, mentioned that the government owes “it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down.” Notably, Johnson was under mounting pressure on Saturday to fire his health secretary after the admission that he broke Covid-19 guidelines by kissing the employee sparked accusations of blatant hypocrisy.Also Read | Matt Hancock ‘sorry’ for flouting Covid-19 rules“The last thing I would want is for my private life to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis,” Hancock wrote, taking responsibility for the current situation. “I want to reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologize to my family and loved ones for putting them through this,” he said. “I also need (to) be with my children at this time,” he said.British tabloid 'The Sun' had released photos and videos of the minister in an embrace and kissing his aide in an office at the Department of Health, evoking demands of resignation from the opposition Labour Party which termed his position "hopelessly untenable".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sajid-javid-named-uk-health-secretary-after-matt-hancock-quits-over-controversial-affair-101624760778265.html

Blinken called for allied nations of the United States to band in solidarity against challenges posed by an increasingly assertive China. "And I want to be clear on this, our goal is not to hold China back," he said, adding, "It is not to establish a policy against China. It is to support a free and open system based on the rules and standards that France and the United States established after WWII, and which have served us well."Also Read | ‘This means war’: China warns US over military ties with TaipeiThe statements come in the backdrop of recent criticisms at the G7 and NATO summits against Beijing's ambitious political gambits. While the participating countries took out joint statements criticising the Chinese government over its recent controversial exploits in human rights, trade ties, and coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic cooperation, there have been marked differences in the trans-Atlantic partnership regarding how exactly to go about it.The US prefers a hardline approach, calling out the Communist Party of China's lies at the outset, and it seemingly wants to take its allies down this road as well. In his interviews, president Joe Biden has described the US-China rivalry with an almost fantastic edge, framing it as a conflict of interest between democratic forces and autocratic regimes. On the other hand, its allies in Europe, particularly Germany, where chancellor Angela Merkel was instrumental in penning down an EU-China investment agreement deal, might not be too keen on openly antagonising China.Also Read | US unveils strategy to counter rising ChinaThe US administration realises that there is a disparity in approach, and has hence called for greater convergence among its allies. Even so, the gains made in the G7 summit seem to have bolstered US confidence in its allies, at least for now. In an interview with the office of the spokesperson in Paris, Antony Blinken said, "What I've seen, especially these last few weeks, is a convergence with regard to the approach to China and I think we see it the same way."When asked about the reported difference between the US and its allies over China, Blinken simply said that the relationships that these countries share are too "complicated" to be effectively summed up in a single word or sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-not-trying-to-hold-back-china-but-set-up-a-free-and-open-system-101624757783271.html

"Vaccination plus masks, because just a vaccine is not enough with 'Delta.' We need to make an effort over a short period of time, otherwise there would be a lockdown," Vujnovic said on the live YouTube show, according to news agency ANI.Vujnovic said that vaccination is essential because it lowers the probability of spreading the virus and lowers the risks of severe disease. Vujnovic warned that "additional measures" will probably be required as well. She was speaking to talk show host Vladimir Solovyov on his “Solovyov LIVE”.Also read | Delta Plus a Covid-19 'variant of concern' in India: Health ministryThe Delta plus variant, which is also known as AY.1, spreads more easily, binds more easily to lung cells and is potentially resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy, which is a potent intravenous infusion of antibodies to neutralise the virus.WHO, earlier this month, included the Delta variant in its list of variants of concern as the strain became prevalent and has caused a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in several countries. India has also reported multiple cases of the Delta Plus strain, which was first discovered in March.The Centre said on Friday the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus has spread to 12 states in the country and that Maharashtra has reported the highest number of cases at 22.On Saturday, authorities in Gujarat's Surat said that a case of Delta Plus variant was confirmed in a person in the city.

27-06-2021||World||For George Floyd’s murder, Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22.5 years in prison||A US court on Friday sentenced former police officer Derek Chauvin to 22 and a half years in jail for the murder of African-American George Floyd, whose death last year led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the US in generations.Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12-and-a-half-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing Chauvin’s “abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd.“This (jail term) is based on your abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty shown to George Floyd,” Cahill told Chauvin.The punishment - which came after Chauvin broke his yearlong silence to offer condolences to the Floyd family and express hope that they eventually have “some peace of mind” - is one of the longest prison terms ever imposed on a US police officer in the killing of a Black person.Still, Floyd family members and others were disappointed. The sentence fell short of the 30 years prosecutors had requested. And with good behaviour, Chauvin, 45, could get out on parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years.Floyd’s brother Rodney called the sentence a slap on the wrist, saying the family has “suffered a life sentence for not having him in our life, and that hurts me to death”.Outside the courthouse, a crowd of about 50 people clasped hands or placed them on each other’s shoulders. The reaction was subdued as people debated whether the sentence was long enough.At George Floyd Square, as the intersection where Floyd was pinned to the pavement is now known, members of the crowd broke into applause, and several said, “We’ll take it.”The fired white officer was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for up to 9 and a half minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn’t breathe and went limp on May 25, 2020.President Joe Biden called the sentence appropriate. “I don’t know all the circumstances that were considered but it seems to be under the guidelines, that seem to be appropriate,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-george-floyd-s-murder-derek-chauvin-sentenced-to-22-5-years-in-prison-101624754924388.html

He dismissed a US intelligence report that has forecast the fall of Kabul within six months of the departure of the last of US troops, scheduled for as early as July, saying such dire prediction “turned out false” in the past.In the bluntest remarks on the issue yet, secretary of state Antony Blinken said in Paris on Thursday that the US is assessing the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and “whether the Taliban is, at all, serious about a peaceful resolution of the conflict”.“Our troops may be leaving but our support for Afghanistan is not ending in terms of support and maintenance of helping maintain their military as well as economic and political support,” Biden said, seeking to assure the Afghan leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-assures-afghanistan-of-support-after-troop-drawdown-101624749476262.html

In a news conference, she described the blaze as “very deep” and said rescuers faced “incredible difficulties” because of the flames.A fire hose blasted one of the lower floors on the north side of the tower as white smoke or steam streamed out, and a bitter, sulfur-like smell hung in the air.“The stench is very thick,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said.A crane removed pieces of debris from the more than 30-foot pile in the city of Surfside, and scores of rescuers used big machines, small buckets, drones, microphones and their own hands to pick through the rubble.Among those anxiously awaiting word of missing loved ones was Rachel Spiegel, whose mother, 66-year-old Judy Spiegel, lived on the sixth floor. Speaking alongside her siblings, she said Saturday that “we’re trying to hold it together.”“I know my mom is a fighter. I know she loves us. I know she doesn’t want to give up. So, you know, it’s day three, so it’s hard,” Spiegel said.One hundred fifty-nine people were still unaccounted for two days after Thursday's collapse, which killed at least four.Authorities announced they were beginning an audit of buildings nearing their 40-year review — like the fallen Champlain Towers South — to make sure they’re safe. The mayor asked other cities in the county to join the building review and said there will be state and federal funding to help.Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have joined local and state authorities at the site, DeSantis said. He added that a nearby “sister building” of the collapsed tower is also being looked at because it was built at the same time and with the same designer.Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said he was working on a plan to temporarily relocate residents of the Champlain Towers North, which was constructed the same year and sits about 100 yards away from the collapsed building, and that FEMA has agreed to pay for lodging.Burkett added that he was also trying to arrange an emergency inspection and until that happens, he can’t tell residents whether they’re safe in their homes.“I know that the identical building collapsed for an inexplicable reason,” Burkett said. “Buildings in the United States do not just fall down. ... Something very, very wrong was going on at that building, and we need to find out.”The mayor said he didn't plan to order residents to evacuate, but if he lived there, “I’d be gone.”Surfside city staffers were also gathering details about a third building, Champlain Towers East, which was built in a different style and appears to have been constructed at a different time.The news came after word of a 2018 engineering report that showed the building had “major structural damage” to a concrete slab below its pool deck that needed extensive repairs, part of a series of documents released by the city of Surfside.While officials said no cause for the collapse early Thursday has been determined, DeSantis said a “definitive answer” was needed in a timely manner. Video showed the center of the building appearing to tumble down first, followed by a section nearer to the beach.The 2018 report was part of preliminary work by the engineering company conducting the building’s required inspections for a recertification due this year of the building’s structural integrity at 40 years. The condominium tower was built in 1981.The government of Israel said it was sending a team of engineering and rescue specialists to assist in the search. Israeli media have reported that some 20 citizens of that country were believed to be among the missing.Another 22 people unaccounted for were from Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Paraguay, including relatives of Paraguayan first lady Silvana de Abdo Benítez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deep-fire-slowing-rescue-effort-at-collapsed-florida-condo-101624737684652.html
27-06-2021||World||Moderna, Pfizer vaccines warn of heart inflammation risk||In a rare side effect of the coronavirus vaccine shots, the product information about the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is now warning about the increased risk for heart inflammation, reported Associated Press.However, the benefits and the protection offered by the vaccines against the deadly infection outweighs the risk posed by the side effect which is evident commonly in people under 30, government officials said. Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 1,200 cases of heart inflammation in people who received messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines.The risk from the vaccine is surfacing particularly after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and the symptoms usually appear within a few days of vaccination, the Food and Drugs Administration said. Those witnessing mildest of symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or a fast, fluttering or pounding heart after vaccination, should immediately seek medical attention, officials said.The update in fact sheets for patients and health care providers appeared on Friday on the website. In a joint statement, top government health officials and medical organisations said the side effect is "extremely rare" and usually mild in young people. People who see these side-effects recover on their own or with minimal treatment, the statement said. More than 130 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with mRNA shots, according to the CDC, and there have been few reports of serious adverse effects. Two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimens made by Moderna Inc. and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE rely on the technology.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-pfizer-vaccines-warn-of-heart-inflammation-risk-101624733897021.html
