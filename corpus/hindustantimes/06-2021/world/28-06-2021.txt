Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.The Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found that an AstraZeneca jab followed by Pfizer induced higher antibodies and T cell responses than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.Both of these mixes induced higher antibodies than two doses of AstraZeneca, the report said.The highest antibody response was seen after two doses of Pfizer, and the highest T cell response from AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer, it said.Lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: "We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart."He said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK. "This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response," he added. Mixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-vaccines-gives-good-protection-against-covid-19-uk-study-101624903784227.html
28-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Indonesia to vaccinate citizens aged 12 and older||Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo announced Monday that his government will administer Covid-19 vaccines for children as young as 12 after the country’s Food and Drug Monitoring Agency green-lighted emergency use of the Sinovac vaccine for children.Widodo said in a video statement that he was grateful that the agency has issued an emergency use of authorization for the Sinovac vaccine so that “vaccination for children that age can start immediately.”He has asked authorities to boost the country’s vaccination rollout to two million shots a day by August from the current level of about 1 million a day, as a second wave of infections engulfs Southeast Asia country.Monday’s announcement came a day after health authorities announced the country’s largest one-day jump in new coronavirus infections, the second day in a row, as the Health Ministry reported 21,342 new cases and 409 deaths over the past 24 hours.The latest tally on Monday showed the country’s total confirmed cases since the pandemic began at more than 2.1 million, the most in Southeast Asia, including confirmed fatalities to more than 57,100.Authorities have so far only fully vaccinated 13.1 million of Indonesia’s 270 million people and partially vaccinated another 14.2 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-indonesia-to-vaccinate-citizens-aged-12-and-older-101624902051056.html
28-06-2021||World||Wuhan lab scientist says no virus was made to infect people. Explains why||Danielle Anderson was working in what has become the world’s most notorious laboratory just weeks before the first known cases of Covid-19 emerged in central China. Yet, the Australian virologist still wonders what she missed.An expert in bat-borne viruses, Anderson is the only foreign scientist to have undertaken research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s BSL-4 lab, the first in mainland China equipped to handle the planet’s deadliest pathogens. Her most recent stint ended in November 2019, giving Anderson an insider’s perspective on a place that’s become a flashpoint in the search for what caused the worst pandemic in a century.The emergence of the coronavirus in the same city where institute scientists, clad head-to-toe in protective gear, study that exact family of viruses has stoked speculation that it might have leaked from the lab, possibly via an infected staffer or a contaminated object. China’s lack of transparency since the earliest days of the outbreak fueled those suspicions, which have been seized on by the US. That’s turned the quest to uncover the origins of the virus, critical for preventing future pandemics, into a geopolitical minefield.The work of the lab and the director of its emerging infectious diseases section—Shi Zhengli, a long-time colleague of Anderson’s dubbed ‘Batwoman’ for her work hunting viruses in caves—is now shrouded in controversy. The US has questioned the lab’s safety and alleged its scientists were engaged in contentious gain of function research that manipulated viruses in a manner that could have made them more dangerous.It’s a stark contrast to the place Anderson described in an interview with Bloomberg News, the first in which she’s shared details about working at the lab.Half-truths and distorted information have obscured an accurate accounting of the lab's functions and activities, which were more routine than how they’ve been portrayed in the media, she said.“It’s not that it was boring, but it was a regular lab that worked in the same way as any other high-containment lab,” Anderson said. “What people are saying is just not how it is.”Now at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Anderson began collaborating with Wuhan researchers in 2016, when she was scientific director of the biosafety lab at Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School. Her research—which focuses on why lethal viruses like Ebola and Nipah cause no disease in the bats in which they perpetually circulate—complemented studies underway at the Chinese institute, which offered funding to encourage international collaboration.A rising star in the virology community, Anderson, 42, says her work on Ebola in Wuhan was the realization of a life-long career goal. Her favorite movie is “Outbreak,” the 1995 film in which disease experts respond to a dangerous new virus—a job Anderson said she wanted to do. For her, that meant working on Ebola in a high-containment laboratory. Anderson’s career has taken her all over the world. After obtaining an undergraduate degree from Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, she worked as a lab technician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, then returned to Australia to complete a PhD under the supervision of eminent virologists John Mackenzie and Linfa Wang. She did post-doctoral work in Montreal, before moving to Singapore and working again with Wang, who described Anderson as “very committed and dedicated,” and similar in personality to Shi. “They’re both very blunt with such high moral standards,” Wang said by phone from Singapore, where he’s the director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School. “I’m very proud of what Danielle’s been able to do.”On the GroundAnderson was on the ground in Wuhan when experts believe the virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, was beginning to spread. Daily visits for a period in late 2019 put her in close proximity to many others working at the 65-year-old research center. She was part of a group that gathered each morning at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to catch a bus that shuttled them to the institute about 20 miles away.As the sole foreigner, Anderson stood out, and she said the other researchers there looked out for her.“We went to dinners together, lunches, we saw each other outside of the lab,” she said.From her first visit before it formally opened in 2018, Anderson was impressed with the institute’s maximum biocontainment lab. The concrete, bunker-style building has the highest biosafety designation, and requires air, water and waste to be filtered and sterilized before it leaves the facility. There were strict protocols and requirements aimed at containing the pathogens being studied, Anderson said, and researchers underwent 45 hours of training to be certified to work independently in the lab.The induction process required scientists to demonstrate their knowledge of containment procedures and their competency in wearing air-pressured suits. “It’s very, very extensive,” Anderson said.Entering and exiting the facility was a carefully choreographed endeavor, she said. Departures were made especially intricate by a requirement to take both a chemical shower and a personal shower—the timings of which were precisely planned.Special DisinfectantsThese rules are mandatory across BSL-4 labs, though Anderson noted differences compared with similar facilities in Europe, Singapore and Australia in which she’s worked. The Wuhan lab uses a bespoke method to make and monitor its disinfectants daily, a system Anderson was inspired to introduce in her own lab. She was connected via a headset to colleagues in the lab’s command center to enable constant communication and safety vigilance—steps designed to ensure nothing went awry.However, the Trump administration’s focus in 2020 on the idea the virus escaped from the Wuhan facility suggested that something went seriously wrong at the institute, the only one to specialize in virology, viral pathology and virus technology of the some 20 biological and biomedical research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Virologists and infectious disease experts initially dismissed the theory, noting that viruses jump from animals to humans with regularity. There was no clear evidence from within SARS-CoV-2’s genome that it had been artificially manipulated, or that the lab harbored progenitor strains of the pandemic virus. Political observers suggested the allegations had a strategic basis and were designed to put pressure on Beijing.And yet, China’s actions raised questions. The government refused to allow international scientists into Wuhan in early 2020 when the outbreak was mushrooming, including experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who were already in the region.Beijing stonewalled on allowing World Health Organization experts into Wuhan for more than a year, and then provided only limited access. The WHO team’s final report, written with and vetted by Chinese researchers, played down the possibility of a lab leak. Instead, it said the virus probably spread via a bat through another animal, and gave some credence to a favored Chinese theory that it could have been transferred via frozen food.Never SickChina’s obfuscation led outside researchers to reconsider their stance. Last month, 18 scientists writing in the journal Science called for an investigation into Covid-19’s origins that would give balanced consideration to the possibility of a lab accident. Even the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the lab theory hadn’t been studied extensively enough.But it’s US President Joe Biden’s consideration of the idea—previously dismissed by many as a Trumpist conspiracy theory—that has given it newfound legitimacy. Biden called on America’s intelligence agencies last month to redouble their efforts in rooting out the genesis of Covid-19 after an earlier report, disclosed by the Wall Street Journal, claimed three researchers from the lab were hospitalized with flu-like symptoms in November 2019.Anderson said no one she knew at the Wuhan institute was ill toward the end of 2019. Moreover, there is a procedure for reporting symptoms that correspond with the pathogens handled in high-risk containment labs.“If people were sick, I assume that I would have been sick—and I wasn’t,” she said. “I was tested for coronavirus in Singapore before I was vaccinated, and had never had it.”Not only that, many of Anderson’s collaborators in Wuhan came to Singapore at the end of December for a gathering on Nipah virus. There was no word of any illness sweeping the laboratory, she said.“There was no chatter,” Anderson said. “Scientists are gossipy and excited. There was nothing strange from my point of view going on at that point that would make you think something is going on here.”The names of the scientists reported to have been hospitalized haven’t been disclosed. The Chinese government and Shi Zhengli, the lab’s now-famous bat-virus researcher, have repeatedly denied that anyone from the facility contracted Covid-19. Anderson’s work at the facility, and her funding, ended after the pandemic emerged and she focused on the novel coronavirus. ‘I’m Not Naive’It’s not that it’s impossible the virus spilled from there. Anderson, better than most people, understands how a pathogen can escape from a laboratory. SARS, an earlier coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2002 and killed more than 700 people, subsequently made its way out of secure facilities a handful of times, she said. If presented with evidence that such an accident spawned Covid-19, Anderson “could foresee how things could maybe happen,” she said. “I’m not naive enough to say I absolutely write this off.” And yet, she still believes it most likely came from a natural source. Since it took researchers almost a decade to pin down where in nature the SARS pathogen emerged, Anderson says she’s not surprised they haven’t found the “smoking gun” bat responsible for the latest outbreak yet. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is large enough that Anderson said she didn’t know what everyone was working on at the end of 2019. She is aware of published research from the lab that involved testing viral components for their propensity to infect human cells. Anderson is convinced no virus was made intentionally to infect people and deliberately released—one of the more disturbing theories to have emerged about the pandemic’s origins.Gain of FunctionAnderson did concede that it would be theoretically possible for a scientist in the lab to be working on a gain of function technique to unknowingly infect themselves and to then unintentionally infect others in the community. But there’s no evidence that occurred and Anderson rated its likelihood as exceedingly slim.Getting authorization to create a virus in this way typically requires many layers of approval, and there are scientific best practices that put strict limits on this kind of work. For example, a moratorium was placed on research that could be done on the 1918 Spanish Flu virus after scientists isolated it decades later.Even if such a gain of function effort got clearance, it’s hard to achieve, Anderson said. The technique is called reverse genetics.“It’s exceedingly difficult to actually make it work when you want it to work,” she said.Anderson’s lab in Singapore was one of the first to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from a Covid patient outside China and then to grow the virus. It was complicated and challenging, even for a team used to working with coronaviruses that knew its biological characteristics, including which protein receptor it targets. These key facets wouldn’t be known by anyone trying to craft a new virus, she said. Even then, the material that researchers study—the virus’s basic building blocks and genetic fingerprint—aren’t initially infectious, so they would need to culture significant amounts to infect people.Despite this, Anderson does think an investigation is needed to nail down the virus’s origin once and for all. She’s dumbfounded by the portrayal of the lab by some media outside China, and the toxic attacks on scientists that have ensued.One of a dozen experts appointed to an international taskforce in November to study the origins of the virus, Anderson hasn’t sought public attention, especially since being targeted by US extremists in early 2020 after she exposed false information about the pandemic posted online. The vitriol that ensued prompted her to file a police report. The threats of violence many coronavirus scientists have experienced over the past 18 months have made them hesitant to speak out because of the risk that their words will be misconstrued.The elements known to trigger infectious outbreaks—the mixing of humans and animals, especially wildlife—were present in Wuhan, creating an environment conducive for the spillover of a new zoonotic disease. In that respect, the emergence of Covid-19 follows a familiar pattern. What’s shocking to Anderson is the way it unfurled into a global contagion.“The pandemic is something no one could have imagined on this scale,” she said. Researchers must study Covid's calamitous path to determine what went wrong and how to stop the spread of future pathogens with pandemic potential.“The virus was in the right place at the right time and everything lined up to cause this disaster.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-scientist-says-no-virus-was-made-to-infect-people-explains-why-101624901328409.html
28-06-2021||World||CCTV camera that caught Matt Hancock's affair removed, says Javid||The United Kingdom government has removed the mysterious CCTV camera that captured former health minister Matt Hancock who engaging and kissing an aide in the government's departmental office, successor Sajid Javid said on Monday. This comes two days after ex-health minister Matt Hancock was forced to resign for he broke Covid-19 guidance amid staunch opposition from Labour Party.Javid, UK's new health minister, was questioned about the secret device placed in Hancock's office as Cabinet ministers ordered a sweep of their offices. The UK government has moved to probe how was the camera placed inside the minister's office smoke alarm and how the footage was leaked in a security breach, forcing Hancock's exit from Boris-led government. "I haven't disabled the camera that you are talking about, but it has been disabled by the department,” Javid told reporters, as he began his new job at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).“I think for security it is just common sense… I don't think, as a general rule, there should be cameras in the secretary of state's office. I've never known that in the other five departments that I've run and I am not really sure why there was one here. But I am sure there will be more to this as the whole incident is investigated," said the Pakistani-origin politician who has previously held UK Cabinet posts as Home Secretary and Chancellor.In his letter of resignation to PM Johnson, Hancock said that the government owes “it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down.”British PM Boris Johnson was under mounting pressure on Saturday to fire his health secretary after the admission that he broke Covid-19 guidelines by kissing an employee sparked accusations of blatant hypocrisy.The 42-year-old minister has been at the centre of the government's fight against the pandemic, routinely telling people to follow strict rules and even welcoming the resignation last year of a senior scientist who broke restrictions in a similar manner.British tabloids 'The Sun' has released photos and videos of the minister in an embrace and kissing his aide in an office at the Department of Health, evoking demands of resignation from the Opposition Labour Party which termed his position "hopelessly untenable".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cctv-camera-that-caught-uk-minister-matt-hancock-s-affair-removed-says-javid-101624894518226.html
28-06-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna vaccines provide lasting protection: Study||Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA-based vaccines provide “persistent” and lasting protection for years from Covid-19, says a new study in Nature publication on Monday.“Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC (germinal centre) B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity,” the authors said in an abstract of their study, referring to memory cells found in lymph nodes, where immune cells are educated to detect and fight the virus.Booster doses of these vaccines would probably not be needed as had been previously felt necessary, unless the virus evolves way beyond its current variants.Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who led the study, told The New York Times they did not look at the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but he added he expected it to be less effective than the mRNA-based versions. Also not included, it appeared, was AstraZeneca, which retails in India as Covishield.But the good news for India, which is battling a devastating second wave of Covid-19 driven in part by the new Delta variant of SARS-CoV2, is that it is engaged in talks at the highest levels to find a way to authorise Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.Earlier research had indicated that only those who had survived Covid-19 infection and had been fully vaccinated acquired a persistent and lasting protection from the virus.After an infection, a specialised structure called a germinal centre forms in the lung, which serves as a school for memory B cells to recognise the virus. In vaccinated people, these germinal centres are formed in lymph nodes in the armpits.“Everyone always focuses on the virus evolving - this is showing that the B cells are doing the same thing,” Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the New York Times. “And it’s going to be protective against ongoing evolution of the virus, which is really encouraging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-provide-lasting-protection-study-101624899914092.html
28-06-2021||World||US Covid-19 cases hit new plateau as Delta variant rises||After declining fast for two months, the rate of Covid infections in the United States has leveled off since mid-June thanks to localized spikes in under-vaccinated regions of the country, data showed Monday.It comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to gain traction, now accounting for 35.6 percent of sequenced cases in the past two weeks, according to the covSpectrum tracker. Authorities have said it is poised to soon become the country's dominant strain.The seven-day-average of new daily cases has hovered at around 11,500 since June 16, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or about 3.5 per 100,000 people.A clear divide has emerged across the country, with cases rising rapidly in communities that have low rates of vaccination.For example, the city of Springfield in the midwestern state of Missouri is experiencing a surge of 36.8 new cases per 100,000, and has just 35 percent of its population vaccinated with one or more doses, a dashboard maintained by Covid ActNow showed.On the other hand, Burlington in the northeastern state of Vermont is seeing just 0.9 new cases per 100,000, and has 71 percent of its population vaccinated with one or more doses.Nationally, 54 percent of the United States' 332 million people have received one or more doses while 46.1 percent have had two doses, according to the CDC.The national immunization drive peaked in mid-April but has been declining since, with vaccine hesitancy much higher in states that lean Republican than those that predominantly vote for Democrats.Cases dropped steeply across the country from mid-April to the beginning of June, a period that coincided with spring weather and increased socialization outdoors.The summer heat however has brought more people indoors, where the primarily airborne respiratory illness mostly spreads. Air conditioning contributes by drying out the air and making conditions more favorable for the virus to remain viable.All of this spells danger for unvaccinated people, who are more exposed than ever in the face of the highly contagious Delta variant.According to research from Britain, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88 percent effective in protecting against symptomatic disease from Delta, but just 33 percent after one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-hit-new-plateau-as-delta-variant-rises-101624897958705.html
28-06-2021||World||'America Tirupati': US Hindu temple holds Maha Kumbhabhishekam||When throngs gathered to rededicate the oldest major Hindu temple in the United States, there was poignance -- prayers for continued recovery from the pandemic that struck many loved ones in India -- and the elation of coming together after more than a year of restrictions.And there was joy.Shouts of the divine name “Govinda!” rose Sunday from the crowd of worshippers at the Sri Venkateswara Temple, atop a steep hill just east of Pittsburgh. Dressed in festive saris and other traditional clothing, they gazed up toward a gopuram — an ornamented temple tower whose white, newly restored facade gleamed brilliantly in the mid-day sun.High above, priests stood on scaffolding and lifted ceremonial urns, pouring holy waters onto golden spires atop the gopuram.They repeated the ritual on three smaller towers at the center of the temple. There were drumbeats and the horn-like fanfares of a nathaswaram, a traditional Indian reed instrument, and floral petals soon came wafting down on the devotees from a helicopter overhead.Known as Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a reference to the sprinkling of holy water from ceremonial urns, the festival is traditionally held at Hindu temples once every 12 years to reharmonize and boost the spiritual energies of the temple and its deities.Several hundred devotees from surrounding states arrived throughout Sunday, culminating five days of prayers, chants and other rituals at outdoor fire altars. More than 20 priests took part, wearing yellow or saffron vestments around their waists; most were visiting from other North American temples.The Sri Venkateswara Temple is much smaller than its massive prototype, a temple by the same name in the southern Indian city of Tirupati. Still, this Pittsburgh suburb has become a pilgrimage destination for Hindus throughout North America and a landmark in the growing landscape of Hinduism in America. There are now hundreds of temples across the country, and about 1 percent of American adults now identify as Hindu, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center report.Kalathur Raghu, one of the temple’s founding members, recalled a much smaller ceremony on a chilly November day in 1976 to dedicate the new temple. “I think none of us expected to get to this level when we started,” he said.The temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, considered an incarnation of Vishnu, a deity associated with protection and preservation who is also known by Govinda. The stone murti, or statue, of Venkateswara stands at the holiest spot in the temple. Images of other deities stand nearby, such as those of Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, and Bhoodevi, goddess of the earth.Devotees streamed into the temple Sunday afternoon to offer devotions to the deities at their newly rededicated shrines. There, priests chanted and bathed the statues in water, milk, honey and other traditional offerings, while devotees cupped their hands and received priests’ blessings.A Maha Kumbhabhishekam has both practical and spiritual significance.The ceremony is typically held every 12 years because it is believed that over time, the spiritual energies at a temple need to be ceremonially reharmonized. (In the earlier years of the Sri Venkateswara Temple, the intervals between ceremonies were longer than 12 years.)On a practical level, the temple is temporarily deconsecrated in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, enabling repairs in areas normally off-limits to all but priests. At the Sri Venkateswara Temple, contractors renovated everything from ventilation to weather-worn ornamentation.Volunteers also prepared for months. In days before the festival, women in saris wove garlands from thousands of mango leaves and carnations to decorate the tent and other festival areas.“For one and a half years we were miserable” during the pandemic, said Nagamani Kasi, the temple’s joint treasurer. “We didn’t get to do anything. … This is like going back to normal and enjoying it. It’s good timing.”The festival also included a large distribution of food to a nearby health center, which followed several other donations for pandemic relief locally and to India.The ceremonies began officially last Wednesday in a tent in the temple parking lot.Priests took turns chanting from the Vedas, four ancient scriptural texts, and tending to sacred fires at seven altars. Smaller idols of Venkateswara and other deities stood in front.The scent of incense and woodsmoke mingled with the humid summer air as the amplified voices of the priests rang out for hours each day. The priests chanted at times in unison, at other times in a call-and-response led by the clarion voice of Sri Venkateswara Temple head priest Samudrala Venkatacharyulu.At various points, priests led devotees in processions around the tent.The prayers are not just on behalf of the devotees but that the “whole universe be healthy and happy” and that the coronavirus “go away soon,” said Venkatacharyulu. He arrived here in 1982 at age 21 from the mother temple in India for a two-year assignment, which has stretched to nearly 40 and counting, in what he calls the “America Tirupati.”Hinduism historically had a tiny following in the United States, but its American profile grew following a 1965 congressional act that opened the doors to more immigrants from Asia and elsewhere.Pittsburgh drew Indian immigrants to engineering, medical and educational careers, and the Hindu community began to coalesce by the early 1970s, when a small group of children met in a theater basement to study classical Indian dance. “We would go and do a little prayer and then start the dance class,” recalled the instructor, Mani Manoharan.Community leaders concluded “we have to have a temple” and mobilized funds and other volunteer efforts, recalled Raghu. The Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati contributed funds and sent craftsmen and priests to help.The Pittsburgh region’s Indian population was “not a large community at that time,” Raghu said, “but we had the passion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hindu-temple-holds-maha-kumbhabhishekam-sees-timely-rite-of-rejuvenation-101624897676280.html
28-06-2021||World||England’s pandemic ordeal set to end in next 21 days, says UK PM Johnson||England is “very likely” to be freed from pandemic restrictions on July 19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, as he predicted the country is just three weeks away from returning to “life before Covid.”Despite a surge in infections of the new delta variant, hospitalization and death rates remain relatively low as the UK’s vaccine program progresses, he said.Johnson confirmed there will not be an early release from England’s social-distancing rules on July 5, which was an option if data had been good enough. He said it is “sensible” to take a few more weeks to analyze the infection patterns and deliver more second vaccine doses before lifting the curbs.“With every day that goes by it’s clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we’re very likely to be in a position on July 19 to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible,” Johnson told reporters Monday.Entertainment and hospitality businesses including nightclubs and theaters have been shut due to the need to operate social distancing rules.While many bosses will welcome Johnson’s upbeat assessment, others are likely to remember they have been disappointed before, after plans to lift the limits on social gatherings were delayed by a month.Under the delayed timetable, all legal rules on social distancing are due to be scrapped from July 19, allowing nightclubs to reopen for the first time since March 2020. Audience limits will also be dropped for theater, concert and sports venues under the plan.New Health Secretary Sajid Javid will set out the government’s latest position in more detail in Parliament on Monday.Even though domestic rules are set to be eased, Britons face a harder time traveling overseas, as other countries impose curbs on arrivals from the UK in response to the rise in the delta variant. The authorities in Portugal, Spain and Hong Kong all announced new restrictions on British travelers.Johnson said he and Javid had spoken and reviewed the pandemic data on Sunday and concluded the best option would be to wait a “few more weeks” to deliver another 5 million vaccine doses before easing the remaining rules for England. Separate rules are in place in other parts of the UK.Both Javid and the prime minister say they want to take a cautious approach to lifting restrictions so that curbs do not need to be reimposed again.LockdownsThe government has put England into a hard lockdown three times since the pandemic began, after relaxations in the rules led cases to surge.Johnson said that while data showed a significant rise in cases of the new delta variant -- with coronavirus infections at the highest level since February -- the link between cases, hospitalizations and deaths has been “interrupted.” That’s an “encouraging” sign that the vaccine program is working, Johnson said.Johnson tried to brush aside questions about the scandal that prompted Matt Hancock to quit as health secretary on Saturday after admitting he broke social-distancing rules.Asked why he hadn’t fired the minister when the story broke, Johnson suggested he had in fact concluded Hancock should go after learning of the details on Friday.That prompted questions over whether Hancock resigned or was removed.

28-06-2021||World||Pak PM Imran Khan’s aide made secret visit to Israel: Report||A former aide of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan made a secret visit to Israel last November for meetings with foreign ministry officials and the then Mossad chief, according to an Israeli media report on Monday. Sayed Zulfi Bukhari, a British Pakistani businessman who served as Khan’s special assistant on overseas Pakistanis till May this year, conveyed a message from the Pakistani premier to Israeli foreign ministry officials and another message from Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa to then Israeli spy chief Yossi Cohen, Israel Hayom newspaper reported. The report said Bukhari, who lives in the UK, arrived at Ben Gurion airport from Islamabad on a connecting flight to London in the last week of November, taking advantage of his British passport. He travelled to Tel Aviv for the meetings and the Pakistan-Israel contacts were the outcome of “heavy pressure from the UAE”, the report added.Bukhari denied the report in a tweet. “DID NOT go to Israel. Funny bit is Pakistani paper says I went to Israel based on ‘Israeli news source’ & Israeli paper says I went to Israel based on a ‘Pakistani source’ – wonder who this imaginative Pakistani source is,” he tweeted, referring to reports in the Pakistani and Israeli media about the matter. “Apparently, I’m the only one who was kept out of the loop,” Bukhari added. Also Read | Imran Khan calling bin Laden ‘martyr’ was ‘slip of tongue’, says Pak minister In December 2020, Israel Hayom had reported about a secret visit to Israel by a “senior adviser to the leader of a large Muslim-majority country” despite the two countries having no diplomatic relations. At the time, the newspaper didn’t name the Muslim country involved. On Monday, Israel Hayom identified the country as Pakistan after getting clearance from the Israeli military censor. Monday’s reported cited a source in Islamabad. The visit to Tel Aviv by the Pakistani official came against the backdrop of key Muslim countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco normalising relations with Israel and a debate within Pakistan’s political and diplomatic circles about re-evaluating the country’s position on Israel. However, Khan had said in an interview in August last year that Pakistan “cannot ever accept Israel as long as Palestinians are not given their rights and there is no just settlement”. Khan had appointed Bukhari as his special assistant on overseas Pakistanis and human resource development a month after assuming office in September 2018. Bukhari, who had the status of a minister of state, resigned from the post on May 17 this year following allegations that he had illegally benefited from changes made to the Rawalpindi Ring Road project. Bukhari had denied allegations that he had received financial benefits because his land was located near the project. Israel Hayom’s report would suggest this was the first formal contact between Pakistan and Israel since the era of former military dictator Pervez Musharraf. At Musharraf’s initiative and with backing from Pakistan’s ally Turkey, then Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri met his Israeli counterpart Silvan Shalom in the Turkish city of Istanbul on September 1, 2005. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Pakistan-Israel contacts in 2005 had not led to any substantial engagement and had subsequently fizzled out. In a statement issued by the Israeli foreign ministry in 2005, Shalom had described his meeting with Kasuri as “historic” and said Israeli hoped it would “herald the beginning of an open and mutually beneficial relationship” between the two countries. Shalom also thanked Musharraf “for his courage in promoting peace and moderation in our region”.There was no official word from the Pakistan government on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-s-aide-made-secret-visit-to-israelreport-101624872674038.html
28-06-2021||World||China operationalises Baihetan hydro project, biggest since Three Gorges||Two units of the giant Baihetan hydropower plant, said to be the largest one under construction globally, on the Yangtze river in southwest China generated electricity for the first time on Monday, state media reported.The project’s first two 1-gigawatt (GW) turbines will go into formal operation after a three-day trial that began on Monday, national broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV) said.Built by the China Three Gorges Corporation - operator of the world’s largest hydropower plant in the world, the Three Gorges Dam - the Baihetan is located on the border between the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.It is on the Jinsha, the upstream section of the Yangtze river, the longest in Asia.The dam has been operationalised in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1, state media reported, adding that it was a symbol of how efficient CPC is in planning and completing large-scale projects.“With a total installed capacity of 16 million kilowatts, the hydropower station is equipped with 16 hydro-generating units, each with a capacity of 1 million kilowatts, the largest single-unit capacity in the world,” the Xinhua news agency reported on Monday. That will make it second in size after the Three Gorges Dam, opened in 2003 on the Yangtze, with 22.5 million kilowatts of generating capacity, the Associated Press reported.The trial operation is limited to generators 1 and 14 while the remaining 14 generators of the hydropower station are expected to be put into use by July 2022.One of China’s biggest and most challenging engineering projects - as it had to tackle a set of complex geological and technical issues with a dam height of 289m - it has taken only four years to build, state media reported.Earlier this month, all 12 units of the Wudongde hydropower station, the world’s seventh-largest, on Jinsha river near the Yunnan and Sichuan border were also operationalised.With a total installed capacity of 10.2 million kilowatts, the Wudongde hydropower station is a key project in China’s west-east power transmission programme.The station’s construction began in late 2015, and it started to generate electricity in late June last year.By the middle of June, the station had produced 24.5 billion kWh of electricity, equal to that generated by around 7.68 million tonnes of standard coal, Wang Jintao, head of the Wudongde electricity plant under China Three Gorges Corporation, told Xinhua news agency.In its latest five-year plan covering the period of 2021-25, Sichuan province aims to complete the construction of 10 hydropower plants and start building another seven.Environmental groups have criticised the large-scale damming of the Yangtze and its tributaries because of concerns the over-engineering of the river has destroyed major habitats and damaged natural flood plains, Reuters news agency said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-operationalises-baihetan-hydro-project-biggest-since-three-gorges-101624871112696.html

28-06-2021||World||Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the world||North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s weight has always been a talking point around the world. He disappeared from the public eyes for nearly a month, and resurfaced in June, but this time, a lot slimmer.The latest buzz around Kim’s weight started after an unnamed resident of North Korean capital Pyongyang said on tightly controlled state media that people “were most heartbroken when they saw the emaciated figure of the respected comrade general”. The man added that the people’s tears came out naturally.The report came out after Kim returned on June 4, looking noticeably thinner. The media in South Korea, which keeps a hawkish eye on what is happening inside the neighbouring country, showed the watch strap tightly tied around the waist of the North Korean leader, which, it said, appeared thinner.The heart issues of Kim familyThe issue is a talking point as the world looks for clues about his grip on the country, especially since his family has a history of heart disease.Kim (at 5ft 8) weighed over 140 kg a few months ago. After his latest appearance, the South Korean media is claiming that he lost around 20 kg. The 37-year-old is a chain smoker, fuelling further speculation about his health, given the fact that he has not officially chosen his successor.The father of Kim, who took over as North Korea’s supreme leader in 2011, died of a massive heat attack. Kim Jong II became the leader of North Korea in 1994 after his father passed away due to heart attack. Kim Il-Sung had ruled the country since he founded it in 1948.The reason for the world’s concernNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons programme has been an intractable problem for the West, especially the United States, given the fact that the tiny country has severed its ties from the world.The hermit country imposed further curbs due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with Kim claiming a few weeks ago that there is not a single case of the infection in North Korea.The US wants to tackle North Korea’s nuclear programme, and the future of the country after Kim Jong Un.Kim’s disappearanceBefore the month-long disappearance, Kim was away from the public eye for six weeks in 2014. That was the longest he stayed away from the public gaze.When he came back, Kim was seen walking with the help of a cane, raising speculation that he was suffering from gout.Early last year, speculation about Kim’s health exploded after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, only to reappear in public in early May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-kim-jong-un-s-weight-issue-is-a-talking-point-across-the-world-101624851813474.html
28-06-2021||World||US carries out air strikes against Iran-backed militia in Iraq, Syria||The United States said on Sunday it carried out another round of air strikes against Iran-backed militia in Iraq and Syria, this time in response to drone attacks by the militia against US personnel and facilities in Iraq.In a statement, the U.S. military said it targeted operational and weapons storage facilities at two locations in Syria and one location in Iraq. It did not disclose whether it believed anyone was killed or injured but officials said assessments were ongoing.The strikes came at the direction of President Joe Biden, the second time he has ordered retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militia since taking office five months ago. Biden last ordered limited strikes in Syria in February, that time in response to rocket attacks in Iraq."As demonstrated by this evening's strikes, President Biden has been clear that he will act to protect U.S. personnel," the Pentagon said in a statement.The strikes came even as Biden's administration is looking to potentially revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. The strikes appear to show Biden's efforts to compartmentalize defensive strikes to protect American personnel, while simultaneously engaging Tehran in diplomacy.His critics say Iran cannot be trusted and point to the drone attacks as further evidence that Iran and its proxies will never accept a U.S. military presence in Iraq or Syria.Biden and the White House declined comment on the strikes on Sunday.U.S. officials believe Iran is behind a ramp-up in drone attacks and periodic rocket fire against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq, where the U.S. military has been helping Baghdad combat the remnants of Islamic State.Two U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Iran-backed militias carried out at least five drone attacks against facilities used by U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq since April.The Pentagon said the facilities targeted were used by Iran-backed militia including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada.One of the facilities targeted was used to launch and recover the drones, a defense official said.The U.S. military carried out strikes with F-15 and F-16 aircraft, officials said, adding the pilots made it back from the mission safely."We assess each strike hit the intended targets," one of the officials told Reuters.Iraq's government is struggling to deal with militias ideologically aligned with Iran which are accused of rocket fire against U.S. forces and of involvement in killing peaceful pro-democracy activists.Earlier in June, Iraq released Iran-aligned militia commander Qasim Muslih, who was arrested in May on terrorism-related charges, after authorities found insufficient evidence against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-air-strikes-against-iran-backed-militia-in-iraq-syria-101624840230642.html

28-06-2021||World||Covid-19 Deaths in Moscow spike; Asia-Pacific sees curbs return||Moscow on Sunday recorded the worst daily coronavirus death toll so far for a Russian city, as countries across the Asia-Pacific region extended or reimposed restrictions to tackle fresh waves of infections.The pandemic has now killed close to 4 million people across the world, but vaccination drives have brought down infection numbers in many wealthy countries, though the Delta strain of the virus remains a concern.The Delta variant is now in 85 countries and is the most contagious of any Covid-19 strain identified, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite that, in much of Europe and the US, curbs on daily life are easing as vaccination programmes bear fruit.Moscow on Sunday recorded 144 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, a day after Saint Petersburg set the previous highest figure. Russia has seen an explosion of new infections since mid-June driven by the Delta variant.The Delta variant is also feeding fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Australia where authorities have brought back or prolonged restrictions. More than 5mn Sydney residents endured their first full day of a two-week lockdown on Sunday to contain the variant. Restaurants, bars and cafes were shuttered and stay-at-home orders were issued.More than 110 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Sydney since a driver for an international flight crew tested positive in June for the Delta variant.Australia’s northern city of Darwin also entered a separate snap 48-hour lockdown on Sunday after a handful of cases were linked to a coronavirus outbreak on a remote gold mine.Similar spikes in infections have recently been seen across Southeast Asia. Thailand will from Monday reimpose restrictions on restaurants, construction sites and gatherings in the capital Bangkok as it tries to contain a wave of infections. The country’s latest wave kicked off in April when a cluster was found in upscale Bangkok clubs.Indonesia set a new record for daily coronavirus cases on Sunday with a tally of more than 21,000, as hospitals are flooded with patients in Jakarta.The Bangladesh government said it would impose a new national lockdown from Monday, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.The announcement prompted tens of thousands of migrant workers to desert the capital Dhaka, where the lockdown will cut off their revenue sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-in-moscow-spike-asia-pacific-sees-curbs-return-101624836380362.html
28-06-2021||World||Florida condo collapse: Families frustrated by slow pace of rescue ops||Rescuers digging through the rubble of a Florida beachfront condo sought to reassure families that they were doing as much as possible to find missing loved ones, but the crews said they needed to work carefully for the best chance of uncovering survivors.As the death toll rose Sunday to nine, relatives grew increasingly desperate for news and worried about the slow progress and dwindling hopes. No one has been pulled alive from the pile since Thursday, hours after the collapse. Some family members were taken by bus Sunday to a location near the site after relatives frustrated with the pace of rescue efforts demanded to visit the scene.“My daughter is 26 years old, in perfect health. She could make it out of there,” one mother told rescuers during a weekend meeting with family members. A video of the meeting was posted by Instagram user Abigail Pereira.“It’s not enough,” continued the mother, who was among relatives who pushed authorities to bring in experts from other countries to help. “Imagine if your children were in there.”More than 150 people are still unaccounted for in Surfside, and authorities and loved ones fear the toll will go much higher.Scores of rescue workers remained on the massive pile of rubble, searching for survivors but so far finding only bodies and human remains.In a meeting with families Saturday evening, people moaned and wept as Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah explained why he could not answer their repeated questions about how many victims they had found.“It’s not necessarily that we’re finding victims, OK? We’re finding human remains,” Jadallah said, according to the video posted on Instagram.Every time crews find remains, they clean the area and remove the remains. They work with a rabbi to ensure any religious rituals are done properly, Jadallah said.“So the question is, is why is things taking so long?” he said, “What we’re doing is making sure that everything is followed to a ‘T.’”Authorities said their efforts are still a search-and-rescue operation. Alan Cominsky, chief of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, said they are holding out hope of finding someone alive, but they must be slow and methodical.“The debris field is scattered throughout, and it’s compact, extremely compact,” he said.Debris must be stabilized and shored up as they go.“If there is a void space, we want to make sure we’re given every possibility of a survivor. That’s why we can’t just go in and move things erratically, because that’s going to have the worst outcome possible,” he said.In meetings with authorities, family members repeatedly pushed rescuers to do more. One asked why they could not surgically remove the largest pieces of cement with cranes, to try to uncover bigger voids where survivors might be found.“There’s not giant pieces that we can easily surgically remove," replied Maggie Castro, of the fire rescue agency, who described herself as “one of the people out there attempting to find your family members.”“They’re not big pieces. Pieces are crumbled, and they’re being held together by the rebar that’s part of the construction. So if we try to lift that piece, even as carefully, those pieces that are crumbling can fall off the sides and disturb the pile,” Castro said.She said they try to cut rebar in strategic places and remove large pieces, but that they have to remove them in a way that nothing will fall onto the pile.“We are doing layer by layer," Castro said. “It doesn’t stop. It’s all day. All night.”Rescuers were also using a microwave radar device developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab and the Department of Homeland Security that “sees” through up to eight inches of solid concrete, according to Adrian Garulay, CEO of Spec Ops Group, which sells them. The suitcase-sized device can detect human respiration and heartbeats and was being deployed Sunday by a seven-member search-and-rescue team from Mexico’s Jewish community.But as the work dragged on, family members grew desperate. Some asked to visit the site so they could shout messages to their loved ones, “so they can hear our voices.” On Sunday afternoon, relatives were driven to a location next to the site as crews continued their work.TV cameras showed two buses pull up and groups of relatives step off. They walked to an area near the scene, where officials said they could observe and have a moment of reflection.A fire in the rubble pile slowed rescue efforts earlier in the weekend, but Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said it was suppressed Saturday.She said six to eight teams are actively searching the pile at any given time, with hundreds of team members on standby ready to rotate in. She said teams have worked around the clock since Thursday, and there was no lack of personnel.Teams are also working with engineers and sonar to make sure the rescuers are safe.“We need to be sure that the pile does not fall on them. It does not fall on any possible survivors and we are diligently pursuing that as we do our work,” she said.Crews spent the night digging a trench that stretches 125 feet, 20 feet across and 40 feet deep, which, she said, allowed them to find more bodies and human remains.Earl Tilton, who runs a search-and-rescue consulting firm in North Carolina, said the rescuers in Miami-Dade County were doing an “outstanding job.” Rushing into the rubble without careful planning and execution would injure or kill rescuers and the people they are trying to save, said Tilton, who runs Lodestar Professional Services in Hendersonville, North Carolina.“I understand the families’ concerns on this. If it was my family member, I would want everyone in there pulling rubble away as fast as humanly possible,” Tilton said. “But moving the wrong piece of debris at the wrong time could cause it to fall on them and crush them.”During past urban rescues, rescuers have found survivors as long as a week past the initial catastrophe, Tilton said.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the search teams as being “some of the best in the business.”“I’d hope that none of these things would ever happen anywhere, but if something like this happens, the people you would want are Miami-Dade search and rescue," DeSantis said during a Sunday news conference. "These teams have gone all over the world. These are the people that you want. And they’ve been there within minutes, and it’s been nonstop.”Authorities also sought to assure family members directly that the rescuers were well qualified, telling them during a Saturday meeting that some rescuers had worked on search-and-rescue operations after the Oklahoma City bombing, at the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks and following the Haiti earthquake.After remains are found, they are sent to the medical examiner. Authorities are gathering DNA samples from family members to aid in identification. Late Saturday, four of the victims were identified as Stacie Dawn Fang, 54; Antonio Lozano, 83; Gladys Lozano, 79; and Manuel LaFont, 54.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-condo-collapse-families-frustrated-by-slow-pace-of-rescue-ops-101624827475051.html
28-06-2021||World||Bangladesh: At least 7 dead, dozens injured in explosion in Dhaka||At least seven people were killed and dozens wounded in an explosion in Bangladesh capital Dhaka late on Sunday with authorities initially suspecting it to have been caused by gas cylinder blasts.“So far, we came to know seven people were killed in the explosion,” Dhaka’s police commissioner Shafiqul Islam told newspersons at the scene at Moghbazar area adding that the explosion damaged seven buildings and three passenger buses.Fire Brigade chief Brigadier General Sajjad Hossain said primary evidence suggested gas cylinder blasts caused the explosion but “we are yet to know how it actually occurred”.“There were gas cylinders at a restaurant at the ground floor of a nearby building and air-conditioners at a showroom upstairs while there were gas cylinders as well at the road construction site at the scene... investigations have been launched,” Hossain said.TV channels reported dozens of wounded, mostly bus passengers and passersby, being treated at three hospitals where doctors said many of them received severe burn injuries.According to residents in the neighbourhood, the explosion rocked the part of the city spreading panic while television footage showed broken pillars, concrete and glass shards strewn across the street at the scene in the central part of the country's capital.“I was on a bus when the explosion occurred. I jumped out of it through a narrow window of the vehicle, initially thinking the bus gas cylinder exploded... never experienced such a big explosion in my life,” 50-year-old Tajul Islam, who received injuries on his waist and complained of hearing impairment due to the explosion, told PTI.Another witness said he saw a fireball go over his head and the explosion turned everything dark and smoky in his vicinity while pieces of glass started to shower from above.“The sound was so huge... it scared everyone,” he told a TV channel.According to witnesses, soon after the explosion the buses and cars crashed into one another while panic-gripped passengers struggled to come out of the vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-at-least-7-dead-dozens-injured-in-explosion-in-dhaka-101624817665852.html
