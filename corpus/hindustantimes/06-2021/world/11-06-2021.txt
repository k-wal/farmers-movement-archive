The signing of the memorandum of understanding for cooperation on the recruitment of domestic workers was among the key outcomes of Jaishankar’s visit that concluded on Friday. The MoU brings Indian workers in Kuwait within the ambit of a legal framework that streamlines their recruitment and provides them protection of law. It also introduces an employment contract to ensure the rights and obligations of employers and workers, and a mechanism for 24-hour assistance to workers. A joint committee will be created to carry out periodic reviews and follow up the implementation of the MoU. With this MoU, the total number of agreements between the two countries has gone up to 34. The agreement was signed by officials during a meeting between Jaishankar and his Kuwaiti counterpart, Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah, on Thursday. The meeting was also attended by Kuwait’s trade minister Abdullah Issa Al Salman. The two sides reviewed bilateral ties and discussed challenges posed by the Covid-19 crisis. They reiterated their commitment to jointly fight the pandemic and address issues faced by citizens of both sides, such as travel restrictions and matters related to vaccination. The meeting also focused on cooperation in food security, cyber security, healthcare, education and the energy sector and issues related to the Indian workforce in Kuwait.

He denies the charges and has described the case as "clearly political". The United States has labelled the trial a "theatre of the absurd" and lacking in serious evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gravely-concerned-us-decries-lack-of-access-to-jailed-ex-marine-in-russia-101623432896027.html

Production of J&J's vaccine at the Baltimore site was halted by US authorities in April and J&J was put in charge of manufacturing at the plant.J&J did not have an immediate comment. The FDA declined to comment beyond its statement.The FDA said its decision allows the J&J doses to be used in the United States or exported. It said that for J&J and Emergent to export these shots, they must agree that the FDA can share information on the batches with the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the vaccine may be used.Last month, Emergent Chief Executive Robert Kramer said it was his understanding that there are 100 million doses of J&J's one-shot vaccine ready for FDA review and that regulators had begun the review process.The April halt followed the discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine. AstraZeneca's shot is no longer being made there.An FDA inspection also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices at the Emergent plant.Separately, Europe's drug regulator said on Friday that batches of J&J COVID-19 vaccine made for the region around the time the contamination issues were revealed at the Baltimore plant would, as a precaution, not be used.The European Medicines Agency did not say how many shots were affected, but Reuters has reported it involves millions of doses, making it harder for J&J to meet a target of delivering 55 million to Europe by end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/discard-60-million-covid-vaccine-doses-made-at-baltimore-plant-us-fda-to-jj-101623432645719.html

The immigration agency said that its updated policy is aimed at clarifying the criteria and circumstances for expedited processing, improving RFE and NOID guidance, and increasing the validity period for certain employment authorization documents (EADs).“We are taking action to eliminate policies that fail to promote access to the legal immigration system, and will continue to make improvements that help individuals navigate the path to citizenship, and that modernize our immigration system,” Alejandro N. Mayorkas, secretary of US homeland security, said in a statement.The H-1B visa, popular among Indian IT companies and professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. There are other immigrant visas as well which were impacted by the Trump-era policy, like the L1, H-2B, J-1, J-2, I, F and O.Also Read | USCIS should approve H-1B visas for 6 years, suggests Cato Institute's David BierThe Biden administration has undone several Trump-era immigration policies, including the suspension of employment-based nonimmigrant visas. USCIS is now returning to the adjudicative principles of a June 2013 memo that instructed agency officers to issue an RFE or NOID when additional evidence could potentially demonstrate eligibility for an immigration benefit, the agency said on Wednesday. USCIS further stated that the updated policy will ensure that requestors are given an opportunity to correct innocent mistakes and unintentional omissions.Acting USCIS director Tracy Renaud said in a statement that the latest policy updates are consistent with the Biden administration's priorities to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the “legal immigration system.” “USCIS is committed to promoting policies and procedures that ensure we operate in a fair, efficient, and humane manner that reflects America’s heritage as a land of opportunity for those who seek it,” added Renaud.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-rescinds-trump-era-policy-that-denied-certain-visa-applications-101623432170918.html

The Star Tribune of Minneapolis won the breaking news prize for its reporting following the killing of George Floyd, while Darnella Frazier — the teenager who filmed Floyd's killing — received a special citation.Frazier's award was intended to highlight “the crucial role of citizens in journalists’ quest for truth and justice,” while the board called the Tribune’s prize-winning coverage “urgent, authoritative and nuanced.”The AP and The New York Times each won two prizes.The feature photography prize went to AP’s chief photographer in Spain, Emilio Morenatti, who captured haunting images of an older couple embracing through a plastic sheet, mortuary workers in hazmat gear removing bodies and of people enduring the crisis in isolation.The breaking news prize for protest coverage was shared by 10 AP photographers. One widely reproduced photograph by Julio Cortez on the night of May 28 in riot-torn Minneapolis shows a lone, silhouetted protester running with an upside-down American flag past a burning liquor store.“It is a tremendous honor to win not only one, but two Pulitzer Prizes for photography, and a true testament to the talent and dedication of AP photojournalists,” said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. “These photographers told the stories of the year through remarkable and unforgettable images that resonated around the world.”The Star Tribune won for breaking news for its coverage of the May 25, 2020 killing of Floyd and the resulting civil unrest that tore through the city. Floyd, a Black man, died as he was being pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer.Video of the killing sparked a wave of protests, first in the Twin Cities and then nationwide.Star Tribune journalists covered the rage in Minneapolis, where protesters burned buildings including a police station.The officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds was later convicted of murder.The New York Times won its public service prize for pandemic coverage the judges said was “courageous, prescient and sweeping coverage” and “filled the data vacuum” for the general public. Wesley Morris of the Times won for criticism touching on the intersection of race and culture.The Boston Globe received the investigative reporting Pulitzer for a series demonstrating how poor government oversight imperils road safety. The series detailed how the United States lacks an effective national system to keep track of drivers who commit serious offenses in another state. It also reported how the increasingly deadly trucking industry operates with minimal federal government oversight.The prize for explanatory reporting was shared by two recipients, including Reuters. Ed Yong of The Atlantic won for a series of deeply reported and accessible articles about the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulitzers-honour-coverage-of-covid-19-black-lives-matter-protests-101623432280987.html

China landed the Tianwen-1 spacecraft carrying the rover on Mars last month, becoming the second country in the world to have touched the Martian surface. The spacecraft spent about three months orbiting the red planet prior to the landing.In the first photograph the terrain in front of the rover is clearly visible in the and the planet's horizon appears curved because of the camera’s wide-angle lens. This black and white image, was taken by an obstacle avoidance camera installed in front of the Mars rover, the CNSA said in a statement on its websiteThe second image is in colour and was taken by the navigation camera fitted at the rover's back. The rover’s solar panels and antenna appear to be clearly unfolded, against a background of red soil and rocks on the Martian surface.The probe also sent back a video taken by a camera on the orbiter, showing how the lander and the rover separated from the orbiter while landing on the surface of Mars.In one of the pictures the Chinese rover and lander bearing the national flag can be seen on the surface of Mars. The lander and rover both display the national flag and the former even has pictures of the 2022 Chinese Olympics and Paralympics mascot ingrained on its surface, reported the Associated Press.The Zhurong rover, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, weighs 240 kilograms and carries six scientific instruments meant to aid in its mission, including a high-resolution camera. The rover is currently surveying an area known as Utopia Planitia, a large plain in the northern hemisphere of Mars on Saturday, according to reports by state media. It will be looking for signs of existence of life on Mars using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-mars-rover-sends-back-images-to-earth-101623431813858.html

Ahead of the first meeting of the G7 Leaders’ Summit, Macron said that the group defends fair remuneration of innovation and the respect of intellectual property rights.India and South Africa have been pushing for a waiver for all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the implementation, application and enforcement of certain provisions of a 1995 intellectual property rights agreement in order to boost Covid-19 prevention, containment or treatment. The proposal has received support from US President Joe Biden but WTO members like Germany have opposed any kind of waiver.Also Read | G7 needs a reset. It must reflect the world of todayMacron said that G7 countries have worked on the initial proposal from India and South Africa and they want to continue working on it with the WTO, World Health Organization (WTO), and all other partners. “But I hope that it will lead to an agreement at this G7 summit,” the French president added.Macron also encouraged the idea of Covid-19 vaccines donation by pharmaceutical companies in the short term, which would complement the decision of the United States to share half a billion doses of Covid vaccines to struggling nations around the world. Speaking on Thursday ahead of the G7 meet, Biden said that the United States is going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside its global partners, adding that the G-7 nations would join the US in outlining their vaccine donation commitments.G7 nations comprise the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan. The UK holds the presidency for G7 Leaders’ Summit 2021 and has invited India, along with Australia, South Korea and South Africa as guest countries. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa left the country on Friday for the G7 Summit in Cornwall, southwestern England, where he will be joining other world leaders.The multilateral agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) provides for copyright, industrial designs, patents and protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets. A temporary Trips waiver for certain provisions is supposed to enable greater access to Covid-19 vaccines, particularly in middle- and low-income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-to-propose-time-limited-ip-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccines-macron-101623427669330.html

The bill to facilitate appeals by foreign nationals convicted by a Pakistani military court was among 21 bills passed by the National Assembly or lower house of Parliament on Thursday. The opposition boycotted the session and contended the government had bulldozed the legislation through the House. The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Bill of 2020 is on the same lines as an ordinance that was issued by the Pakistan government last year to facilitate Jadhav’s right to appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court for alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India has rejected the charges levelled against the navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018. The bills were passed after the Speaker of the National Assembly suspended the rules of business, which was challenged by the opposition. However, the opposition was defeated in a vote 112-101. According to reports in the Pakistani media, opposition members shouted slogans such as “Modi ka jo yaar hai ghaddar hai” (Modi’s friend is a traitor) and “Kulbhushan ko phansi do” (Hang Kulbhushan), and PML-N MP Ahsan Iqbal said the government had passed the bill to provide relief to an “Indian spy”. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the decision to pass the bills by saying that they could be delayed once the budget session began on Friday. He also said that opposition MPs who were against the bill to provide relief to Jadhav were “speaking the language of India”. “India wants Pakistan not to abide by the decision of the ICJ and the opposition also wants this,” he said. Law minister Farogh Naseem added the ICJ had asked Pakistan to enact legislation to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav. If the bill wasn’t passed, India could initiate contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ, Naseem said. Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said the bill was meant to give safe passage to an “Indian spy”. He said, “You were advocating the case of Kashmiris and now that of Kulbhushan?” The bills will have to be passed by the opposition-dominated Senate or upper house before the president gives his assent to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-parliament-passes-bill-that-will-let-jadhav-appeal-against-death-sentence-101623426927904.html

In a blistering review of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, the US FDA advised healthcare providers and test users to either destroy the lateral flow Covid tests by throwing them away in the trash or return it to the company using the FedEx return label that was included with the recall letter that Innova sent to customers.The FDA said it has significant concerns regarding the performance of Innova’s rapid antigen test, highlighting that the test kit does not have authorisation, clearance, or approval from the US regulator. The FDA further added that the performance of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test device has not been adequately established, which presents a risk of false results.The US regulator warned that false-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of Covid-19, which could not only aggravate the health condition, it also poses a risk of the spread of coronavirus. On the other hand, false-positive results could lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis of the disease as well as an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of the patient's illness, the FDA said.“False-positive results could also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus when presumed positive patients are grouped into cohorts based on false test results,” the US agency added.Also Read | US FDA approves obesity drug Wegovy which helped people cut weight by 15%. All you need to knowOn April 23, 2021, Innova Medical Group recalled their unauthorised rapid Covid test and the FDA has classified it as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. The FDA announced that the agency has also issued a warning letter to Innova Medical Group, Inc.The FDA has advised healthcare providers to consider retesting their patients using a different Covid diagnostic test if Innova’s rapid test was given less than two weeks ago and they suspect an inaccurate result. “If testing was performed more than two weeks ago and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest,” it further added.According to the US FDA, the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test is also distributed under the names Innova COVID-19 Self-Test Kit (3T Configuration), Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (7T Configuration), and Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (25T Configuration).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-urges-users-to-throw-innova-rapid-covid-test-in-trash-or-return-to-company-101623423465163.html

The number of people signing up for benefits exceeded 900,000 in early January and has fallen more or less steadily ever since. Still, claims are high by historic standards. Before the pandemic brought economic activity to a near-standstill in March 2020, weekly applications were regularly coming in below 220,000.Nearly 3.5 million people were receiving traditional state unemployment benefits the week of May 29, down by 258,000 from 3.8 million the week before.Businesses are reopening rapidly as the rollout of vaccines allows Americans to feel more comfortable returning to restaurants, bars and shops. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that job openings hit a record 9.3 million in April. Layoffs dropped to 1.4 million, lowest in records dating back to 2000; 4 million quit their jobs in April, another record and a sign that they are confident enough in their prospects to try something new.“As life normalizes and the service sector continues to gain momentum, we expect initial jobless claims to continue to trend lower,″ said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at the economic and financial consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez, Inc.In May, the U.S. economy generated 559,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.8% from 6.1% in April. Many economists expected to see even faster job growth. The United States is still short 7.6 million jobs from where it stood in February 2020.But employers are posting vacancies faster than would-be applicants can fill them. Many Americans are contending with health and childcare issues related to Covid-19 and with career uncertainty after the coronavirus recession wiped out many jobs for good. Some are taking their time looking for work because expanded federal jobless benefits pay more than their old jobs.Many states are scheduled to begin dropping the federal benefits this month. Altogether, 15.3 million people were receiving some type of jobless aid the week of May 22; a year earlier, the number exceeded 30 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-claims-fall-to-376-000-sixth-straight-drop-101623420627666.html
11-06-2021||World||Explained: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violence||The confidence vote in the Israeli parliament on Sunday could end the 12-year-long run of its longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. If all goes according to the plan, the parliament will vote to install a “change” coalition, led by Naftali Bennett, the ultranationalist who has vowed to chart a new course aimed at healing the country's divisions and restoring a sense of normalcy.The new coalition, aimed at unseating Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, consists of eight parties from across Israel's political spectrum, including a small Arab party that has made history by joining a government for the first time. The fragile coalition could collapse even if one party breaks out of it, which would give Netanyahu another chance for the top post.What to expect?Under the agreement reached by the opposition parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years, followed by the centrist Yair Lapid, a former journalist who was the driving force behind the coalition. But that would be possible only if the government survives more than two years.The coalition holds a thin majority in the Israeli parliament, Knesset, with the help of parties from across the political spectrum - the right, left and centre. All parties signed the coalition agreement ahead of a Friday deadline, crushing the hopes of Netanyahu. But the parties have come together to keep Netanyahu out of the office and avoid another election.Also Read | Israeli lawmakers to vote Sunday on coalition formed against PM NetanyahuThe new coalition government is expected to adopt a modest agenda acceptable to Israelis from across the ideological divide that steers clear of hot-button issues. The major challenge in front of the coalition will be to agree on a budget, the first since 2019.Bennett, a religious ultranationalist, supports the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and is strongly against a Palestinian state. However, any push against Palestinians would risk his job given the fragility of the coalition supported by an Arab party. In such a situation, the annexation of the occupied West Bank and the invasion of Gaza are probably off the table, but so are any major concessions to the Palestinians.The new government is expected to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in a subdued way, unlike earlier governments, to avoid angering the Biden administration, which is pushing for restraint. It is also expected to maintain Netanyahu's hard-line stance on Iran and oppose US President Joe Biden's efforts to revive its international nuclear deal.Also Read | Amid tension with Palestine, Israel appoints Isaac Herzog as new PresidentOn Friday, Bennett said that the government will work for all the Israeli public as one, out of the partnership and national responsibility, adding that he believes his government will succeed. Bennett’s statement came as the current government has failed to heal the divisions between Jews and Arabs and between ultra-Orthodox and secular Israelis.Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List, a small party with Islamist roots, is expected to secure large budgets for housing, infrastructure and law enforcement in Arab communities.Israel's Arab citizens, who make up 20% of the population, have close familial ties to the Palestinians and largely identify with their cause, leading many Jewish Israelis to view them with suspicion. The new government already faces hostility from Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, which recently condemned the deal to oust Netanyahu, demanding Bennett remove his skullcap worn by observant Jews.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-to-expect-from-israel-s-new-govt-under-bennett-101623417776141.html

Doubling rate is a concept borrowed from the world of finance, which simply means the time taken for the number of infections to double. The doubling rate of the Delta variant was around 3.4 days in India before states imposed lockdown, as per government estimates.“Growth rates for Delta cases are high across the regions, with regional estimates for doubling time ranging from 4.5 days to 11.5 days,” PHE said in its analysis.The Delta or B1.617.2 variant of concern (VOC) also reduces the efficacy of vaccines compared to its predecessor, with it being more pronounced in individuals who have just been inoculated with the first dose.“There are now analyses from England and Scotland supporting a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for Delta compared to Alpha. This is more pronounced after one dose (absolute reduction in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of approximately 15% to 20% after one dose),” its risk assessment analysis reads.Repeated analysis also demonstrated that vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant is higher after both doses, but even then there’s slight reduction in the efficacy levels compared to the Alpha variant.“Iterated analysis continues to show vaccine effectiveness against Delta is higher after two doses but that there is a reduction for Delta compared to Alpha,” the report states“There is uncertainty around the magnitude of the change in vaccine effectiveness after two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine,” it adds.The report states that the maximum number of cases in the UK are of the delta variant but the increase in number of cases has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in hospitalisations yet. It also advised vaccination as the best possible way to combat the infection when deployed in combination with following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.The Delta variant, which was upgraded from variant of interest to variant of concern by the World Health Organization, is said to be the reason behind the surge during the second wave of the pandemic. This study comes as the UK government is poised to announce if lockdown restrictions will be lifted all over the country by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-60-more-transmissible-than-alpha-reduces-vaccine-efficacy-uk-study-101623415416351.html

I speak freely to you," said the monk named Lhakpa, speaking from a courtyard overlooked by security cameras and government observers.The portraits of Xi were visible at almost all sites visited by Reuters during the trip to Tibet, where journalists are banned from entering outside of such tours. It was not clear when the posters and flags were put up."The posters coincide with a massive political education programme which is called 'feeling gratitude to the party' education," said Robert Barnett, a Tibetan studies veteran scholar at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.Also Read | China says to uphold leadership of Communist Party in TibetChina's foreign ministry said: "Tibet's economy and society has made great achievements under the care of China's central government and the strong support of every Chinese person."The right to religious freedom of all ethnic groups in Tibet are protected by the Constitution and the law."During the visit, government officials suggested that such images, along with small Chinese flags that lined many city streets, were a sign of the "patriotic feeling" in Tibet.Beijing says it "peacefully liberated" Tibet in 1951, after Chinese troops entered the then-country and took over its administration.The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and has since established a government in exile based in Dharamsala, India.Beijing has labeled him a dangerous separatist and has said when he passes away the government will select its own successor.Reuters did not see any images of the Dalai Lama, previously common in homes throughout Tibet, on the trip from May 31 to June 5.Photos of the spiritual leader are now strictly banned, according to rights groups and Tibetans who have since left the region.The foreign ministry repeated China's position that the Dalai Lama was "attempting to separate Tibet from China.""Since Dalai defected, he has not done anything good for the Tibetan people," said Fan Chunwen, the secretary for Tibet’s Department of Education.POLITICAL LEARNINGIn Tibet's College of Buddhism, a major religious training school on the outskirts of Lhasa, Chinese flags flew atop temples and images of Xi featured prominently in every dorm and classroom visited by Reuters."We are under the leadership of the Communist Party now, of course, we must learn about politics," said Kelsang Wandui, vice director of the college.Around 40% of the school's study program was dedicated to political and cultural education, Wandui said, adding the monks will celebrate the upcoming 100th anniversary of the Communist Party on July 1.Also Read | Chinese authorities restrict religious practices of Tibetans in Lhasa during holy monthThe Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), the name of the exiled Tibetan government which oversees up to 150,000 Tibetans in exile, said the "political re-education campaign has been reinvigorated to Sinicize Tibet."Beijing has consistently strongly denied any accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, and says people in China are free to practice approved religions, including Buddhism.In a Lhasa high school political ideology class visited by Reuters, a teacher preached the benefits of China's policy in Tibet and led them in chants of agreement."Our young people must cherish the party, listen to the party and be guided by the party and be loyal to our beautiful new Tibet," said Wang Zhen, Director of the Department of Education in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-is-my-spiritual-leader-china-s-education-drive-in-tibet-101623413432798.html

Nasa said that the newly discovered exoplanet is more than three-and-a half times as big as Earth, calling it “oddly reminiscent” of Neptune. The exoplanet named TOI-1231 b orbits a red-dwarf star that, according to Nasa, is “smaller but longer-lived” than the Sun.The exoplanet revolves once around the star in a year that is 24 days long. Despite the proximity to the star, TOI-1231 b is relatively cool because the red-dwarf star is also on the cooler side. Nasa said that the exoplanet could offer scientists the chance to capture a “bar-code” type reading of the atmosphere of a temperate planet orbiting another star.“This will allow comparisons with similar worlds elsewhere in the galaxy, bringing potentially deep insights into the composition and formation of exoplanets and planetary systems, including our own,” Nasa’s exoplanet exploration program said in a statement.Also Read | ‘They saw something real’: Nasa getting serious about UFOs under new chiefNasa said that the scientists might see evidence of clouds, perhaps even made of water, in the exoplanet's atmosphere. This star-and-planet system is moving at a high velocity away from Earth, the hydrogen atoms from the atmosphere of TOI-1231 b could also be detected, which means the planet could turn out to have a ‘tail’.While such atoms are almost impossible to detect due to its masking by the outer wisps of Earth’s atmosphere and by interstellar gas, Nasa said that the TOI-1231 system is moving so quickly that hydrogen atoms escaping from the exoplanet are “shifted out of phase with the blocking material, where they could be detected by telescopes like Hubble.”An international team of astronomers, led by Dr Jennifer Burt, an exoplanet researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, and Professor Diana Dragomir, an exoplanet researcher at the University of New Mexico, announced the discovery of TOI-1231 b in a new paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-says-newly-discovered-exoplanet-could-have-water-clouds-and-a-tail-101623412252350.html

11-06-2021||World||New law in China bans defaming of military personnel||China has passed a new law banning the defamation of military personnel as the country tries to weed out comments critical of the armed forces, many of which were made on social media in context of the Sino-India border conflict last year.The new law will add to the arsenal of existing legal measures under a 2018 law, which said that any individuals or groups defaming or slandering martyrs’ names, portraits or reputation would be punished and held criminally responsible for their behaviour.It was under the existing legal measures that a popular Chinese blogger was given an eight-month jail sentence for posting comments considered slanderous against People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers killed in last year’s clash with the Indian Army at the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.The new law was passed by China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Thursday. “No organisation or individual may in any way slander or derogate the honour of servicemen, nor may they insult or slander the reputation of members of military forces,” the legislation read, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency.The Xinhua report said that the legislation allows prosecutors to act if the slander seriously affects soldiers’ “performance and missions”.It also banned the desecration of plaques in honour of military personnel. “Prosecutors can file public interest litigation in cases of defamation of military personnel and the infringement on their legitimate rights and interests that have seriously affected their performance of duties and missions and damaged the public interests of society,” the law adds.Commenting on the new law, Song Zhongping, a former PLA instructor and Hong Kong-based military affairs commentator said the legislation which also covers families of service personnel was meant to bolster the PLA’s sense of mission.“Previously, our legal instruments were not complete and this new law will provide more comprehensive protection for the rights and honours of our soldiers,” Song told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.Chinese state media listed several cases of perceived defamation - mostly involving PLA’s deadly clash with the Indian army in 2020 - that could have hastened the passage of the law that was put up to the NPC in April.One case was of a 63-year-old man detained by the “…Beijing police after he was found to have slandered martyr Wang Wei and insulted Wang’s wife in a WeChat group earlier in April. Wang was a Chinese air force pilot who died when his fighter jet collided with a US military reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea in 2001”, a state media report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-law-in-china-bans-defaming-of-military-personnel-101623409165886.html
11-06-2021||World||Myanmar has plunged into a ‘human rights catastrophe’, violence escalating: UN rights chief||A day after Myanmar’s military junta formally charged civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other officials with corruption, the UN rights chief said that the violence was further escalating in the Southeast Asian nation. Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, warned on Friday that Myanmar has plunged into a “human rights catastrophe” since the military coup in February.“In just over four months, Myanmar has gone from being a fragile democracy to a human rights catastrophe...The military leadership is singularly responsible for this crisis, and must be held to account,” Bachelet said in a statement.Myanmar’s armed forces carried out a coup d’état by detaining de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians after weeks of heightened tensions owing to a disputed election. The military, which ruled Myanmar for nearly five decades, again took control under a state of emergency for one year, triggering protests across the country and condemnation from world leaders.Also Read | UN says estimated 100,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar’s Kayah State due to violenceScores of pro-democracy protesters and children have been killed by Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, since the coup. Several media reports indicate a military build-up, especially in Kayah state in the east and Chin state in the west of the country.Citing reports of the military using civilians as human shields, Bachelet said that state security forces have continued to use heavy weaponry, including airstrikes, against armed groups and against civilians and civilian objects, including Christian churches. Bachelet said she was deeply troubled by the reports of detainees being tortured, and of collective punishment of family members of activists.“There appear to be no efforts towards de-escalation but rather a build-up of troops in key areas, contrary to the commitments the military made to ASEAN to cease the violence,” she added.Also Read | 'Undeniable that violence is spiraling': US govt's top Asia official on situation in MyanmarThe UN rights commissioner appealed to intensify regional diplomacy by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other influential States. Bachelet urged them to insist on the immediate cessation of violence and ongoing human rights violations. She will update the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Myanmar on July 7.Meanwhile, Myanmar’s ministry of information, now controlled by the military, has said that the anti-corruption commission has inspected corruption cases against the ex-state counsellor. “She was found guilty of committing corruption using her rank,” the ministry said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-has-plunged-into-a-human-rights-catastrophe-un-rights-chief-101623407601084.html

The SAA, the second-largest airline in the entire continent, was grounded in December last year and had since been a drain on state finances, news agencies reported.The SAA, despite being one of the largest airlines in Africa -- second only to the Ethiopian Airlines -- had not turned in a profit since 2011. It was placed under a state-approved rescue plan in December 2019 to save it from collapse, AFP reported, adding that the airline was one of the many symbols of "the mismanagement of state-owned enterprises" that characterised ex-South African president Jacob Zuma's regime. The airlines was having a hard time surviving even way before the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, only managing to survive on state bailouts."Having evaluated the current environment, the government has agreed to the (strategic equity partner) owning of 51% of the shareholding and government 49%," South Africa's public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said in an online media conference.The consortium to which South Africa is selling its national airlines comprises of private-equity firm Harith General Partners, an investor in African infrastructure and airports, and Johannesburg-based airline management and leasing firm Global Airways, which owns the recently launched domestic budget airline LIFT. The consortium will own the majority 51% share while the government will retain the minority 49% stakes in the shareholding, the minister informed, adding that the new SAA will not be "dependent" on the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-agrees-to-privatise-grounded-state-airline-101623406365783.html

Moon also called for cooperation "even though some political confrontation might be inevitable" ahead of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-conservatives-pick-upstart-lee-jun-seok-to-retake-presidential-office-101623400369946.html
11-06-2021||World||Once ‘deeply-moved’ by K-Pop, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls it ‘vicious cancer’: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly called K-pop, a music genre originating in South Korea, a “vicious cancer” corrupting the country’s youth, according to the New York Times. In recent months, Kim Jong Un and North Korean state media have been rallying against South Korean pop culture, including movies, K-dramas and K-pop videos. The North’s state media has warned that K-pop’s growing influence, which it calls “anti-socialist and nonsocialist”, on youth would make North Korea “crumble like a damp wall.”The two neighbouring countries of the Korean peninsula have often used loudspeakers in the demilitarised zone along the border as propaganda machinery. Last year, inter-Korean relations took a major hit after North Korean defectors started floating leaflets to criticise Kim Jong Un’s regime over human rights violations and nuclear ambitions. North Korea destroyed the inter-Korean liaison office and cut all communication lines with South Korea.Also Read | Kim Jong Un's Swiss watch 'clearest evidence' of weight lossKim has now apparently declared a culture war against South Korea as the North Korean leader believes the popular culture of the South is corrupting the “attire, hairstyles, speeches, behaviours” of the country's youth.“Young North Koreans think they owe nothing to Kim Jong Un,” Times quoted Jung Gwang-il, a defector who runs a network that smuggles K-pop into North Korea, as saying.“He must reassert his ideological control on the young if he doesn’t want to lose the foundation for the future of his family’s dynastic rule,” Jung reportedly added.Also Read | BTS 2021 Muster Sowoozoo date, time, tickets, live stream: Where and how to watch K-pop concert onlineThe family of Kim Jong Un, who took over the reins after his father’s demise in 2011, has ruled North Korea for three generations.

Times report suggests that young North Koreans now watch South Korean entertainment, smuggled on flash drives from China, behind closed doors and draped windows.The war against K-pop comes years after the North Korean leader was "deeply moved", as reported by North Korean state news agency KCNA, following a two-hour performance by South Korean artists. In 2018, a 160-person delegation from South Korea, including the K-pop group Red Velvet and Cho Yong Pil, visited the North. Kim attended a performance in Pyongyang by South Korean artists and was "particularly interested" in Red Velvet, a K-pop girl group, the publicly funded South Korean broadcaster KBS reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-deeply-moved-by-k-pop-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-calls-it-vicious-cancer-report-101623403208916.html
11-06-2021||World||What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probe||The US push for a new inquiry to determine the origins of the coronavirus -- including whether it leaked from a Wuhan lab -- raises a key question: What has China failed to disclose?The Group of Seven leaders this weekend are set to call for a fresh, transparent, World Health Organization-convened study into the origins of this virus, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg News. Yet so far they’ve been vague on what exactly they want.In his statement giving intelligence agencies 90 days to redouble efforts into the origin of Covid-19, President Joe Biden asked them to come up with “specific questions for China.” Beijing officials have repeatedly denied that the virus leaked from the lab, and pointed to a WHO report earlier this year that said the most likely origin was natural.But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the lab leak hypothesis required further investigation, adding that he was ready to deploy more resources. He said scientists would benefit from “full access to data,” including biological samples from at least September 2019. The European Union similarly called for more data.Here’s what a new study should examine:Details on Wuhan Lab ResearchOne big outstanding question is what type of work was actually going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus researcher at the lab, said in a March 2020 article in Scientific American that the genetic code of the virus that causes Covid-19 doesn’t match any of her lab’s samples. She also told the WHO team that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies.Still, researchers haven’t yet had access to all coronavirus isolates and genomic sequence data held at Wuhan labs. And they also haven’t had access to log books and records of the research that was being conducted on coronaviruses, in particular viruses with the RaTG13 bat sequence that is similar to SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen underpinning Covid-19.There are also questions about whether the institute conducted gain-of-function experiments, in which researchers manipulate naturally occurring viruses to see if they can be made deadlier or more transmissible.Medical Records of Lab WorkersThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that US intelligence indicates three researchers from the lab became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. A number of media also reported that the Chinese government has restricted access to an abandoned copper mine in southwest China where researchers from the Wuhan lab collected coronavirus samples after a 2012 incident in which six miners fell ill with a “mysterious” respiratory illness.Shi, the bat coronavirus researcher, told the WHO team that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. The China Daily again reported this week that no staff member of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has ever contracted the virus that caused Covid-19.Still, researchers haven’t had access to medial records and specimens collected from staff at the institute who sought hospital care in late 2019. And they would also want to see medical records and specimens collected from the miners in southwest China.More Data on Early CasesTo identify the earliest human cases in December 2019, the WHO team reviewed health records, mortality data, trends in retail sales of cold and cough medications and reported patterns of influenza-like illnesses and severe respiratory infections in the two months preceding the outbreak in Wuhan.International investigators examined 76,000 cases from more than 200 medical centers, and researchers in China also tested some 4,500 patient specimens stored at hospitals in Wuhan and other parts of China.Even so, the WHO team that went to Wuhan earlier this year proposed further analysis of cases of respiratory illness that occurred in Wuhan in October and November 2019.Documentation on Wuhan Wet MarketsTo identify potential animal sources, 11,000 blood samples taken from livestock and poultry in 31 provinces were tested along with 1,914 samples from 35 species of wild animals. Researchers in China looked for SARS-CoV-2 in 12,000 animal swabs and 50,000 samples from 300 different species of wild animals. All were negative.Researchers this week found that mink, masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, Siberian weasels, hog badgers and Chinese bamboo rats were among 38 animal species sold live at markets in Wuhan from May 2017 to November 2019.Still, gaps remain in evidence to support a theory that the virus spilled over to humans from animals. WHO researchers haven’t seen full documentation of what species of animals were sold live at markets in Wuhan in 2019, when they were present, and a list of their vendors and suppliers.The WHO team has sought additional sampling of animal species that may act as a reservoir, including bat populations in China and neighboring countries. They also would benefit from names and addresses of farms raising minks, foxes, raccoon dogs and other fur-producing animals in China from 2018 to 2020.Evidence From Outside ChinaChinese officials have repeatedly raised the specter that the virus originated elsewhere in the world, and was brought into the country either through frozen-food imports or even a US military operation. Foreign Ministry officials have repeatedly called for the US to provide access to Fort Detrick in Maryland, which is home to the American bio-defence agency.The WHO team has called for collecting and analyzing epidemiological, clinical, molecular and environmental data from other countries to better understand the virus’s origins, since some reports have suggested it may have been circulating outside China before December 2019. They are also seeking more research to understand if it could be transmitted from contaminated products to humans, and under which conditions that might occur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-the-world-wants-china-to-disclose-in-wuhan-lab-leak-probe-101623400682838.html

11-06-2021||World||Hong Kong to follow China's steps, start censoring films over national security||Hong Kong censors are to vet all films for national security breaches under expanded powers announced on Friday, in the latest blow to the financial hub's political and artistic freedoms. Authorities in semi-autonomous Hong Kong have embarked on a sweeping crackdown to root out Beijing's critics after huge and often violent democracy protests convulsed the city in 2019. A new security law imposed by China and an official campaign dubbed "Patriots rule Hong Kong" has since criminalised much dissent and strangled the democracy movement. Films are just the latest target.In a statement on Friday, the government said the Film Censorship Ordinance had been expanded to include "any act or activity which may amount to an offense endangering national security"."When considering a film as a whole and its effect on the viewers, the censor should have regard to his duties to prevent and suppress acts or activities endangering national security, and the common responsibility of the people of Hong Kong to safeguard the sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China," the new guidance, which is effective immediately, states.Films are rigorously vetted on the Chinese mainland and only a handful of Western films or documentaries ever see a commercial release each year.Hong Kong's Film Censorship Authority has traditionally employed a much lighter touch.Historically, the city has boasted a thriving film scene and for much of the latter half of the last century, Cantonese cinema was world-class.In more recent decades, slick mainland Chinese and South Korean blockbusters have come to dominate the regional film scene.But Hong Kong still maintains some key studios, a handful of lauded directors, and a thriving indie scene.Yet there are growing signs authorities want to see an increase in mainland-style controls over the cultural and art scenes in Hong Kong.Over the past week, health officials have conducted spot checks on a protest-themed museum and a separate exhibition, stating neither have the correct licenses. The museum had been operating for years without issue.In March, an award-winning documentary about Hong Kong's massive pro-democracy protests was pulled hours before its first commercial screening after days of criticism from a pro-Beijing newspaper.It said the film's content breached the new national security law.Earlier this year a university cancelled a prestigious press photography exhibition that featured pictures of the 2019 protests, citing security concerns.And M, a multi-million-dollar contemporary art museum expected to open soon, has said it will allow security officials to vet its collection for any security law breaches before it opens to the public later this year.A government spokesperson said film censors would strike a "balance between protection of individual rights and freedoms on the one hand, and the protection of legitimate societal interests on the other".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-follow-china-s-steps-start-censoring-films-over-national-security-101623390894800.html
11-06-2021||World||Xinjiang a ‘dystopian hellscape’ where torture is common: Report||China is committing human rights abuses on Muslim minorities in the province of Xinjiang, a “dystopian hellscape” where brainwashing and torture in camps are commonplace, human rights group, Amnesty International has said in a new report.In a report published on Thursday, the group said hundreds of thousands of Muslim minority men and women were being subjected to mass internment and torture, systemic mass surveillance and being forced to abandon their religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages.The Chinese foreign ministry dismissed the report on Friday, calling it a “record of lies”. “People are clear about the nature of Amnesty International. This organisation, wearing tinted glasses, has been misleading the public and spreading lies and rumours about Xinjiang. Its so-called report is like adding one more page to its ‘record of lies’,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.“We urge the relevant organisation to abandon its persistent prejudice against China, stop fabricating and spreading disinformation and look at relevant issues from an objective and just perspective,” Wang added.The 160-page report by London-based AI - titled “Like We Were Enemies in a War: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang” - is, however, scathing, alleging more than just persistent state-sponsored prejudice against Muslim minorities in China’s largest province.“Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) face systematic state-organised mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity,” the report said, quoting dozens of new testimonies from former camp detainees.Sleep deprivation, beatings, and the use of “tiger chairs” - iron chairs with iron buckles to restrain those being questioned - were recorded, the report said, adding that detainees could be hooded and shackled during questioning.“The Chinese authorities have created a ‘dystopian hellscape’ on a staggering scale in XUAR,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said at the release of the report.“It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive number of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” Callamard added.The Chinese government does not deny the existence of camps in XUAR - it first acknowledged the camps in October, 2018 - but says they are part of anti-terrorism and de-radicalisation efforts in the region in accordance with the law to protect people’s lives.In February, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi told the UN Human Rights Council that it was taking counter-terrorism measures in accordance with the law and that Xinjiang enjoyed “social stability and sound development” after four years without any “terrorist case”.People of all ethnic groups enjoy labour rights and Muslims were free to pray in the 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, he said. “These basic facts show that there has never been so-called genocide, forced labour, or religious oppression in Xinjiang.”Amnesty International, however, said counter-terrorism could not reasonably account for mass detention, and that the Chinese government’s actions showed a “clear intent to target parts of Xinjiang’s population collectively on the basis of religion and ethnicity and to use severe violence and intimidation to root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices”.The report also said Muslims were not free to practice their religion in Xinjiang. Dozens of Muslim men and women told the organisation that the regional “Chinese authorities showed extraordinary hostility towards their Islamic faith. Basic religious and cultural practices have been deemed ‘extremist’ and used as grounds for detention”.As a result, most people have stopped praying or showing any outward signs of observing Islam. “We couldn’t say ‘as-salamu-alaykum’ [a typical greeting in many Islamic cultures meaning ‘peace be upon you’] …anymore,” one man told Amnesty International. “Qurans, prayer mats and other religious artefacts have effectively been banned.”The new report is likely to add to the international pressure on China over its policies for minorities in Xinjiang, described by the US, UK and Canada and Lithuania as genocide.The government has also been accused of carrying out forced sterilisation of Uighur women, a charge that has also been denied by the authorities.In March, the EU, US, UK, and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the alleged abuses; Beijing responded with tit-for-tat sanctions on lawmakers, researchers, and institutions.In the report, Amnesty said the Chinese government “…must immediately close all the remaining internment camps and release all persons held in internment camps or other detention facilities - including prisons - in Xinjiang, unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognised offence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xinjiang-a-dystopian-hellscape-where-torture-is-common-report-101623384204402.html

The decision, as per ARY News, was taken at a meeting in Lahore presided over by the province's health minister Dr. Yasmin Rashid. The move is seemingly aimed at forcing all those citizens who refuse to get themselves vaccinated to do so at the earliest.Dr. Rashid, the provincial health minister in Pakistan's Punjab, said that there has been a "considerable decrease" in Covid-19 cases in the province due to mass vaccinations. However, a report compiled by the Punjab primary health department shows that the province still failed to achieve its set target for Covid-19 vaccination, reports ARY News, adding that around 300,000 recipients of the first dose of the vaccine never returned for the second dose since the start of Pakistan's mass inoculation drive on February 2.An official of Pakistan's ministry of national health services (NHS) said that the administration is identifying and categorising the people who never showed up for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on their due dates. "There is a possibility that some of them might have died before getting the second dose," ANI quoted the official as saying. He noted that while a section of these people might have contracted the coronavirus after receiving the first dose and decided not to get the second, others might simply have fallen prey to negative propaganda regarding the vaccine.Meanwhile, Pakistan's finance minister Shaukat Tarin is set to present the country's budget speech in capital Islamabad on Friday afternoon, as he faces a challenge in walking the fine line between spending big over post-Covid economic recovery and keeping the budget deficit in check as Pakistan emerges from the more infectious third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-punjab-to-block-sim-cards-of-citizens-not-vaccinated-against-covid19-101623379436486.html

Johnson presented his gift during a G7 summit, Biden's first official overseas engagement meant to normalise the United States' trans-Atlantic relations with its allies in Europe and Asia after a tumultuous Trump regime. The British prime minister hailed the newly crowned president of the United States of America as "a big breath of fresh air", as the countries pledged to work with each other on a host of issues ranging from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) management to climate change and security.The British mural presented by Johnson depicts Frederick Douglass, Black 19th-century abolitionist who escaped slavery in the United States, later going on to become an abolitionist leader who toured Britain and Ireland, with which Biden has ancestral ties. The black-and-white mural is painted on the wall of a residential street corner in Edinburgh, a city where Douglass stayed on his tour, by artist Ross Blair who used the hashtag #blacklivesmatter when first unveiling the piece online in 2020. Douglass' mural portrait was photographed by dual British-US national Melissa Highton.Appreciating the UK prime minister's gift, Biden reciprocated by presenting Johnson, a keen cyclist, with an American-made bicycle and helmet.The US president also gave a silk scarf and leather bag made by military wives for Johnson's wife Carrie. The UK side, in return, presented US first lady Jill Biden with the first edition copy of 'The Apple Tree' - a collection of short stories by 20th-century British author Daphne du Maurier, who lived in Cornwall, the picturesque corner of England that is hosting the G7 summit.The United Kingdom is keen to collaborate with the United States of America on a host of issues with prime minister Boris Johnson playing down differences with Washington over the impact of Brexit on the peace in Northern Ireland. "You know, I'm optimistic," Reuters quoted him as saying, "There’s complete harmony on the need to keep going, find solutions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-s-boris-johnson-gifts-joe-biden-mural-of-19th-century-abolitionist-frederick-douglass-101623377062480.html

The image of Gosiame Thamara Sithole with an over-expanded stomach went viral like wildfire on social media and led to the coining of the term ‘decuplets’.However, the babies have not made a public appearance yet, prompting speculation that the claim made by the parents may be fake. The South African government, meanwhile, has still not been able to verify how many babies the 37-year-old from the Tembisa township near Johannesburgactually delivered.According to the Associated Press, the department of social development in the Gauteng province said they have traced Sithole and spokesperson Feziwe Ndwayana said they would make an announcement after meeting with the family. AP also reported that another local government department said earlier this week that it had no record of the babies' births in any of the province's hospitals.Sithole’s news comes just a month after a Malian woman gave birth to nine babies in Morocco, the first case of nonuplets. Pretoria News newspaper reported citing her husband Teboho Tsotetsi that Sithole gave birth at a hospital in Pretoria. The newspaper further reported that all the babies were born prematurely.The couple already has twins aged six and now the family will have a dozen kids.“It’s seven boys and three girls. She was seven months and seven days pregnant. I am happy. I am emotional,” Tsotetsi said, adding the birth of 10 babies at once was a big surprise as doctors only found eight in prenatal scans - which use sound waves to form images that show a baby’s shape and position.But relatives and neighbours of the family have insisted the news is indeed true. Speaking to AP, Wilson Machaya, a neighbour of Sithole, said it was a blessing to have 10 babies at once and he would assist the family in any way possible.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-from-south-africa-gives-birth-to-10-babies-govt-says-will-verify-101623375504821.html
