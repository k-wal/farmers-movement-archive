The leaders of the G7 states – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US – will gather in the British seaside resort of Cornwall during June 11-13 for the summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was invited by the UK as a special guest but dropped plans to travel to Cornwall because of the pandemic, will virtually join G7 outreach sessions during June 12-13. A draft communiqué accessed by Bloomberg News said the G7 leaders will call for a “fresh, transparent, WHO-convened study” into the origins of the Coronavirus. This follows calls by several countries, including India and the US, for further studies to determine how Covid-19 spread last year. “I think we have been very clear that we support the need for a follow-up to the WHO report on the origin of Covid-19 and for further studies and we have called for understanding and cooperation of all in this regard,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, without directly naming China. India first backed the call for further investigations on May 28, days after US President Joe Biden asked intelligence agencies to redouble their efforts to gather information to facilitate a definitive conclusion on the origin of the Coronavirus and to submit a fresh report on the issue within 90 days. Biden’s action angered China, which has said the US is playing politics. Within the US intelligence set-up, at least one agency is leaning towards the theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan. Most scientific experts believe the virus jumped to humans from an animal host in a natural event, and the WHO’s probe earlier this year concluded it was “extremely unlikely” the pandemic began in a laboratory. The draft communiqué also contains a pledge by G7 leaders to deliver at least one billion extra doses of vaccines through dose-sharing and financing over the next year to help cover 80% of the world’s adult population. G7 officials are putting together the communiqué which outlines a plan to end the pandemic by December 2022. The document will form the basis of “final-stage talks” at the summit and will be released on Sunday. The figure of one billion additional vaccines doses will include 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that the US will buy for distribution to some 100 countries. The White House said on Thursday the Biden administration had reached an agreement with Pfizer and a formal announcement would be made by the president in remarks before the G7 Summit. The US will donate 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022, and the vaccines will begin shipping in August, the White House said. The Biden administration earlier said it will donate 80 million doses of vaccines – 20 million of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs and 60 million doses of AstraZeneca shots – from surplus stocks to countries around the world. Three-fourths of these doses will be distributed through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. Prime Minister Modi will join the outreach sessions of the G7 Summit at the invitation of his UK counterpart Boris Johnson. The UK, which holds the G7 presidency, has invited India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa, as guest countries for the summit. The summit’s theme is “Build Back Better” and the UK has outlined four priority areas – leading the global recovery from Covid-19 while strengthening resilience against future pandemics, promoting prosperity by championing free and fair trade, tackling climate change, and championing shared values and open societies. This is the second time Modi will participate in a G7 meeting. India was invited by the G7 French presidency in 2019 to the Biarritz Summit as a goodwill partner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-to-call-for-new-probe-into-origins-of-coronavirus-draft-communique-101623338358449.html

The team will meet with Bukele Thursday.El Salvador’s congress approved a law this week requiring businesses to accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods and services. President Nayib Bukele said the digital currency will help counter El Salvador’s low banking penetration and cut the cost of sending remittances.The nation’s bonds dropped, sending the yield on its bonds coming due in 2025 up 71 basis points to 7.8% at 10:40 a.m. in New York. El Salvador’s bonds are the worst performers in emerging markets this week, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index.“The plans for Bitcoin under an increasingly autocratic regime will likely only compound concerns about corruption, money laundering and the independence of regulatory agencies,” Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont, wrote in a note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-sees-risks-after-el-salvador-makes-bitcoin-legal-tender-101623337622774.html

Karzai’s visit is being seen as complementary to US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad’s efforts to nudge the Afghan government and the Taliban towards a political settlement. Khalilzad began a visit on June 4 that has taken him to Afghanistan and Qatar, where he met the Taliban negotiating team. The team to be led by Karzai to Pakistan will represent the Grand Council that was convened recently by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to fashion a strategy for further talks with the Taliban, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The inclusion of Abdullah in the team is an effort to project a united front, they said. Also Read | Talking to the TalibanThe team is expected to travel to Islamabad by June 20 and its members will engage with Pakistan’s political and military leadership to underline the importance of taking forward talks with the Taliban on finding a political settlement, the people said. “The team will convey the will of the Afghan people to the Pakistani leadership and discuss ways to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table,” one of the people cited above said. The Afghan side is expecting the Pakistani side to lend a helping hand, even though there is a heated dialogue in Kabul on the way forward with Islamabad, especially because of the lack of trust and suspicions about the Pakistani military’s close ties with elements within the Afghan Taliban, the people said. Referring to the Pakistani military’s relationship with the Haqqani Network, which has been blamed for a string of attacks in Afghanistan, a second person said: “It is better to convince the master so that they can convince the foot soldiers. The patron has been behaving badly for too long.” The Taliban have refused to open a dialogue with Ghani’s government and are holding separate talks with Khalilzad. It is believed UK Chief of Defence Staff Gen Nick Carter has been spearheading British efforts to push the Pakistani side to play a positive role in helping with the Afghan peace process. Key Western powers have pointed out to Pakistan that a positive role in the Afghan peace process would also be helpful at a time when Islamabad is dealing with various vulnerabilities and challenges, such as a worsening economy and pressure on the counter-terrorism front from bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force FATF). The people said there was a growing realisation in India, Afghanistan and key Western powers that the Taliban will have a part in the next government formed in Kabul and, therefore, the current efforts should ensure that the group did not emerge as the dominant power in such a dispensation. “Even Pakistan realises that a government in which the Taliban have free rein is not in its interests,” the first person cited above said. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “Everyone expects the Taliban to be part of the next Afghan government in some manner. This would indicate that efforts to contain the Taliban by all the players, except for Pakistan, haven’t yielded results, but it is also true that efforts to prop up other political elements have not been successful.” He added, “The only option now is to create an amalgamation of elements from both sides that will work for some sort of political stability in Afghanistan. Within this, the aim will be to ensure the Taliban doesn’t have the upper hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expresident-karzai-to-lead-afghan-team-to-pakistan-to-push-peace-process-101623329659106.html
10-06-2021||World||China warns Japan after its PM refers to Taiwan as a ‘country’||China on Thursday said it has lodged stern protests and warned Japan after its Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga made a rare reference to Taiwan as a country during a parliamentary meeting a day before.China accused Japan of severely breaching its pledge not to refer to self-ruled Taiwan as a country, which Beijing sees as a breakaway region to be reunited, if required, by force.Suga had referred to Taiwan as a country during a meeting of National Diet, the country’s bicameral legislature on Wednesday.In his first one-on-one parliamentary debate with opposition leaders on Wednesday, Suga, naming Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, said “such three countries have been imposing strong restrictions on privacy rights” to curb the novel coronavirus outbreak, Kyodo news agency said in its report from Tokyo.The reference evoked strong response from Beijing, which is against foreign countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan or even referring to the island as a country.“Japanese leaders flagrantly refer to Taiwan as a ‘country’ on multiple occasions, severely violating principles set out in the four political documents including the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and its solemn and repeated commitment of not seeing Taiwan as a country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday.“China is strongly dissatisfied with Japan’s wrong remarks and has lodged solemn representation to the Japanese side,” Wang said, adding: “We ask Japan to make prompt clarification, remove the severe damage and ensure that such things won’t happen again.”Urging the Japanese side to “earnestly honour its commitment”, Wang said Tokyo should avoid undermining China’s sovereignty in any form and refrain from sending any wrong signal to the “Taiwan independence” forces.Wang emphasised that there is only “one China” in the world and “Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory”.Since Japan broke off diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, successive Japanese governments have usually called Taiwan a region, in accordance with its “one-China” policy.Japan-Taiwan ties recently, however, have shown signs of warming especially after Tokyo last week donated 1.24 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to help tackle the rising number of cases on the island.Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen thanked Japan for supplying “timely assistance”, calling Tokyo “a partner insisting on the same values of freedom and democracy”.In April, a joint statement after a summit between US President Joe Biden and Suga referred to the “importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”.“The meeting was Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state since taking office and was in line with the US administration’s efforts to rally its partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s growing influence in the region. Notably, the statement was the first issued by leaders of the two countries to mention Taiwan since 1969,” Taiwan News reported. Ties between China and Japan are themselves fraught with the history of colonialism and maritime disputes with differences flaring frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-japan-after-its-pm-refers-to-taiwan-as-a-country-101623324556275.html
10-06-2021||World||Israel-Palestine conflict: A bit of Mahmoud Darwish, Edward Said in all those affected||The burning conflict between Israel and Palestine, which dates back decades, was all over the news in May. On social media too, along with snippets of air strikes between Hamas and Israel, there were polarised opinions on whether the Palestinian families should be evicted and their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood near Damascus Gate, be given to Israeli settlers.What gave rise to the latest clashes?The conflict that has its roots in the early 19th century was stirred once again after a skirmish broke out between the Palestinian worshipers and Israeli police at Al Aqsa Mosque on the last Friday of Ramadan. The Temple Mount is considered the holiest place in Judaism and is the place to which Jews turn during prayer. It is also a site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The site is one of the most sensitive in the Middle East conflict and a tussle there sparked off the Israel-Hamas conflict which culminated in air strikes from Hamas in Gaza in response to the clash and counter-air strikes from Israel.Who was Mahmoud Darwish?Social media was flooded with images, poems and videos of Mahmoud Darwish and Edward Said around the time of the clashes. Mahmoud Darwish, a Palestinian poet and author who was also regarded as his country's national poet, remains relevant even today as his works speak for the many internally displaced people who fled or were expelled from their homes in Mandatory Palestine during the 1947-1949 Palestine war but remained within the area that became the state of Israel.Mahmoud Darwish was legally classified as ‘present-absent-alien’ after he was forced to first leave his homeland for Lebanon in 1948, when the village of al-Birwah in the district of Galilee was demolished along with 416 other Palestinian villages, then returned to Palestine ‘illegally’ a year later. Now an ‘internal refugee’, he settled in the nearby village of Dayr-al-Asad upon his return.Edward SaidEdward Said was a Palestinian American academic who was born in Jerusalem in 1935. He was also a political activist and a literary critic whose major works were in the field of, but not limited to, postcolonial studies — an academic field he was also a founder of.Like Darwish, Said was a Palestinian exile who claimed that his work was aimed at easing tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. When a photo of him throwing stones at a fence was published in 2002, he rubbished reports that said it was a "violent" gesture on his part and reiterated his claim. “One stone tossed into an empty place scarcely warrants a second thought,” he said in an official statement issued two days after the incident.When asked why he did it, Said said, "If my child asks me one day 'Dad what did you do in the war?', I will say that I threw a stone to vile and injustice."The image of him throwing the stone angered many Israelis but Said justified it as ‘a symbolic gesture of joy’. Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after 18 years of occupation in May 2000, it became a custom for Arab tourists to throw stones over the wire fence. The fence was erected at the border after the Israeli withdrawal.Sense of identityFor Said, whose family was a Protestant Christian and Palestinian, he was a "minority inside a minority". Said was a citizen of the United States as his father was a war veteran in the US army. In an interview with novelist Salman Rushdie in 1986, which was published in the New Left Review, Said talked about the Palestinian identity and consciousness in general and his alienation in New York."In Edward’s view, the broken or discontinuous nature of Palestinian experience entails that classic rules about form or structure cannot be true to that experience; rather, it is necessary to work through a kind of chaos or unstable form that will accurately express its essential instability. Edward then proceeds to introduce the theme…that the history of Palestine has turned the insider (the Palestinian Arab) into the outsider," Rushdie wrote after the interview.The last line of Said's memoir 'Out of Place' reads, “With so many dissonances in my life I have learned actually to prefer being not quite right and out of place.”Darwish's sense of identity was also complex. Following the loss of his homeland at an early age (he was 6 when he was first forced to flee from his country), he went on to find solace and purpose in creating an identity through his poetry, and lyrical prose. His works aim to answer one question -- 'Who am I?' -- and are a site of resistance.For him, “the personal and the public are always in an uneasy relationship” Said wrote in his essay 'On Mahmoud Darwish'.The Rita-element in Mahmoud DarwishReports suggest that Darwish was in love with a woman whom he called 'Rita' in his works. 'Rita' is the pen name for the Jewish-Israeli Tamar Ben-Ami, with whom Darwish met in Haifa and fell in love when he was 22.This transgressive love, which was out of place when it came to the poet's politics, was commemorated through his poems like 'Rita and the Rifle', 'Rita’s Winter' and 'The Sleeping Garden'. The complexity of Arab-Jewish relationships is explored in his work and we see an attempt to humanise the enemy.Darwish seems to be an advocate of dialogue with Israelis. He embraced the Israeli component in his Palestinian identity and did not condemn the former for being the 'other'.His poem 'Rita and the Rifle' is one such example in which he acknowledges the two lovers' differences and yet reminisces their time together and expresses his love for 'Rita'."Between Rita and my eyes is a gunand whoever knows Rita kneelsand praysto some divinity in those hazel eyes...""And I kissed Ritawhen she was youngand I remember how she clung to meand how my arm was covered by the loveliest of braidsand I remember Ritaas a sparrow remembers its stream...""Once upon a time …O silence of the eveningmy moon migrated far in the morningin the hazel eyesand the cityswept away all the singers and Rita.Between Rita and my eyes is a gun."Said's way forwardIn Said's view, the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) gave Palestine very little control and a limited territory. The Palestinian Authority was given self-governance of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the accord.Separate Palestinian and Jewish states would be unrealisable, Said argued and while he recognised that both Palestinian and Jewish sides were against forming a single binational state, he claimed it to be the most suitable solution.“I see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together, and sharing it in a truly democratic way, with equal rights for each citizen,” he wrote in a 1999 essay in The New York Times.Darwish and Said, in their own capacities, remain relevant to the conflict of the Arab world till date. While the works of the former help explain the lack of coherence when it comes to identities of those affected by the conflict, the latter, among other things, addresses the problematic takeover of the East by the West which was guided by a sense of the white man's burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-conflict-a-bit-of-mahmoud-darwish-edward-said-in-all-those-affected-101623318933943.html

A "ring of fire" will be visible around the Moon from several regions across the world, a celestial phenomenon whereby the Sun's halo is partially blocked by the lunar body. Although the annular solar eclipse will most prominently be visible in the northern hemisphere -- in parts of northeast Canada, Greenland, and Siberia -- Indians will be able to watch the annular solar eclipse 2021 online with the help of live stream options provided by Nasa and the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Sudbury Centre.Solar eclipse: What is a "ring of fire"?NASA describes solar eclipse as an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on the latter, fully or partially blocking the Sun's light in some areas.Also Read: Solar eclipse of June 10, 2021: These states will witness partial eclipse. Check timings, live stream optionsA total solar eclipse, as in when the Moon completely obscures the Sun, occurs because the Moon is about 400 times smaller than the Sun, but also 400 times closer, giving both the celestial bodies the same apparent size in the sky.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's orbit is not completely aligned with that of the Sun, thereby leaving a sliver of the solar halo.Because the Moon’s orbit is not perfectly circular, it can sometimes appear slightly smaller than the Sun. When this happens, we witness an annular solar eclipse, where a "ring of fire" appears around the Moon due to the remnant halo of the Sun.Solar eclipse of June 10, 2021The annular solar eclipse of June 10, 2021, where a "ring of fire" appears around the Moon due to the remnant halo of the Sun, will mostly be visible in the northern hemisphere. In the UK and Ireland, people will witness a partial solar eclipse while most of India, barring a few cities, will be missing out on the celestial phenomenon.Also Read: First solar eclipse of 2021 today, nearly all of India to miss outThe solar eclipse on Thursday is expected to begin here shortly after noon, at 1:42pm. The peak time will come around 4:16pm, when both the Sun and the Moon will conjunct exactly at 25 degrees in the Taurus sign. After that, the phenomenon will begin to recede and the solar eclipse will finally end at 6:41pm.About 35% of the Sun will be blocked out by the moon as viewed from Northern Ireland and Scotland, decreasing to about 20% in southeast England, according to Ryan Milligan, lecturer in astrophysics at Queen's University Belfast and an avid solar eclipse chaser. "Most people will be oblivious to what’s going on above their heads, even with clear skies," he said, adding that people need specially-approved solar eclipse glasses that reduce sunlight to safe levels to look directly at the Sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-today-ring-of-fire-around-the-moon-during-annular-solar-eclipse-explained-101623310947529.html

From June 21, dining-in at restaurants can resume, as well as live performances, in-person tuition and gym classes. For companies however, work-from-home remains the default arrangement, according to the statement.“Further relaxations such as for group and event sizes, capacity limits, distancing requirements, mask-wearing and travel will be introduced when a sufficient proportion of the population has been fully vaccinated, especially for those who are vaccinated,” it said in the statement.The country’s daily virus count has dropped to the single-digit range since lockdown-like restrictions such as smaller group sizes and the ban on dining-in were imposed in mid-May, after an outbreak from Changi Airport resulted in the country’s largest active cluster. Singapore’s hard-won success in bringing the latest outbreak under control comes as the city-state ramps up vaccination.As of June 9, about 44% of the population have received their first dose, and about a third have been fully vaccinated, according to the statement. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last month pledged to reopen the economy as testing and inoculation become widespread, signalling a shift away from the strict containment approach that could be detrimental to the trade-reliant country.Vaccination, testingOfficials at a briefing on Thursday said they expect half of Singapore’s population to be fully vaccinated in August. Citizens aged 12 to 39 years old will be invited to register for vaccination from June 11, with this extended to the rest of the population over the coming months.As more activities resume, the government will also require all staff who work at settings with unmasked clients to be regularly tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. These include staff of dine-in food outlets and fitness studios.Authorities have also granted interim approval for self-test kits, that produce results in less than 20 minutes, to be sold at retail pharmacies from June 16 onwards. Sales will be initially limited to 10 kits per person.“This wave of infection is not like a big forest fire where the entire thing is burning. We see spots of fire,” health minister Ong Ye Kung said at the briefing. “We didn’t resort to flying overhead and dropping big water bombs, but the trucks went in with our water tanks and hose, and we managed to put it out.”As Singapore looks to once again restart activities, Lee is set to meet his Australian counterpart, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, today. Morrison will be the first foreign leader to make an official visit to the city-state since Covid-19 broke out, and this takes place against a backdrop of interest within both countries to establish air travel bubbles with each another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-relax-covid-rules-in-stages-as-infections-fall-101623313066375.html
10-06-2021||World||Three in four employees in India seek remote work options: Microsoft survey||Nearly three-fourths or 74% of Indian employees say they want more flexible remote work options while at the same time 73% of them are also craving more in-person time with their teams, according to findings of Microsoft's first annual work trend index released on Thursday. To prepare, 73% of business decision-makers are considering redesigning physical spaces to better accommodate hybrid work environments. The data is clear: extreme flexibility and hybrid work will define the post-pandemic workplace.Microsoft said last year's move to remote work boosted feelings of inclusion for workers because everyone was in the same virtual room. But the move to a hybrid work environment will need to ensure employees are given the flexibility to work when and where they want, as well as the tools they need to equally contribute from wherever they happen to be.The 2021 work trend index outlines findings from a study of more than 30,000 people in 31 countries and analyses trillions of aggregate productivity and labour signals across Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn. It also includes perspectives from experts who have studied collaboration, social capital, and space design at work for decades."If we have learned one thing in the last year, it is that we are no longer bound to traditional notions of space and time when it comes to how, when, and where we work," said Rajiv Sodhi, chief operating officer at Microsoft India.The findings attest that remote work has created new opportunities but there are challenges ahead as well."We believe hybrid work is the future and a successful hybrid strategy will require extreme flexibility. As every organisation fundamentally reimagines itself for the hybrid work era, we are collectively learning and innovating on how we will shape the future of work in India. It is time to embrace work as a frame of mind, not a place you go."Creating a hybrid work plan for any organisation requires a flexible operating model spanning people, places, and processes, show index findings.To help people thrive, organisations need to rethink the entire employee experience -- from creating a culture to attracting and retaining talent and building privacy-backed listening systems.The findings say work has become more human and authentic. Co-workers leaned on each other in new ways to get through the last year.One among four (24%) Indian employees has cried with a colleague and 35% of people are less likely to feel embarrassed now when their home lives show up at work. As living rooms made way for work meetings, 37% of people got to meet their co-workers' families.The genuine interactions with coworkers are helping to foster a workplace where 63% of Indian workers said they are more likely to be their full, authentic selves at work.At the same time, digital overload is real and rising. Self-assessed productivity has remained the same or higher for many employees over the past year, but at a human cost.About 62% of the Indian workforce says their companies are asking too much of them at a time like this and 13% say their employer does not care about their work-life balance.More than half -- 57% to be exact -- of Indian employees feel overworked and 32% feel exhausted.The findings say India's first generation of digital natives (Gen Z) appears to be suffering and need to be re-energised. Nearly 71% of this generation -- those between the ages of 18 and 25 years -- say they are merely surviving or flat-out struggling.Very significantly, a vast talent marketplace is one of the brightest outcomes from shift to remote work. Remote job postings on LinkedIn increased more than five times in the last year, and people are taking notice.This fundamental shift expands economic opportunity for individuals and enables organisations to build high-performing, diverse teams from a near-limitless talent pool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-in-four-employees-in-india-seek-remote-work-options-microsoft-survey-101623307415007.html

Military help is also not likely at government enclaves across the country, the newspaper reported.Additional airstrikes would require Biden's approval, the Times noted.The National Security Council declined to comment to the Times on the options being discussed.The Hill has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The report comes as the US military reaches the halfway point of withdrawing forces.Biden said in April that all US troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that sparked the conflict.Meanwhile, President Biden said at the time that the US would continue to provide humanitarian assistance and support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.Still, questions remained about how the US would handle threats from the region. Concerns over a rise in violence have grown amid clashes between the Afghan military and the Taliban since Biden announced the withdrawal, reported The Hill.Biden is also under pressure to evacuate Afghans who helped US forces during the conflict and are at risk of being hunted by the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mulls-authorising-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-if-country-falls-into-crisis-report-101623306724766.html

The man was discovered Tuesday by a deputy responding to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked near the winery in Santa Rosa, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The deputy saw a hat on a piece of farming equipment and then found the man stuck inside the shaft of a vineyard fan. Firefighters rescued him.“The man indicated he liked to take pictures of the engines of old farm equipment,” the statement said. “After a thorough investigation, which revealed the farm equipment wasn’t antique and the man had far more methamphetamine than camera equipment, the motivation to climb into the fan shaft remains a total mystery.”The 38-year-old man required medical treatment but is expected to make a full recovery, the office said.The man will be charged with trespassing and drug possession, as well as violations of a probation case, the statement said.Vineyard fans are used to circulate air across vines to keep grapes from freezing during colder months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-rescued-after-being-trapped-for-2-days-in-giant-fan-at-santa-rosa-vineyard-101623305333893.html

Beginning on June 15, Facebook will let any employee whose job can be done remotely ask to work that way permanently, the internet giant told news agency AFP."We believe how we work is more important than where we work," Facebook said while sharing an update to its remote work policy."We want to be the place where people can do the best work of their careers while ensuring a consistent experience for employees no matter where they're located."Facebook and other Silicon Valley firms shifted to remote work early in the pandemic, relying on the internet tools they create to get jobs done.Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects the shift to remote work to be a lasting one at the leading social network, which plans to look for employees able to do their jobs from wherever they happen to live.Facebook recently began reopening its offices after a yearlong pandemic shutdown, but without perks such as free food and commuter shuttles.The rollout of vaccines and improving health conditions were cited as reasons for gradually welcoming employees back to abandoned campuses.Facebook said work schedules for those returning to offices will be flexible, but its guidance is for people to be on-site at least half the time.The leading social network said it is on track to have most of its US campuses at 50 percent capacity by early September.Some Facebook offices in Europe and Asia are open, according to the California-based firm.Safety protocols in place include wearing face masks and keeping one's distance at work, along with routine Covid-19 testing, according to Facebook.As of June 15, Facebook will also expand remote work across international borders, supporting moves from the United States to Canada as well as shifts to Britain from other parts of Europe, the company said.Google and Microsoft have unveiled similar hybrid schemes for workers, while some firms such as Twitter have told employees they can work remotely indefinitely.Apple is reportedly facing employee resistance to its plan to bring employees back to the office.The iPhone maker has called for employees to return three days a week starting in September, according to the tech news site The Verge.But some Apple workers have signed a letter calling for more flexibility for employees who have been doing their jobs remotely for more than a year.The Apple letter said the remote system works well and gives employees better work-life balance while accommodating those with special needs and reducing the risk of contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-offers-permanent-work-from-home-for-employees-even-as-offices-reopen-101623303929754.html

'The 2021 Atlantic Charter is designed to echo those values and cover new partnerships, including a new Travel Taskforce for renewed US-UK exchanges.“While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge - how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic,” said Johnson.“And as we do so, cooperation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world’s stability and prosperity. The agreements President Biden and I will make today [Thursday], rooted as they are in our shared values and outlook, will form the foundation of a sustainable global recovery," he said."Eighty years ago the US President and British Prime Minister stood together promising a better future. Today we do the same,” he added.The new Atlantic Charter will outline eight areas to work together, around values of defending democracy, reaffirming the importance of collective security, and building a fair and sustainable global trading system, Downing Street said.The principled commitments made in the new Atlantic Charter will be underpinned by a series of new policy priorities expected to be agreed by the two leaders ahead of the formal G7 deliberations.These include working to open up travel between the UK and US as soon as possible."Many people in the UK and US have been prevented from seeing family and friends for over 400 days as a result of coronavirus travel restrictions. Before the outbreak of coronavirus more than 5 million Brits visited the US and over 4.5 million Americans visited the UK every year - more than any other country," Downing Street said.Biden and Johnson expected to agree to work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible through a new Travel Taskforce, which will make recommendations on safely reopening international travel.The taskforce will work to explore options and to ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward.It’s also expected that the leaders will agree to pursue a landmark bilateral technology agreement, to be signed next year."The agreement will start a new era of strategic cooperation by reducing the barriers British tech firms face when trying to work with their US counterparts. By combining our shared expertise in areas like AI and quantum technology, the UK and US have the potential to transform the way we live," Downing Street said.It added that the two leaders will agree to work together to harness their power to address modern challenges like climate change, fighting cancer and antimicrobial resistance, as well as strengthening our strategic advantage on the international stage as like-minded democracies.To strengthen UK and US efforts to beat the coronavirus pandemic and prevent any future outbreaks, the two leaders are expected to agree to "scale up" joint work on genomic sequencing and variant assessments.This includes the UK Health Security Agency’s new Centre for Pandemic Preparedness linking up with its US counterpart, the proposed National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, as part of an integrated global surveillance system.Discussions between the Prime Minister and President Biden are also expected to cover other areas of bilateral cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-biden-to-hold-first-in-person-meeting-ahead-of-g7-leaders-summit-101623302525983.html

Sri Lanka is currently using China's Sinopharm and Rusian Sputnik V vaccines.Sri Lanka has witnessed an increase of positive cases and deaths since April, partly caused by celebrations and shopping during last month's traditional new year festival.

The UNODC partially attributed the rise in supply to the ease in obtaining precursors to manufacture meth and other drugs. The supply of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, cannabinoids, and ketamine has also expanded across the region, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-drug-trade-booming-amid-covid-19-pandemic-asia-sees-record-rise-in-crystal-meth-use-101623300447660.html
10-06-2021||World||Canada: Researchers claim to have developed treatment for blood clot from AZ jab||Researchers in Canada have claimed to have demonstrated an effective treatment for a rare blood clot caused by the Covid-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca, which is also manufactured under the brand name Covishield by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).Scientists at the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory (MPIL), which is part of the faculty of health sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton in the province of Ontario, recommended “two treatments, a combination of anti-clotting drugs with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin” to combat the adverse side-effect - vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).“The use of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus anticoagulation is recommended for the treatment of VITT, a rare side-effect of adenoviral vector vaccines against Covid-19,” they said in a study published in New England Journal of Medicine.The university described it as a “new lifesaving treatment”. MPIL’s scientific director and associate professor of medicine Ishac Nazy said, “If you were a patient with VITT, I’d be telling you, we know of a treatment approach. We can diagnose it accurately with our tests, treat it, and we know exactly how the treatment works.”MPIL is the only laboratory accredited by Canadian health authorities to test treatments for this rare condition. There have been 28 such cases officially reported in Canada so far, including five fatalities.MPIL researchers devised an “effective VITT test and treatment by building on their previous investigations of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT),” the release said. Scientists modified their HIT test to “detect VITT-specific antibodies that are found, albeit rarely, in patients who had a Covid-19 vaccine”.Following that, tests on blood samples taken from three Canadian patients who were suffering from the side-effect “showed how high doses of immunoglobulin coupled with blood-thinner medications shut down platelet activation and stopped clot formation”.Nazy said, “We now understand the mechanism that leads to platelet activation and clotting.”Around 2.8 million doses of the AZ vaccine have been administered to Canadians, including 500,000 doses of Covishield. While the number recorded as having suffered from adverse reactions was minuscule, health authorities like those in Ontario had paused use of the vaccine in mid-May. The vaccination drive has now resumed for second doses, though the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation updated its recommendation earlier this month to say that the first dose of the AZ vaccine can be followed by a second jab of a Pfizer or Moderna shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-researchers-claim-to-have-developed-treatment-for-blood-clot-from-az-jab-101623300433634.html

One included a pretty woman holding up a sign that read, "Do you want to live at the library with me, from morning till night?" and the other said, "Do you want me to become part of your youth?"The other photos, especially when men held up the signs, did not feature the seemingly suggestive text.For example, one man was pictured holding a sign that said, "Do you want to become an honest, diligent and ambitious NJU student?"The ads became controversial online almost immediately."The problem with this photo is that it treats women as if they should be someone's belonging. These women made it to NJU, but now they are 'part of someone else's youth'? That is ridiculous," one comment said on Weibo.Another wrote: "As a top university, you should recruit based on your resources and quality of your academics, instead of using hot guys and pretty women to lure people."NJU deleted the ads after they receiving the criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-top-university-faces-criticism-for-using-women-to-lure-applicants-101623299456269.html

They will be instrumental in delivering my vision for the #PresidencyOfHope,” Shahid tweeted.Hussain is Maldives’ permanent representative to the UN and doubles up as ambassador to the US and Canada.Naidu is India’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, and he will be on loan from the Indian government to the United Nations for a position that is comparable to the Indian prime minister’s principal secretary, who oversees the cabinet bureaucracy; also something like the chief of staff to the US president.Naidu will probably be the first Indian diplomat to be named to this position, and as such, his appointment bears testimony to India’s growing influence in the world body. India started a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in January - it’s eighth so far - with an unstated goal of, among other things, to buttress its claim to a permanent membership of the most exclusive club of nations in the world.Naidu’s stewardship of the UN general assembly bureaucracy will be critical at a time when the world body is trying to get back on its feet with Covid-19 being steadily brought under control.

In what comes as their first such call since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the ministers “agreed to promote the healthy development of pragmatic cooperation in trade and investment” and “exchanged views frankly and pragmatically on relevant issues and mutual concerns,” according to a statement by the Xi Jinping-led Chinese government.US-China relations have remained strained for years owing to pinched economic ties, hegemonic rivalry in the Pacific, mutual suspicion over each other's political intentions, and global influence. The phone call today between the commerce ministers of two countries is part of an attempt to bridge these fraught ties under the Biden administration — and is the third such call this week, after Chinese vice-premier Liu He spoke with US trade representative Katherine Tai and treasury secretary Janet Yellen earlier.China appears optimistic regarding the latest attempts in normalising economic and political ties between the two countries. According to Gao Feng, the spokesperson for China's commerce ministry, the country has started "normal communications" with the US. The two sides have agreed to pragmatically solve some issues for producers and consumers, and promote healthy, stable economic and trade ties, he said.US statements, on the other hand, do not look that positive. While the Biden administration is committed to leveling the "significantly imbalanced" trade ties with China, there are parts of the US-China relationship “that are unhealthy and have over time been damaging in some very important ways to the US economy,” said US trade representative Katherine Tai said on the weekend before a meeting of Asia-Pacific trade ministers.Investors and market analysts are keeping a close watch on the developments in the international sphere, according to the news agency, without getting overly excited about the normalisation attempts just yet. While it is true that both countries stepping up economic and trade cooperation is a positive step worth highlighting, it is also true that any notable "game-changing decision" or announcement is yet to be made.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-officials-hold-first-phone-call-agree-to-promote-healthy-ties-101623290490594.html

"We were told that a peaceful protest is being organised and the demonstrators were instructed against violence, road blockades and hate speech," he said.The protest in Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) against land grabbing turned violent as fast food franchises, several vehicles, a showroom and two offices of estate agents were set ablaze and police resorted to teargas shelling and firing rubber bullets.An anti-terrorism court in Karachi has handed over 120 people to the police for two-day physical remand, reported The Frontier Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-conversing-with-deaf-sindh-cm-lashes-out-at-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-101623287942543.html

But it may be the North Korean leader’s Swiss timepiece that provides the clearest evidence he’s been watching his weight.Also Read: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un appears in public for the first time in monthKim’s ever-present IWC Schaffhausen Portofino appeared to have been fastened tighter around his wrist in the latest photos released by state media, according to an analysis published Tuesday by NK News. The Seoul-based news site compared close-ups of the $12,000 watch from past months to support observations that Kim, 37, had slimmed down.The North Korean leader’s weight has long been tracked by spy agencies for clues about about the stability of his autocratic and secretive regime, especially since his family has a history of heart disease. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in November that Kim weighed an estimated 140 kilograms (309 pounds) and had gained some 50 kilograms since coming to power in 2011.“Foreign intelligence agencies want to know is Kim Jong Un healthy enough to remain the leader for a long amount of time,” said Colin Zwirko, a senior analytic correspondent for NK News. “What’s going on behind the scenes, if he’s unhealthy? And how does that affect security in the region given North Korea has nuclear weapons.”Kim’s health became the subject of global intrigue during a 20-day absence last year in which he missed birthday celebrations for his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung. The Seoul-based news site Daily NK reported that Kim had undergone a “cardiovascular surgical procedure,” and, when he finally emerged, NK News cited a mark on his wrist as possible evidence to support that theory.Kim hadn’t been featured in North Korean state media for about a month before reports Saturday that he had attended a ruling party meeting on economic issues. The country’s economy has shown little sign of growth this year after its worst contraction in decades as it continues to struggle with the pandemic, U.S. sanctions and a lack of trade with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-swiss-watch-clearest-evidence-of-weight-loss-101623287376413.html

She had previously pleaded not guilty after being charged in a single-count criminal complaint with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the US.She was arrested in February at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.Prosecutors have alleged Coronel “worked closely with the command-and-control structure” of the Sinaloa cartel and conspired to distribute large quantities of drugs, knowing they would be smuggled into the US.Her arrest was a surprise in part because authorities made no move to arrest her over the past two years, even after she was implicated in her husband’s crimes. During Guzman’s trial in 2019, prosecutors said she helped orchestrate Guzman’s two prison breaks in Mexico.As Mexico’s most powerful drug lord, Guzman ran a cartel responsible for smuggling cocaine and other drugs into the United States during his 25-year reign, prosecutors say. They also said his “army of sicarios,” or “hit men,” was under orders to kidnap, torture and kill anyone who got in his way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-kingpin-el-chapo-s-wife-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-us-charges-101623283460291.html
10-06-2021||World||Setbacks for SII leave world short of Covid-19 shots||round the world, from Bangladesh to Nepal to Rwanda, vulnerable hotspots have been grappling with stalled Covid-19 vaccination programmes as they run out of doses. Many of those shortages can be traced back to a single company: The Serum Institute of India.The world’s largest vaccine maker, Serum was last year named a top supplier of coronavirus shots to Covax, the World Health Organization-backed initiative aimed at securing an equitable global rollout. But the company has been dogged by setbacks, from a ban on exports to a factory fire, which have hampered its ability to fill orders.Covax has pledged to send shots to some 92 countries, but has so far received only 30 million of the minimum 200 million doses it ordered from Serum. Serum’s travails have now become a cautionary tale for becoming over-reliant on one manufacturer.Other manufacturers have also had trouble meeting targets, yet Serum’s shortfalls are particularly consequential because Covax and emerging countries were counting on it so heavily.The company has been unable to send any shots overseas since April, when the India banned vaccine exports amid the country’s devastating second wave. But some of Serum’s problems began long before.Last year, Serum’s chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, pledged that his vaccine producing colossus would churn out 400 million doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus shot for low and middle-income countries by the end of 2020. A month into 2021, he said it had manufactured only 70 million shots because the company had been uncertain about when it would receive a license from India and didn’t have enough warehouse space.A string of nations had also entered into direct contracts with Serum and are now racing to find new suppliers. In Nepal, the government says it has received only half of the 2 million shots it ordered directly from Serum. The rest were supposed to arrive by March.“We are struggling with the shortage of vaccines,” said Tara Nath Pokhrel, the director of the family welfare division at Nepal’s health ministry.The decision to choose Serum as a major Covax supplier “was based, largely, on the company’s massive production capacity, ability to deliver at low cost and the fact that its vaccine was one of the earliest to gain WHO emergency use listing,” said Seth Berkley, chief executive officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has been facilitating Covax.Berkley says Serum’s manufacturing capacity is now expanding. Still, Covax and many developing countries are scrambling to find new sources after Serum said that exports are unlikely to resume until the end of 2021 given the needs of India. Bangladesh too briefly stopped giving out first vaccination doses after Serum’s supply shortages.The situation Serum now finds itself in a turnaround. In November, Poonawalla said Serum was aiming to have 100 million doses ready in reserve by the end of December, just a quarter of the amount promised. In January, he lowered that to 70 million.Poonawalla said in January that the shortfalls were due to a lack of warehouse space after slower than anticipated regulatory approvals in India. The company filed their application for an emergency license in early December. Over recent months Poonawalla has also cited US policies for some of his company’s problems, spearheading complaints against a de-facto American export ban on some vaccine raw materials.Meanwhile, in January, a fire broke out at one of Serum’s plants. The manufacturer at first downplayed its impact, but it led to losses of equipment and delays in putting on additional manufacturing lines, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Right now I think they are really, really stuck -- that’s a major blow to Covax,” said Cleo Kontoravdi, a member of Imperial College London’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Research Hub and Vaccine Research Network.Serum didn’t respond to a list of questions.There have been shortages in India as well. India’s initial order sheet in January was parsimonious -- just 11 million shots at first. But as the second wave swept across the demand shot up, and supplies dwindled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setbacks-for-sii-leave-world-short-of-covid-19-shots-101623269299473.html

This means for every 10 people who get the strain, another 15 or 16 people will contract it.The modelling came as the UK recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period on Wednesday, the highest since the end of February."Basically [the modelling] is saying there is a risk of a substantial third wave, (but) we cannot be definitive about the scale of that – it could be substantially lower than the second wave or it could be of the same order of magnitude,” professor Ferguson told reporters.“That, critically, depends on how effective the vaccines still are protecting people against hospitalisation and death against the Delta variant, as well as a few other unknowns. The key issue is how long will it keep on doubling, because we are starting at a very low level and we have a lot of immunity in the population from vaccination and from people being infected in the past," he said.The scientist also said that delaying the June 21 complete unlocking would allow for "more people to get second doses" of vaccines, as the modelling suggests benefits to "getting more vaccines into more arms as it reduces the scale of any third wave".It comes as the government continues to weigh up the data in order to make an announcement on the next stage in the lockdown roadmap by Monday.Meanwhile, the National Health Service (NHS) declared another milestone in its vaccination programme with more than 1 million bookings for a Covid-19 vaccine through the NHS website on Tuesday. It marks a record high figure and the first time daily appointments booked through the national booking service have topped the million mark.As eligibility extended to people aged 25 to 29 on Tuesday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone, around 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours.“The Covid-19 vaccine is still the best protection against coronavirus and as further supplies become available to us week by week it’s great that we’ve seen 25 to 29 year olds sending bookings to blockbuster levels, following hard on the heels of the millions of others,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive.“Hitting 1 million bookings in a day sends a fantastic signal that getting the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us – no matter our age – can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes,” said Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme.Meanwhile, coronavirus vaccines and tests are being stepped up in hotspot areas of north-west England to try to deal with the rise in cases of the Delta variant – the highly transmissible VOC first detected in India. Local leaders have asked for extra vaccine doses to vaccinate everyone even faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-uk-epidemiologist-warns-of-substantial-third-wave-of-covid-19-backed-by-new-data-modelling-101623270207658.html
10-06-2021||World||Biden admin to repeal Trump-era rule that ended federal protection for waterways||The Biden administration began legal action Wednesday to repeal a Trump-era rule that ended federal protections for hundreds of thousands of small streams, wetlands and other waterways, leaving them more vulnerable to pollution from development, industry and farms.The rule — sometimes referred to as “waters of the United States” or WOTUS — narrowed the types of waterways that qualify for federal protection under the Clean Water Act. It was one of hundreds of rollbacks of environmental and public health regulations under former President Donald Trump, who said the rules imposed unnecessary burdens on business.The Trump-era rule, finalized last year, was long sought by builders, oil and gas developers, farmers and others who complained about federal overreach that they said stretched into gullies, creeks and ravines on farmland and other private property.Environmental groups and public-health advocates said the rollback approved under Trump would allow businesses to dump pollutants into unprotected waterways and fill in some wetlands, threatening public water supplies downstream and harming wildlife and habitat.The water rule has been a point of contention for decades. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan has pledged to issue a new rule that protects water quality while not overly burdening small farmers.President Joe Biden ordered a review of the Trump-era rule as part of a broader executive action on climate change during his first week in office. Wednesday's legal filing by the Justice Department begins that process, as the Biden administration formally requests repeal of the Trump-era rule.“Today's action reflects the agencies' intent to initiate a new rulemaking process that restores the protections in place prior to the 2015 WOTUS implementation, and anticipates developing a new rule'' that defines what waters are considered to be under federal jurisdiction, the EPA said in a statement Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-to-repeal-trump-era-rule-that-ended-federal-protection-for-waterways-101623268274707.html
10-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting early July||Canada on Wednesday took a cautious first step toward easing Covid-19 border restrictions, saying it was prepared to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting in early July.Canada's air and land borders have allowed for only essential travel since March of last year, and Canadians coming home are currently required to quarantine for 14 days. If they arrive by air, they also must stay in a designated hotel until they receive a negative Covid-19 test."The first step ... is to allow fully vaccinated individuals currently permitted to enter Canada to do so without the requirement to stay in government-authorized accommodation," Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters on Wednesday.The easing of restrictions will hinge on Covid-19 case numbers and vaccinations, she said.Canadian businesses, especially airlines and those that depend on tourism, have been lobbying for Ottawa to relax restrictions as more and more people are vaccinated. But Hajdu made clear that Ottawa would act slowly.Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said: "We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy."The Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the announcement but said much work still remained."As other countries move ahead with their reopening plans, it is critical for Canada to catch up by providing a national reopening strategy, including a plan for border measures," it said in a statement.By June 21, Canada is due to decide whether to extend land border restrictions with the United States. The measures do not affect trade.Hajdu said Canada would take a "phased approach towards adjusting current border measures."It is still unclear when the border rules might change for foreign travelers.There will be as many as seven phases, with borders not fully open until some 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, a source familiar with the matter said.Canada is working on developing a vaccine certificate that can be presented at the border as proof of vaccination, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters.Even if fully vaccinated, Canadians will be required to take a Covid-19 test before departure and upon arrival, and then quarantine until they receive a negative result, Hajdu saidSome 70% of eligible Canadians have received a first shot, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on Wednesday, while about 10% are fully vaccinated.Canada is due to receive millions of doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in June. Canada will receive 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, with some coming for the first time from the United States, Anand said.On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it was forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-relax-quarantine-protocols-for-fully-vaccinated-citizens-returning-home-starting-early-july-101623266116186.html

Biden, who is due to arrive in Britain on Wednesday at the start of his first trip abroad as president, has said he would press Putin to respect human rights.Putin said last Friday he expected the talks to be held in a positive atmosphere, though he anticipated no breakthrough.He said allegations that Russian hackers were behind a cyber attack that disrupted meat production in North America and Australia were an attempt to provoke a political row ahead of the summit, Interfax news agency reported.Despite "destructive noise" by both sides, a mutual objective has emerged to put their relationship "on a more predictable and stable basis", said Robert Legvold, professor emeritus at Colombia University and a Russia expert."Over time Geneva summits have been critical to the relationship," he told reporters in the Swiss city on Wednesday."And when it comes to actually working out important areas of cooperation, strategic nuclear arms control, the majority of those talks have been in Geneva too."Diplomatic sources expect confirmation of the venue later on Wednesday or Thursday. The Swiss police and army have closed the two parks surrounding the Villa La Grange and installed barricades and barbed wire.Neutral Switzerland, which did not join Western sanctions against Russia for its 2014 annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine, lobbied hard to land the first big power summit in the Alpine country in decades."RESET"In the Cold War era, US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev held their first summit in Geneva in Nov. 1985 and agreed to pursue cuts in their nuclear arsenals.In Geneva in 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a yellow box bearing a red "reset" button to symbolise improved ties under President Barack Obama. But the word "reset" was mistranslated into the Russian word for "overcharge", creating an awkward moment.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Lavrov will accompany Biden and Putin.The classic villa is located in a park along the left bank. Dotted with redwood trees, rose bushes and ancient fountains, the park offers a stunning view of Lake Geneva and sailboats.Biden is also scheduled to hold talks with Swiss President Guy Parmelin.Switzerland has represented US interests in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, often facilitating the transfer of prisoners between the two foes. Tax issues are likely to be raised after Biden referred to Switzerland as a "fiscal paradise" in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-meet-russia-s-vladimir-putin-in-18th-century-swiss-villa-for-june-16-summit-101623265038896.html

The duo also denied knowing any Barbara Jarabica, a female friend of Choksi who he alleged was also behind his abduction. Choksi, in his complaint filed before the Antiguan Royal Police force on June 3, has named one Gurmit Singh as one of his kidnappers. Bhandal and Gurmit Singh have also been named by Michael Polak, a lawyer assisting the Choksi family in the UK, in a complaint filed at British Police’s War Crimes Unit. Barbara Jarabica and another UK resident Gurdip Bath are also said to have been named in the lawyer’s complaint. Bhandal told Writeups24 that he is of Indian origin and resides in Midlands, United Kingdom and doesn’t even remember when he last visited India while referring to his association with India or any Indian authority.He added that he will cooperate with investigators in Antigua if contacted but they were yet to approach him. Asked about their whereabouts on the day Mehul Choksi went missing, Bhandal told the website they were on English Harbour (Antigua) but left late morning for Dominica after clearing immigration. Bhandal further said their plan was to go to St Lucia from Dominica but he got seasick and they had to take a charter to Barbados directly. They denied knowing about Mehul Choksi and anything about allegations levelled by him. Asked why Choksi and his lawyers have specifically taken their name, the duo told Writeups24 -- “On Monday morning when I was not feeling well, so I told them I would like to get out of the boat. Most of the customs and coast guards took our picture and came and started inspecting the boat asking questions. Maybe someone had shared out information with them since our boat was there.”They added they are friends and often sail together in the Mediterranean but this time they decided to go to Caribbean. Bhandal said he works in property purchasing while Gurmit Singh is retired. Barbara Jarabica, in interviews with Indian TV channels, has also denied any role in abduction of Choksi. Choksi has alleged that he was abducted by 8-10 people from Barbara’s house in Antigua on May 23 around 5:15 pm and brought to Dominica in a boat. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said they are conducting an investigation into the allegations of abduction. Choksi is currently being treated in Dominica but is facing illegal entry charges in the country while the Indian government is pushing for his deportation directly to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-uk-nationals-say-they-have-no-role-in-mehul-choksi-s-abduction-101623265210643.html

Two hundred million doses — enough to fully protect 100 million people — would be shared this year, with the balance to be donated in the first half of 2022, the person said.National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the US As Biden embarks on his first foreign trip, he is aiming to show “that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere," Sullivan said.“As he said in his joint session (address), we were the ‘arsenal of democracy’ in World War II," Sullivan said. "We're going to be the ‘arsenal of vaccines’ over this next period to help end the pandemic.”The news of the Pfizer sharing plan was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president's formal announcement. The news was first reported by the Washington Post.The US has faced mounting pressure to outline its global vaccine sharing plan. Inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced, and the demand for shots in the US — where nearly 64% of adults have received at least one dose — has dropped precipitously.The announcement comes a week after the White House unveiled its plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas, mostly through the United Nations-backed COVAX program, promising infusions for South and Central America, Asia, Africa and others at a time of glaring shortages abroad.Overall, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most through COVAX. Officials say a quarter of the nation’s excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the US to share directly with allies and partners.The White House has also directed doses to allies including South Korea, Taiwan and Ukraine.Global public health groups had been aiming to use the upcoming G-7 meetings in Cornwall, England, to press the nation's wealthiest democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world, and Biden's plans drew immediate praise toward that end.“The Biden administration’s decision to purchase and donate additional Covid-19 vaccine doses is the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic," said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign, a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty. “This action sends an incredibly powerful message about America’s commitment to helping the world fight this pandemic and the immense power of US global leadership.”Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that he does not expect the US push to waive the patents on vaccines to cause tension with European counterparts.“We’re all converging around the idea that we need to boost vaccine supply in a number of ways, sharing more of our own doses,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We’ll have more to say on that, helping get more manufacturing capacity around the world.”Globally, there have been more than 3.7 million confirmed deaths from Covid-19, and more than 174 million people have been confirmed infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-buy-500-million-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-share-globally-via-covax-reports-101623264117007.html

If you’re young and haven’t gotten your shot yet, it really is time. It’s the best way to protect yourself and those you love," Biden tweeted on Tuesday.Dr Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said the Delta variant accounts for more than 6 per cent of the cases being sequenced in the US. The actual number is likely higher, as the US is running the genetic sequence on a fraction of cases.The variant has become the dominant strain in the UK, accounting for an estimated 60 per cent of new cases. It’s now more prevalent than the Alpha strain, formerly called the B.1.1.7 strain, which was first identified in the UK, and transmission is peaking in people between the ages of 12 and 20, Dr. Fauci said at a press briefing on Tuesday."In the UK, the Delta variant is rapidly emerging as the dominant variant ... It is replacing the B.1.1.7," Fauci said. "We cannot let that happen in the United States," he told CNBC. President Biden has set a goal of administering at least one vaccine shot to 70 per cent of Americans by July 4. Last week, health officials in Britain warned that the Delta variant of Covid-19, has now become the dominant variant of concern in the UK and may also come with an increased risk of hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-urges-young-people-to-take-covid-19-shots-citing-rapid-spread-of-delta-variant-in-uk-101623262971981.html

10-06-2021||World||1 in 2 Indians faced bias in Trump’s final year: US study||One in two Indian Americans experienced some form of discrimination in the United States over the course of a 12-month period, says a new survey-based study. And it’s mostly over the colour of their skin, followed by gender, religion, country of origin and caste, in that order.The Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS), done jointly by Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie, with polling group YouGov, also found that US-born Indian Americans are more likely to complain of discrimination than those born outside, mostly in India.The study is based on a poll of 1,200 Indian Americans — including citizens, Green Card holders and Non-Resident Indians — in September of 2020, in the run up to the November election. Respondents were asked, among a wide range of questions, if they had felt discrimination against in the past 12 months, roughly the last year of President Donald Trump’s term.Trump’s four years were marked by a significant spike in hate crimes and discriminatory behaviour in the US, including the mainstreaming of white supremacists. The worst of it was against Asian Americans, over the Covid-19 outbreak, which Trump and his supporters had taken to calling the “China Virus”, “Wuhan Virus” or “Kung Flu”.But there is no data to show if Indian American felt the same level of discrimination or less pre-Trump. The report said, according to their data, “one in two Indian Americans reports being subject to some form of discrimination in the past year”. It added that the data suggested that “discrimination based on skin colour is the most common form of bias: 30% of respondents report feeling discriminated against due to the colour of their skin”. The findings showed that 18% were discriminated against due to their gender or religion and 16% for their country of origin. About 5% were discriminated over caste, which, the authors of the report said, based on the responses, was perpetrated by both Indian Americans and non-Indians, such as South Asians who are familiar with caste and related issues. The state of California sued Cisco Systems, a San Jose-based IT giant in July 2020 for alleged caste-based discrimination at workplace on a complaint from an employee who was described as “Dalit”. The lawsuit cited a 2018 survey that found that 67% of Dalit employees reported being treated unfairly at American workplaces.Indian Americans were also hit by a wave of hate crimes and ethnic slurs in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 -- a Sikh man in Arizona was the first person killed in the backlash. A white supremacist gunned down six people at a Wisconsin gurdwara in 2012; and Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an IT engineer from Hyderabad, was killed in Kansas by a man who yelled at him and a friend to “get out of my country” in 2017.“The incident of my friend’s daughter who was born in America being told by another person who was standing in line at a coffee shop to ‘go home’ still stands out for me,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, an advocacy group for the Indian American community. The study, he added, “is a clarion call for the Indian diaspora to build institutions that can stand up for the community and work aggressively on these issues”.A significantly larger number of foreign-born Indian Americans , 59% , did not feel they had been discriminated against in the past one year, compared to 36% of their US-born counterparts, the survey showed. “Differences in social norms, greater awareness of discriminatory practices, or less fear of retaliation”, were some of the factors cited by the study for the higher reporting of discrimination by US-born Indian Americans. In other findings, Indian Americans — both born in the US and outside — tend to marry within the community, with US-born Indian Americans marrying non-Indians at a significantly higher number than foreign-born Indian Americans. They tend to hang out with other Indian Americans as their “social network [is] populated with relatively more people of Indian origin. And only 43% believe the phrase “Indian American” describes them adequately. About 30% preferred to be called “Indian” and 6% don’t like the “hyphenated American” part like Bobby Jindal, the Republican who briefly ran for the White House in 2016, and wanted to be called “American”.The survey makes a broader point that the Indian American community has come of age and as it has come to be portrayed “as a poster child” of America opening up to immigrants, it has also faced greater scrutiny. “This paper argues that while there is much that binds the community, there are also nascent signs that these common bonds are being tested as religious cleavages, generational divides, and political polarisation invite fragmentation,” the study said in conclusion. “In that sense, the currents coursing their way through the Indian diaspora are perhaps reflective not only of broader developments in American society but also—and perhaps even to a greater extent—the turbulence afflicting India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamericans-regularly-encounter-discrimination-survey-101623214070757.html
