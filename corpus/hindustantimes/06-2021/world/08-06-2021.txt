The idea has drawn support from over 60 countries, which now include the US and China. Insiders cautioned that a breakthrough wasn’t expected.Blinken spells out targets for distribution of jabsWith the US sending millions of its Covid-19 vaccines to several countries, including India, secretary of state Antony Blinken said there is a need to increase production capacity on a regional basis across the globe.Testifying before the House foreign affairs committee on the state department’s 2022 budgetary proposals, Blinken said it is important to have three-fourths of the world vaccinated soon.The US, he said, has 80 million vaccines that will be distributed. “We want to make sure that anything we send out is safe and effective. It’s starting now and it’s going to be rolled out over the coming days and weeks between now and the end of July,” Blinken said.1 million Europeans have EU Covid certificatesMore than one million Europeans have received the new EU Covid-19 health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission said on Tuesday. EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European Parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law for the continent’s summer tourism season.It is expected to be passed by a big majority after agreement between MEPs and the EU’s 27 member states on the details, with the vote result known early on Wednesday.The UK government is said to be weighing up a delay of around a fortnight beyond the June 21 timeline set for the final stage of a road map to end all legal lockdown restrictions, amid a continuing rise in the cases of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-debating-on-anti-covid-jab-ipr-101623174619968.html

It also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic’s acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.US President Joe Biden said the “historic judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world”.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday the ruling upholding the conviction of Mladic for genocide and war crimes meant the international justice system has held him to account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mladics-conviction-upheld-at-un-101623174410229.html

Mayra Zulfiqar, who had arrived in Pakistan earlier this year to attend a wedding, was staying at a rented accommodation in Lahore when she was found dead with two bullet wounds and signs of torture on her body.Zahir Jadoon was earlier detained by the police but was not formally arrested after Zulfiqar's uncle him and another man as key suspects in the murder case. The other man has not yet been arrested and is said to be cooperating with the investigation, reported BBC quoting the man’s lawyer. Jadoon’s brother and the driver had previously been detained.Zulfiqar, a law graduate, had been threatened by two men after she turned down marriage proposals from both of them, reported BBC citing legal documents. According to a police report filed by Zulfiqar on April 20, a man had abducted her at a gunpoint and attempted to sexually assault her a few days earlier.When she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, Zulfiqar said, the man threatened her, saying, "You won't be able to escape; I will kill you," as per BBC.Zulfiqar’s father, Muhammad Zulfiqar, had appealed for help to Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 for her work as an advocate for women’s education. Muhammad asked Yousafazai to advocate for justice on behalf of his daughter Mayra Zulfiqar.“My dear daughter Malala, I appeal to you for God’s sake please raise your voice for my daughter. She was like your sister," he told The Associated Press late on Thursday. “Your voice is heard. The only difference is that you have gone abroad after studying here and my daughter came to Pakistan to serve humanity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lahore-police-arrest-man-in-mayra-zulfiqar-murder-case-report-101623172128849.html

The medical body also said that it would communicate the decision in July 2021, unless more data was required.In a statement released on the day, the European regulator said that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) will carry out an accelerated assessment of the data submitted by the vaccine maker in their application. “EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) will carry out an accelerated assessment of data submitted in the application, including results from a large ongoing clinical study involving adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age. This study was carried out in accordance with the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, which was agreed by EMA's Paediatric Committee (PDCO),” it said.EMA allows accelerated assessment of drugs that are of major interest for public health, especially medicines that are therapeutic innovations. The process would usually involve 150 evaluation days rather than the 210 days which is the norm otherwise.The European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), will issue the decision to extend the use of the Moderna shot in young beneficiaries across the member states. “The CHMP’s opinion on extending the use of the vaccine, together with any requirements for further studies and additional safety monitoring, will then be forwarded to the European Commission, which will issue a final legally binding decision applicable in all EU Member States,” the EMA further mentioned in its statement.Moderna’s Covid-19 shot received a conditional marketing authorisation for usage within the EU earlier on January 6 and is currently authorised to be used in the immunisation of people above 18 years of age in the bloc. The vaccine is based on a new technology called the messenger RNA (mRNA) and administered in two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ema-evaluating-use-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-in-12-17-age-group-decision-expected-in-july-2021-101623172757901.html

Harris earlier Tuesday defended her approach, saying in an NBC News interview that there is “not going to be a quick fix” for the flow of people to the U.S. southern border.She rebuffed GOP criticism that she hasn’t yet visited the border. “And I haven’t been to Europe,” she said in the interview. “And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”Also Read | Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bidUnderscoring the political challenge she faces, Harris also came under fire from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democrat from New York, and human-rights groups that expressed disappointment at her warning to migrants not to make the journey to the U.S.The U.S. vice president on Monday visited Guatemala, where she met with President Alejandro Giammattei and announced several new initiatives to crack down on human trafficking and corruption as well as addressing poverty and violence which U.S. officials blame for the migration spike.During a news conference Monday, she told would-be migrants: “Do not come,” warning that “if you come to our border, you will be turned back.”Also Read | Kamala Harris tells Guatemalans ‘Do Not Come,’ urges fight against corruptionBiden and other administration officials have previously made similar remarks. They have sometimes softened their warnings with a time element -- “now” -- suggesting that migrants might be welcome in the future.The Mexican government limited press access to Harris’s meeting with AMLO, restricting coverage to five U.S. journalists and allowing them to observe for about three minutes. AMLO’s party lost its supermajority in the lower house of Mexico’s legislature in midterm elections on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-deflects-barbs-from-republicans-ocasio-cortez-over-border-effort-101623172555872.html

This was a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities,” he said.On Sunday, a 20-year-old Canadian national rammed five people, who were waiting to cross the intersection, with a black pickup truck. According to the police, the investigators believe it was an intentional act and the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith. The police said in a statement there is evidence that it was a “planned, premeditated act, motivated by hate.”“There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,” they added.Nathaniel Veltman, 20, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempt murder.The four family members killed in the attack were Salman Afzaal, 46, his wife, Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter, Yumnah Afzaal, and Afzaal’s 74-year-old mother, whose name is not yet released. Their 9-year-old son, Fayez Afzaal, is in hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.Also Read | 'Stand against hate and Islamophobia': Canadian Muslim family loses three generations in truck attackIn a statement on Tuesday, the victims’ family called on everyone to stand against hate and Islamophobia.

Taking to Twitter, the Canadian prime minister said that Islamophobia has “no place in any of our communities” and the insidious hate must stop.“I spoke on the phone this evening with @LdnOntMayor and @NTahir2015 about the hateful and heinous attack that took place in London, Ontario yesterday.

However, they failed to fully incorporate this information into all of its internal assessments about Capitol riots, the report said.The Senate Rules and Administration and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees jointly prepared the report which focuses on the security, planning and response failures related to the violent attack on the US Capitol. It uncovered a number of failures leading up to and on January 6 that allowed for the Capitol to be breached.Also Read | Alaska man, charged in US Capitol riots, avoids house arrestAccording to the report, the failures ranged from federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of a potential for violence to a lack of planning and inadequate preparation by the US Capitol Police and law enforcement. Notably, the report has omitted any examination of Trump’s role in the attack. Quoting people familiar with the matter, CNN reported that the language had to be carefully crafted in the quest for bipartisanship."Did we look at Trump's role in the attack? The answer is no. The report did not attempt to look at the origins and development of the groups or individuals that participated in the attack on the Capitol,” a Senate committee aide was quoted by CNN as saying.Also Read | Trump and I may never see 'eye-to-eye' on Capitol riots: Mike PenceHere are some of the key findings of the report:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-report-omits-trump-s-role-in-capitol-riots-new-details-revealed-101623161134710.html

They came back up after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour.Fastly, one of the world's most widely-used cloud-based content delivery network providers, said it reported a disruption from a "service configuration" and did not explain."Customers may experience increased origin load as global services return," the company said."Incidents like this underline the fragility of the internet and its independence on a patchwork of fragmented technology. Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover," Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight said."The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is."Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of more than $5 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. It helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking Covid-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.Fastly's website said that most of its coverage areas had faced "Degraded Performance". Error messages on several of the websites pointed to Fastly problems.Websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg News also faced outages.News publishers came up with inventive workarounds to report about the outage when their websites failed to load up.Popular tech website the Verge used Google Docs to report news, while UK Technology Editor at the Guardian started a Twitter thread to report on the problems.At the onset of the outage, nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to Downdetector.com.Twitter users quickly jumped on the news, creating the #InternetShutdown hashtag with KITKAT's official handle telling its 441,500 followers "Guess it's time to Have A Break.""We were offline for a few minutes because the whole internet broke down," tweeted Jitse Groen, chief executive of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-cnn-nyt-paypal-websites-back-online-after-fastly-linked-takes-down-internet-101623160578268.html

The body also expressed concern about the “rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation” in Kayah State and other areas in south-eastern Myanmar.“Recent violence in Kayah State, including indiscriminate attacks by security forces against civilian areas, has led to the internal displacement of an estimated 100,000 men, women and children. Many of them are currently seeking safety in host communities and forests across Kayah and southern parts of neighbouring Shan state,” the UN in Myanmar said in its statement. It further warned that the crisis would force those displaced across the international border, which could be seen in many other parts of the country.Also read | Trial of Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi to begin next weekStressing that the people affected by the violence were in urgent need of essentials such as food, water, shelter, fuel and access to healthcare, the UN said that relief items are ready to be deployed.

08-06-2021||World||NRA's gun rights message lingers in US despite legal, money woes||Liberals have cheered the highly public legal and financial jeopardy ensnaring the National Rifle Association, seeing the gun lobby's potential demise as the path to stricter firearms laws.But, it turns out, the NRA's message has become so solidified in the Republican Party that even if the organization implodes from bankruptcy and allegations of lavish spending and misuse of funds, its unapologetic pro-gun point of view will live on, as the heated debate increasingly shifts from Washington to the states.Not even the shift in power to Democrats in the White House and Congress has been enough to push through new federal restrictions, and states continue to pass laws with far-reaching protections for gun owners.Ever confident, the NRA, which is based in Fairfax, Virginia, says the suggestion it is receding is magical thinking on the left. The group promises it will emerge from bankruptcy stronger, particularly as it seeks to relocate to the decidedly pro-gun rights state of Texas.The durable nature of the NRA’s clout is an exemplar of how difficult it is to claw back control from an entrenched lobbying powerhouse that has planted deep roots in the American political system with money, organization and relentless messaging.“The NRA built up an impressive mountain of power over the course of 40 years. And despite their recent fall from grace, that power doesn't disappear overnight,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in an interview.Not to say there is no hope for gun control — far from it, said Murphy, whose own views are shaped by the massacre of 20 children in Newtown, Conn. on Dec. 14, 2012, and the subsequent (successful) effort by the NRA to stop gun legislation in the aftermath.He said Democratic gains in Congress, despite the efforts by the NRA to stop candidates, are one measure of a change in the dynamic. Another is a shift in some public opinion. A Gallup poll in 2019 found the percentage of people viewing the NRA favorably dropping below 50% for only the second time in three decades.“There’s no doubt that their political muscle is reduced,” Murphy said. “The Georgia special elections are a pretty clear indication of that. Democrats who support universal background checks are winning all over the country, including in states where you would have thought the NRA had a stranglehold.”One of Biden’s first executive orders was on gun control. On Monday, the Justice Department announced model legislation for red-flag laws, which permit police to ask for the removal of firearms from people who may present a danger to themselves or others.In March, the House passed two bills requiring background checks on all firearms sales and transfers and allowing an expanded 10-day review for gun purchases. But the legislation faces strong headwinds in the Senate, with some Republican support required for passage.At the same time, though, the NRA has been growing, with 225,000 additional dues-paying members since January, its ranks now swelling to more than 5 million. Its embattled leader, Wayne LaPierre, has led the fund-raising efforts for nearly three decades, selling himself as an aggressive guardian of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.He positioned the lobby as the major antagonizer of Democratic administrations. Then, in 2016, the organization spent more than $30 million on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data. The effort paid off — after back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump seemed inclined to take action on extensive background checks but backed off after a phone call with the NRA.But those successes were happening while the NRA was having major problems within. By 2018, the organization had a $36 million deficit due to lavish spending. A class action lawsuit by members over mismanagement and a lack of transparency followed in 2019. And then, Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James sued to disband the group, arguing it was “fraught with fraud and abuse.” In D.C., the attorney general sued over improper diversion of funds.The NRA filed for bankruptcy in January. During the trial, an embarrassing deposition by LaPierre emerged in which he said he’d borrowed a friend’s 108-foot yacht to hide multiple times between 2013 and 2018 after threats following multiple mass shootings.Even with that inner turmoil, the NRA has also been behind hundreds of successful efforts to loosen gun laws in the states — most recently working to persuade states to abandon requirements that people get training and pass background checks to carry concealed handguns.Six states have passed legislation removing or weakening concealed-carry permit requirements this year, most recently Texas. About 20 states now allow people to carry concealed weapons without a license.Four more states have passed legislation banning police from enforcing federal gun laws, a preemptive shot at any new measures passed by Democrats.The NRA is far from the only pro-gun group at the table in state legislatures now. In Utah, one of the first states to remove permit requirements this year, it was just one of at least six gun rights groups speaking in favor of the bill at the Capitol — and it wasn’t the most outspoken one.The number of generally pro-gun rights states outnumbers those that pass gun control measures 40 to 10, although the latter have more people, so the country’s population is about evenly divided between the two camps. And a Pew Research Center report released in April found the number of Americans who favor stricter gun laws has declined this year to 53%, down from 60% in September 2019.“Gun rights, the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms is bigger than any organization,” said Jordan Stein, communications director for the Gun Owners of America, one such group.Gun owners would continue fighting if the organizations who often help them organize and coordinate around the issue were gone, he said.Recent gun sales suggest a new zeal for owning a weapon. Gun dealers sold more than 2 million firearms in January, a 75% increase over the same month last year and the biggest-selling January on record, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group. The FBI, meanwhile, reported 4.3 million firearm-related background checks, the highest monthly total since the system was created over two decades ago.While the NRA is easily the best known gun lobby, Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the real players are the state gun groups.“The groups that work at the state level are much more powerful than they used to be," Horwitz said. "Even if the NRA went away tomorrow, and it may, (Senate Republican leader) Mitch McConnell is still going to be checking in with whatever the Kentucky gun rights alliance is, and the Ohio legislature is going to be checking in with the Buckeye Firearms Association.“We’re in a generational battle," he added. "Guns in America is going to be a big fight for a long time.”Despite its troubles, the NRA remains confident in its prowess.The organization, which in January reported total assets of about $203 million, liabilities of about $153 million and $31 million in bank loans, said in court papers it saw revenues drop about 7% because of the coronavirus pandemic. To cut costs, it laid off dozens of employees and canceled its national convention.Last month, a federal judge in Dallas dealt another blow to the lobby when he dismissed its bankruptcy case, because he found it was not filed in good faith.But it has also balanced its budget and is again in the black after years of deficits.“Coupled with our typical excellent report card on legal and legislative advances and wins, the record is clear: the NRA is as strong and effective as ever as we confront President Biden’s anti-gun agenda," said Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA'S managing director for public affairs."Any suggestion to the contrary is wishful thinking from our adversaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nras-gun-rights-message-in-us-lingers-despite-legal-money-woes-101623147680624.html
08-06-2021||World||WTO panel considers easing patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines||Envoys from World Trade Organisation member nations are taking up a proposal to ease patents and other intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines to help developing countries fight the pandemic, an idea backed by the Biden administration but opposed in other wealthy countries with strong pharmaceutical industries.On the table for a two-day meeting of a WTO panel opening Tuesday is a revised proposal presented by India and South Africa for a temporary IP waiver on coronavirus vaccines. The idea has drawn support from more than 60 countries, which now include the United States and China.Some European Union member states oppose the idea, and the EU on Friday offered an alternative proposal that relies on existing World Trade Organization rules. The 27-nation bloc said those rules currently allow governments to grant production licenses — such as for Covid-19 vaccines or therapies — to manufacturers in their countries without the consent of the patent holders in times of emergency.At stake in the meeting is whether the various sides can move toward drawing up a unified text, a key procedural step that could unlock accelerated negotiations. Inside observers cautioned, however, that a major breakthrough was not expected.Even optimistic supporters acknowledge an IP waiver could take months to finalise because of solid resistance from some countries and WTO rules that require consensus on such decisions -- meaning a single country among the 164 members could scuttle any proposal. Even if adopted, ratification would also take time.Advocacy groups, emboldened by the support the United States announced last month, have increasingly pushed the plan and insisted it would not be as difficult to carry out as detractors would say.Doctors Without Borders, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning humanitarian agency, faulted the European Union, Switzerland, Norway and other holdouts on the IP waiver idea Monday for employing alleged “delaying tactics.”Pharmaceutical companies insist that an IP waiver could dampen the incentive for researchers and entrepreneurs to innovate and say vaccine-sharing by rich countries would be a much faster way to get shots to health workers and at-risk populations in the developing world.The World Health Organisation has repeatedly inveighed against unequal access to vaccines, noting that rich countries scooped up supplies well in excess of the need of their own populations while developing countries have obtained only a small fraction of the doses so far distributed and injected worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-panel-considers-easing-protections-on-covid-19-vaccines-101623154520551.html

She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The ministry said the trip damaged the basis of Sino-US ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and was "extremely irresponsible and very dangerous".The United States must immediately stop any kind of official exchanges or military relations with Taiwan, it added."If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely fight head-on at all costs and resolutely defend the country's unity and territorial integrity".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vile-political-provocation-china-on-us-senators-visiting-taiwan-on-military-plane-101623154100387.html

Who is the frontrunner?||Virginia and New Jersey are set to hold their Democratic primaries on Tuesday for the gubernatorial nomination that could be an indicator of where the voters stand after the divisive 2020 US presidential elections. Both states voted for Joe Biden by double-digit margins and both of their governors are Democrats. This means the primary elections will be closely watched since the party's gubernatorial nominee may as well be the frontrunner for the post.The winner of the primary will face Republican Glenn Youngkin, who won his party's nomination last month and immediately received former president Donald Trump's endorsement. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe currently leads a slate of Democratic candidates.The outcome of the gubernatorial election is being watched as a possible bellwether for voter sentiment ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, which will serve as an uphill battle for Democrats who are holding their majority in Congress by skin of their teeth."If the Republicans can manage to recapture Virginia, which has clearly moved in a Democratic direction, the prospects for Democrats in the midterm elections in 2022 will be dimmed, there's just no doubt about it," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.Also Read | Biden promotes $4 trillion plans in visit to Virginia schoolsVirginia, a southeastern US state, has become more Democratic in recent years as no Republican has won statewide office since 2009.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday said that his government has struck a heavy blow to organised crime that will echo around the world.Calling it a watershed moment in Australia’s law enforcement history, Morrison told a news conference that the operation has charged more than 800 hundred alleged offenders, seized millions of dollars in criminal proceeds, and removed weapons from the streets and saved lives. Morrison was joined by Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Reece Kershaw and FBI legal attaché at the US embassy Anthony Russo for the announcement. The AFP commissioner told reporters that the law enforcement agency partnered with the FBI and gained access to a new encrypted application named AN0M.“As of today, we have charged 224 alleged offenders, including 525 charges laid, shut down six clandestine laboratories and acted on 21 threats to kill, including saving a family of five. And seized 104 firearms and weapons and almost $45 million in cash,” said Kershaw, adding that the figures are likely to increase over the coming days.Also Read | FBI employee accused of storing classified documents at homeWhat is AN0M?According to New Zealand police, the FBI dismantled encrypted communication platforms, including Canadian-based encryption service company Phantom Secure, used by criminals. Under the covert law enforcement operation, named ‘Operation Trojan Shield’, the FBI created a closed encrypted company called ‘AN0M’ to fill this void. The US federal law enforcement agency distributed the chat app in the criminal underworld through undercover officers. AN0M was initially used by alleged senior crime figures and later trickled down to associates and other criminals as confidence in the app grew.New Zealand police said in a statement that criminal users of AN0M unknowingly communicated on the system operated by FBI agents, believing their devices were protected from law enforcement by the shield of impenetrable encryption. AN0M was used to “target organised crime, drug trafficking and money laundering activities across the globe by monitoring individuals' communications about their criminal offending,” New Zealand police added.‘Operation Trojan Shield’ was led by the FBI and coordinated with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), AFP, Europol and numerous other law enforcement partners from more than a dozen countries. New Zealand became involved in the operation in January 2020.Also Read | FBI, other agents to start wearing body cameras when serving warrantsWhy did they reveal the existence of the operation?Without further elaborating on it, AFP's Kershaw said that there was a legal time frame for this operation. “Part of it has to do with legal authorities...there is going to be a technical briefing by Assistant Commissioner Ryan,” he said.Talking about the legality of the operation, the commissioner told the reporters that they used the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2018 in combination with legal authority from the FBI. “So there were legal authorities used in relation to this app,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criminals-fall-for-fbi-s-encrypted-app-an0m-hundreds-arrested-worldwide-101623146217451.html

08-06-2021||World||Nepal resumes vaccination campaign with Sinopharm doses given by China||Nepal resumed its stalled coronavirus vaccination campaign on Tuesday with 1 million doses given by China after the Himalayan nation made international pleas for help with a shortage of doses.Thousands of people, all 64 years old, lined up at vaccination centers even before they opened. People aged 60 to 63 are scheduled in coming days.Nepal’s vaccination campaign began in January but was stalled when neighboring India suffered a coronavirus surge and banned exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine it produces. Nepal had received 1 million AstraZeneca doses donated by India and paid for 2 million more but never received half the shipment.That left 1.4 million people over age 65 who received an initial dose of AstraZeneca vaccine still uncertain if they will receive their second.China's first donation of 800,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine in March was snapped up quickly.Desperate Nepal made several pleas to foreign governments and international donor agencies. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari made calls to the Chinese leader and wrote to the presidents of India, the United States and Britain.Another 1 million doses donated by China arrived this month.“I am the happiest person today. I finally got the vaccine and I am now protected,” businessman Pawan Khanal said at a Kathmandu vaccine center. “I want to really thank the government.”“Not only me, but my family is also a lot safer now because we got our vaccine,” said another recipient, Gopal Shrestha, who came with his wife.City and health officials said they had been frustrated because of not being able to provide answers to people desperately seeking vaccines. “Everybody wants to get vaccinated and protect themselves,” said Saroj Dhoj Mulmi, a city council member.Nepal's coronavirus cases are declining after a lockdown imposed when infections surged. In April and May, hospitals were treating patients in corridors, parking garages and waiting areas while struggling with shortages of medicine and oxygen.The 4,472 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Monday were about half of the daily numbers reported last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-resumes-vaccination-campaign-with-sinopharm-doses-given-by-china-101623142759066.html
08-06-2021||World||Trade with India jumped by over 70% in 2021, shows China’s customs data||Spurred to an extent by India importing medical goods from China to combat the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, trade between the two neighbours soared by more than 70% year-on-year to over $48 billion in the first five months of 2021, China’s customs data showed on Monday.Calling it a “spectacular growth”, Chinese state media interpreted the increase in bilateral trade as a sign of resilience in trade ties between the two nations despite conflict at the border and political differences.“Trade between China and India soared 70.1% in US dollar terms in the first five months of this year to $48.16 billion, according to Chinese customs data released on Monday. Specifically, Chinese exports to India grew 64.1% year-on-year from January to May, while imports surged 90.2%,” the tabloid Global Times reported.The India-China trade volume was higher than the trade that Beijing conducted with other trading partners, the report said.The latest statistics were released by China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Monday.As per data available in China, the rise in trade, specifically Chinese exports to India, rose sharply between April and May.Until April, the bilateral trade in goods between China and India in the first quarter of 2021 grew with the total trade volume reaching $27.7 billion, a year-on-year increase of 42.8%.The rise could be attributed to the increase of exports of Chinese medical goods and equipment by Indian companies to fight a surge in Covid-19 cases over the last couple of months.“If anything, these extraordinary growth rates show that China-India trade has largely shrugged off the impact of the political tensions caused by the border friction last year, bouncing back quickly,” the state media report said.India-China trade in 2020 had declined by 5.6% to $87.6 billion, the lowest since 2017. But China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner last year.According to the Indian embassy in Beijing, though overall bilateral trade between the two countries grew exponentially - notwithstanding a fall last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic - India continues to be saddled with a big trade deficit.“The growth of trade deficit with China could be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, that we export to China, and market access impediments for most of our agricultural products and the sectors where we are competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, IT/IteS, etc. Our predominant exports have consisted of cotton, copper and diamonds or natural gems,” the Indian embassy wrote on its website under the section “India-China trade and economic relations”.Chinese companies saw an increase in demand from India for medical equipment, especially oxygen concentrators, in the last couple of months following a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trade-with-india-jumped-by-over-70-in-2021-shows-china-s-customs-data-101623143023368.html
08-06-2021||World||EU, UK on collision course over Northern Ireland Brexit terms||The U.K. and European Union are on course for a fresh confrontation over Northern Ireland, with the bloc warning of “swift” and “firm” action if Britain again breaches the terms of the Brexit deal.Ahead of a key meeting with Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost on Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic warned Brussels would react strongly if the U.K. fails to implement the parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland.“If the U.K. takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely,” he wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph. “Unfortunately, we see numerous and fundamental gaps in the U.K.’s implementation.”The accord -- which U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to less than two years ago -- created a trade border in the Irish sea, roiling supermarket supply chains and stirring violent protests among Northern Ireland’s unionists. Tensions between the U.K. and EU have been rising for months, with the British criticizing the bloc’s “legal purism” and calling for more flexibility.But in a move that threatens to further undermine trust between the two sides, the U.K. is considering a unilateral extension to a grace period that allows sausages and other chilled meat products to continue to be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, the Telegraph reported, without saying how it got the information. The grace period is due to expire on June 30.The EU’s patience is running thin and it could use all the tools at its disposal if the U.K. fails to put a stop to unilateral actions and threats, according to an official who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. They said that earlier infringement and arbitration procedures weren’t working.Under the terms of the Brexit deal, both sides have the right to impose retaliatory tariffs in extreme circumstances. Separately, the EU could prevent the U.K. financial services industry getting access to the single market.The dispute is escalating at a sensitive time for Johnson, who hosts world leaders in the U.K. for the Group of Seven summit later this week. Brexit encroached on a phone call Johnson held with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, ahead of the gathering.Johnson told Macron that “both the U.K. and the EU have a responsibility to find solutions” to the dispute over Northern Ireland, according to a spokesman for the British premier’s office.The onus is on the U.K. to fulfill its obligations or face a much more confrontational future, said the EU official, who said Brussels experts still did not have access to the most basic IT systems to determine what goods are moving where, and thus assess risks linked to plant and animal health.The EU is open to finding solutions, but there are limits to what can be achieved given the political decisions the U.K. has made, the official said. Solutions can only be found within the framework of the protocol, the official added.Defending the U.K.’s stance, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the EU needed to show flexibility to resolve the impasse.“The protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavors to make the protocol work,” Eustice said on Sky News on Tuesday. “What we really need the EU to do is respect that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-on-collision-course-over-northern-ireland-brexit-terms-101623140997779.html
08-06-2021||World||Biden invites Ukraine president to White House in summer||Joe Biden invited his opposite number in Ukraine to visit the White House this summer -- part of efforts to reassure the eastern European country before the U.S. president meets Vladimir Putin in Geneva next week.Tensions between Ukraine and Russia -- high since Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and fomented a war nearby -- spiked in April as the Kremlin stationed tens of thousands of troops on its neighbor’s border and raised the threat of an invasion.The fear in Kyiv is that Biden is prepared to make concessions to Putin to win cooperation on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation. In the run-up to the summit, the U.S. all but abandoned efforts to halt Russia’s construction of an undersea natural-gas pipeline to Europe that could deprive Ukraine of vital transit revenue.In a phone call Monday requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Biden reaffirmed strong U.S. support for the former Soviet republic, according to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.Biden assured Zelenskiy that in his meeting with Putin, “he’ll stand up firmly for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and aspirations,” Sullivan told reporters.The two leaders spoke in what was their second phone call this year. In addition to those discussions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine in May, promising that the U.S. is taking steps toward boosting security assistance to help counter Russia’s “aggressive” and “destabilizing” actions.Zelenskiy said Monday in a tweet that his trip to Washington will take place sometime next month and discussions will focus on expanding “strategic cooperation.”That’s likely to include long-standing goals such as joining NATO, as well as further strengthening ties with the West. The U.S. already supplies Ukraine with military hardware to help it fight Kremlin-backed forces in the conflict in its easternmost regions.Zelenskiy’s press office initially said Biden stressed his “full support for Ukraine’s euro-Atlantic integration and the importance of a NATO membership plan.” But in an amendment published later, that line was replaced with one from Zelenskiy describing the “importance of granting Ukraine a NATO membership action plan.”While the U.S. President said he opposes the implementation of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, Blinken said separately on Monday that the project’s completion is a ‘fait accompli.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-invites-ukraine-president-to-white-house-in-summer-101623140000467.html
08-06-2021||World||Chinese trade retaliation against Aussies is an ominous signal to countries in favour of the Wuhan lab probe||Even as the genomic evidence is mounting to point the needle of suspicion at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) for laboratory leak of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the global community will be vary of nailing China for the pandemic fearing an economic retaliation from the Xi Jinping regime. To date, 173 million people have been afflicted with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and as many as 3.7 million succumbing to it, apart from trillions of dollars lost in economic opportunity.Also Read: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in newsWhile a Wall Street Journal report quoted a May 2020 study by prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California which concluded that the hypothesis that virus was a lab leak from WIV was plausible, the global community fears that the Xi Jinping regime will follow the Australia example against any country that pins the pandemic blame on China. Hence, all eyes are now on US Intelligence report on the virus origins as tasked by US President Joe Biden in coming weeks.On May 18, 2020, Australian health minister Greg Hunt in his speech at the World Health Assembly said, “We are pleased to have support for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the pandemic. We need to learn the lessons from this pandemic and ensure we have the strongest possible health architecture, with an enhanced stability to prevent and respond to future outbreaks.” The Covid-19 resolution was co-sponsored by Australia and the European Union (EU).Also Read: Indian ‘seeker’ among sleuths who raised heat on lab theoryThe Australian health minister also pointed fingers at the WHO in his speech. "This (impartial inquiry) could include an examination of whether the WHO mandate and powers, include around inspection, need to be strengthened to ensure WHO members have timely access to critical data. And we need to protect against the global health threat posed by wildlife wet markets,” he said. The wet market is reference to possible zoonotic spill-over of the virus from bats to humans.The Australian demand for an impartial probe into the origins of the virus at the World Health Assembly (WHA) led to swift retaliation from the Xi Jinping regime with economic sanctions on Australian goods like wine and beef. While a Chinese department accused Australia of having a Cold War mindset, it later suspended the bilateral economic dialogue. Beijing also blames the Australian government for cancelling two deals that the state of Victoria had stuck with China as part of its ambitious belt and road initiative.While President Xi Jinping has directed the Politburo to convey a positive and humble image of China, its wolf warrior diplomats have been issuing threats to even countries like Bangladesh on joining the Quad initiative. Fact is that given the level of investment and exposure by Japanese, American and EU companies in China, it will be very difficult for global powers to call a spade a spade and make Beijing answerable to the pandemic. The matters will be further compounded if the Chinese decide to bring out the American complicity in gain of function research at the Wuhan lab to counter the findings by the much awaited US intelligence report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-retaliation-against-aussies-signal-to-nations-favouring-wuhan-lab-probe-101623139709613.html
08-06-2021||World||'We will be annoying': Thousands of UK police poised for G7 protests||Thousands of police have been drafted in from across Britain to beef up security for what organisers promise will be disruptive and "annoying" protests when G7 leaders gather for a summit this week.The first in-person meeting of the leaders of major developed economies for nearly two years will take place in Cornwall on the tip of southwestern England, with the focus on the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.Police have closed off roads and coastal paths to Carbis Bay, the small seaside resort which is hosting the event, erecting steel fences and putting other restrictions in place.An extra 5,000 officers have been drafted in to help the operation with about 6,500 officers and staff involved altogether, Devon and Cornwall Police said."Everything that we do will be proportionate and will be legitimate," Assistant Chief Constable Glen Mayhew, who is in charge of policing the summit, said. "We know that the eyes of the world's media will be on us over the next seven days."While the threat of terrorism remains - Britain is on its third highest alert level of "substantial", meaning an attack is considered likely - the most overt issue will be dealing with a swathe of protests, some of which will endeavour to cause major disruption to highlight their causes."Our rights weren’t won through quiet, polite protest. Our rights were won through being noisy, disruptive and annoying," said the Kill The Bill group, one of about 20 activist organisations to have joined a "Resist G7 Coalition" (RG7)."We will be loud. We will be disruptive. We will be annoying," said the group, which is campaigning against a proposed law that would give police extra powers to curb protests.Police say they support the right to peaceful protests and have allocated four sites for protesters to gather. But RG7 - whose number also includes climate change groups, anti-war activists and anarchists - has said it will boycott these."RG7 does not talk or liaise with the cops. Cops will not be welcome into any of our spaces," it said on its website.Extinction Rebellion, which caused traffic chaos in central London with 11 days of protests in 2019, has said it expects some 1,000 protesters to make their way to St Ives, the town next to Carbis Bay, for the summit."We have done our best to plan our actions to be peaceful, creative, artistic and Covid safe," it wrote in an open letter to locals last week. "We sincerely apologise in advance for any additional disruption that we cause."Police have indicated they will be taking a tough line, saying sustained disruption could not be allowed and any public order or criminal offences would be dealt with "robustly"."Assuming that a protest has the intention of causing major disruption, then we would look to clear blocked roads as soon as practicable," police said on their website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-be-annoying-thousands-of-uk-police-poised-for-g7-protests-101623139200777.html

The giant sauropod Australotitan cooperensis or 'the southern titan' is among the 15 largest dinosaurs of the world. Australotitan is now the largest known species from Australia, Rochelle Lawrence, senior research assistant, and Scott Hocknull, senior curator, geosciences at Queensland Museum, who were part of the study said ."The new titanosaurian is the largest dinosaur from Australia as represented by osteological remains and based on limb-size comparisons it reached a size similar to that of the giant titanosaurians from South America," the research article read.Also read: 100 million-year-old bones of sauropod dinosaurs discovered in MeghalayaTitanosaurs were the last surviving group of long-necked sauropods and the largest known land-dwelling animals to have ever existed, researchers said. Experts believe that Australotitan would have been "as long as a basketball court" or up to 6.5m (21ft) tall and 30m long."Say hello to Australia’s largest dinosaur & newest species Australotitan cooperensis – the Southern Titan! Nicknamed Cooper, he’s as long as a basketball court & has been scientifically described & named by Queensland Museum & @EromangaNHM paleontologists. ©Vlad Konstantinov," the Queensland Museum tweeted on Monday.The skeleton of the largest dinosaur of the continent was first found on a farm in south-west Queensland by the Mackenzie property owners and excavated with Queensland Museum. The team of researchers nicknamed the dinosaur Cooper based on the nearby Cooper Creek where it was found. Cooper's discovery led to the establishment of the Eromanga Natural History Museum, Lawrence and Hocknull said.The identifying process has been reported to be long due to the remote location of the bones and their sizes and delicate condition, however, many fossils were found intact. The team used new digital technology to capture each bone in 3-D and compare them to the bones of its closest relatives for the first time, Lawrence and Hocknull in the museum's blogpost said.Meet #Australotitan, Australia's largest #dinosaur as we go #BehindtheScenes of this jumbo journey.

08-06-2021||World||Mixed Israeli city of Arabs and Jews remains on edge after violence||Israeli security forces guard the streets of Lod, weeks after rioters torched patrol cars, synagogues and homes. Attackers who killed an Arab and a Jewish resident are still at large. And a mayor whom some blame for setting the stage for some of the worst domestic unrest in Israeli history remains in office.Israel and Hamas reached a truce two weeks ago to end 11 days of fighting in the Gaza Strip. But the roots of the upheavals that wracked Israel’s mixed Jewish-Arab cities during the war have not been addressed, leaving those communities on edge.“It’s hard for me to say what tomorrow will be like. To say that I will have the same trust, it’s hard to say," said Rivi Abramowitz, a Jewish resident of Lod's predominantly Arab Ramat Eshkol neighborhood.Lod, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Tel Aviv, next to the main international airport, is home to 77,000 people. About a third are Arabs — many of them descendants of Palestinians who formed the majority of the city before a mass expulsion amid the 1948 war around Israel's creation.An urban landscape of low-rise housing projects from the 1950s and ’60s, the working-class city also is a bastion of hard-line Jewish politics. In the March 23 election, staunchly nationalist parties, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, won more than 60% of the vote in Lod.Any tensions were largely below the surface — until last month.Clashes between Jerusalem police and Palestinian protesters in and near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, and the planned eviction of Palestinians from homes in an east Jerusalem neighborhood drove some Arab residents of Lod into the streets in protest.On the night that war began between Israel and Hamas, the shooting of an Arab man by a Jewish resident of Lod touched off over a week of violence, and the city was placed under a state of emergency.Similar disturbances, fueled by longstanding Arab grievances over discrimination and lack of opportunities, quickly spread to other mixed areas across the country.In Lod, two residents were killed: Musa Hassuna, 32, by a suspected Jewish gunman, and Yigal Yehoshua, 56, by a suspected group of Arab attackers. No charges have been filed in either case, and police say investigations are ongoing.Some Arab residents point to the election of Mayor Yair Revivo eight years ago as a turning point. Revivo has close ties with a religious nationalist movement known as the “Torah Nucleus,” which promotes what it calls Jewish values in impoverished cities.Critics say Revivo, a member of Likud, has incited hate against Arabs, advanced discriminatory policies and empowered the Torah Nucleus in harmful ways. The group's presence in Lod goes back some 25 years, but its numbers have swelled from two founding families to over 1,000 families today.Before the rioting, Revivo railed against “Arab crime” in his city, calling it an “existential threat to the state of Israel.”“Jewish criminals have a drop of compassion. Arab criminals, you don’t understand, don’t have any inhibitions,” he told Radio 103 in December.In April, he urged the government to launch a military-style operation to clamp down on the “nightmare of gunfire, explosions, fireworks and calls to prayer amplified abnormally at 4 am.”In a letter to Israel's police chief and public security minister, Revivo described “an atmosphere of terror, a Wild West” perpetrated by Arab residents.Days before the May 10 riots, Revivo toured Lod with Itamar Ben Gvir, an ultranationalist lawmaker with anti-Arab views, outraging Arab residents.Ruth Lewin-Chen of the Abraham Initiatives, a nonprofit group based in Lod that promotes coexistence, said its Arab population has grown increasingly frustrated.She cited socioeconomic disparities between Jews and Arabs, violent crime and the absence of effective policing, planning and housing policies. She also pointed to the growing influence of the Torah Nucleus.Many Arabs in Lod view the group with suspicion because of its ties with the West Bank settler movement. Some Arab residents refer to all of them collectively as “settlers.”During the unrest, Arabs targeted property belonging to the religious nationalist community. In response, armed West Bank settlers and other ultranationalists mobilized to Lod, fanning the flames.“We are observant from the religious Zionist community. I don’t see why we’re put into the rubric of ‘settlers,’” said Abramowitz, who has lived in Lod for six years with her husband, who was born in town and whose parents were among the founders of the Torah Nucleus. “Nobody has come to throw out anybody.”Arab politician Mohammed Abu Shikri said that in his decades on Lod's city council, “I’ve never seen a mayor of a mixed city of Arabs and Jews who incites against Arabs, brings in settlers."“I’ve known eight Lod mayors,” he said. Until Revivo, “the mayors always had good relations with the Arabs.”Arabs comprise about 20% of Israel's population and are citizens with the right to vote. But they have long suffered from discrimination, and their communities are often plagued by crime, violence and poverty. They largely identify with the Palestinian cause, leading many Israelis to view them with suspicion.A 2018 report by the Israel Democracy Institute noted disparities in Arab representation in mixed municipalities.Although Arabs make up 30% of Lod’s population, only 14% of municipal employees are Arabs, with only four on the 19-member city council. The city hasn't had an Arab deputy mayor in four decades, the report said.“What does this say about the place of Arabs in the city?” asked Lewin-Chen. Lod lacks almost any facilities for "shared communal life," she said, and city hall does little to bring Jews and Arabs together.A rare exception seems to be the Maccabi Lod boxing club, where Jewish and Arab athletes trained together. “Here we are like family,” said coach Yaacov Wallach.But signs of division are widespread. The town's community center has separate exercise and music classes for Arabs and Jews.In the tense Ramat Eshkol neighborhood, members of the Torah Nucleus community held a circumcision ceremony for a newborn on a recent morning. The next day, an Arab family celebrated the birth of their boy. Although the events were just a block apart, there were no signs of the communities celebrating together.Abramowitz, for her part, says she has cordial relations with her Arab neighbors. But she believes there are limits to how far things can go, saying she wants “live together, but separately.”“There are after-school activities for Arabs, there are after-school activities for Jews,” she said. “We are not interested in mingling — assimilation.”Revivo's office declined interview requests. But it dismissed claims of discrimination, saying he has worked “to improve the quality of life in the Arab community the likes of which hasn’t been recalled since the founding of the city.” It added that “throughout the city, Jews and Arabs live as good neighbors.”Samah Salaimeh, founder of Arab Women in the Center, a Lod-based advocacy group, said she’s optimistic the unrest will be a “wake-up call that we can’t continue this way.”Malek Hassuna, the father of the Arab killed in the unrest, stood by his son's grave, which sits beside those of several generations of the deeply rooted Lod family.“If it's Jew or Arab, it's one blood,” he said, expressing hope his grandchildren will live peacefully with their Jewish neighbors. “I want Lod to go back to how it was 40 or 50 years ago, how it was with coexistence with Jews."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixed-israeli-city-of-arabs-and-jews-remains-on-edge-after-violence-101623135341203.html
08-06-2021||World||Death toll in Pakistan train collision rises to 63||Pakistani engineers Tuesday combed the mangled wreckage of two trains that collided in a remote farming region, an accident that killed dozens and highlighted huge safety problems on the nation's dilapidated rail network.At least 63 people were killed early Monday when a high-speed passenger train knifed through carriages of another express that had derailed minutes earlier near Daharki in Sindh province.Also Read: At least 36 killed in train collision in Pakistan's SindhArmy and civil engineers have cleared much of the wreckage of carriages crushed like tin cans in the collision, and welders were finalising repairs to the damaged rails.A heavy stench of diesel, sweat and blood hung over the scene, with workers saying bodies were still being pulled overnight from mangled carriages."This is the most colossal accident I have seen in about 10 years of service," railway engineer Jahan Zeb told AFP, his eyes puffy from sleeplessness.The Millat Express was heading from Karachi to Sargodha when it derailed, its carriages strewn over the tracks as the Sir Syed Express from Rawalpindi arrived minutes later in the opposite direction, smashing into it.The accident has reignited debate about the parlous state of Pakistan's public transport system -- particularly a rail network that has seen little investment in decades.It is not known what caused the Millat Express to jump its tracks, but Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid -- a former railways minister -- described that section of the line as "a shambles", while current minister Azam Swati called it "really dangerous".Pakistan Railways said Tuesday that 63 people had died in the accident, issuing two lists that named 51 victims and marked 12 others as unidentified.Usman Abdullah, the deputy provincial commissioner, confirmed the toll.They ranged from a months-old infant to a woman who was 81.Khan Mohammad, station master at nearby Reti junction, said more lives could have been saved if they had just a few more minutes after the derailment."I saw a six- or seven-year-old girl trapped underneath the locomotive, her knee stuck in the track," he said."We somehow rescued her, and she was miraculously alive."But then the oncoming train hit."If there had been a delay of about 10 minutes, this accident could have been averted," he said.The double accident happened around 3:30 am (2230 GMT) when most of the 1,200 passengers aboard the two trains would have been dozing.ak-fox/ecl/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-pakistan-train-collision-rises-to-63-101623133576537.html

The meeting was set for early June and could take place as early as this week.Kim's plans were not specified but were described as intending to bring “tangible change" to stabilising the economy and people's living conditions.The North Korean economy has been crippled by decades of mismanagement, US-led sanctions over Kim's nuclear weapons program and the coronavirus pandemic. South Korean officials say there are no signs North Korea is easing the border controls it imposed at the start of the pandemic to import more industrial and agricultural materials to boost production.The Workers' Party last held a plenary meeting of Central Committee members in February, when Kim ripped into state economic agencies for their “passive and self-protecting tendencies” in setting their annual goals.Earlier in the year, at the party's first congress since 2016, Kim urged his people to be resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance and called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries. Those sectors have been critically depleted by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with former President Donald Trump, which failed to bring the North sanctions relief, and the North has so far ignored the Biden administration's calls to resume dialogue.Some experts say Kim could use the upcoming Central Committee meeting to address the stalled nuclear diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-shows-plans-to-stabilise-battered-north-korean-economy-in-covid-aftermath-101623124760033.html

Doctors now want to know if it’s also more severe.Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in Covid patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called Delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the now-dominant strain carries a higher risk of hospitalization.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past six months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the U.S. A spike in infections, fueled by the Delta variant, has put pressure on the U.K. government to reconsider its plans of reopening later this month. Higher rates of transmission compared with other variants, and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines, have made understanding the strain’s effects especially critical.“We need more scientific research to analyze if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not,” said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India’s largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more Covid-19 patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the epidemic.‘New Enemy’“Last year, we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed,” Ghafur said. “This virus has become so, so unpredictable.”Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments Covid-19 patients are experiencing, according to six doctors treating patients across India. Beta and Gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil respectively -- have shown little or no evidence of producing different clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from University of New South Wales last month.Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated eight patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past two months. Two required amputations of fingers or a foot.“I saw three-to-four cases the whole of last year, and now it’s one patient a week,” Manudhane said.Baffling ClotsIndia has reported 18.6 million Covid-19 cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year. The Delta variant was the “primary cause” behind the country’s deadlier second wave and is 50% more contagious than the Alpha strain that was first spotted in the U.K., according to a recent study by an Indian government panel.The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare Covid-19 complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he’s seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.“We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant,” he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don’t.Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom, local media have reported.Some Covid patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai’s King Edward Memorial Hospital.“Every person is showing different symptoms” in the second wave, she said.‘Atypical Presentations’The unusual presentations for Delta and a closely related variant known as Kappa, whose spread led to a fourth lockdown in Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations,” she said.The most alarming aspect of the current epidemic in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a pediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad.Also read: How Centre will vaccinate all 940 million adults against Covid by DecemberApollo’s Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with Covid symptoms, instead of the individuals that dominated last year, reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the Delta variant.Cases of Mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8,800 Covid patients and survivors as of May 22, forcing local health care authorities to call it an epidemic.Even as India’s outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to about a quarter of the May 7 peak -- Delta has sparked outbreaks elsewhere, including virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, bolstering calls for mass immunization.But with emerging evidence Delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones.“New vaccines have to prepared with new variants in mind,” said Ghafur. “We can’t get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gangrene-hearing-loss-point-to-delta-variant-of-covid-19-being-more-severe-101623126133600.html

08-06-2021||World||Canadian caught for Ontario Islamophobic killings charged with murder||A 20-year-old Canadian national has been charged with murder and attempted murder after he mowed down a family in Ontario with his pick-up truck on Sunday evening, killing four and injuring a child, in what is being described as a case of Islamophobia. Several leaders including Canadian PM Justin Trudeau have condemned the killings and said hate has no place in the Canadian society.Nathaniel Veltman drove his vehicle into the Muslim family, who were out for an evening walk in the town of London in the Canadian province. London police said the victims “were all members of the same family” and the deceased included a 74-year-old female, a 46-year-old male, a 44-year-old female, and a 15-year-old female, and a 9-year-old male, who remains in hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries.Veltman, resident in the same town, was charged with four counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “horrified” with what had occurred. “To the Muslim community in London, and to Muslims across the country, know that we stand with you. Islamophobia has no place in any of our communities. This hate is insidious and despicable – and it must stop,” he said in a tweet.Opposition leader Erin O’Toole described the killings as “vile and extreme hatred”. “This type of vile and extreme hatred must be condemned. An Islamophobic act of terror like this has no place in Canada.”Ontario Premier Doug Ford too said that hate and Islamophobia had no place in the province. “Justice must be served for the horrific act of hatred that took place in London, Ontario yesterday. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends during this difficult time. These heinous acts of violence must stop,” he added.A statement released by London police cited investigators to say it was an “intentional” act and that the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith. “There is evidence that this was a planned, premeditated act, motivated by hate,” it said.Names of the victims were not released due to a request for privacy from family members.At approximately 8:40 pm on Sunday, the black pick-up truck being driven by Veltman mounted the sidewalk and hit the victims who were waiting at an intersection near Hyde Park Road. Veltman then sped away from the scene but was apprehended by police about five minutes after the attack.Offering his condolences to the family, London mayor Ed Holder said in a statement, “I speak on behalf of all Londoners, when I say our hearts are broken. We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased. We weep for their loved ones. We pray for the recovery of the 9-year-old boy who remains in hospital.” He ordered the flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-caught-for-ontario-islamophobic-killings-charged-with-murder-101623123100636.html

08-06-2021||World||Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandaughter jailed for fraud in South Africa||A 56-year-old great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, who was an accused in a six-million rand fraud and forgery case, has been sentenced to seven years in jail by a Durban court.Ashish Lata Ramgobin was found guilty by the court on Monday.She was accused of defrauding businessman SR Maharaj after he advanced R6.2 million to her for allegedly clearing import and Customs duties for a non-existent consignment from India. He was promised a share of profits.Lata Ramgobin, who is the daughter of noted rights activists Ela Gandhi and late Mewa Ramgobind, was also refused leave to appeal both the conviction and the sentence by the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court.When trial in the case against Lata Ramgobin started in 2015, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had said that she allegedly provided forged invoices and documents to convince potential investors that three containers of linen were being shipped in from India.At that time, Lata Ramgobin was released on a bail of 50,000 rand.On Monday, the court during the hearing was informed that Lata Ramgobin had met Maharaj, director of the New Africa Alliance Footwear Distributors, in August 2015.The company imports and manufactures and sells clothing, linen and footwear. Maharaj’s company also provides finance to other companies on a profit-share basis. Lata Ramgobin had told Maharaj that she had imported three containers of linen for the South African Hospital Group NetCare."She said she was experiencing financial difficulties to pay for import costs and customs and she needed the money to clear the goods at the harbour,” NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said on Monday."She advised him (Maharaj) that she needed R6.2 million. To convince him, she showed him what she claimed was a signed purchase order for the goods. Later that month, she sent him what seemed to be a NetCare invoice and delivery note as proof that the goods were delivered and payment was imminent," she said.Lata Ramgobin “further sent him confirmation from NetCare’s bank account that payment had been made”, Kara said.Because of Ramgobin’s family credentials and NetCare documents, Maharaj had entered into a written agreement with her for the loan.However, after Maharaj found out that the documents were forged and NetCare had no arrangements with Lata Ramgobin, he laid criminal charges.Ramgobin was founder and executive director of the Participative Development Initiative at the NGO International Centre for Non-Violence, where she described herself as “an activist with focus on environmental, societal and political interests.”A number of other descendants of Mahatma Gandhi are human rights activists and among them are Lata Ramgobin’s cousins Kirti Menon, the late Satish Dhupelia, and Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie.Ramgobin’s mother Ela Gandhi in particular has been internationally recognised for her efforts, including national honours from both India and South Africa.

08-06-2021||World||More Chinese companies could be affected by Biden's broader investment ban||President Joe Biden's order last week banning U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies is broader than a similar one signed by his predecessor Donald Trump and has a lower bar, making it easier to add more companies later.Legal experts say it also may help the administration avoid embarrassing defeats in court after a ban imposed near the end of the Trump administration failed to hold up against legal challenges.Biden's order will prohibit U.S. investments in about 60 companies in China's defense or surveillance technology sectors."It's broader in scope and it's a much lower standard for listing," said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official, adding it should better withstand legal scrutiny.The new order prohibits investments in companies that "operate in or have operated in" China's defense or related materials sector, or in surveillance technology, or are owned or controlled by someone who does. Its aim is to limit the flow of money to companies that undermine U.S. security or "democratic values," which allows listings for human rights abuses.The Trump ban was placed on Chinese military companies as defined years ago in the National Defense Authorization Act: companies owned or controlled by or "affiliated with" the People’s Liberation Army, a government ministry or the People's Republic of China's defense industrial base.The revised order eliminates the requirement for a direct link to the Chinese state, using the more vague language that a company must "operate in" the defense or surveillance sectors.The Trump order needed to be shored up after three companies went to court to challenge it. Two got their designations halted, and there's been no ruling in the third case."Courts are usually reluctant to overrule the president when he makes a national security determination," said Bill Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). "The fact that they did so suggests really poor drafting on the part of the Trump people and a poor defense of the decisions made.""ARBITRARY"Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi, which lost some $10 billion in market capitalization in the month after it was included on the list of banned firms, was the first to bring a case to try to expose flaws in Trump's order.The judge halted Xiaomi's designation in March citing a lack of evidence it was affiliated with the PLA or PRC, and calling its listing "arbitrary and capricious."The government's evidence included an award given to Xiaomi's chairman, which more than 500 entrepreneurs had received since 2004, including the leaders of an infant formula company. It also cited Xiaomi's investments in 5G and artificial intelligence technology, but the judge noted they are fast becoming standard for consumer devices, not just military modernization.The judge also noted errors in the government's decision memo, including incorrectly quoting the statute at issue, and said the government did not meet the definition of "affiliated with," namely, "effectively controlled by another or associated with others under common ownership or control."Last month, the Biden administration agreed to remove the company from the list.Luokung Technology Corp, a mapping technology company, won a similar initial ruling.Neither Xiaomi, nor Luokung nor Gowin Semiconductor, the third company that challenged its designation, are on the revised list.Major Chinese firms included under both orders include China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Huawei Technologies Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp .Hong Kong-based lawyer Wendy Wysong, who had been considering bringing cases over Trump's order, said Biden's listings appear to be on more solid ground."It may be harder to challenge the designation because the underlying rationale presumably won't be so weak, and the designation criteria is not as narrowly worded," said Wysong.Many more companies could be affected by Biden's order depending on "how aggressive the U.S. administration wants to be," said CSIS's Reinsch."In theory it could expand the universe rather significantly," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-chinese-companies-could-to-be-affected-under-biden-s-broader-investment-ban-101623110728642.html
08-06-2021||World||US report concluded Covid-19 may have leaked from Wuhan lab: Report||A report on the origins of Covid-19 by a U.S. government national laboratory concluded the hypothesis claiming the virus leaked from a Chinese lab in Wuhan is plausible and deserves further investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the classified document.The study was prepared in May 2020 by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and was referred by the State Department when it conducted an inquiry into the pandemic's origins during the final months of the Trump administration, the report added.Lawrence Livermore's assessment drew on genomic analysis of the Covid-19 virus, the Journal said.Lawrence Livermore declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report.President Joe Biden said last month he had ordered aides to find answers to the origin of the virus.U.S. intelligence agencies are considering two likely scenarios - that the virus resulted from a laboratory accident or that it emerged from human contact with an infected animal - but they have not come to a conclusion, he said.A still-classified U.S. intelligence report circulated during former President Donald Trump's administration alleged that three researchers at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology became so ill in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, U.S. government sources said.U.S. officials have accused China of a lack of transparency on the virus' origin, a charge Beijing has denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-concluded-covid-19-may-have-leaked-from-wuhan-lab-report-101623108949917.html
08-06-2021||World||Russia imposes sanctions on 9 Canadian officials in retaliatory move||Russia on Monday targeted nine Canadian officials with sanctions in retaliation to Canada's restrictions against Russian officials accused of involvement in the imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the Canadian officials indefinitely barred from entering Russia include David Lametti, Canada's justice minister and attorney general, Brenda Lucki, the Canadian police commissioner and Anne Kelly, the commissioner of the country's Correctional Service.The Russian sanctions also targeted Dominic LeBlanc, minister for intergovernmental affairs, Marci Surkes, the policy director for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Jody Thomas, deputy minister of the national defense department. Also hit with Russian sanctions were Lt. Gen. Mike Rouleau of the Canadian armed forces and Rear Adm. Scott Bishop, the head of the military intelligence command, and Brian Brennan. a deputy police commissioner.The Russian travel ban on Canadian officials follows similar sanctions previously imposed by Moscow against US and European officials in response to their restrictions against Russian officials.Navalny, the most determined political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject. European labs have confirmed that Navalny was poisoned.In February, Navalny was handed a 2 1/2-year prison term on charges of violating the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Germany. The sentence stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has condemned as politically motivated.Russia has rejected the US and the EU criticism of Navalny’s imprisonment and of Russia’s crackdown on protests demanding his release as meddling in its internal affairs.The tensions over Navalny further exacerbated Russia’s relations with the West, which sank to post-Cold War lows over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, the accusations of Moscow's interference in elections and hacking attacks.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement that Moscow remains open for “the development of our ties on the basis of mutual respect and with the emphasis on cooperation in areas such as the Arctic issues, relations between regions and business ties where our interests objectively converge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-imposes-sanctions-on-9-canadian-officials-in-retaliatory-move-101623096514194.html

Monaco said the takeaway for the private sector is that if companies come quickly to law enforcement, officials may be able to conduct similar seizures in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-in-ransom-recovered-from-colonial-pipeline-hackers-us-official-101623094054615.html
08-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris tells Guatemalans ‘Do Not Come,’ urges fight against corruption||Vice President Kamala Harris warned Central Americans not to migrate to the US and said the administration will intensify efforts to combat corruption in the region, after meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday.“Do not come. Do not come,” Harris said at a news conference in Guatemala City. “If you come to our border, you will be turned back.”Harris’s trip is part of the Biden administration’s effort to address the so-called root causes of migration from Central America, after more than 200,000 attempts by migrants from the region to enter the US since the start of the year. President Joe Biden directed Harris to lead the effort to stem the surge in migration.Harris and Giammattei had a “very frank and very candid” conversation that included “the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,” she said. In April, the country’s legislature -- controlled by Giammattei’s party -- refused to seat an anti-corruption judge, Gloria Porras, a move criticized by US officials.Giammattei said at the news conference that there are “zero” allegations of corruption against him.The Justice Department on Monday announced new steps to fight human trafficking, including a joint US law enforcement task force and additional assistance to Central American governments to address the problem in their own countries. The department is also stepping up its efforts on investigations, prosecutions and asset recoveries of corruption in the Northern Triangle countries.“Corruption does not know borders,” Harris said. “We have to follow the money and we have to stop it.”The new announcements follow $310 million in humanitarian aid for Central America that Harris unveiled in April.US and regional leaders must “give the people a sense of hope that help is on the way and to then follow through, understanding that hope does not exist by itself,” Harris said earlier as her meeting with Giammattei began. “It must be coupled with relationships and trust. It must be coupled with tangible outcomes, in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children.”Republicans have criticized Harris’s effort, repeatedly noting that she has yet to travel to the US border. She said in response that the reason she’s in Guatemala is “because this is one of our highest priorities,” adding that she wanted to talk about “what we can do in a way that is significant, is tangible.”“I will continue to be focused on that kind of work as opposed to grand gestures,” she said.The Biden administration’s migration strategy is not yet fully formed, and Harris’s advisers have framed her first overseas trip as a fact-finding mission to help develop the policy. The final strategy is not expected to be released until after Harris returns to the USUS officials have said the Biden administration’s plan will center on improving economic conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador so their citizens have less reason to leave. That strategy has been tried before with mixed results; those countries remain among the poorest in the Western Hemisphere and racked by violence.Harris regards corruption as a main driver of migration since it affects all sectors from the economy to criminal justice. She has pledged to work with non-governmental organizations and companies to direct assistance. Later Monday, she plans to meet with civil society leaders and entrepreneurs before flying to Mexico.”These are efforts that have not been tried in the past that we believe will be quite productive,” Harris said.The benefits of greater US financial aid may be used to soften the blow of tough messages Harris and other officials are expected to send about cracking down on corruption and upholding democratic principles.The US has already condemned the government of El Salvador for a recent purge of the judicial branch and views Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez warily since federal prosecutors implicated him in a drug trafficking ring involving his brother.While Harris is meeting with the leader of only one of the three countries that make up the Northern Triangle of Central America, administration officials say they’re also working with El Salvador and Honduras.Harris is expected to meet on Tuesday with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. AMLO, as he is known, said earlier Monday that he will sign a migration agreement with the new US administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-tells-guatemalans-do-not-come-urges-fight-against-corruption-101623093285577.html

Low-income countries have administered just 0.4 per cent, Tedros said, adding that the most frustrating thing about this statistic is that it hasn't changed in months.At the World Health Assembly, Tedros also called for a massive global effort to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of the population of all countries by September, and at least 30 per cent by the end of the year.As this weekend, the leaders of G7 countries will meet for their annual summit, Tedros said "These seven nations have the power to meet these targets. I am calling on the G7 not just to commit to sharing doses, but to commit to sharing them in June and July.""I also call on all manufacturers to give COVAX first right of refusal on new volume of vaccines, or to commit 50 per cent of their volumes to COVAX this year," he added.Tedros also called on companies whose vaccines rely on mRNA technology to share their knowledge with the WHO's Covid-19 Technology Access Pool."We continue to call on companies with mRNA technology to share it through the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool - the result can be a win-win for both the owner of the know-how as well as for public health," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lifting-covid-19-restrictions-too-quickly-can-be-disastrous-for-those-not-vaccinated-who-chief-101623092761664.html

We need to do the same. That's why in this budget, we've requested USD 58.5 billion for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022," he said, adding that this budget will strengthen global health."The United States has been a leader in this field for decades in Africa and around the world. We're asking for USD 10 billion for global health programs, including nearly USD 1 billion for global health security, to help us prevent, prepare for, and better respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and our prosperity in danger," he said.He said that the budget will accelerate the global response to climate change and the climate crisis by providing USD 2.5 billion for international climate programs, including USD 1.25 billion for the Green Climate Fund, to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs.Blinken said the budget will double down on the fight for democracy, which, he said, is under threat in too many places."Our budget request includes USD 2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, to fight corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies, for example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil society. It also requests USD 300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy," he said.Responding to a question from Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Blinken said that China invests about 50 per cent of its global assistance and 50 per cent of its economic diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific. "So this is clearly a priority for them," he said."We are working closely with partners to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific. And our budget reflects that. We have a significant budget allocation for work in the Indo-Pacific for work that we hope the Congress will support, and this will help us engage effectively in the region," he said.He said the President held the "first ever leaders' summit among the so-called Quad countries: the United States, India, Japan, Australia. We are working with them across a number of fronts to strengthen the work that--that we do together in the region."Meeks said last month he unveiled the Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act or the EAGLE Act which will reinvigorate US institutions and America’s diplomatic efforts to effectively respond to the challenge that's posed by China and boost US engagement in the Indo-Pacific region."In these efforts we must tack from a position of strength but emphasize it through the values that set our nation apart including multilateralism and building alliances, promoting human rights and democracy, and leading the fight against climate change," he said and asked Blinken what are the most critical step to take to advance US engagement, values, and interests in the Indo-Pacific region?Blinken said the budget includes a request of USD 3.6 billion to "pay our assess contributions in full to international organizations, initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts, including to restore America’s annual contributions to the World Health Organization.""As China and others work hard to bend international organisations to their world view, we need to ensure that these organisations instead remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of the road and rules of the world that have made our shared progress possible for so many decades," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-to-revitalise-alliances-and-partnerships-outcompete-china-says-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-101623085099309.html
