The White House announced last week that it was purchasing 500 million Pfizer Inc shots to donate to poorer countries in 2021 and 2022.Also Read | ‘Worst PR award’: Chinese media mocks US donation of 80 Covid vaccine vials to Trinidad and TobagoMore than 175 million Americans have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose so far, and nearly 65% of US adults have received one shot. Meanwhile, countries such as India and Brazil have continued to face severe outbreaks of Covid-19 and are still in desperate need of shots.Zients said US cases and deaths are down more than 90% since late January and are at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic.But he cautioned he is concerned about low vaccination rates in some US communities, especially as a dangerous new variant first identified in India, known as the Delta variant, is spreading in the United States.Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said her agency will present details on Friday about more than 300 confirmed cases of heart inflammation reported among the more than 20 million young adults and adolescents who have received Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-finish-allocating-80-mn-us-made-covid-shots-for-shipment-abroad-101623948888363.html

All but one "nay" vote came from Republicans, although at least 49 joined Democrats in favor of repeal.To be enacted, the measure must also be approved by the Senate - where its prospects are less certain - and signed into law by President Joe Biden, who has said he supports repeal.The US Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. However, that authority has shifted to the president as lawmakers passed "forever war" AUMFs, which do not expire - such as the 2002 Iraq measure, and one allowing the fight against al Qaeda and affiliates after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States."I look forward to Congress no longer taking a back seat on some of the most consequential decisions our nation can make," said Representative Greg Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging support for the repeal.Opponents worry that the repeal would dangerously limit the powers of the president and send the message that the United States is pulling back from the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-votes-to-scrap-2002-authorisation-used-for-iraq-war-101623945684282.html

Before that, two polio workers were gunned down in the line of duty in Swabi city."After the Peshawar incident, the uncertain and threatening situation for the frontline polio workers has emerged and we need to save the program from a further major damage," Dawn quoted the EOC as saying in a statement.It further said that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (SPEI) partners had backed the move. "Hence, no further vaccination or catch-up activity will be conducted in any area for this campaign," said the EOC.Kamal Siddiqi, an Australian journalist of Pakistani origin, has said that these attacks are happening at a time when Pakistan is making strides in its battle against polio.In an op-ed for The Express Tribune, Siddiqi argued that the recent attacks on vaccine workers serve as a reminder how "Pakistanis of the level of ignorance prevailing in our country and the inability of the government to stamp out religious extremism."This comes as Pakistan is among only a few countries in the world where polio is still endemic. As many as 922,824 people have been infected with polio in Pakistan with 21,323 deaths so far.Slamming the Pakistani government, Siddiqi stressed that these attacks need to stop and the authorities need to trace those who are involved in these murders."As a nation, we are willing to bear the shame of being isolated and identified as a polio-positive country but cannot go after and punish the extremists who are responsible for this shame -- as this goes against our values," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indefinitely-suspends-polio-vaccine-drive-after-attacks-on-health-workers-101623941178150.html
17-06-2021||World||Editors of Hong Kong newspaper arrested under security law||Hong Kong police used a sweeping national security law Thursday to arrest five editors and executives of a pro-democracy newspaper on charges of colluding with foreign powers — the first time the legislation has been used against the press in yet another sign of an intensifying crackdown by Chinese authorities in the city long known for its freedoms.Police said they had evidence that more than 30 articles published by Apple Daily played a “crucial part” in what they called a conspiracy with foreign countries to impose sanctions against China and Hong Kong.Apple Daily said in a statement that the move left it “speechless” but vowed to continue its reporting. The newspaper has long been one of the most outspoken defenders of Hong Kong's freedoms and in recent years has often criticized the Chinese and Hong Kong governments for walking back promises that the territory could retain those freedoms for 50 years after the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.The newspaper has thus found itself a frequent target. Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai is currently serving a 20-month prison sentence after being convicted of playing a role in unauthorized protests in 2019, when Hongkongers took the streets in massive antigovernment demonstrations in response to a proposed extradition law that would have allowed suspects to stand trial in China. Protests grew to include calls for broader democratic freedoms, but the movement only appeared to harden Beijing's resolve to limit civil liberties in the territory, including by imposing the national security law used in Thursday's arrests.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion and has been used to arrest over 100 pro-democracy figures since it was first implemented a year ago, with many others fleeing abroad. The result is that it has virtually silenced opposition voices in the city — and drawn sanctions from the U.S. against Hong Kong and Chinese government officials.Those arrested Thursday included Apple Daily’s chief editor Ryan Law; the CEO of its publisher Next Digital, Cheung Kim-hung; the publisher’s chief operating officer; and two other top editors, according to the newspaper.Police also froze 18 million Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 million) in assets belonging to three companies linked to Apple Daily, said Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent at Hong Kong’s National Security Department.Trading in shares of Next Digital was halted Thursday morning at the request of the company, according to filings with the Hong Kong stock exchange.In an apparent show of force, more than 200 police officers were involved in the search of Apple Daily's offices, and the government said a warrant was obtained to look for evidence of a suspected violation of the national security law.Apple Daily published a letter to its readers, saying that police had confiscated many items during the search, including 38 computers that contained “considerable” journalistic material.“Today’s Hong Kong feels unfamiliar and leaves us speechless. It feels as though we are powerless to stop the regime from exercising its power as it pleases,” the letter read. “Nevertheless, the staff of Apple Daily is standing firm. We will continue to persist as Hongkongers and live up to the expectations so that we have no regrets to our readers and the times we are in.”Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee told a news conference that police will investigate those arrested and others to establish if they have assisted in instigating or funding the offenses.He alleged that the police action against the Apple Daily editors and executives is not related to “normal journalistic work.”“The action targeted the use of journalistic work as a tool to endanger national security,” he said.In a chilling warning, he said that anyone working with the “perpetrators” would "pay a hefty price.” He added: “Distance yourself from them, otherwise all you will be left with are regrets.”The Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong said in a statement Thursday that it supported police action, noting that while the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, guarantees the freedoms of speech and press, those rights cannot undermine the “bottom line of national security.”“Freedom of the press is not a ‘shield’ for illegal activities,” the liaison office said.Experts said that, with the arrests, the government has sent a message that certain topics are off limits.“This is a direct attack on Apple Daily, and on press freedom in Hong Kong,” said Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. “I fear that the arrests will send a message to media outlets across Hong Kong, that certain red lines will be enforced … and that those who cross them risk the possibility of arrest and of jail time under the national security law.”Hong Kong Journalists Association Chairman Chris Yeung echoed those concerns, saying the national security law was being used as a “weapon to prosecute media executives and journalists.”He said that the court warrant that allowed police to search the offices of Apple Daily had undermined journalists’ ability to protect their materials, a vital part of upholding press freedom.“Self censorship will get worse if journalists are not sure whether they are able to protect their sources of information,” said Yeung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/editors-of-hong-kong-newspaper-arrested-under-security-law-101623941119364.html
17-06-2021||World||Israeli officer charged in killing of autistic Palestinian||Israeli prosecutors on Thursday charged a border police officer with reckless manslaughter in the deadly shooting of an autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem’s Old City last year.The indictment came just over a year after the shooting of Eyad Hallaq, whose family has criticized Israel's investigation into the killing and called for much tougher charges. The shooting has drawn comparisons to the police killing of George Floyd in the United States.Rights groups say Israel rarely holds members of its security forces accountable for the deadly shootings of Palestinians. Investigations often end with no charges or lenient sentences, and in many cases witnesses are not even summoned for questioning.The officer, who remains unidentified in the indictment submitted to the Jerusalem District Court on Thursday, was charged with reckless manslaughter, and if convicted could face up to 12 years in prison.“We want justice for our son,” Hallaq's father, Khairi, said in response to the indictment. “Why is it that when an Arab kills they say he is a murderer and when an Israeli kills they say reckless manslaughter?”Hallaq, 32, was fatally shot just inside the Old City’s Lion’s Gate on May 30, 2020, as he was on his way to the special-needs institution that he attended. The officer's commander, who was also present during the incident, was not charged.The area is a frequent site of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, and the Old City’s narrow streets are lined with hundreds of security cameras that are monitored by police. But as the investigation proceeded last summer, prosecutors claimed that none of the cameras in the area had worked, and there was no footage of the incident.The Old City is part of east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed to its capital in a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the city's fate is one of the most divisive issues in the conflict.Prosecutors from the police internal investigations department said in a statement that the decision to charge the officer “was made after deep examination of the evidence, examination of all the circumstances of the incident and the claims heard during the officer’s hearing.” They said Hallaq's death was a “serious and unfortunate incident” and that the officer shot him “while he took an unreasonable risk that he would cause his death.”According to accounts at the time, Hallaq was shot after running away and failing to heed calls to stop. Two members of Israel’s paramilitary Border Police then chased Hallaq into a garbage room and shot him as he cowered next to a bin.The Justice Ministry said in a statement in October, when prosecutors recommended charges against the officer, that the wounded Hallaq pointed to a woman he knew and muttered something. The officer then turned to the woman and asked her in Arabic, “Where is the gun?”She replied, “What gun?” At that point, the officer under investigation fired again at Hallaq.The woman mentioned in the statement appears to be Hallaq’s teacher, who was with him that morning. At the time of the shooting, she told an Israeli TV station that she had repeatedly called out to police that he was “disabled.”In the charges filed Thursday, prosecutors described how the accused shot Hallaq in the stomach when he had his back against a wall in a corner, then shot him a second time in the chest while Hallaq was sprawled on the ground injured.Hallaq's family has expressed concerns the killing would be whitewashed, especially after the alleged camera malfunction. In cases of attacks against Israeli security forces, police often quickly release security-camera footage to the public.Palestinians and human rights groups say Israel has a poor record of prosecuting cases in which soldiers and police kill Palestinians under questionable circumstances.An Associated Press investigation in 2019 found that the Israeli military opened investigations into 24 potentially criminal shootings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip over the past year. None had yielded convictions or even indictments, and in most instances, the army had not interviewed key witnesses or retrieved evidence from the field.The Israeli military says it investigates all cases in which Palestinians are killed and that its soldiers often have to make split-second decisions in hostile situations. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israeli security forces in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank in recent years.Hallaq's death prompted a series of small demonstrations in which Jews and Palestinians protested against police violence. Some evoked the killing of Floyd, which sparked a wave of protests across the U.S. demanding racial justice and police accountability. Israeli leaders expressed regret over the shooting death of Hallaq.Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List of Arab parties in Israel’s parliament, criticized the indictment, tweeting that reckless manslaughter was “an infuriating and denigrating charge," given the gravity of what happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-officer-charged-in-last-year-s-killing-of-autistic-palestinian-101623939070293.html
17-06-2021||World||US Supreme Court upholds Obamacare, preserving insurance coverage for millions||The Supreme Court has dismissed a challenge to the Obama era health care law, preserving insurance coverage for millions of Americans.The justices, by a 7-2 vote, left the entire law intact Thursday in ruling that Texas, other Republican-led states and two individuals had no right to bring their lawsuit in federal court.The law’s major provisions include protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, a range of no-cost preventive services and the expansion of the Medicaid program that insures lower-income people, including those who work in jobs that don’t pay much or provide health insurance.Also left in place is the law’s now-toothless requirement that people have health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress rendered that provision irrelevant in 2017 when it reduced the penalty to zero.The elimination of the penalty had become the hook that Texas and other Republican-led states, as well as the Trump administration, used to attack the entire law. They argued that without the mandate, a pillar of the law when it was passed in 2010, the rest of the law should fall, too.And with a more conservative Supreme Court that includes three Trump appointees, opponents of “Obamacare” hoped a majority of the justices would finally kill off the law they have been fighting against for more than a decade.But the third major attack on the law at the Supreme Court ended the way the first two did, with a majority of the court rebuffing efforts to gut the law or get rid of it altogether.Trump’s three appointees to the Supreme Court — Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — split their votes. Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the majority. Gorsuch was in dissent, signing on to an opinion from Justice Samuel Alito.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-upholds-obamacare-preserving-insurance-coverage-for-millions-101623939443157.html

Afghanistan is witnessing its worst Covid-19 wave since the start of the pandemic, with the curve of total active infection cases and related deaths showing an exponential rise. ICRC said that more than a third of Covid-19 tests last week came back positive.“Afghanistan is at a crisis point in the battle to contain Covid-19 as hospital beds are full to capacity in the capital Kabul and in many areas,” Nilab Mobarez, acting president of the Afghan Red Crescent Society, said in a statement released by the ICRC.Afghanistan’s health infrastructure has already been strained due to decades of war and violence has risen in recent months with the gradual withdrawal of US troops. Mobarez warned that the surge is rapidly spiralling out of control adding huge pressures on the country’s fragile health system and millions of people living in poverty“We fear that we are just a heartbeat away from the kind of horror that we have already seen in countries like India and Nepal,” she added.Also Read | US out, Taliban ride on violence, situation critical in AfghanistanAfghan health authorities on Thursday registered 2,313 new Covid-19 cases and a record 101 deaths from the infection in the last 24 hours. Officials and experts have said low testing means those official figures are probably a dramatic undercount. Meanwhile, Afghanistan is also dealing with a vaccine shortfall exacerbated by a high level of hesitancy, with less than 0.5% of the population having been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“Covid-19 is another cruel blow for millions of Afghans already dealing with the constant threat of violence, displacement, food insecurity and poverty. We’re seeing large numbers of people having to make terrible choices between finding a way to feed their families and growing risks of getting sick,” Necephor Mghendi, head of Afghanistan country delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-at-crisis-point-as-covid-19-cases-up-2-400-in-a-month-101623936356033.html

He said negotiations would obviously have to be conducted quietly and in secret.Watch | ‘Consequences would be devastating’: Joe Biden warns Vladimir Putin on NavalnyPeskov, who attended the summit himself, said it had broadly unfolded as Russia had expected and that the meeting, from a Kremlin viewpoint, had gone smoothly."It went off rather well, with a plus sign," Dmitry Peskov told the Ekho Moskvy radio station."It was productive in the sense that the two leaders had the chance to directly explain their positions, more or less understand where they can cooperate, and where right now they can't cooperate because of categorical differences in their views. That also happened and that's also a plus," he said.Peskov singled out a joint statement that reaffirmed the two countries' belief that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."It may be a short statement but...it reflects the special responsibility of our two countries not only before our own peoples but, as pretentious as it may sound, before the whole world," said Peskov.Also Read | Joe Biden gifts Vladimir Putin custom aviator sunglassesRussia's deputy foreign minister said separately that Moscow expected arms control talks with the United States, that were agreed at the summit, to start within weeks.He said Moscow felt reassured by the joint statement on the need to never wage nuclear war and to start arms control talks."The confirmation of the formula that there can be no winner in a nuclear war and that one must not be waged is a significant achievement," Ryabkov told the Kommersant daily newspaper."Frankly speaking, we had growing concerns in recent years about Washington's readiness to support this. This is not a figure of speech or lofty words but simply a reflection of reality."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-pleased-with-putin-biden-summit-hails-pledge-to-never-wage-nuclear-war-101623932947148.html
17-06-2021||World||Chinese crewed spaceship Shenzhou-12 docks with new space station module Tianhe||A Chinese spaceship carrying a three-person crew docked with China's new space station at the start of a three-month mission Thursday, marking a milestone in the country's ambitious space program.The Shenzhou-12 craft connected with the Tianhe space station module about six hours after takeoff from the Jiuquan launch centre on the edge of the Gobi Desert.The three astronauts are the first to take up residency in the main living module and will carry out experiments, test equipment, conduct maintenance and prepare the station for receiving two laboratory modules next year.The mission brings to 14 the number of astronauts China has launched into space since 2003, becoming only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to do so on its own.The astronauts were seen off by space officials, other uniformed military personnel and a crowd of children waving flowers and flags and singing patriotic songs.The rocket dropped its boosters about two minutes into the flight followed by the cowling surrounding Shenzhou-12 at the top of the rocket. After about 10 minutes it separated from the rocket's upper section, extended its solar panels and shortly afterward entered orbit.About a half-dozen adjustments took place over the following six hours to line up the spaceship for docking with the Tianhe, or Heavenly Harmony, module at about 4 p.m. (0800 GMT).The travel time is down from the two days it took to reach China's earlier experimental space stations, a result of a “great many breakthroughs and innovations," the mission’s deputy chief designer, Gao Xu, told state broadcaster CCTV.“So the astronauts can have a good rest in space which should make them less tired," Gao said.Other improvements include an increase in the number of automated and remote-controlled systems that should “significantly lessen the pressure on the astronauts," Gao said.Two astronauts on those past missions were women, and while this first station crew is all male, women are expected to be part of future station crews.Also Read | China launches crewed spacecraft Shenzhou-12 in historic missionThe mission is the third of 11 planned through next year to add the additional sections to the station and send up crews and supplies. A fresh three-member crew and a cargo ship with supplies will be sent in three months.China is not a participant in the International Space Station, largely as a result of US objections to the Chinese programs secrecy and close military ties. However, China has been stepping up cooperation with Russia and a host of other countries, and its station may continue operating beyond the International Space Station, which is reaching the end of its functional life.China landed a probe on Mars last month that carried a rover, the Zhurong, and earlier landed a probe and rover on the moon's less explored far side and brought back the first lunar samples by any country’s space program since the 1970s.China and Russia this week also unveiled an ambitious plan for a joint International Lunar Research Station running through 2036. That could compete and possibly conflict with the multinational Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space cooperation that supports Nasa’s plans to return humans to the moon by 2024 and to launch a historic human mission to Mars.After the Tianhe was launched in April, the rocket that carried it into space made an uncontrolled reentry to Earth, though China dismissed criticism of the potential safety hazard. Usually, discarded rocket stages reenter the atmosphere soon after liftoff, normally over water, and don’t go into orbit.The rocket used Thursday is of a different type and the components that will reenter are expected to burn up long before they could be a danger, said Ji Qiming, assistant director of the China Manned Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-crewed-spaceship-shenzhou-12-docks-with-new-space-station-module-tianhe-101623928640810.html
17-06-2021||World||China disease expert demands next Covid origin probe in US after new NIH study||A senior Chinese epidemiologist has demanded that the second phase of investigation into the origins of coronavirus should be conducted in the United States after a study showed the virus could have been circulating there as early as December 2019, according to a Chinese state media outlet. Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reportedly told Global Times that the US was slow to test people for Covid-19 at an early stage of the pandemic and it possesses many biological laboratories all around the world."All bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny," Global Times quoted Zeng as saying.China’s attempt to put blame on the United States for the devastating pandemic comes after the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) published a study that showed at least seven people in five states were infected with Sars-CoV-2 weeks before the country reported its first official cases. The researchers analysed more than 24,000 stored blood samples collected from across 50 US states between January 2 and March 18, 2020, through the NIH’s ‘All of Us Research Program’.Also Read | WHO chief asks China to cooperate with probe into origins of Covid-19As per the new findings of the study, researchers detected antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in the samples of nine participants, all of them from outside the major urban hotspots of Seattle and New York City, believed to be key points of entry of the virus in the US. The study suggests that the positive samples came as early as January 7 from participants in Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.The origin of the coronavirus has become a source of political tension between China and the United States, which has further heightened after the US demanded a transparent second phase of investigation in China amid claims of possible virus leak at a Wuhan laboratory. Following an investigation by an international team of experts into the virus origins, a joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) was published in March that said Covid-19 most likely originated in the country's wildlife trade, dismissing the lab leak theory as “extremely unlikely”.Citing virus outbreaks in China linked to the imported cold chain, the study also suggested that Sars-CoV-2 can persist in conditions found in frozen food, packaging and cold-chain products. While the report said that the findings raise the possibility for different potential pathways of introduction, Beijing promoted the theory that Covid-19 entered China from overseas via contaminated frozen food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-disease-expert-demands-next-covid-origin-probe-in-us-after-new-nih-study-101623926456768.html

The 1098-carat diamond was shown to Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Wednesday, two weeks after the diamond firm Debswana discovered it.The large gem-quality stone, which measures 73mm long, 52mm wide and 27mm thick, is slightly less heavy than the world's second-largest diamond ‘Lesedi La Rona’ which was also found in Botswana in 2015. The largest diamond unearthed to date, 3106 carat Cullinan stone, was recovered in South Africa in 1905."This is the largest diamond to be recovered by Debswana in its history of over 50 years in operation," Debswana’s acting managing director Lynette Armstrong said."From our preliminary analysis, it could be the world's third-largest gem-quality stone. We are yet to make a decision on whether to sell it through the De Beers channel or through the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company," she added.Also Read | Mystery stones spark diamond rush in poor South African regionMinerals minister Lefoko Moagi said the discovery of the yet-to-be-named diamond could not have come at a better time after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic hit diamond sales in 2020. While an estimate of the diamond's potential cost has not yet been released, the cost of Lesedi La Rona, which was sold for $53 million in 2017 to a London jeweller, can be used to gauge the potential cost.Botswana government receives as much as 80 per cent of the income from Debswana's sales through dividends, royalties and taxes. The economic devastation caused by the pandemic impacted both diamond production and demand in 2020. Production at Debswana fell 29% to 16.6 million carats, while sales fell 30%to $2.1 billion.In 2021, Debswana plans to increase output by as much as 38% to pre-pandemic levels of 23 million carats as the global diamond market recovers with the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of jewellers.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diamond-believed-to-be-world-s-third-largest-unearthed-in-botswana-101623920970460.html

Regular hearings on the case will resume from June 23.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to embattled Prime Minister Oli who was preparing for snap polls.Oli repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House of Representatives, saying some leaders of his party were attempting to form a "parallel government".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/courts-can-t-appoint-pm-oli-defends-dissolution-of-house-of-representatives-101623919616616.html
17-06-2021||World||Major Australian banking, airline websites goes down briefly in broad internet outage||A plethora of websites operated by financial institutions, governments and airlines including Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. and Australia’s central bank went down briefly Thursday in the second global internet outage in as many weeks.Some of the outages, including those that affected Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., were linked to a failure at Akamai Technologies Ltd., which helps clients manage web services, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal affairs. The Reserve Bank of Australia was forced to cancel a scheduled bond-buying operation Thursday, blaming “technical difficulties.” A representative for Akamai in Asia didn’t respond to emails and calls seeking comment.The widespread downtime recalled an hour-long global outage earlier this month, triggered by a software failure at content delivery platform Fastly Inc. The resultant cascading failures, which affected services from Amazon.com Inc. to Shopify Inc. and Stripe Inc., served as a stark reminder of how exposed the world’s biggest websites are to the impact of disruptions ranging from simple human error to coordinated cyberattack.Website tracker Downdetector.com initially flagged hundreds of user complaints about outages affecting Southwest Airlines Co., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Automatic Data Processing Inc. Other websites pinpointed included those operated by Vanguard, E-Trade and Navy Federal Credit Union.Many of the websites affected on Thursday recovered within the hour, some after rerouting to other providers. Companies including Hong Kong’s exchange and Southwest said they were investigating the incident, without elaborating. “The pause in connectivity did not impact our operation,” Southwest said in an emailed response to questions.It was unclear what triggered the incidents Thursday. In Fastly’s case, a valid software configuration change by one of its customers triggered a previously undiscovered bug, introduced during a May 12 software deployment. Fastly quickly identified an issue with its content delivery network and announced it was rolling out a fix just 46 minutes after acknowledging a problem. Sites began to spring back to life soon afterward.Akamai is one of a number of high-level website and application hosting services that large enterprises use to serve content to millions of users simultaneously.Rather than hosting all website content on a single set of servers in one location, Fastly’s so-called “edge computing” model puts servers in dozens of locations, allowing websites to serve pages to users from physical locations closest to them. This cuts lag time, speeding up page-loading and spreading the burden on individual servers.These vast and complex setups are run by just a few companies, such as Fastly and Cloudflare Inc. The global edge computing market was valued at $4.68 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 38.4% from 2021 to 2028, according to a recent analysis by Grand View Research.While these setups usually work perfectly, their complexity means that even a simple error in a configuration file can trigger chain reactions of outages. For users, most of whom rarely need to think about how the internet works, that can come as a shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-airline-websites-went-down-briefly-in-broad-internet-outage-101623913799947.html

Previously, the Delhi Covid-19 strain was only considered a "variant of interest" by the US CDC, but its status was changed to a "variant of concern" after assessing the Delta variant's high transmissibility, among other factors.Along with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19, a few other variants circulating in the United States have also been classified as 'variants of concern', a CDC statement published on Tuesday read. These include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) Covid-19 variants.The CDC said the Delta variant shows increased transmissibility, potential reduction in neutralisation by some monoclonal antibody treatments under emergency authorisation, and potential reduction in neutralization from sera after vaccination in lab tests. A particular Covid-19 variant is only dubbed 'variant of concern' when scientists believe that coronavirus strain is shows increased transmissibility and a chance to cause more severe disease. Vaccines, treatments, and tests that detect the virus may also be less effective against a variant of concern.The Delta variant, which was dubbed a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 10, accounts for around 9.9% of all Covid-19 cases in the United States, the CDC estimates. However, to date, no variants of high consequence have been identified in the country, the public health body explained in its statement.US President Joe Biden and his Chief Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci last week have warned that the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus is highly infectious, which is now the dominant strain in the United Kingdom, spreading rapidly among young people between 12 and 20 years old.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-classified-as-variant-of-concern-by-us-cdc-101623905251183.html
17-06-2021||World||US ends strict Trump-era asylum rules for violence victims||The US government on Wednesday ended two Trump administration policies that made it harder for immigrants fleeing violence to qualify for asylum, especially Central Americans.Attorney General Merrick Garland issued new instructions to immigration judges to stop following the Trump-era rules that made it tough for immigrants who faced domestic or gang violence to win asylum in the United States. He also undid a policy that made it difficult for immigrants to obtain asylum based on threats to a family member.The moves could make it easier for immigrants to win their cases for humanitarian protection and were widely celebrated by immigrant advocates.“The significance of this cannot be overstated,” said Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council. “This was one of the worst anti-asylum decisions under the Trump era, and this is a really important first step in undoing that.”Garland said he was making the changes after President Joe Biden ordered his office and the Department of Homeland Security to draft rules addressing complex issues in immigration law about groups of people who should qualify for asylum.Gene Hamilton, a key architect of many of former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies who served in the Justice Department, said in a statement that he believed the change would lead to more immigrants filing asylum claims based on crime and that should not be a reason for protections.The Biden administration changes come as U.S. immigration authorities have reported unusually high numbers of encounters with migrants on the southern border. In April, border officials reported the highest number of encounters in more than 20 years, though many migrants were repeat crossers who previously had been expelled from the country under pandemic-related powers. The number of children crossing the border alone also has hovered at all-time highs.Many Central Americans arrive on the border fleeing gang violence in their countries. But it isn't easy to qualify for asylum under U.S. immigration laws, and the Trump-era policies made it that much harder.More than half of asylum cases decided by the immigration courts in the 2020 fiscal year were denials, according to data from the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review. Four years earlier, it was about one in five cases.In the current fiscal year, people from countries such as Russia and Cameroon have seen higher asylum grant rates in the immigration courts than people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, the data shows.Immigration judges abide by instructions set by the attorney general, and their courts are within the Justice Department.In one of the reversals, Garland restored a 2014 case that defined married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship as a group deserving of asylum, a decision that eased the way for other victims of domestic violence. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned that guidance and added that victims of gang violence also should be largely ineligible, extending the scope to large swaths of non-government actors.In another case involving a Mexican man who claimed his father was targeted by a drug cartel, Garland reversed a decision by former Attorney General William Barr that said such family ties were insufficient grounds for an asylum claim.Jason Dzubow, an immigration attorney in Washington who focuses on asylum, said he recently represented a Salvadoran family in which the husband was killed and gang members started coming after his children. While Dzubow argued they were in danger because of their family ties, he said the immigration judge denied the case, citing the Trump-era decision among the reasons.Dzubow welcomed Garland's changes but said he doesn't expect to suddenly see large numbers of Central Americans winning their asylum cases, which remain difficult under U.S. law.“I don't expect it is going to open the floodgates, and all of a sudden everyone from Central America can win their cases. Those cases are very burdensome and difficult,” he said. “We need to make a decision: Do we want to protect these people?'”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ends-strict-trump-era-asylum-rules-for-violence-victims-101623904795582.html
17-06-2021||World||Glacial outburst suspected for flash flood in Central Nepal||The flash flood incident of Tuesday in Sindhupalchok district of Nepal is suspected to be caused by glacial outburst in a high lying area bordering Tibet, said a government official.Speaking to ANI, Rudra Prasad Dulal, Ward Chair of Sindhupalchok ward 11 confirmed that the incident can be the result of a glacial outburst near Tibetan territory which has resulted in loss of millions of rupees."Reason behind this flash flood is attributed to heavy rainfall in upper lying areas. Shaken by the 2072 (Nepali date of 2015 earthquake) earthquake, creeks on the inner areas of the hills are suspected to be swept by large masses of ice and muds contained by it. We have suspected it to be a reason for flooding," Rudra Prasad Dulal said.He also added that incessant rainfall and movement of ice masses underneath the glaciers which ran down the hill have been dumped here in low lying areas."We are suspecting it to be a glacial outburst," Dulal stressed.Several people, who have been displaced due to floods as they have lost their houses and properties, are in state of shock.Melamchi town, once a brimming marketplace and centre of attraction, now remains submerged in a thick layer of mud, sand and water after the flood. As per the official, about 200 houses in town have been damaged partially or completely in mayhem which began with onset of monsoon.Hundreds of families who resided in the area have taken shelter in a local school, located a few hundred meters away from the main market square.Radhika Shrestha, one of displaced due to flood while recalling the incident said: "I just had returned back from my field, then brother-in-law who resides in "Dhap" (locality in Sindhupalchok) called me and warned to flee to safer ground stating a river has been blocked from flowing due to landslide which might burst and flood the town where we reside.""Till the time I received a warning call, I called my husband who was working in the field, to rush out from there. Later we ran to high edges without any second thoughts," she said.As the blocked river made its way down hill, it has completely changed the life of Shrestha's family of four who have lost all of their belongings in the flood compelling them to make a fresh start."As flood took away our land, properties and all key documents, our family has to survive whether by doing labour or any other means," Shrestha said.After the mayhem, a total of seven people have been confirmed dead by district administration and at least eight staffers of the Melamchi drinking water project have gone missing.Nepal Army along with Armed Police Force and the Nepal Police has been conducting a rescue and search operation in the flood ravaged area, which has continued to be submerged under a thick layer of mud and high flowing water."We are yet to think about making a new start. All the riches which we earned lies in that house which is now covered in mud and is not accessible. We don't have anything now and we are clueless where to go and how to go, a complete state of numbness reels over mind," Laxmi Prasad Shrestha, another flood victim from the area said.One of the epicenters of 2015 earthquake, Sindhupalchok has been witnessing damages due to floods and landslides on an annual basis. With the onset of monsoon in the Himalayan nation, incidents of floods and landslides are expected to rise further.Earlier, Meteorologists of Nepal and other South Asian nations had predicted that monsoon for the year 2021 will arrive earlier than last year and that Nepal and some other Asian countries are expected to receive normal to above-normal rainfall.As per Nepal's Meteorological Forecasting Division, monsoon has already hit Nepal from June 1 and it will continue for about 3 months.Last year, the monsoon entered Nepal on June 12, two days later than the normal onset date (June 10). In 2019, monsoon entered eastern Nepal on June 20, delayed by 10 days. Lasting for 105 days in Nepal, monsoon normally leaves the country by September end.Almost 80 per cent of the annual rain in Nepal is received during the monsoon (June-September). The average annual rainfall is 1,600 mm, but it varies by eco-climatic zones (3,345 mm in Pokhara and below 300 mm in Mustang).The Meteorological Forecasting Division (MFD) has estimated the high mountainous region of Nepal to receive 55 to 65 per cent rainfall (snow mainly) in 2021. Additionally, average rainfall is estimated to be anywhere between 35 to 45 per cent in Lumbini, Gandaki, Bagmati and in the western part of Province 2, while Terai region of Province 1 and eastern region of Province 2 are likely to receive less-than-average rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glacial-outburst-suspected-for-flash-flood-in-central-nepal-101623904493595.html
17-06-2021||World||US Congress declares holiday for Juneteenth, marking end of slavery||The United States will soon have a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery.The House voted 415-14 Wednesday to make Juneteenth, or June 19th, the 12th federal holiday. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk, and he is expected to sign it into law.Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas — two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. That was also about 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in the Southern states.It’s the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983.“Our federal holidays are purposely few in number and recognize the most important milestones," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. “I cannot think of a more important milestone to commemorate than the end of slavery in the United States."Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaking next to a large poster of a Black man whose back bore massive scarring from being whipped, said she would be in Galveston this Saturday to celebrate along with Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.“Can you imagine?” said the rather short Jackson Lee. “I will be standing maybe taller than Sen. Cornyn, forgive me for that, because it will be such an elevation of joy.”The Senate passed the bill a day earlier under a unanimous consent agreement that expedites the process for considering legislation. It takes just one senator’s objection to block such agreements.“Please, let us do as the Senate. Vote unanimously for passage," Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., pleaded with his colleagues.The vote comes as lawmakers struggle to overcome divisions on police reform legislation following the killing of George Floyd by police and as Republican state legislators push what experts say is an unprecedented number of bills aimed at restricting access to the ballot box. While Republicans say the goal is to prevent voter fraud, Democrats contend that the measures are aimed at undermining minority voting rights.Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus took to the floor to speak in favor of the bill. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said she viewed Juneteenth as a commemoration rather than a celebration because it represented something that was delayed in happening.“It also reminds me of what we don't have today," she said. “And that is full access to justice, freedom and equality. All these are often in short supply as it relates to the Black community."The bill was sponsored by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and had 60 co-sponsors. Democratic leaders moved quickly to bring the bill to the House floor after the Senate's vote the day before.Some Republican lawmakers opposed the effort. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., said creating the federal holiday was an effort to celebrate “identity politics."“Since I believe in treating everyone equally, regardless of race, and that we should be focused on what unites us rather than our differences, I will vote no," he said in a press release.The vast majority of states recognize Juneteenth as a holiday or have an official observance of the day, and most states hold celebrations. Juneteenth is a paid holiday for state employees in Texas, New York, Virginia and Washington.Under the legislation, the federal holiday would be known as Juneteenth National Independence Day.Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said that he would vote for the bill and that he supported the establishment of a federal holiday, but he was upset that the name of the holiday included the word “independence” rather than “emancipation.”“Why would the Democrats want to politicize this by coopting the name of our sacred holiday of Independence Day?" Higgins asked.Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., replied, “I want to say to my white colleagues on the other side: Getting your independence from being enslaved in a country is different from a country getting independence to rule themselves.”She added, "We have a responsibility to teach every generation of Black and white Americans the pride of a people who have survived, endured and succeeded in these United States of America despite slavery."The 14 House Republicans who voted against the bill were Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Doug LaMalfa of California, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom McClintock of California, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Mike Rogers of Alabama, Rosendale of Montana, Chip Roy of Texas and Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-approves-bill-to-make-juneteenth-a-federal-holiday-101623904080593.html

The station is expected to be completed by 2022.Thursday’s launch is Beijing’s latest demonstration of its growing confidence and capability in space. In recent months, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency reported.The ISS – from which China is excluded – comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.Also Read | A year on, Galwan braveheart’s kin wait for govt to keep its word“The mission’s launch was broadcast live on CCTV, China’s state broadcaster and also live streamed on China’s social media platforms on Thursday morning, drawing hundreds of millions of views and soon topping the trending list on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo,” a state media report said.Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first spacewalk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).The launch and docking of Tianzhou-2 was carried out a month after Tianhe, the first part of the space station Tiangong, “Heavenly Palace” in Chinese, was launched.In late April, China sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.The Tianhe, which was sent to orbit by a rocket, can provide electricity and accommodate three astronauts for up to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-crewed-spacecraft-shenzhou-12-in-historic-mission-101623901874096.html

17-06-2021||World||China launches manned space mission: Veteran astronaut, treadmills and more||China sent three astronauts into orbit on Thursday in a high-stakes mission, the first of four crewed space flights to complete the country's space station by the end of next year. China launched Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo into orbit aboard the spacecraft Shenzhou-12 from Jiuquan in northwestern Gansu province, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) has said.The astronauts are traveling in Shenzhou-12 or Divine Vessel spaceship launched by a Long March-2F Y12 rocket to Tianhe, which means Harmony of the Heavens, the core module of China's new space station. The mission will be China's longest crewed mission to date and the first in nearly five years, as Beijing pushes forward with its ambitious programme to establish itself as a space power.The menThe mission’s commander is Nie Haisheng and the most senior of the three is making his third trip to space. “The task is very arduous and there are many challenges. My colleagues and I will cooperate closely, operate carefully and overcome all difficulties,” Nie, the 56-year-old, said. Nie was among the first batch of Chinese astronauts selected for training in 1998 and is a decorated air force pilot. Nie, the oldest Chinese astronaut to go to space, has said he has packed "things for entertainment and for hosting mini get-togethers" for the long trip.The others in his team are also members of the Chinese military. Also read | A selfie from Mars: China's Zhurong rover spreads its 'wings' on Red PlanetLiu Boming’s previous flight in 2008 included the first spacewalk of China. The 54-year-old said there would be multiple such activities during the mission as the astronauts carry out their science experiments, conduct maintenance and prepare the Tianhe core module to receive two other modules to be sent up next year. China Global Television Network (CGTN) reported that Liu learned about manned space missions in high school and applied to become a military pilot without letting his parents know. According to the Chinese state media outlet, he became a fighter jet pilot in 1990 and has recorded more than 1000 hours of safe flying. He is a major general in the People's Liberation Army.Tang Hongbo, 45, is making his first flight since being selected among the second batch of astronauts in 2010. Tang is a second-generation astronaut with 11 years of experience, CGTN said.Tang said he had been training virtually nonstop for years. “There is pressure. But where there is pressure there is motivation and ... I have confidence in myself and have confidence in our team,” he said.Also read | China’s space ambitions: Robot on Mars, a human on the moonTang told state broadcaster CCTV that he had taken videos of everyday life with his son and wife to watch on the space station.The three men have undergone more than 6000 hours of training, including hundreds of underwater somersaults in full space gear, to get accustomed to their suits for spacewalks. They have prepared by working in a pool in spacesuits to simulate making repairs to the station during a spacewalk, officials have said.‘Space treadmills’The astronauts can choose 120 different types of food and "space treadmills" for exercise as they spend three months on the Tiangong station. They will be able to work off their range of dinner options, which officials have said were all nutritious and tasty, on the special treadmills or exercise bikes.https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-3-male-astronauts-for-3-month-stay-in-its-new-space-station-101622443019941.htmlTianhe, a cylinder 55 feet long and 14ft in diameter, has separate living areas for each of them as well as a shared bathroom, dining area and a communication centre to send emails and allow video calls with ground control.The planShenzhou-12 will dock with the main section of the Tiangong space station, Tianhe. Nie, Liu and Tang will be busy testing and maintaining the systems onboard, conducting spacewalks and undertaking scientific experiments.Officials have said another eight missions are planned over the next year and a half to complete the construction of Tiangong in orbit, including the attachment of solar panels and two laboratory modules. The main living section of the Tiangong space station was launched in April while the other two modules will be primarily for scientific work. China has earlier operated two experimental space stations. It also landed a probe on Mars last month that carried the Zhurong rover and earlier landed a probe and rover on the moon and brought back the first lunar samples by any country’s space program since the 1970s. The station, once completed, will allow for stays of up to six months, similar to the much larger International Space Station (ISS), which is nearing the end of its functional lifespan. Tiangong is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-manned-space-mission-veteran-astronaut-treadmills-and-more-101623897207929.html
17-06-2021||World||UK Parliament approves extending Covid-19 restrictions until July 19||The House of Commons of the UK Parliament approved on Wednesday the government's proposal to postpone the deadline for lifting quarantine restrictions in England until July 19 due to the surge of Covid-19.In favor of extending social restrictions in England voted 461 members of parliament, against -- 60.The move was proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on June 14 over concerns about the third wave of the pandemic and the spread of the Indian strain of Covid-19. The authorities planned to completely lift restrictions in England on June 21.Scotland earlier also refused to lift restrictions, planned for June 7, and tentatively pushed the date to June 28.According to Johnson, the authorities need more time to vaccinate as many people as possible, especially given the dangers of the Indian strain. The government has already accelerated the vaccination program: by July 19, London plans to vaccinate two-thirds of the population aged over 30, while those in the 18-24 age bracket began receiving their first shots.Currently, the restrictions include the ban on indoor mass events, the closing of nightclubs, social distancing and mask-wearing. The government has recommended to continue working remotely, if possible. Shops, pubs and restaurants are open and can serve visitors indoors.The number of new cases continues to grow in the UK, exceeding 9,000 daily infections as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-approves-extending-covid-19-restrictions-until-july-19-101623896584536.html

Clearly, that is bad news," Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, Imperial College London, told reporters.The study is one of the largest prevalence surveys in Britain, with 109,000 volunteers tested in its latest round.Riley added that Britain's high vaccination levels made it hard to predict how long that exponential growth would last, saying the rapid rollout of vaccine doses to younger age groups should slow it down. (Graphic on global vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/3tUM8taOver half the adult population of Britain have received two vaccine doses, and more than three-quarters of adults have received at least one vaccine dose.Although the Delta variant is shown to substantially reduce the effectiveness of one dose of vaccine against mild infection, two doses still provide good protection against severe disease, early evidence has shown."These findings highlight the stark context in which we took the difficult decision to delay Step 4 of the roadmap out of lockdown," health minister Matt Hancock said, referring to the lifting of the last remaining restrictions in England."We all must hold our nerve that little bit longer as our vaccine rollout continues."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-fuelled-50-rise-in-britain-covid-19-prevalence-study-101623896604621.html
17-06-2021||World||2021 Desertification and Drought Day: UN puts focus on recovery of degraded land||The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed each year on June 17, as mandated by the United Nations, to combat the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas due to climate change and detrimental activities carried out by human beings which leave an adverse impact on the environment. While issues like global warming are being predominantly discussed around the world, it is also important to take note of the increasing degradation of the land cover due to deforestation and subsequent desertification.2021 Desertification and Drought Day: Purpose2021 Desertification and Drought Day is being observed on June 17 this year to focus on turning degraded land into healthy land. The United Nations, on its website marking the occasion, stated that restoring degraded land brings economic resilience, creates jobs, raises incomes, and increases food security. It also helps biodiversity to recover.The aim is to prevent the elimination of sustainable living conditions on Earth for all animals, including human beings. Conditions like desertification and drought not only make human life on this planet difficult but also push the environment toward a situation from which it might be impossible to return.What is desertification?2021 World Desertification and Drought Day is also being observed to increase public awareness of the detrimental effects of desertification. According to the United Nations, desertification does not just mean an expansion of existing deserts. It also refers to the overall declining productivity of land due to overexploitation and inappropriate land use by human activity. Poverty, political instability, deforestation, overgrazing, and bad irrigation practices can all lead to desertification and drought, the UN says.2021 World Desertification and Drought Day: This year's themeThis year's theme for the United Nations' world day for fighting desertification and drought is "Restoration. Land. Recovery." Experts believe that we have to stop the process of desertification on an immediate basis, as well as maintain soil fertility and prevent soil from flowing into the water to stick to the current commitment by over 100 countries to restore almost 100 hectares of land over the next decade. The best way is to plant trees, which can eventually lead to land resettlement. At the same time, we have to change the sustainable and alternative methods of land use so that drought conditions are not triggered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2021-desertification-and-drought-day-un-puts-focus-on-recovery-of-degraded-land-101623893119310.html

The high-stakes mission, named Shenzhou 12, was launched on the back of the Long March 2F rocket, which blasted off as scheduled at 9:22am Beijing time (which translates to 6:52am in Indian Standard Time) at Jiuquan in the northwestern Gansu province. The mission is being led by 56-year-old Nie Haisheng, accompanied by fellow spacefarers Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo who are aboard the spacecraft Shenzhou-12, according to the latest updates.Also Read: China to launch spaceship with 3 astronauts on June 17The Chinese astronauts are set to reach Tianhe ("Harmony of the Heavens"), the core module of the new Tiangon space station, on the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft, which was launched atop a Long March 2F rocket. Chinese state television is broadcasting the live coverage of the launch of the Shenzhou 12 mission to the new space station.Among the astronauts in China's space mission, Nie Haisheng has flown to space twice before -- on the Shenzou-6 mission in 2005 and then again on the Shenzhou-10 mission in 2013. The former air force pilot is now the oldest Chinese astronaut to go to space, reported news agency Reuters. Liu Boming flew on the Shenzhou-7 space mission in 2008, while this is the first spaceflight for the other astronaut, Tang Hongbo. The three astronauts are scheduled for a three-month stay aboard the core module of the new space station, which was launched to low Earth orbit on April 28.The three-month stay for Nie, Liu, and Tang will be the longest for any Chinese astronauts, and one focus will be seeing how the men handle their relatively long time in orbit. "The (mission) is longer this time, and not only do we have to set up the core module – this ‘home’ in space – we’ve to carry out a series of pivotal technical tests," Nie told reporters in Jiuquan. Although the Tianhe module has already received a robotic visitor last month -- the Tianzhou-2 cargo craft -- this will be the first time that humans set foot aboard it.Shenzhou-12, meaning “Divine Vessel”, is the third of 11 missions needed to build China’s space station. The most recent of China's space missions was Shenzhou-11, in October 2016, which carried three astronauts for a one-month stay at a prototype precursor for the new Chinese space station.Chinese astronauts have had a comparatively low international profile. US legislation bars NASA from any cooperation with China, and Chinese astronauts have not been to the more than two-decade-old International Space Station (ISS), which has been visited by more than 240 men and women of various nationalities. The ISS may be decommissioned in 2024 if the project does not receive new funding, and China could end up being the operator of the only space station in Earth’s orbit.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-first-crew-to-new-space-station-today-astronauts-prepare-for-liftoff-101623889631810.html

CureVac declined to say how many who got the shot got sick or how many received a placebo. But the results suggest the vaccine works less well for older people than in a younger population, Chief Technology Officer Mariola Fotin-Mleczek said in an interview Wednesday.Though preliminary, the results throw the future of the vaccine into question as wealthy nations around the world move swiftly to inoculate their populations with shots already available. Still, CureVac will finish its trial and plans to gain approval, Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas said.“There is a huge need for vaccine, and I think we can still make a contribution,” Haas said.The shot could be a boost in the developing world, since it doesn’t require the deep freezing needed for other Covid shots. Partly owned by the German government, CureVac has forged partnerships with Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and the U.K. government aimed at speeding production of its shot and future versions that will target mutated strains.The data comes as the world is at something of a crossroads in the Covid fight, with global infections falling even as outbreaks in places with less access to vaccines serve as a reminder that the pandemic is far from over. The wealthiest countries have taken an outsize share of the more than 2.4 billion shots administered so far.The proliferation of variants in the CureVac trial is testimony to how the pandemic has changed since the first large vaccine clinical trials were run last year.Genetic SequencingCureVac’s researchers genetically sequenced 124 of the 134 cases they included in their analysis. Just one of the sequenced cases was due to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in Wuhan, China. The rest came from a range of variants, including 21% of cases attributable to a new variant called lambda that was first identified in Peru.The World Health Organization added lambda to its watchlist as a variant of interest on Monday.Some 57% of the Covid cases in the study were due to so-called variants of concern, the four variants that the World Health Organization has deemed the most worrying. Most of these -- about 41% of all the cases -- were due to the alpha variant first observed in the U.K., CureVac said.That variant is now the most common in the U.S., and other vaccines, including shots from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE as well as Novavax Inc., have shown themselves effective against it. CureVac didn’t release detailed data about how its shot performed against each of the variants.Final ReadoutMore details will emerge in the final readout of the study, which will include more than 200 Covid cases and could come within two or three weeks, CureVac said.Like the shots from Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer-BioNtech alliance, CureVac’s vaccine relies on mRNA, enlisting the body’s own cells as vaccine factories. Unproven until last year, the technology has now catapulted to the forefront of the global fight against Covid.CureVac’s shot, though, is subtly different than its competitors, because it uses an unmodified form of mRNA.CureVac has said it plans to supply 300 million vaccine doses this year, enough to immunize 150 million people. Together with partners, it has said it will supply more than 1 billion doses in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curevac-covid-shot-falls-short-with-47-efficacy-in-early-result-101623888739529.html
17-06-2021||World||Biden tells Putin certain cyberattacks should be 'off-limits'||US President Joe Biden told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that certain critical infrastructure should be "off-limits" to cyberattacks, but analysts said his efforts were unlikely to be more successful than previous attempts to carve out safe zones online.Biden wasn't explicit about which areas he wanted out of bounds, but spoke of 16 kinds of infrastructure - an apparent reference to the 16 sectors designated as critical by the U.S. Homeland Security Department, including telecommunications, healthcare, food and energy."We agreed to task experts in both our countries to work on specific understandings about what is off-limits," Biden said following a lakeside summit with Putin in Geneva. "We'll find out whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order."A senior administration official said that the proposal was focused on "destructive" hacks, as opposed to the conventional digital espionage operations carried out by intelligence agencies worldwide.Putin's response to the idea wasn't immediately clear. In a separate press conference, he said the two leaders had agreed to "begin consultations" on cybersecurity issues but didn't directly refer to Biden's proposal.The threat of destructive hacks aimed at critical infrastructure, a staple of disaster movies where renegade hackers trigger blackouts and mayhem, have long worried experts.The United States had its first serious taste of what that might mean last month, when ransom-seeking cybercriminals briefly triggered the closure of a major U.S. pipeline network, interrupting gasoline deliveries and sparking panic-buying up and down the East Coast.Earlier cyberattacks aimed at the Ukrainian power grid and a Saudi petrochemical plant have also drawn concern.In all those cases, the hackers involved are accused by the United States of either working directly for the Russian government or from Russian territory.Russian officials have repeatedly denied carrying out or tolerating cyberattacks, and Putin on Wednesday made no concessions on the issue."We need to throw out all kinds of insinuations, sit down at the expert level and start working in the interests of the United States and Russia," Putin told reporters.He then made an insinuation of his own, saying that Russian officials had tracked malicious digital activity coming from the United States."We certainly see where the attacks are coming from. We see that this work is coordinated from U.S. cyberspace," Putin said.Experts were skeptical that Biden's proposal would be taken seriously by Putin."There's no indication at all that he actually went along with it," said Keir Giles, a Russia expert with the London-based Chatham House think tank.Giles said that grappling with the cyber threat emerging from Russia would require "an outbreak of honesty" on the Kremlin's side."There's no indication – at least from Putin's public comments so far – that that outbreak has begun," Giles said.The fate of a similar agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is not encouraging, said Stefan Soesanto, a researcher at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.The 2015 agreement theoretically banned the theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, but many cyber experts that track Chinese hacking say Beijing eventually reneged on the deal."Will Biden fare better than Obama/Xi? I don't think it will," Soesanto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tells-putin-certain-cyberattacks-should-be-offlimits-101623886241246.html

He notably kept wearing his aviators while meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on Sunday.The custom aviators are a brand manufactured in Massachusetts and designed for fighter pilots, the White House said, announcing the gifts after Biden and Putin concluded their summit in Geneva on Wednesday.The US leader also gave Putin a crystal sculpture of an American bison made by a New York-based glass company.The Kremlin has not said whether and how Putin may have reciprocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-gifts-vladimir-putin-custom-aviator-sunglasses-101623873020291.html
17-06-2021||World||Israeli airstrikes hit militant sites in Gaza, first since ceasefire||Israeli airstrikes hit militant sites in the Gaza Strip early Wednesday, and Palestinians responded by sending a series of fire-carrying balloons back across the border for a second straight day — further testing the fragile ceasefire that ended last month’s war between Israel and Hamas.The latest round of violence was prompted by a parade of Israeli ultranationalists through contested east Jerusalem on Tuesday. Palestinians saw the march as a provocation and sent balloons into southern Israel, causing several blazes in parched farmland. Israel then carried out the airstrikes — the first such raids since the May 21 ceasefire ended 11 days of fighting — and more balloons followed.The airstrikes targeted facilities used by Hamas militants for meetings to plan attacks, the army said. There were no reports of injuries.“The Hamas terror organization is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip, and will bear the consequences for its actions,” the army said. It added that it was prepared for any scenario, “including a resumption of hostilities.”By Wednesday afternoon, masked Palestinians sent a number of balloons, laden with fuses and flaming rags, into Israel. Several fires were reported.The unrest provided the first test of the ceasefire at a time when Egyptian mediators have been working to reach a longer-term agreement. It comes as tensions have risen again in Jerusalem, as they did before the recent war, leading Gaza's Hamas rulers to fire a barrage of rockets at the holy city on May 10. The fighting claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives and killed 13 people in Israel.An Egyptian security official said his government has been in “direct and around-the-clock” contacts with Israeli officials and the Gaza rulers to keep the ceasefire and to urge them to refrain from provocative acts.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy, said the US administration has also been in touch with Israel as part of the efforts.The two sides seem to agree "not to escalate to the tipping point,” he said. “And we do every effort to prevent this.”The flare-up also has created a test for Israel’s new government, which took office early this week. The diverse coalition includes several hard-line parties as well as dovish and centrist parties, along with the first Arab faction ever to be part of an Israeli government.Keeping the delicate coalition intact will be a difficult task for the new prime minister, Naftali Bennett.In Tuesday’s parade, hundreds of Israeli ultranationalists, some chanting “Death to Arabs,” marched in east Jerusalem in a show of force. Hamas called on Palestinians to “resist” the parade, which was meant to celebrate Israel’s capture of east Jerusalem in 1967. Palestinians consider it a provocation.In a scathing condemnation on Twitter, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who heads the centrist Yesh Atid Party, said those shouting racist slogans were “a disgrace to the Israeli people.”Bennett, who will hand over the prime minister’s job to Lapid after two years, is a hard-line Israeli nationalist who has promised a pragmatic approach as he presides over a delicate, diverse coalition government.Though there were concerns the march would raise tensions, canceling it would have opened Bennett and other right-wing members of the coalition to intense criticism from those who would view it as a capitulation to Hamas.Mansour Abbas, whose Raam party is the first Arab faction to join an Israeli coalition, said the march was “an attempt to set the region on fire for political aims,” with the intention of undermining the new government.Abbas said the police and public security minister should have canceled the event.While the parade provided the immediate impetus for the balloons, Hamas is also angry because Israel has tightened its blockade of the territory since the ceasefire. The restrictions include a ban on imports of fuel for Gaza’s power plant and raw materials.Israel imposed the blockade after Hamas, a militant group that seeks Israel’s destruction, seized control of Gaza from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007. Israel and Hamas have fought four wars and numerous skirmishes since then. Israel says the blockade, enforced with Egypt, is needed to prevent Hamas from importing and developing weapons.One of the masked activists firing the balloons said they launched hundreds of them Tuesday and will continue sending them in response to what he described as Israeli provocations in east Jerusalem.After capturing east Jerusalem in 1967, Israel annexed the area in a move not recognized by most of the international community. It considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. The competing claims over east Jerusalem, home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites, lie at the heart of the conflict and have sparked many rounds of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-airstrikes-target-gaza-sites-first-since-ceasefire-101623872928329.html
