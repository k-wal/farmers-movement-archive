Providence was founded to serve patients, and this commitment by Biological E allows us to achieve that essential goal.”However, the availability of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in India will be contingent upon it receiving the necessary emergency-use authorisation from India authorities.Sorenson also said Providence was looking at “a minimum production capacity of 600 million doses in 2022 and a target capacity of one billion doses”.Biological E will be responsible for clinical development and regulatory activities for the mRNA vaccine in India.On May 12, Providence had announced “very favourable interim clinical data” for its Phase 1 study of the efficacy of the vaccine candidate. While the company had originally looked at ramping up vaccine manufacturing capability within Canada, Sorenson had later complained of the lack of sustained support from the Canadian government that was forcing it to seek opportunities abroad.“The mRNA platform has emerged as the front-runner in delivering the first vaccines for emergency use to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Biological E is very pleased to be able to work with Providence on its promising mRNA vaccine candidate. We hope to provide India and other countries yet another option to ramp up their efforts towards achieving herd immunity against Covid-19,” said Mahima Datla, managing director of Biological E.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firm-ties-up-with-indian-company-for-covid-vaccine-production-101622570279931.html
01-06-2021||World||Germany, Greece, 5 other countries kick off Covid-19 vaccination travel certificates||Greece, Germany and five other European Union nations introduced a vaccination certificate system for travelers on Tuesday, weeks ahead of the July 1 rollout of the program across the 27-nation bloc.The other countries starting early were Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia and Poland, according to the European Commission.Greece, which depends heavily on tourism, has been pressing for the commonly-recognized certificate that uses a QR code with advanced security features. The certificates are being issued to people who are fully vaccinated as well as those have already contracted the virus and developed antibodies and others who have had a PCR test within the last 72 hours.The documents will have both digital and paper forms. They’ll be free of charge, distributed in the national language plus English and be valid in all the bloc’s countries.“EU citizens are looking forward to travelling again, and they want to do so safely. Having an EU certificate is a crucial step on the way,” EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said.Greece’s digital governance minister, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, said easier travel will open up within the EU as nations adopt the new verification standard.“What will happen is that countries will stop issuing certificates using their own convention and adopt the common convention. That will simplify things considerably, because you can imagine the number of bilateral agreements that would otherwise need to be worked out,” Pierrakakis told private Skai television.Kyriakides said in the next few weeks, all EU nations need to "fully finalize their national systems to issue, store and verify certificates, so the system is functioning in time for the holiday season.”Countries will be allowed to add extra vaccines to their individual entry list, including those that have not been formally approved for use across the EU.The EU Commission believes that people who are vaccinated should no longer have to be tested or put into quarantines, regardless of where they are travelling to or from, starting 14 days after receiving their second shot.Member countries, however, have not yet endorsed that recommendation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-greece-5-other-countries-kick-off-covid-19-vaccination-travel-certificates-101622569734745.html
01-06-2021||World||'Big risk': California farmers hit by drought change planting plans||Joe Del Bosque is leaving a third of his 2,000-acre farm near Firebaugh, California, unseeded this year due to extreme drought. Yet, he hopes to access enough water to produce a marketable melon crop.Farmers across California say they expect to receive little water from state and federal agencies that regulate the state's reservoirs and canals, leading many to leave fields barren, plant more drought-tolerant crops or seek new income sources all-together."We're taking a big risk in planting crops and hoping the water gets here in time," said Del Bosque, 72.Agriculture is an important part of California's economy and the state is a top producer of vegetables, berries, nuts and dairy products. The last major drought from 2012 to 2017 reduced irrigation supplies to farmers, forced strict household conservation measures and stoked deadly wildfires.California farmers are allocated water from the state based on seniority and need, but farmers say water needs of cities and environmental restrictions reduce agricultural access.Nearly 40% of California's 24.6 million acres of farmland are irrigated, with crops like almonds and grapes in some regions needing more water to thrive."I'm going to be reducing some of our almond acreage. I may be increasing some of our row crops, like tomatoes," said Stuart Woolf, who operates 30,000 acres, most of it in Western Fresno County. He may fallow 30% of his land.Del Bosque, who grows melons, asparagus, sweet corn, almonds and cherries, said his operation could lose more than half a million dollars in income, and put many of his 700 workers out of work. He and other farmers say drought has been exacerbated by California's lack of investment in water storage infrastructure over the last 40 years."Fundamentally, a storage project is paid for by the people who want the water," said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for California's Department of Water Resources. "All we can do is deliver what mother nature provides."New dams face environmental restrictions meant to protect endangered fish and other wildlife, and don't solve near-term water needs, said Ernest Conant, regional director of the Bureau of Reclamation, California-Great Basin region, the federal agency that overseas dams, canals and water allocations in the Western United States."We simply don't have enough water to supply our agricultural users," said Conant. "We're hopeful some water can be moved sooner than October, but there's no guarantees."Water scarcity threatens Del Bosque's watermelon crop, which is due to be harvested in August. But it also has dire consequences for those planting it."If there is no water, there is no work. And for us farm workers, how are we going to support the family?" said 57-year-old Pablo Barrera, who was planting watermelons for Del Bosque.Woolf said as the state continues to restrict water access, he's exploring ways to generate income off the land he can no longer irrigate, including installing solar arrays and planting Agave, normally grown in Mexico to make tequila."You've got to absorb all of your farming costs on the few acres that you're farming," he said. "How do we maximize the value of the land that we are not farming?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-risk-california-farmers-hit-by-drought-change-planting-plans-101622569219150.html
01-06-2021||World||Miami-area shootings mark bloody Memorial Day weekend||Gunfire that wounded two people in Miami Beach wrapped up a violent Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area, which included a mass shooting that killed two and injured 21 others, law enforcement authorities said.Miami Beach police received multiple 911 calls reporting a shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg, spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said in a social media post. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital.During the investigation, the heavily traveled MacArthur Causeway was shut down in both directions. It had reopened by early Tuesday.Rodriguez said “several possible suspects" had been detained.Meanwhile, a manhunt continued Tuesday for three masked suspects who opened fire early Sunday outside a Miami banquet hall. On Monday, police released a surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah.The video showed three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two carried what police described as “assault-style rifles.” They began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, though police said the assailants had specific targets in mind.In addition to the two fatalities, three others were hospitalized in critical condition. Police did not release the victims' names, citing privacy laws.The SUV used in the shooting was found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of the banquet hall. Police said it had been reported stolen two weeks ago.Miami-Dade Police said Sunday’s shooting was unrelated to a drive-by shooting Friday night that killed a person and injured six others outside another venue in the Wynwood area. Some witnesses likened the scene to a “war zone” after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying for cover.“This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we’re here mourning,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Monday press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miamiarea-shootings-mark-bloody-memorial-day-weekend-101622568299473.html

The BRICS is a bloc of major emerging economies comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Wang said, “At this trying time, China stands in solidarity with India and all BRICS countries. As long as it is needed by India, I believe all BRICS partners including China will provide further support and assistance at any time. We are fully confident that India will certainly overcome the pandemic.”Monday’s meeting was chaired by India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The foreign ministers’ meeting was attended by Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco Franca, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor.The Chinese minister lauded India for conducting its role as the BRICS chair despite the raging pandemic.“Since the beginning of the year and despite the impact of the Covid-19, India as BRICS chair has worked vigorously focusing on the theme of BRICS@15: Intra BRICS Cooperation for Continuity, Consolidation and Consensus,” he said.“China commends India for its efforts and we are ready to work with BRICS countries to support India as the chair and ensure tangible outcomes in this year’s BRICS cooperation,” he added.Wang said the five-member bloc faces profound and complex ramifications of the pandemic.“This is a challenge to the BRICS countries, but opportunities could also emerge from a crisis. We believe that with all of us joining forces, BRICS will surely display its unique value and play a due role,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-brics-stand-with-india-in-its-fight-against-the-pandemic-chinese-fm-101622568719892.html
01-06-2021||World||‘Stop resisting’: Video shows Alabama police officers stomping, assaulting man at local store||The American police force is again at the centre of a controversy due to a Facebook video, in which some of its officers are seen kicking, punching and trying to overpower a man in a store in Alabama. The video, recorded on Monday, shows a police officer trying to overturn the man and handcuff him as he scremas for help. A few seconds later, another police officer is seen approaching the scene and kicking and stomping on the man’s leg while shouting “stop resisting” repeatedly.A few other officers joined the two officers and the man was eventually subdued, the 90-second video showed. It was broadcast as Facebook Live by Bruce Turner, who lives in Huntsville, Alabama, and has been viewed more than 13,000 times. The man who was lying on the floor of the store has been idenfied as 22-year-old Kemontae Kentarieus Hobbs by news agency AP and other local media outlets.“We are aware of the video and investigating at this time,” Captain Michael Johnson of the Huntsville Police Department said in reply to queries regarding the incident, local media company al.com reported on Monday.After the incident, Hobbs was booked into the Madison County Jail on charges of resisting arrest and obstructing government operations, AP reported earlier in the day. The report also said that he was released later on Monday afternoon (local time).Kimberlyn Heyes, mother of Hobbs, condemned the use of such force by the officers in the video. “It didn’t take all those officers when he was already down. How was he resisting when he was already on the ground and you are stomping on him like a dog? That’s not how you handle things,” AP quoted Heyes as saying.Meanwhile, a group named Huntsville Bail Fund also confirmed the release of Hobbs in a Facebook post, in which it had earlier sought donations to secure his release. “Kemontae Hobbs was brutalized by Huntsville Police last night. Police were called because Kemontae was panhandling outside a gas station, leading to the viral video of an officer attempting to break his leg. Kemontae has had several run-ins with the cops. They are aware that he has schizophrenia, and is sometimes known to wander when he isn't able to access treatment. After his arrest and brutalization, Huntsville Police called to tell his mother that they had her son, and knew he was mentally ill. They treated him like this anyway,” the group’s Facebook post said.The incident comes a month after William Darby, a 28-year-old officer of the Huntsville Police Department, was convicted of murder in a 2018 shooting incident, according to a report by the Washington Post. Darby was found guilty of shooting a man who had sought help from 911 for his suicidal thoughts and had a gun to his own head, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-resisting-video-shows-alabama-police-officers-stomping-assaulting-man-at-local-store-101622567986972.html

01-06-2021||World||Canada decides to mix and match different Covid vaccines for easier roll-out||Canadian health authorities have announced that Covid-19 vaccines will be mixed and matched in order to ensure a quicker roll-out of the national vaccination programme.The announcement from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was based on an updated guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), which recommended that a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, including the Covishield version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, could be followed by a second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. It also recommended that the doses for the two mRNA vaccines can be switched if necessary.In a statement that accompanied an official release, NACI chair Caroline Quach-Thanh said, “We know that the question of which vaccine will be used for second doses, in particular for individuals who had received the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine as their first dose, has been a question for many people in these last few months.“NACI has seen additional data on the safety of using mixed Covid-19 vaccine schedules and NACI has also seen some data on the immune response following this mixed schedule. “Based on that evidence, but also on the risk of the rare but serious adverse event called VITT that is associated with the viral vector vaccines, we are recommending that someone who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine may receive an mRNA vaccine for their second dose.”Quach-Thanh added, “The committee strongly recommends that if one mRNA vaccine was used for the first dose, the other mRNA vaccine can be used as the second dose if needed. Second doses are important for more robust and long-term protection. These NACI recommendations on mixed schedules will provide flexibility for provinces and territories in the move towards second doses.”Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said, “This rapid response on the interchangeability of authorised Covid-19 vaccines will guide decision-making by provinces and territories as we continue to roll-out Canada’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign.” The NACI release stated that current evidence suggested that mixing the viral vector first dose with an mRNA second had a “good safety profile at shorter (four-week) and longer (8 to 12-week) intervals” and that there is “evidence that providing an mRNA vaccine after AstraZeneca vaccine will boost the immune response, which is what we expect from a second dose”.NACI’s earlier position had been that the second dose administered had to be from the same inoculation applied for the first. However, in light of emerging evidence of interchangeability, primarily from research in Spain and the UK, Canadian health authorities updated their stand on Tuesday.NACI underscored that this was not an unusual step, as it noted that was “not a new concept” and similar vaccines from different manufacturers have been used to complete a vaccine series for influenza, Hepatitis A and others.In fact, on Monday, the province of Manitoba had already announced that those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine as their first dose could get another for their second. Canada has so far given emergency authorisation to four vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra Zeneca/Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson, with the last one requiring a single dose.Among the issues that health authorities could resolve with the new recommendation is that of lack of availability of the AstraZeneca vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-decides-to-mix-and-match-different-covid-vaccines-for-easier-rollout-101622567039914.html

The company, the world's largest meatpacker, said it was working to resolve the incident, which has stopped livestock slaughter in JBS plants in several U.S. states."On Sunday, May 30, JBS USA determined that it was the target of an organised cybersecurity attack, affecting some of the servers supporting its North American and Australian IT systems," it said in a Monday statement.The company has not responded for additional request for comment on the nature of the attack or why meat production is being impacted. JBS controls about 20% of the slaughtering capacity for U.S. cattle and hogs, according to industry estimates.JBS reported the incident a few weeks after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, crippled fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast.The attack also comes at a time of rising meat prices as China increases imports, food costs rise and plants continue to face labor shortages that started during the Covid-19 pandemic.The cyberattack could push U.S. beef prices even higher by tightening supplies, said Brad Lyle, chief financial officer for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture.The average unit price for U.S. fresh beef in April rose by 5% from March and was up about 10% from a year earlier, according to NielsenIQ data. Pork and chicken prices are each up about 5.4% from last year.U.S. inventories of frozen beef at the end of April were 5% lower than a year earlier, while frozen pork supplies were down 26%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Also Read | World's largest beef and pork supplier JBS hit by cyberattackAny impact on consumers would depend on how long production is impacted, said Matthew Wiegand, a risk management consultant and commodity broker at FuturesOne in Nebraska."If it lingers for multiple days, you see some food service shortages," Wiegand said. "The good thing is that this happened after Memorial Day. You are on the downhill side of summer demand and summer bookings."Two kill and fabrication shifts had been canceled at JBS's beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, due to the cyber attack, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 said in an e-mail. JBS Beef in Cactus, Texas, also said on Facebook it would not run on Tuesday -- updating an early post that had said the plant would run as normal.The United States Cattlemen's Association, an industry group, said on Twitter that it had reports of JBS redirecting livestock haulers who arrived at plants and were to unload animals for slaughter.Last year, cattle and hogs backed up on U.S. farms and some animals were euthanized when meat plants shut due to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers.JBS Canada said in a Facebook post that shifts had been canceled at its plant in Brooks, Alberta, on Monday and one shift so far had been canceled on Tuesday.JBS, which has its North American operations headquartered in Greeley, did not respond to additional questions about the cyberattack. A representative in Sao Paulo said the company's Brazilian operations were not impacted.A JBS beef plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, said only workers in maintenance and shipping were scheduled to work on Tuesday due to the cyberattack."We continue to work through the situation and will keep you informed regarding production on Wednesday," the Facebook post from Grand Island, Nebraska, said.The JBS cyberattack spurred a new round of support for improved cyber security.Congressman Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican, called for a bipartisan effort to secure food and cyber security."Cyber security is synonymous with national security, and so is food security," he wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/large-north-american-meat-plants-stop-slaughter-after-jbs-cyberattack-101622566088630.html

01-06-2021||World||China’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine gets WHO’s emergency-use approval||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it has approved a Covid-19 vaccine made by China’s Sinovac Biotech for emergency use, making it the second Chinese-produced shot to get the UN health agency’s endorsement.The WHO’s approval gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing, a statement from the WHO said.It is the second Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO after it gave the green light to Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally, in early May.The WHO’s emergency-use listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for the global Covax vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer Covid-19 vaccines. “On the basis of available evidence, the WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks,” the WHO statement said.Vaccine efficacy results showed that the jab prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100% of the studied population.Few older adults, over 60 years of age, were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age-group. The WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity information suggests that the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.“The decision further demonstrated that China not only has the willingness and the means to help in the global anti-pandemic fight, but the capability to do so,” Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told Global Times on Tuesday.The EUL procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality.Over 661.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered across China as of Monday, the national health commission said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-gets-who-s-emergency-use-approval-101622565719631.html

Donald Trump, his Republican predecessor, did not officially recognize Pride Month during his four years in office."For all of our progress, there are many States in which LGBTQ+ individuals still lack protections for fundamental rights and dignity in hospitals, schools, public accommodations, and other spaces," Biden said."We will not rest until full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans is finally achieved and codified into law."Biden cited what he called a tragic spike in violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color and LGBTQ youth who face bullying and harassment in academic settings and run the risk of self-harm and death by suicide.Biden recognized the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person confirmed by the Senate.Activists describe the Biden administration as the most pro-LGBTQ in U.S. history.On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to protect LGBTQ people under all federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex. Biden also reversed a ban on transgender people openly enlisting and serving in the military.The Biden White House also reversed an order issued by Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on flying the Pride flag and some U.S. embassies, including in India and Australia, are highlighting their support for LGBTQ people.In Florida on Tuesday, Governor Ron DeSantis, who is closely aligned with Trump, signed into law banning transgender women and girls from participating in school sports, part of a campaign in statehouses nationwide this year that equal rights activists assail as discriminatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-says-14-of-his-1-500-agency-appointees-identify-as-lgbtq-101622563982238.html
01-06-2021||World||When Fauci likened Trump supporters to 'crazy people in this world'. Here's what happened||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci’s friction with the previous administration under President Donald Trump is no secret. While Fauci, in the early days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, pushed for masking and warned against the sudden reopening of businesses, Trump showed reluctance in wearing a face mask and termed protesters demanding to end stay-at-home orders as “great people.”At one point, Fauci, who was on the White House coronavirus task force, even acknowledged that he was no longer in frequent contact with Trump after their contradictory stance on easing of restrictions. The latest trove of emails, obtained by The Washington Post as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, shed more light on Fauci’s response to thousands of requests and queries between March and April 2020.Even as Trump frequently attacked China for not containing coronavirus after detecting it first in Wuhan, Fauci and top Chinese health official, George Gao, sought to maintain ties with each other. In one of the emails, published by the Post, Gao gave clarification to Fauci after Science magazine quoted the Chinese scientist saying that the US and other Western nations were making a “big mistake” by encouraging people to mask up.“I saw the Science interview, how could I say such a word ‘big mistake’ about others? That was journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wrote to Fauci, according to the Post.“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.Also Read: Anthony Fauci reveals ‘disturbing’ incidents under Trump administrationIn an interview with the New York Times, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases talked about the death threats he had started receiving in mid-March last year. Fauci revealed that one day he received a letter in the mail with a powdered substance in it and he accidentally got it all over his face, calling the incident “very, very disturbing”. After he faced threats from Trump supporters, Gao emailed him again, according to the report.“I saw some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such a irrational situation,” Gao, a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, wrote on April 8, reported the Washington Post.“Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replied, as per the published correspondence. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.”The security detail for the infectious disease expert was expanded to full time after the threats from the “crazy people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-fauci-likened-trump-supporters-to-some-crazy-people-in-this-world-101622562606448.html

I was particularly inspired to hear how you have helped children with special needs enjoy the activity you enjoy and excel at," Johnson said in a personal letter to Sharma.The schoolboy's free online classes were already proving a success before the start of the coronavirus pandemic but expanded even further in recent months.His virtual sessions were seen as even more vital as he is passionate about promoting both the mental and physical health benefits of practising Yoga."I am honoured and humbled by this recognition. There have been unprecedented mental health issues amongst children due to the pandemic. I feel it is a recognition for Yoga as a discipline, which helps in balancing mental and physical health,” said Sharma.“This award has motivated me to continue my endeavour to spread the message of Yoga all over the world. I do hope that Yoga and meditation will be included in the national school curriculum in the future," he said.Ishwar Sharma is the 1,646th person to receive the UK Prime Minister’s daily Points of Light award, which was first launched in April 2014 to recognise outstanding individuals making a difference where they live.Each day, an inspiring person is selected to receive the award to celebrate their remarkable achievements, including hundreds of volunteers who have been recognised for how they have served their communities through the pandemic.The UK Prime Minister makes daily announcements of the winners to celebrate, encourage and promote volunteering and the value that it brings to the country.The public are encouraged to write to 10 Downing Street with their suggestions for deserving candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11yearold-indian-origin-yoga-prodigy-wins-uk-pm-award-101622561522249.html
01-06-2021||World||Tulsa race massacre: Why 'Black Wall Street' prospered||In a century-old family story about a teenage aunt who liked to drive her luxury car down the trolley tracks of Tulsa, Kristi Williams still savors a tiny, lingering taste of how different life could have been for all Black Americans after slavery.On Monday, Tulsans commemorated the 100th anniversary of a two-day assault by armed white men on Tulsa's prosperous Black community of Greenwood, known around the country as Black Wall Street, calling attention to an era of deadly mob assaults on Black communities that official history long suppressed.But Williams, and other descendants of the freed Black people enslaved by Native American nations who once owned much of the land under Tulsa, say there's another part of Black Wall Street's history that more Americans need to know about.It's one that has important lessons for contemporary racial issues in the United States, including the long debated matter of reparations, descendants and historians say.That bit of the story: where much of the seed money that made Black Wall Street boom came from.Unlike Black Americans across the country after slavery, Williams' ancestors and thousands of other Black members of slave-owning Native American nations freed after the war “had land,” says Williams, a Tulsa community activist. “They had opportunity to build a house on that land, farm that land, and they were wealthy with their crops.""And that was huge — a great opportunity and you’re thinking this is going to last for generations to come. I can leave my children this land, and they can leave their children this land,” recounts Williams, whose ancestor went from enslaved laborer to judge of the Muscogee Creek tribal Supreme Court after slavery.In fact, Alaina E. Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, writes in her book "I’ve Been Here All the While: Black Freedom on Native Land,” the freed slaves of five Native American nations “became the only people of African descent in the world to receive what might be viewed as reparations for their enslavement on a large scale.”Why that happened in the territory that became Oklahoma, and not the rest of the slaveholding South: The US government enforced stricter terms for reconstruction on the slave-owning American Indian nations that had fully or partially allied with the Confederacy than it had on Southern states.While US officials quickly broke Gen. William T. Sherman's famous Special Field Order No. 15 providing 40 acres for each formerly enslaved family after the Civil War, US treaties compelled five slave-owning tribes — the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Muscogee Creek and Seminoles — to share tribal land and other resources and rights with freed Black people who had been enslaved.By 1860, about 14% of the total population of that tribal territory of the future state of Oklahoma were Black people enslaved by tribal members. After the Civil War, the Black tribal Freedmen held millions of acres in common with other tribal members and later in large individual allotments.The difference that made is “incalculable,” Roberts said in an interview. “Allotments really gave them an upward mobility that other Black people did not have in most of the United States.”The financial stability allowed Black Native American Freedmen to start businesses, farms and ranches, and helped give rise to Black Wall Street and thriving Black communities in the future state of Oklahoma. The prosperity of those communities — many long since vanished —“attracted Black African Americans from the South, built them up as a Black mecca,” Roberts says. Black Wall Street alone had roughly 200 businesses.Meeting the Black tribal Freedmen in the thriving Black city of Boley in 1905, Booker T. Washington wrote admiringly of a community “which shall demonstrate the right of the negro, not merely as an individual, but as a race, to have a worthy and permanent place in the civilization that the American people are creating.”And while some tribes reputedly gave their Black members some of the worst, rockiest, unfarmable land, that was often just where drillers struck oil starting in the first years of the 20th century, before statehood changed Indian Territory to Oklahoma in 1907. For a time it made the area around Tulsa the world's biggest oil producer.For Eli Grayson, another descendant of Muscogee Creek Black Freedmen, any history that tries to tell the story of Black Wall Street without telling the story of the Black Indian Freedmen and their land is a flop.“They're missing the point of what caused the wealth, the foundation of the wealth,” Grayson says.The oil wealth, besides helping put the bustle and boom in Tulsa's Black-owned Greenwood business district, gave rise to fortunes for a few Freedpeople that made headlines around the United States. That included 11-year-old Sarah Rector, a Muscogee Creek girl hailed as “the richest colored girl in the world” by newspapers of the time. Her oil fortune drew attention from Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois, who intervened to check that Rector's white guardian wasn't pillaging her money.The wealth from the tribal allotment also gave rise to Williams' family story of great-aunt Janie, “who learned to drive by going behind the trolley lines” in Tulsa, with her parents in the car, Williams' uncle, 67-year-old Samuel Morgan, recounted, laughing."It was real fashionable, because it was one of the cars that had four windows that rolled all the way up,” Morgan said.Little of that Black wealth remains today.In May 1921, 100 years ago this month, Aunt Janie, then a teenager, had to flee Greenwood's Dreamland movie theater as the white mob burned Black Wall Street to the ground, killing scores or hundreds — no one knows — and leaving Greenwood an empty ruin populated by charred corpses.Black Freedmen and many other American Indian citizens rapidly lost land and money to unscrupulous or careless white guardians that were imposed upon them, to property taxes, white scams, accidents, racist policies and laws, business mistakes or bad luck. For Aunt Janie, all the family knows today is a vague tale of the oil wells on her land catching fire.Williams, Grayson and other Black Indian Freedmen descendants today drive past the spots in Tulsa that family history says used to belong to them: 51st Street. The grounds of Oral Roberts University. Mingo Park.That's yet another lesson Tulsa's Greenwood has for the rest of the United States, says William A. Darity Jr., a leading scholar and writer on reparations at Duke University.If freed Black people had gotten reparations after the Civil War, Darity said, assaults like the Tulsa Race Massacre show they would have needed years of U.S. troop deployments to protect them — given the angry resentment of white people at seeing money in Black hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tulsa-race-massacre-why-black-wall-street-prospered-101622560414150.html
01-06-2021||World||WHO approves China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for global use||China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. received long-awaited World Health Organization authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for a wider rollout of the controversial shot in countries scrambling for a supply of immunizations.The WHO recommended its use for people aged 18 and older in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks between shots, according to a statement Tuesday.The emergency use listing granted to Sinovac’s shot is the second given to a Chinese Covid vaccine, after state-owned Sinopharm Group Co. secured WHO’s nod for emergency use in early May. They will be additional inoculation options for Covax, a program backed by WHO and other global health groups dedicated to ensuring every country has access to vaccines -- notably poorer nations that have been shut out as wealthier ones snap up most of the world’s existing supply.Already cleared for emergency use by the WHO are vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc.Key SupportThe WHO’s green light bestows global legitimacy on a Chinese shot that has battled concerns about its efficacy after divergent data was reported from trial sites. It could provide assurance for developing countries that lack their own regulatory bodies and rely on the organization’s advice on which shots are safe to use. Sinovac has shipped 380 million doses to countries and region ranging from Hong Kong to Zimbabwe since late last year.China Sinovac Shot Seen Highly Effective in Real World Study The shot, dubbed CoronaVac, has the lowest efficacy rate reported from clinical trials among the frontrunner wave of vaccines: it was found to be just 50.7% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid in a trial in Brazil, barely crossing the minimum threshold required by drug regulators around the world. But real world evidence is emerging that it’s far more effective on the ground: In a recent study of around 130,000 Indonesia health workers, it protected 94% against symptomatic infection, 96% against hospitalization, and 98% against death.Infections are also on the rebound in some countries that have rolled out Sinovac locally like Chile, fueling doubt on its effectiveness, though hasty reopenings and the spread of virus variants also play a part in the renewed outbreaks.The World Finally Accepts a Much-Maligned Covid ShotThe WHO nod also paves the way for countries to allow travelers who have received Sinovac shots, even if the vaccine isn’t approved for use locally. Ahead of a planned reopening to vaccinated tourists this summer, the European Union said that member countries can consider opening up to people who have shots approved by the WHO. The company has also started submitting data on a rolling basis to drug regulator the European Medicines Agency.The Sinovac vaccine contains the inactive forms of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which are injected to stimulate an immune response against the pathogen. Two other similar shots have been developed by China’s Sinopharm, including the one already cleared by WHO. They have all been widely used in the mainland since mid-2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-china-s-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-for-global-use-101622560684737.html

Only the girl was wearing a life jacket.“I felt really scared,” Chase told the station.Their father jumped in the water to grab her. Chase then began swimming toward shore.“I told them I loved him because I wasn’t sure what’s going to happen,” their father told the station. “I tried to stick with both of them. I wore myself out. She drifted away from me.”Chase kept swimming, doggie paddling and floating on his back to keep from tiring out. “The current was going the opposite way of going to the boat and the shore so it was very hard to swim that way,” Chase said. It took him about an hour to reach land. He ran to the nearest house for help.Crews from the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found the father and daughter about a mile from their boat.“I screamed for help at the top of my lungs and waved my arms and sure enough someone heard us,” Poust said. “Little man also made it to shore and got help and that’s what saved our lives.”According to Eric Prosswimmer of the fire department, neither the 7-year-old nor the father were required to wear a life vest. The law applies to children age 6 and under for a vessel under 26 feet (8 meters) long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-boy-swims-an-hour-to-rescue-his-dad-and-little-sister-101622557311891.html

We accepted," Giovanni Apolone, scientific director of one of the lead institutions, the Milan Cancer Institute (INT), said.The WHO's request has not previously been reported."WHO is in contact with the researchers that had published the original paper. A collaboration with partner laboratories has been set up for further testing," a WHO spokesman said.The spokesman said the WHO was aware that the researchers are planning to publish a follow-up report "in the near future".He said the UN agency has contacted all researchers who have published or provided information on samples collected in 2019 that were reported to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but does not yet have the final interpretation of the results.The Italian researchers' findings, published by the INT's scientific magazine Tumori Journal, showed neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood taken from healthy volunteers in Italy in October 2019 during a lung cancer screening trial.Most of the volunteers were from Lombardy, the northern region around Milan, which was the first and hardest hit by the virus in Italy."None of the studies published so far have ever questioned the geographical origin," Apolone told Reuters."The growing doubt is that the virus, probably less powerful compared to later months, was circulating in China long before the reported cases," Apolone added.Also Read | Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsDUTCH TESTThe WHO chose the laboratory of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam for the re-test, Emanuele Montomoli, co-author of the original study and professor of Public Health at the Molecular Medicine Department in the University of Siena, said.The Erasmus University did not reply to requests for comment.Italian researchers sent the team in Rotterdam 30 biological samples from October-December 2019 that they had found positive, 30 samples from the same period they had tested negative and 30 samples from as far back as 2018, negative."We sent them blind, that means our colleagues did not know which samples were positive and which negative," Apolone said."They rechecked our samples with commercial tests, which are much less sensitive than the ones we devised and validated," Montomoli said.Despite the differences in the two detection methods, both Italian scientists said they were satisfied with the results, delivered to them in late February, adding that they could not comment further until the team of Italian and Dutch scientists have published their findings."We did not say in our study that we could establish without a doubt that the coronavirus, later sequenced in Wuhan, was already circulating in Italy in October," Montomoli said."We only found the response to the virus, namely the antibodies. So we can say that this coronavirus or a very similar one, perhaps a less transmissible variant, was circulating here in October," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-re-checks-research-on-when-coronavirus-first-surfaced-in-italy-101622555871452.html
01-06-2021||World||Scientists in UK urge caution over lockdown end amid Covid-19 3rd wave fears||Scientists in the UK have urged the government to exercise caution when making a decision about a scheduled June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown restrictions amid growing fears on Tuesday of a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Professor Ravi Gupta, an Indian-origin scientist from Cambridge University, said that while the infection rates in the country currently remain low, the B1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and now renamed as Delta, has led to an exponential rise in case numbers in recent days.He advised a few weeks’ delay to the June 21 date to allow the vaccination programme to catch up with the highly transmissible variant of COVID-19.“There’s been exponential growth in the number of new cases and at least three quarters of them are the new variant,” Gupta told the BBC.“We’re not too far from reaching the levels of vaccination that would help us contain the virus. I think that people are not saying we should abandon the June 21 date altogether, but just to delay it by a few weeks while we gather more intelligence and we can look at the trajectory in a clearer way,” he said.Prof. Gupta warned that the country may be in the early stages of the third wave."Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment; all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave," he added.On Monday, 3,383 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the UK, making a total of 23,418 over the past week – an increase of 28.8 per cent over the previous week. There was one new death from the deadly virus, with the weekly tally of 58 up 45 per cent on the previous week.Professor Adam Finn, the expert scientist on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) which determines the vaccination rollout cohorts in the country, warned the UK remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people."The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong – we've still got a lot of people out there who have neither had this virus infection nor yet been immunised and that's why we're in a vulnerable position right now," he said.Prof. Finn also echoed other scientists in the view that it was "so much better to delay slightly than to go around with another cycle" of lockdown restrictions."It's a different virus, it could be a real problem and it's only by taking it seriously now that we can get where we want to be as soon as possible," he said.The UK government's Former Chief Scientific Adviser and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), Professor Sir Mark Walport, noted that it was “not impossible” that Britain was at the tip of a third wave of the pandemic due to the Delta variant.“It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work,” he said.“It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75 per cent of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced,” he said.According to official data, the B.1.617.2 variant renamed as Delta by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK and is linked to the current surge in different parts of the country.A final decision on whether and to what degree restrictions will be lifted on June 21 will be reached on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-in-uk-urge-caution-over-lockdown-end-amid-covid-19-3rd-wave-fears-101622553590413.html

A government minister said it might be days before production resumes.JBS is also Australia's largest meat and food processing company, with 47 facilities across the country including abattoirs, feedlots and meat processing sites. JBS employs around 11,000 people.JBS USA said in a statement from Greeley, Colorado, on Monday that it was the target on Sunday of an “organized cybersecurity attack” affecting some of its servers supporting its North American and Australian IT systems.“The company's backup servers were not affected and it is actively working with an Incident Response firm to restore its systems as soon as possible,” the statement said.Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the government and Australian Federal Police were working with JBS to resolve the problems and to pursue those responsible.“Despite the fact that JBS accounts for around 20% of our processing production here in Australia, we're not expecting there to be significant impacts on exports so long as this isn't a protracted shutdown,” Littleproud said on Tuesday.“We're also working with JBS right here in Australia to make sure that we can get some limited capacity up and going in the next couple of days. JBS have been very proactive in that,” he said.Littleproud said it was too early to say whether it was a ransomware attack or who might be responsible.Australian staff learned of the attack when they were turned away from their workplaces on Monday.JBS exports about 70% of what it produces in Australia. But Australia and New Zealand account for only 4% of the company's global revenue.Several consignments of cattle in Queensland state were cancelled at short notice and cattle trucks were turned around, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.“We had to send them up on Sunday afternoon and then we got the message in the morning that they'd have to cancel the train because the meat works was going to be shutting for an indefinite amount of time,” Queensland cattle rancher Colin Baker told ABC.“We had a wasted day . . . because mustering the cattle, sorting them out and then trucking them up there and then we had to bring them home today and let them all go again,” Baker added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-largest-beef-and-pork-supplier-jbs-hit-by-cyberattack-101622552546470.html

There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.The NHC further said that no other cases of human infection with H10N3 have previously been reported globally.(With inputs from previous HT stories and Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avian-influenza-all-you-need-to-know-about-first-human-case-of-h10n3-bird-flu-in-china-101622550226266.html

It began commercial launches in 2018.Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, a New Zealander, said signing the accords was testament to the country’s growing role in the space industry and opened the door for collaboration and mission opportunities with NASA.There could also soon be a second New Zealand launch site. The government announced Tuesday it was partnering with Indigenous Maori to buy land in the Canterbury region to develop a space launch site.Estimates indicate the New Zealand space industry is worth 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.2 billion) and that space manufacturing generates about NZ$250 million a year.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement that New Zealand was one of seven nations that helped craft the principles in the accords and he was delighted they had signed up.“Outer space is getting crowded," said Kevin Covert, the acting U.S. ambassador to New Zealand. “As more countries establish a presence in outer space, via research stations, satellites, or even rocket launches, these accords provide a set of principles to create a safe and transparent environment that inspires exploration, science, and commercial activities.”The other signatories to the accords are the U.S., Australia, Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and Ukraine. Brazil also said it plans to sign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-latest-nation-to-sign-space-agreement-with-nasa-101622545491373.html

With the revised Covid-19 death toll, Peru has reached the sombre milestone of having the highest death rate per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Peru’s official death toll is now 180,764, up from 69,342, in a country of about 33 million people. The revised data makes more than 500 Covid deaths per 100,000 people.While Peru has been one of the hardest-hit Latin American countries, its official death toll was continuously under scanner because the scenes of cemeteries and unprecedented use of refrigerators as makeshift morgues contradicted the government data.Announcing the revised coronavirus-related death toll, Peruvian Prime Minister Violeta Bermúdez told a news conference on Monday that they “think it is [their] duty to make public this updated information.” He said that the Covid death toll was revised on the advice of Peruvian and international experts.“What is being said is that a significant number of deaths were not classified as caused by Covid-19,” Peru health minister Óscar Ugarte said, adding that the criteria for assigning Covid as a cause of death have been changed.Also Read | Peru: Artist portrays pain and suffering from Covid-19 pandemic in 100 drawingsPreviously, Hungary, with around 300 Covid deaths per 100,000 people, had the highest per capita death toll, followed by the Czech Republic and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

01-06-2021||World||'Martial law': Pakistan opposition, rights bodies condemn new media ordinance||An ordinance proposed by the Imran Khan government to regulate the media is at the centre of storm in Pakistan. Human rights bodies and media organisations have rejected the Pakistan Media Development Authority (PMDA) ordinance 2021, which proposes to repeal all media-related and merge them, and establishment of tribunals.The ordinance also proposes to nominate a bureaucrat to head the PMDA - a provision which is being widely being criticised as coercive censorship.The opposition parties as well as media organisations have called the ordinance "martial law". Those against the proposed law have vowed to resist such draconian steps by the government by taking trade unions, academia, political parties and citizens' organisations on board.Strong objections"Plans to centralise media oversight under one draconian authority, annual NOCs to remain operational, suspension/ penalties on way," said Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Sherry Rehman. After the new ordinance, media outlets will "either become state mouthpieces or go under", she added.Pakistan Muslim League (N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb on Twitter called the ordinance a "draconian, authoritarian, repressive and punitive" instrument to "suppress constitutional freedom of expression of print media, electronic media and online citizen journalism.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), an umbrella organisation of all journalist unions in the country, condemn the proposed law in a statement.The civil and rights bodies have raised serious objections to the draft of the ordinance, stating that the proposed law reflects a "mindset hostile to the concept of people's freedom of expression and right to information".What are the provisions?The ordinance proposes to repeal all current media-related laws in the country and wants them to be merged under the PMDA. Pakistan has several media-related laws like the Newspaper Employees, (Conditions of Service Act), 1973; the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (amended in 2007); and the Motion Pictures Ordinance, 1979.These laws govern different mediums and the way content is present there. But the Imran Khan government now wants a single authority for the entire media sector - a move which is being vehemently opposed by various bodies.The ordinance also proposes to establish media tribunals to hand down punishments of up to three years in jail and PKR 25 million in fines to content producers for violating the repressive new provisions.Local reports said that the government has also proposed that the proposed authority will be headed by a bureaucrat of level Grade-22 - the highest rank for a civil servant in the country.Past instancesPakistan's senior media editors raised alarm in April over a new directive by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) that advised satellite television channels not to report on government meetings under progress.The editors said that Pemra was turning into a 'censorship tool' instead of acting as a regulator.The EU Chronicle had reported in October 2020 that Journalists and the media are a priority target of Pakistan's military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), adding that such actions of intolerance towards independent journalism have increased dramatically since July 2018 when Imran Khan became prime minister.A large number of journalists and social media activists became targets of the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, accordign to Annual Pakistan media legal review 2020 report, launched by the Institute for Research, Advocacy and Development (IRADA) in April.Several journalists and rights activists faced inquiries, abductions, investigations and arrests related to their online/social media activities and posts, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/martial-law-pakistan-opposition-rights-bodies-condemn-new-media-ordinance-101622542267106.html
01-06-2021||World||US President Joe Biden to honour the forgotten victims of Tulsa race massacre||US president Joe Biden will take part in a remembrance of one of the nation’s darkest — and largely forgotten — moments of racial violence when he helps commemorate the 100th anniversary of the destruction of a thriving Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Biden’s visit Tuesday, in which he will grieve for the hundreds of Black people killed by a white mob a century ago, comes amid a national reckoning on racial justice. And it will stand in stark contrast to the most recent visit to Tulsa by a president, which took place last year.Biden will be the first president to participate in remembrances of the destruction of what was known as “Black Wall Street.” In 1921 — on May 31 and June 1 — Tulsa's white residents and civil society leaders looted and burned to the ground the Greenwood district and used planes to drop projectiles on it.Up to 300 Black Tulsans were killed, and thousands of survivors were forced for a time into internment camps overseen by the National Guard. Burned bricks and a fragment of a church basement are about all that survives today of the more than 30-block historically Black district.America's continuing struggle over racial justice will continue to test Biden, whose presidency would have been impossible without overwhelming support from Black voters, both in the Democratic primaries and the general election.Biden has pledged to help combat racism in policing and other areas of life following nationwide protests after George Floyd’s death a year ago that reignited a national conversation about race. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.After Chauvin was convicted in April, Biden said the country’s work was far from finished with the verdict, declaring, “We can’t stop here.”He called on Congress to act swiftly to address policing reform. But he has also long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.Despite its horror, the Tulsa massacre has only recently entered the national discourse — and the presidential visit will put an even brighter spotlight on the event.“This is so important because we have to recognize what we have done if we are going to be otherwise,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University. Biden's visit, Glaude said, "has to be more than symbolic. To tell the truth, is the precondition for reconciliation, and reconciliation is the basis for repair.”Biden, while visiting the Greenwood Cultural Center, is set to announce new measures to help narrow the wealth gap between Blacks and whites and reinvest in underserved communities by expanding access to homeownership and small-business ownership.The White House said the administration will take steps to address disparities that result in Black-owned homes being appraised at tens of thousands of dollars less than comparable homes owned by whites as well as issue new federal rules to fight housing discrimination.The administration is also setting a goal of increasing the share of federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2026, funneling an estimated additional $100 billion to such businesses over the five-year period, according to the White House.Biden will also discuss ways his jobs plan — still a subject of negotiation with Congress — can help create jobs and build wealth in communities of color.Historians say the massacre in Tulsa began after a local newspaper drummed up a furor over a Black man accused of stepping on a white girl’s foot. When Black Tulsans showed up with guns to prevent the man’s lynching, white residents responded with overwhelming force.A grand jury investigation at the time concluded, without evidence, that unidentified agitators had given Tulsa’s African Americans both their firearms and what was described as their mistaken belief “in equal rights, social equality, and their ability to demand the same.”Tensions persist 100 years laterOrganizers called off a headline commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, saying no agreement could be reached over monetary payments to three survivors of the deadly attack. It highlights broader debates over reparations for racial injustice.Reparations for Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved and for other racial discrimination have been debated in the U.S. since slavery ended in 1865. Now they are being discussed by colleges and universities with ties to slavery and by local governments looking to make cash payments to Black residents.But some of Tulsa’s Black residents question whether the $20 million spent to build the Greenwood Rising museum in an increasingly gentrified part of the city could have been better spent helping Black descendants of the massacre of residents of the city’s predominantly Black north side several miles away from Greenwood.Disagreements among Black leaders in Tulsa over the handling of commemorative events and millions of dollars in donations have led to two disparate groups planning separate slates of anniversary events.Biden, who was vice president to the nation’s first Black president and who chose a Black woman as his own vice president, backs a study of reparations, both in Tulsa and more broadly, but has not committed to support payments. He recently declared the need for America to confront its ugly past, saying, “We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear and trauma wrought upon African American people in this country.”He issued a proclamation designating Monday as a “day of remembrance” for the massacre.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump visited Tulsa last year under vastly different circumstances.After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday is known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that Trump postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown.Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting Floyd’s death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic — and inaccurate — scenes of American cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-honour-the-forgotten-victims-of-tulsa-race-massacre-101622540461417.html
01-06-2021||World||China's new three-child policy draws scepticism, cost questions||China's decision to allow families to have up to three children was met with scepticism on Tuesday, with doubts expressed on social media whether it would make much difference, and calls for details on what promised "supportive measures" will include.On Monday, Beijing announced that it was lifting the two-child limit in an effort to encourage more child-bearing, weeks after census data confirmed rapid aging and a decline in fertility that puts China on track to see its population, the world's largest, begin shrinking.The major policy shift will include supportive measures "conducive to improving our country's population structure," the official Xinhua news agency said."I don't quite understand. What's the meaning of supportive measures?", asked one Weibo user in a post that received more than 128,000 thumbs-up, the most popular comment on Xinhua's post on the three-child policy.Social media participants cited the high cost of raising children in urban China, where housing can be expensive and children undergo private tuition in addition to public schools amid a fiercely competitive education system, as deterrents to having kids.Also Read | China’s three-child policy is an admission of failureWomen in China already face a widening gender gap in terms of workforce participation and earnings, and have borne a growing share of childcare duties as state-supported childcare has declined, according to a report last year by the Peterson Institute for International Economics."Working women in the big cities will be further discriminated against, and it would be harder for women over 30s to find jobs," said another Weibo user.The Xinhua readout from Monday's Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping said that in conjunction with the new policy China would lower educational costs, step up tax and housing support and guarantee the legal interests of working women, but did not give specifics.James Liang, a professor at Peking University's School of Economics and founder of online travel giant Trip.com Group, last month urged China to give parents of each newborn 1 million yuan to lift a fertility rate of just 1.3 children per woman in 2020. That rate is in line with countries such as Japan and Italy and far short of the 2.1 replacement rate.He said this week that China would need to spend about 5% of GDP, compared with "practically 0% now", in cash, tax breaks, housing subsidies, day care and other incentives in order to get the fertility rate up to about 1.6, and expects the government soon to step up building day-care centres and kindergartens.Developed counties typically spend 1% to 4% of GDP on such support, he said."The one I'd really like to see is the housing subsidy, especially in large cities," he said. "If the local government can return (land tax) or give discounts to couples with a third child or second child," it would be helpful, he said.Also Read | Explained: China’s family planning laws over the yearsUptick and DeclineWhen China scrapped its one-child policy in 2016 there was a brief uptick in births followed by a decline that has steepened as costs continue to rise.Yi Fuxian, a University of Wisconsin scientist and longtime critic of Chinese birth policy, said the decades-long one-child policy entrenched attitudes.In Japan, he noted, costly policies such as free childcare and education, housing subsidies for young couples and free medical care for kids helped lift the fertility rate from 1.26 in 2005 to 1.45 in 2015, only for it to drop to 1.36 in 2019."Having just one child or no children has become the social norm in China. Social and economic patterns cater to the one-child policy, so the inertial effects linger on," he said.The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, acknowledged the difficulty of having three children in big cities but also said economics was not the only factor."It is equally important to change some habitual views of children and family values in a society with a declining birth rate, and to form new expectations and acceptability, as well as views on happiness," it said in an editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-new-three-child-policy-draws-scepticism-cost-questions-101622537155467.html
01-06-2021||World||North Korea sets up second-in-command post under Kim Jong Un: Report||North Korea's ruling party has amended its rules to create a de facto second-in-command under leader Kim Jong Un as he looks to revamp domestic politics, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday.Citing an unidentified source familiar with North Korea, the agency said the holder of the new post of "first secretary" would chair meetings on behalf of Kim Jong Un.Kim cemented his power at a congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in January, when he was elected its general secretary, taking a title last held by his late father, Kim Jong Il.Now Kim wants a greater role in government for the party, as compared to the more-military centred administration of his father, the news agency added."The term 'military-first politics', a major keyword in the Kim Jong Il era, is known to have been scrapped from the preface of the party by-laws," it said.In a statement, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said new party by-laws were publicized in North Korea after the January meeting. But the ministry responsible for relations with the neighbouring nation said it could not disclose details.Kim Jong Un himself used the "first secretary" designation from 2012 to 2016.The new post, the most senior of the party's seven secretaries, is likely to have been taken by Jo Yong Won, who is a member of the politburo’s five-strong presidium, Yonhap said.Also Read | 'Shameful double-dealing': North Korea slams end to US guidelines limiting S Korea missile rangeJo, considered one of Kim's closest aides, was seen by analysts at the time of the January meeting to hold the government's No. 3 position, after Kim and Choe Ryong Hae, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly."This seems to be the broader trend of North Korea delegating and redistributing some of Kim Jong Un's duties to others, not necessarily his powers, and streamlining the party leadership structure," said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a fellow with 38 North, a U.S.-based programme that monitors North Korea.The change is likely to affect Kim's public profile and how leadership guidance is provided to the public, she said, adding that Jo had already taken a role in leading party sessions.Kim Jong Un has wielded almost absolute power in North Korea's dynastic system since taking over after his father's death in 2011.Last year a South Korean lawmaker said the country's intelligence agency believed that Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, was serving as his "de facto second-in-command" but had not necessarily been designated his successor.\||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-sets-up-second-in-command-post-under-kim-jong-un-report-101622537163330.html
01-06-2021||World||South Korea summons Japan envoy over Tokyo Olympics map showing disputed islands||South Korea summoned Japan's deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest over a map on the Tokyo Olympics website that showed a set of South Korea-controlled islands as Japanese territory.The small islands, called Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been at the center of a decades-long territorial dispute between the two countries.A public uproar arose in South Korea after the islands were marked on a map of Japan on the Tokyo Olympics website showing the route of the torch relay. Tokyo has rejected Seoul's request to change the map, prompting some South Korean politicians to call for a boycott of the Games.South Korea's foreign ministry said it had summoned Hirohisa Soma, deputy ambassador at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to demand correction of the map."We were planning to strongly protest Japan's unjust territorial assertion over Dokdo and demand an immediate correction," ministry spokesman Choi Young-sam told a briefing ahead of the summons.Phone calls to the Japanese embassy for comment went unanswered.The islands, also known as the Liancourt Rocks, are 225 km (140 miles) off the east coast of South Korea. While South Korea controls the islands, Japan also claims sovereignty over them.Choi did not elaborate on the calls to boycott the Olympics, saying the government will closely watch the situation while contesting Japan's territorial claims.The two nations had a similar spat during the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, with Japan protesting the inclusion of the islands on a flag depicting a unified Korean peninsula used when athletes from South and North Korea marched together at the opening ceremony.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo remain icy amid disputes over the islands and the issue of compensation for victims who were forced to work in Japanese firms and military brothels during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-summons-japan-envoy-over-tokyo-olympics-map-showing-disputed-islands-101622536792258.html
01-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Heathrow Airport opens dedicated terminal for 'red list' countries including India||London's busy Heathrow Airport opened a dedicated new terminal on Tuesday for arrivals from countries designated as "red list", such as India, for a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission.Travellers on direct flights from such destinations will now go through Terminal 3 and then move directly to a government-approved quarantine facility booked at the passengers' own expense.Also Read | UK's Heathrow Airport refuses to allow extra flights from India amid Covid-19It comes after the London airport’s staff had raised fears for their safety because of overcrowding, amid concerns that travellers arriving from red list countries – from where travel is effectively banned except for British and Irish nationals or limited exceptions – were mixing with those from green and amber."Red list routes will likely be a feature of UK travel for the foreseeable future as countries vaccinate their populations at different rates,” a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said."We're adapting Heathrow to this longer-term reality by initially opening a dedicated arrivals facility in Terminal 3 from 1 June for red list passengers arriving on direct flights. While opening this facility will be logistically very challenging, our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list. Until then, the current red list system will remain in place,” the spokesperson said.Currently, there are 43 countries on the UK government's red list to cover regions linked with high-risk COVID-19 variants such as India, Brazil and South Africa.Under the UK government's coronavirus rules, anyone who has been in a red list country is required to pay for hotel quarantine for 10 nights after their arrival.According to officials, the latest system has been designed with several layers of COVID-19 security, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests for all international arrivals, mandatory use of face coverings, social distancing, segregation and enhanced cleaning regimes and ventilation in immigration halls."We will move this facility to Terminal 4 as soon as operationally possible," the Heathrow spokesperson said.A UK government spokesperson said the enhanced borders regime was to reduce the risk of new variants being transmitted."As we reopen international travel safely, we will maintain 100 per cent health checks at the border and the new dedicated terminal at Heathrow for arrivals from red list countries will enable passengers to be processed as safely and as efficiently as possible, before being transferred to a managed quarantine facility," the spokesperson said.The move comes as the UK coronavirus cases exceeded 3,000 on Monday for a sixth day in a row, with this figure not having been surpassed since April 12.The highly transmissible B1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and now named 'Delta' by the World Health Organisation, is believed to be largely behind this spike in infections with scientists advising caution before all COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are completely lifted as planned for June 21.The coronavirus has killed 128,045 people in the UK, along with 45,03,231 confirmed cases so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-heathrow-airport-opens-dedicated-terminal-for-red-list-countries-including-india-101622536707760.html
01-06-2021||World||Diaper, toys shares soar after China announces third-child policy||Shares in Chinese toy makers, diaper producers and infant food companies soared for the second day on Tuesday, as investors piled into stocks seen as benefitting from Beijing's new three-child policy.China's announcement on Monday to allow married couples to have up to three children - from the previous limit of two - also sent brokerage analysts scrambling to recommend stocks, despite a widely-shared perception that the policy shift won't have a sudden impact on the country's declining birth rate.Shares in toy maker Goldlok Holdings (Guangdong) Co jumped to their 10% daily limit for the second day, as did shares in Jinfa Labi Maternity & Baby Articles Co.Other baby-related stocks, including milk powder maker Beingmate Co, baby products maker Shanghai Aiyingshi Co and toddler care equipment maker Ningbo David Medical Device Co also soared.An index tracking the so-called "third baby concept" stocks, newly compiled by Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday, while China's benchmark stock index was roughly flat.Hu Yunlong, a Beijing-based hedge fund manager, said the sharp gains in such stocks were the result of "short-term speculation," as he sees limited immediate impact on corporate fundamentals.China lifted the cap on births in a bid to stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population. But analysts say the policy by itself is unlikely to boost many couples' willingness to have more children, given high childcare costs.Still, Xu Qi, investment adviser at Guosheng Securities, said Luolai Lifestyle Technology Co, which makes home textile products such as quilts and pillows, stands to benefit from the new policy. He also recommends Zhejiang Semir Garment Co, which makes children's clothes.Essence International suggested investors pay attention to China Feihe Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed maker of infant milk formula products.Meanwhile, Chinese listed companies fielded questions from investors anxious to learn how their businesses will be affected by the new policy.Thinker Agricultural Machinery Co Ltd, a maker of rice harvesters, was asked if the company was a "third-child concept" stock."Thanks for your humorous question," the company replied in an online investor relations platform.The indirect relationship is that "an increase in population will increase grain consumption...and demand for harvesters."But the precondition is...people are willing to have a third child."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diaper-toys-shares-soar-after-china-announces-third-child-policy-101622535244161.html
01-06-2021||World||Nearly 500,000 killed in a decade of Syria war: Report||A decade of war in Syria has left nearly half a million people dead, a war monitor said Tuesday, in a new toll that includes 100,000 recently confirmed deaths.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the conflict has claimed 494,438 lives since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.The previous tally, issued by the Observatory in March this year, stood at more than 388,000 dead.The war monitor has since confirmed an additional 105,015 deaths following months of documentation efforts supported by its network of sources on the ground."The overwhelming majority of these deaths occurred between the end of 2012 and November 2015," Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP, referring to the latest additions.Of the recently confirmed fatalities, more than 42,000 are civilians, most of them killed under torture in Syrian regime prisons, according to the monitor.Abdel Rahman said that a lull in the fighting allowed his organisation to investigate reports of deaths that had not been included in the overall tally for lack of documentation."It provided us with a window to document tens of thousands of cases for which we lacked evidence," he said.With government forces having reconquered large swathes of Syria and a ceasefire still holding along the main front line in Idlib region in the northwest, violence levels are at their lowest since the start of the conflict.PRISON DEATHSThe new figures published by the Observatory bring the total civilian death toll to 159,774, with attacks by Syrian government forces and allied militia accounting for the majority of deaths.The Observatory also documented a total of at least 57,567 deaths in government prisons and detention centres since 2011, up from the 16,000 confirmed deaths it reported in March.It also reported 168,326 deaths among Syrian soldiers and allied militia, with troops accounting for more than half of the tally.The conflict has killed 68,393 jihadists, most members of the Islamic State group or of organisations linked to Al-Qaeda, as well as 79,844 other rebels.A deal brokered by Turkey and Russia in March 2020 froze a government offensive on the rebel-controlled Idlib enclave which many feared would have caused human suffering on a scale yet unseen in the conflict.The attention on both sides has since turned to battling the Covid-19 pandemic and 2020 saw the lowest number of conflict-related deaths since the start of the war with 10,000, according to the Observatory.Today the Damascus government controls more than two-thirds of the country after a string of Russia-backed victories since 2015.President Bashar al-Assad, in power since 2000, was re-elected in May for a fourth seven-year term.The war has forced more than half the country's pre-war population to flee their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-500-000-killed-in-a-decade-of-syria-war-report-101622534903348.html

01-06-2021||World||Antigua PM says he had no role in Mehul Choksi's 'abduction'||After reports accusing Antigua prime minister Gaston Browne of playing a role in fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi’s disappearance from the country surfaced, he said on Monday that he had no clue about the alleged abduction.“Let me state here that even though Choksi’s citizenship was unsettled, we respected his legal and constitutional rights as a citizen, and we did nothing to abridge those rights whilst he was on Antiguan and Barbudan soil,” Browne said, according to a report on news website Antigua Newsroom.If Antigua was “desperate” to get rid of Choksi, Browne said, “The better option would have been to have the Indians come here, bring a plane and pack him on the plane and send him back to India.”The Indian businessman mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda last Sunday and was detained by Dominican police on Tuesday night on charges of illegally entering the island. Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit also came under fire for allegedly collaborating and being “part of a plot against the rule of law” to send the fugitive diamantaire to India. Dominica’s House of Assembly's leader of the Opposition Lennox Linton said a “full investigation” should be made into the circumstances under which Choksi was brought to Dominica. The “obvious collaboration between Dominica, Antigua and India” and the officials who instructed or influenced the police to facilitate the inhumane transfer of Mehul Choksi to Dominica should also be investigated, he added.Choksi and his lawyers claimed that he was kidnapped and taken to Dominica against his will last week. On Monday, his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal also suggested that the businessman may have been honey-trapped by a woman he had known for six months. He had gone to her house when he was abducted and taken on a yacht to Dominica.Choksi faces multiple charges of embezzling funds from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) in India which is worth some ₹13,500 crore. He had acquired citizenship of Antigua under its Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017, weeks before investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the PNB scam started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antigua-pm-says-he-had-no-role-in-mehul-choksi-s-abduction-101622522769372.html
01-06-2021||World||China reports human case of H10N3 bird flu, sends out advisory||The first case of human infection from a particular bird flu strain has been detected in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, China’s national health commission (NHC) said on Tuesday.In a statement on its website, the NHC has confirmed the case of human infection with the H10N3 strain.The case, detected in a male aged 41 and living in Zhenjiang, a city in the eastern part of the province, was transmitted from poultry, the statement said.The risk of spreading on a large scale was very low, the NHC assured, adding that there hasn’t been any case of human infection of H10N3 reported in the world before.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a genome sequence on a blood sample from the patient last week and confirmed that it was the H10N3 strain.Local authorities have traced the patient’s contacts and have kept them under medical observation.The NHC statement added that experts assessed that the full genetic analysis of the virus showed that the H10N3 virus was of avian origin.Experts have advised that people in the region should avoid contact with sick or dead poultry, and try to avoid direct contact with live birds.They should pay attention to food hygiene, wear masks, improve self-protection awareness, and check for fever and respiratory symptoms, the NHC advised.In February, China reported an outbreak of H5N8 avian influenza in Lianyungang, a coastal city also in the eastern province of Jiangsu.The highly pathogenic avian influenza had been detected among wild birds in a scenic area in the city.“H5N8 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus (also known as the bird flu virus). While H5N8 only presents a low risk to humans, it is highly lethal to wild birds and poultry,” the news agency Xinhua reported on the outbreak.In April, a highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu was found in wild birds in Shenyang, a city in northeast China’s Liaoning province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-human-case-of-h10n3-bird-flu-sends-out-advisory-101622524312651.html

"PPP rejects the decision to delay and rig the elections," he said.The former prime minister said that transparent, unbiased, and timely elections should be held in PoK and that the government would reap what it was sowing.Meanwhile, PPP leader and Sindh Education Minister Saeed Ghani said that the PoK Constitution was very clear and the elections could not be delayed, come what may, alleging that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was once again being used as an "arm twisting tool", reported Dawn.Ghani remarked that all the by-elections in Pakistan were held on time and now postponing elections in PoK polls meant that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was running away from the democratic process of elections.Earlier on Sunday, PoK Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider had accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of wanting to achieve its desired results in the PoK elections.He further remarked that no matter what the Prime Minister does, PoK will never become a province."Elections in PoK can only be postponed if there is external aggression," PM Farooq Haider said.He added that there is no reason to postpone the polls as by-elections were also held in the country despite the pandemic.Last year, the Imran Khan government had announced granting provisional province status to the region, which was not received well by most of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan who had protested against Islamabad's decision of integrating the illegally occupied region with the rest of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pakistan-pm-opposes-government-bid-to-delay-pok-elections-101622521117399.html

"And as prime minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole indigenous children from their communities.""Think of their communities that never saw them again. Think of their hopes, their dreams, their potential, of all they would have accomplished, all they would have become," he said. "All of that was taken away."Trudeau, who has made reconciliation with Canada's nearly 1.7 million indigenous people a priority of his government since coming to power in 2015, said he would speak with his ministers to shore up "next and further things we need to do to support (residential school) survivors and the community."Excavating school burial sites across Canada, as many have urged, he also said, "is an important part of discovering the truth.""Canada will be there to support indigenous communities as we discover the extent of this trauma and trying to give opportunities for families and communities to heal."The Tk'emlups te Secwepemc tribe said last week it had used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the remains of the students who attended a school near Kamloops, British Columbia.The Kamloops Indian Residential School was the largest of 139 boarding schools set up in the late 19th century to assimilate Canada's indigenous peoples, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time.It was operated by the Catholic church on behalf of the Canadian government from 1890 to 1969, before Ottawa took over its administration and closed it a decade later.Official records showed only 50 deaths at the school, where a principal once pleaded for more funds to properly feed students.- Children shoes tiny tributes -As the nation mourned, flags atop government buildings were lowered to half-mast over the weekend.Row upon row of children's shoes were left in front of parliament in Ottawa and on steps outside government offices and churches in several cities, forming makeshift memorials.About 100 people, several in ceremonial attire, also marched Sunday in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, near Montreal.National chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde was quoted by the Globe and Mail as saying former students and families "deserve to know the truth.""A thorough investigation into all former residential school sites could lead to more truths of the genocide against our people," he added.The British Columbia coroner is helping the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc tribe establish the causes and timings of the student deaths in Kamloops.On Monday, opposition parties asked for -- and Trudeau agreed to -- an emergency debate in parliament on the "heart-breaking" discovery.Some 150,000 Indian, Inuit and Metis youngsters in total were forcibly enrolled in these schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language.Today those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in indigenous communities.A truth and reconciliation commission has identified the names of, or information about, at least 4,100 children who died from abuse or neglect while attending a residential school. It estimates the actual toll is much higher.The commission concluded in a 2015 report that more than a century of abuses at the schools amounted to "cultural genocide."Seven years earlier, Ottawa had formally apologized as part of a Can$1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) settlement with former students.The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba, meanwhile, set up an online registry with the names of the thousands of children who never came home from the boarding schools, along with old class photos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-a-dad-trudeau-vows-concrete-action-on-mass-indigenous-student-grave-101622519241349.html

All waves start with a low number of cases... and then become explosive. So the key here is that what we are seeing are the signs of an early wave,” he said.PM Johnson, meanwhile, said he wants the G7 to reach a deal on Covid-19 vaccine passports and open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics in next month’s summit. He will host a June 11-13 G7 summit in Cornwall, England.In Brussels, the European Commission said fully vaccinated EU residents should be exempted from quarantine when travelling within the bloc. The EU executive’s update to its non-binding travel advisory was unveiled a week before EU legislation on a digital EU Covid certificate is set to be passed.The Pacific nation of Palau reported its first confirmed case on Monday.WHO members agree to strengthen global bodyWHO members have agreed to strengthen the global body at the heart of the pandemic response. The 194 member states, in a 14-page resolution on the last day of the virtual annual World Health Assembly, also agreed to “strengthen the WHO’s capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks”.Japan, meanwhile, approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12-15 years on Monday, the media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-in-early-stages-of-3rd-wave-fears-top-scientist-101622516753676.html
