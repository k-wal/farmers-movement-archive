01-06-2021||World||100 years of Tulsa massacre: Hundreds gather at historic church's prayer wall||Hundreds gathered Monday for an interfaith service dedicating a prayer wall outside historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church in Tulsa's Greenwood neighborhood on the centennial of the first day of one of the deadliest racist massacres in the nation.National civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and William Barber, joined multiple local faith leaders offering prayers and remarks outside the church that was under construction and largely destroyed when a white mob descended on the prosperous Black neighborhood in 1921, burning, killing, looting and leveling a 35-square-block area. Estimates of the death toll range from dozens to 300.Barber, a civil and economic rights activist, said he was “humbled even to stand on this holy ground."“You can kill the people but you cannot kill the voice of the blood."Although the church was nearly destroyed in the massacre, parishioners continued to meet in the basement, and it was rebuilt several years later, becoming a symbol of the resilience of Tulsa's Black community. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.As the ceremony came to an end, participants put their hands on the prayer wall along the side of the sanctuary while a soloist sung “Lift Every Voice and Sing." Traffic hummed on a nearby interstate that cuts through the Greenwood District, which was rebuilt after the massacre but slowly deteriorated 50 years later after homes were taken by eminent domain as part of urban renewal in the 1970s.Monday's slate of activities commemorating the massacre was supposed to culminate with a “Remember & Rise" headline event at nearby ONEOK Field, featuring Grammy-award-winning singer and songwriter John Legend and a keynote address from voting rights activist Stacey Abrams. But that event was scrapped late last week after an agreement couldn't be reached over monetary payments to three survivors of the deadly attack, a situation that highlighted broader debates over reparations for racial injustice.Disagreements among Black leaders in Tulsa over the handling of commemoration events and millions of dollars in donations have led to two different groups planning separate slates of events marking the massacre’s 100-year anniversary. In addition to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, the Black Wall Street Legacy Festival scheduled a series of separate events over the Memorial Day weekend.In a statement tweeted Sunday, Legend didn't specifically address the cancellation of the event, but said: “The road to restorative justice is crooked and rough — and there is space for reasonable people to disagree about the best way to heal the collective trauma of white supremacy. But one thing that is not up for debate — one fact we must hold with conviction — is that the path to reconciliation runs through truth and accountability."On Monday night, the Centennial Commission plans to host a candlelight vigil downtown to honor the victims of the massacre, and President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Tulsa on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-years-of-tulsa-massacre-hundreds-gather-at-historic-church-s-prayer-wall-101622491246995.html

But between 2015-2019, they lost an average of 298 billion tonnes each year.The findings will be included in a forthcoming assessment report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iceland-loses-750-sqkm-of-glaciers-to-global-warming-in-20-years-study-shows-101622488383243.html
01-06-2021||World||US business honchos express confidence in India||When top executives of large US companies met External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on May 27 under the aegis of US India Business Council (USIBC) and US India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) in Washington, even as they acknowledged the magnitude of India’s second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, most of their questions and concerns focused on the role of India in global economic recovery.Free from partisan views and knowledgeable about the actual ground situation, they looked beyond raw numbers and assessed the economic outlook after the second wave. Most agreed with the Minister’s view that since lockdowns were local and intermittent and as supply chains were intact, its impact would be far less than last year. They took a keen interest in the government’s efforts to vaccinate as many people as possible so as to get the economy back on track, according to diplomats who asked not to be named.Prominent among those who attended the meeting were: Ariel Mactavish, President, Medtronic Respiratory Inc; Ken Gilmartin, Executive Vice President Jacobs Engineering Group; Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM; Raj Subramaniam, President, FedEx; Julie Sweet, CEO Accenture; and Seifi Ghasemi, Chairman and CEO, Air Products.Also read: BRICS foreign ministers to discuss Covid-19, countering terror at virtual meetThe US CEOs spoke about similar American experiences last year. Many noted the logistics effort made by the Indian overnment, especially on oxygen supply. They highlighted that India had a key role as a global vaccine hub in restoring worldwide economic confidence. Apart from its resident population, its large number of expatriates and services staff including merchant shipping and airline crew were globally relevant. Many US companies also had large India-based staff whose health was central to their operations. The CEOs also believed that as the vaccine drive accelerated, connectivity and interaction between the two business communities will be fully restored.Till Sunday evening, India had fully vaccinated 44.4 million people and partly vaccinated 123.1 million – which means almost 18% of the eligible population of 940 million (over the age of 18 years) has been vaccinated. On Monday, the Indian government told the Supreme Court that the country would vaccinate everyone in the age group by the end of December, something that will require a sharp acceleration to around 7.75 million doses administered a day for the rest of the year.Interestingly, many CEOs themselves brought positive perspectives from their own company feedback on economic recovery. Experts have pointed out that while the onset of the second wave coincided with the economy’s return to normalcy, the fact that most states have ensured manufacturing and other business activities have continued through localized lockdowns may mean a lower impact. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on May 5 that the dent to aggregate demand on account of the second wave was moderate and disruptions in manufacturing were minimal compared to the first wave due to localized containment measures. And most international and domestic forecasters expect the economy to still grow in excess of 10% in 2021-22.In fact, this was taken as such a given that the focus shifted to India hosting more supply chains to de-risk the global economy. In particular, EAM was quizzed in detail about PLI ( performance-linked initiative) schemes to expand manufacturing. Many participants spoke about their plans to invest more in the coming year. There was particularly strong interest in electronic manufacturing, digital and health sectors.The mood in Washington political circles too was supportive, the diplomats added, with the Biden administration assuring India of full support in medical systems and equipment even as they sought to address New Delhi’s concerns over Indo-Pacific with the QUAD grouping now being placed on priority. As for China, it has been widely noted that the May 19 meeting between the foreign ministers of the US and Russia have resulted in a US-Russia summit on June 16 in Geneva, while the March 19 US-China meeting between foreign ministers and national security advisors ended in a slanging match. India is a natural beneficiary of better ties between the US and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-business-honchos-express-confidence-in-india-101622485910492.html
