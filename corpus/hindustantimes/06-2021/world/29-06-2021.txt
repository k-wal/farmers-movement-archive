And most Hindus - 59% - also believe that Indians should be able to speak Hindi.Pew said the survey was conducted among 30,000 Indians through face-to-face interviews in 17 languages in late 2019 and the beginning of 2020, a period marked by escalation in sectarian tension over the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the revocation of the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority erstwhile state.“While people in some countries may aspire to create a ‘melting pot’ of different religious identities, many Indians seem to prefer a country more like a patchwork fabric, with clear lines between groups,” the report said.But, first, what unites Indians. Most of them agree they are free to practise their faith - 91% Hindus, 89% Muslims and Christians, 82% of Sikhs, 93% of Buddhists and 85% of Jains; 85% of Hindus, 78% of Muslims and Christians, 81% of Sikhs, 84% of Buddhists and 83% of Jains said respect for other religions is “very important” to being “truly Indian; and 80%, 79%, 78, 75%, 86% and 73% of the six faiths say respect for other religions is a very important part of their religious identify.There is more that they agree on - 77% of Hindus believe in karma, as do Muslims; a third of Christians and a majority of Hindus believe in the purifying powers of Ganga; and in northern India the survey found that 12% of Hindus and 10% of Sikhs, and 37% of Muslims identity with Sufism.Now, what sets them apart, according to the Pew survey. Most Hindus - 66% - believe they are very different from Muslims, and Muslims nearly reciprocated that with 64% of them saying they consider themselves very different from Hindus. Two-third of Jains and half of Sikhs, however, say they have a lot in common with Hindus.Difference in self-perception among Hindus and Muslims manifests in opposition to inter-faith marriage. Roughly, two-thirds of Hindus in India want to prevent inter-religious marriages of Hindu women (67%) or Hindu men (65%), the survey said. It was also found that larger shares of Muslims feel similarly - 80% say it is very important to prevent Muslim women from marrying outside, and 76% say it is very important to stop Muslim men from doing so.A majority of those polled say their close friends are from the same religious group - 86% of Indians overall, 86% of Hindus, 88% of Muslims, 80% of Sikhs, and 72% of Jain. But Hindus were divided on who they preferred as neighbours - 45% said they were fine with anyone, 45% said they will not be willing to accept members of at least one of the religions as neighbours, mostly, 39% Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-value-religious-tolerance-practice-segregation-survey-101624990458457.html

29-06-2021||World||Covid-19: US announces $41mn aid for India||The United States has announced $41 million in additional assistance to India for its fight against Covid-19 as lawmakers cutting across party lines called for more.The additional assistance will support access to Covid-19 testing, pandemic-related mental health services, timely referrals to medical services, and access to healthcare in remote areas, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said.The agency said the US assistance to India is now up to $200 million with an additional $500 million more in emergency supplies and training for more than 214,000 frontline health workers in infection prevention and control, benefitting more than 42 million Indians.President Joe Biden has promised to help India that supported the US when it was confronting a devastating spike in cases last year. India had lifted an export ban to supply anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in response to a direct appeal from then president Donald Trump.Lawmakers from both parties called for more aid to India during a debate in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan resolution introduced by the co-chairs of the India Caucus Democrat Brad Sherman and Republican Steve Chabot, “Recognising the devastating impact of the pandemic in India and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to Covid assistance to India.”Gregory Meeks, the Democrat who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, started the debate with a passionate appeal for help to India. “We’re all saddened by the devastating impact of Covid-19 and what it already has had on the Indian people.”Meeks said that while the Biden administration’s response has been timely and the number of cases has started to come down in India, “we cannot let our guard down, we must do more to prepare for a potential new wave of infections. It’s important to recognise that none of us will be safe until all of us are safe”.Republican Young Kim reminded lawmakers of the help extended by India last year and it is “only fitting” that the United States has quickly delivered much-needed supplies such as PPE, rapid testing kits, and other drugs to India when the latter is facing devastating surge. “This action from the US, the world’s oldest democracy to India, the world’s largest democracy is only fitting,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-announces-41mn-aid-for-india-101624988838087.html

Under the agreement, confirmed by settler leaders and the interior ministry, the settlers will leave the Eviatar outpost within days but their mobile homes will remain and Israeli troops will establish a base in the area. According to a statement from regional settler leader Yossi Dagan, the defence ministry has agreed to study land claims to assess the prospect of a future recognised settlement. Dagan said the agreement had been approved by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, defence minister Benny Gantz and interior minister Ayelet Shaked.Shaked’s office confirmed the deal, but spokespersons for Bennett and Gantz were not immediately available to comment. About 50 Jewish families moved to Eviatar last month, erecting huts, tents and caravans - in defiance of international and Israeli law - on land near Nablus in the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians claim for a future state.Eviatar settler Tzvi Succot, a leader in the outpost community, said he supported the agreement because he believed it would ultimately lead to a permanent Jewish community. “The most important thing for us is that the buildings stay here, that a Jewish presence remains on this hill,” Succot told AFP.Palestinians protest Palestinians in the nearby community of Beita have responded with night-time protests, flashing horns, burning tyres and shining laser beams to keep the settlers awake. Those protests continued on Monday when they directed green light beams towards Jewish settler homes and hoisted Palestinian flags. Moussa Hamayel, the deputy head of the Beita municipality, told AFP that the Palestinian community had “completely rejected” the purported compromise. Israeli troops have killed four Palestinians including a teenager in unrest sparked by the protests. Eviatar is named after a settler fatally stabbed near Beita in 2013. Israeli authorities had evacuated an earlier version of the outpost. But Israeli families returned in May after a Palestinian man shot dead a student nearby. Gantz ordered the settlement removed, but Benjamin Netanyahu - who served 12 unbroken years as prime minister before he was unseated on June 13 - froze the decision. Bennett, who ousted Netanyahu by joining a broad coalition including left-wingers and an Arab party, is the former head of the Yesha Council, a settlers’ lobbying group.All Jewish settlements in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967, are considered illegal by most of the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-settlers-agree-to-leave-flashpoint-west-bank-outpost-officials-101624987698736.html
29-06-2021||World||UK Labour Party draws flak for using PM Modi's image to target Boris Johnson||The UK’s Opposition Labour Party was branded “divisive” and “anti-India” by Indian diaspora groups after a party leaflet for a by-election in northern England used an image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The leaflet, in circulation for the Batley and Spen by-poll in West Yorkshire scheduled for Thursday, shows Modi in a handshake with Conservative Party Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit in 2019 with the message “Don’t risk a Tory MP who is not on your side”.It triggered furious reactions across social media after Tory MP Richard Holden posted an image of it on Twitter, questioning whether it implies that Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer would not be seen in a handshake with the Indian Prime Minister.“Dear Keir Starmer, please can you explain this leaflet and clarify whether a Labour PM/politician would refuse to have any relationship with the world’s largest democracy? Is this your message to 1.5 million members of the Indian diaspora in UK,” questioned the Conservative Friends of India (CFIN) diaspora organisation.Labour double down on this controversial leaflet being put out in Batley & Spen (branded gutter politics by critics). Kim Leadbeater's campaign spox says the leaflet points out a Tory vote means backing a PM "who insults Muslim women and calls it a joke" pic.twitter.com/C35oS6dapAThe outrage was echoed from within the Labour Party ranks, with the Labour Friends of India (LFIN) diaspora group demanding the “immediate withdrawal” of the leaflet.“The Labour Party is right to call out Boris Johnson’s lack of action following the conclusion that anti-Muslim sentiment remains a problem within the Conservative Party. It is unfortunate that the Labour Party used a picture of the Prime Minister of India, the world’s largest democracy and one of the UK's closest friends, from the G7 meeting in 2019, on its leaflet,” LFIN said in its statement.Indian-origin veteran Labour MP Virendra Sharma also condemned the move as “cheap divide and rule” and “dog-whistle” politics not worthy of Labour.“The Labour Party will win by bringing people together and uniting the community, to do anything else will divide our community and play into Tory hands,” said Sharma, who represents Ealing Southall in London – a constituency with a large Indian diaspora presence.Another Indian-origin Labour MP, Navendu Mishra, took to Twitter to declare that “racism is alive and well within Labour”.“A hierarchy of racism exists inside the party and some groups are seen as fair game for attacks based on religion/race/heritage,” said Mishra, MP for Stockport in northern England.“Labour will not win by playing divide and rule politics against our communities. We will win based on a principled stance against racism and discrimination of all kinds inside and outside the party,” he said.The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) group reacted by organising a letter of complaint to party leader Starmer, criticising the “votebank politics” of the campaign leaflet.“OFBJP objects to this kind of anti-India branding just for votebank politics. Such posters and statements are clearly a sign of divisive politics played by Labour,” said OFBJP President Kuldeep Shekhawat.Angry messages dominated the original Twitter post on social media, with many pointing out that it was Labour’s perceived “anti-India stance" that was among the factors behind its bruising defeat in the 2019 General Election under former leader Jeremy Corbyn.The by-election in Batley and Spen, a traditional Labour stronghold, is seen as a crucial test of Starmer’s leadership after the Opposition party fared poorly in recent byelections.The by-poll this week follows the previous Labour MP, Tracy Brabin, stepping down after being elected Mayor of West Yorkshire and has Kim Leadbeater in the fray for the party, the sister of Jo Cox – the Labour MP murdered near her constituency office in a far-right attack in June 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-labour-party-draws-flak-for-using-pm-modi-s-image-to-target-boris-johnson-101624985313127.html

The 12-storey Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida, partially collapsed last week and the search for survivors has stretched into a sixth day. At least 11 deaths have been confirmed and 150 are still unaccounted for."On Thursday, July 1, the president and the first lady will travel to Surfside, Florida," the Biden administration said in a statement, adding that details for the trip would be provided later.Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, updated the president on the tragedy after visiting the site on Sunday. On Tuesday morning, Criswell testified at a congressional hearing on FEMA’s readiness, saying the devastation was “difficult to put into words.” She apprised the US Congress that FEMA has set up a “recovery centre that is working directly with families and loved ones impacted by this tragic event to get them the assistance that they need.”Also Read | Indian-American family among over 150 missing after building collapse in USAmid intense speculations over the cause of the deadly collapse, US media has reported on multiple warnings about the impending tragedy. Almost three years before the deadly collapse, an engineer had warned about evidence of “major structural damage” to the concrete slab below the pool deck. In the October 2018 report, he had also highlighted “abundant” cracking and crumbling of the columns, beams and walls of the parking garage under the 12-storey building.An April correspondence from the board president of Champlain Towers South, Jean Wodnicki, has shed more light on the condition of the structure. Weeks before the collapse, Wodnicki wrote to neighbours warning that the “garage has gotten significantly worse since the initial [2018] inspection.”“When you can visually see the concrete spalling (cracking), that means that the rebar holding it together is rusting and deteriorating beneath the surface,” the letter read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-florida-condo-collapse-site-on-july-1-as-search-continues-101624984053967.html

The duo remains on bail until the sentencing hearing.The 50-second video was played in court, where Henderson can be heard saying: "As a white man, I won't be listening to people of colour."Cumming then shared it along with the caption: "Haters gonna be hating" and four laughing emojis.Prosecutor Daniel Church, appearing on behalf of the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the video was "motivated by hostility towards members of racial groups".The court heard how members of the public were distressed by the comments linked with the video and feared its contents could incite racial hatred.The duo was summonsed to court on May 29 and charged with sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication network, which comes with a custodial sentence or fine or both."Following complaints in relation to a video targeted at Home Secretary Priti Patel and posted on social media in January 2021, the CPS has authorised Nottinghamshire Police to charge Jake Henderson and Robert Cumming with sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication network,” Janine Smith, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said earlier this month."The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider,” Smith said.The pair faced charges under Section 127 of the UK’s Communications Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-men-racially-abuse-uk-minister-priti-patel-on-social-media-held-101624984265687.html

Trading volume was about 1.2 times the 10-day average as of 12:16 p.m. in New York.Moderna said its vaccine produced protective antibodies against the delta variant, which emerged in India and has been spreading throughout the world. India’s drug regulator approved the import of the shots for restricted emergency use on Tuesday. The world’s second most-populous country trails richer nations with a little more than 4% of the population fully vaccinated, compared with almost half in the US.Some analysts had expressed concern about Moderna’s recent surge, which has pushed the Cambrige, Massachussetts-based company’s market value past $95 billion. Moderna continues to be driven by momentum, and today’s study results are “clearly showing good coverage of variants with their vaccine,” Michael Yee at Jefferies said in an email.The emergency authorization in India as well as Sanofi’s plans to spend about $480 million to speed development of messenger-RNA vaccines, where Moderna has been spending billions per year, is also adding to today’s rally, he said.He told clients last week that trading appears to have moved beyond the fundamentals of future vaccine sales. “I think there’s machines, I think there’s quants, I think there’s just buying of good charts,” he said. “It’s a momentum stock.”Vaccine stocks like Moderna and BioNTech SE have surged over the past 12 months. Shares of BioNTech rallied around 250% while Moderna gained nearly 280% during the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-shares-jump-to-all-time-high-amid-delta-variant-fear-101624984078797.html

The baby western lowland gorilla, classified as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is thought to have been born on the night of June 13 in the Batéké Plateau National Park, a milestone under gorilla reintroduction project.The teams on the site analysed videos taken from camera traps and saw the mother gorilla, Mayombe, one last time without a baby on June 13 and with a newborn the next morning, concluding that the birth had taken place on the intervening night of June 13-14.While several other gorillas have been born under this reintroduction program, their parents descended from the wild, were poached and then rehabilitated. Mayombe was born in the ZooParc de Beauval in France on October 21, 2007, and was reintroduced in June 2019.

This is the first time the medal has been awarded.Among the awardees was Chen Hongjun, a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldier who died during a brawl with Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June 2020. Other recipients include soldiers, community workers and professionals in the arts and science.In the run-up to its centenary celebrations, state-run media has said the CPC demonstrated its “…exemplary governance capability by leading the Chinese people in efficiently containing the Covid-19 outbreak and eliminating absolute poverty in the world’s most populous country”.In the context of security, Beijing has left nothing to chance ahead of the July 1 events expected to be held at the city’s historic Tiananmen Square; it has been closed to the public since June 23 and will reopen on July 2.The second and final comprehensive drill for the grand celebration at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square concluded last Sunday; it started at 8pm on Saturday and some 33,000 people took part.“Measures are in place prohibiting the flying of any aerial objects that may affect the safety of flight activities during the celebration,” a state media report said.Beijing has shut down traffic on various routes, decked streets in patriotic flower arrangements and national flags, and ramped up surveillance and security this week in preparation for the centenary event on July 1.As part of the anniversary-week celebrations, the party also staged a gala performance on Monday night at the National Stadium, or “Bird’s Nest” as it is commonly called.“Party leaders and foreign diplomats watched the extravaganza of song, dance and theatre which credited the party with guiding China’s rise into a great power over the past century,” Reuters news agency said.“Darker parts in the party’s history, including a famine in the late 1950s, the decade-long cultural revolution, which started in the 1960s, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, were omitted from the show,” Reuters said.“Without the Communist Party, there is no new China,” reads propaganda posters that have sprung up across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cpcs-100-year-celebrations-chinese-prez-urges-loyalty-from-people-101624974498020.html

The study showed a significant drop in infections among frontline hospital staff after their face masks were upgraded from FRSMs (fluid resistant surgical masks) to FFP3 respirators.Since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, CUH has been screening its staff for the infection. The screening data was used to track infection rates among the staff. Even after using the recommended PPE kit, staff caring for Covid patients were at a much higher risk of infection compared to staff working in non-Covid wards, the CUH NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement.Dr Mark Ferris, one of the co-authors of the study, said that the researchers developed a mathematical model to look at the risks faced by hospital staff caring for Covid-19 patients. According to their model, the risk of direct infection from working in a Covid ward before the change in respiratory protective equipment was 47 times higher than the risk of community-based exposure.Also Read | As Delta variant cases rise, WHO asks fully vaccinated to keep masks onIn December 2020, the hospital upgraded its respiratory protective equipment to FFP3 respirators, which, once fitted, provide a tight seal around the nose and mouth, helping stop the airborne infection from being breathed in and out. According to the FFP3 respirators can be classified as FFP 1, FFP 2 or FFP 3, with the highest number providing the highest protection.The study concluded that infections from ward-based exposure fell significantly, “with FFP3 respirators providing 31-100% protection (and most likely 100%)” against infection from Covid patients.“Once FFP3 respirators were introduced, the number of cases attributed to exposure on Covid wards dropped dramatically – in fact, our model suggests that FFP3 respirators may have cut ward-based infection to zero,” Dr Chris Illingworth from the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, said.The results are available in a pre-print and have not been peer-reviewed yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highgrade-ffp3-masks-can-provide-up-to-100-protection-against-covid-19-study-101624967377547.html

The EU offered the clarification against the backdrop of speculation on the possible impact of the “EU Digital Covid Certificate” or green pass on Indian nationals as the regime doesn’t include any of the vaccines currently being administered in India. The green pass system is expected to be in place from July 1. As of Monday, the Serum Institute of India (SII) had not applied to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval of Covishield, the EU official said. The EMA has so far approved only four vaccines – Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine, Spikevax or the Moderna vaccine and Vaxzevria or the AstraZeneca vaccine. “For the purpose of the Digital Covid Certificate, individual [EU] member states will have the option to also accept vaccinations that have been authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO), such as Covishield,” the EU official said. Also Read | EU’s green pass for Covishield: What is the document all aboutThe Digital Covid Certificate is meant to “facilitate safe free movement during the Covid-19 pandemic within the EU”, and it will serve as “proof that a person was vaccinated against Covid-19, received a negative test result or recovered from Covid-19”, the official added. “The aim of the EU Digital Covid Certificate is to facilitate free movement inside the EU. It is not a precondition to travel,” the official said. Referring to the possible EMA authorisation for Covishield, the official said, “As of yesterday [Monday], the EMA stated that it had not received a request for approval. It will examine any such request when received, as per its procedures.” The EU further clarified that EMA “does not investigate new drugs on its own, unless it is asked by the relevant companies”. The official noted that temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU were currently in place for many non-EU countries, including India, due to the pandemic. “EU member states shall gradually lift these temporary travel restrictions at the external borders, based on developments of the health situation,” the official said. The issue of a “fair travel regime” figured in talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and the EU commissioner for international partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, when they met in Italy on Monday ahead of a meeting of G20 foreign ministers. Jaishankar tweeted that he had a “good conversation” with Urpilainen, adding: “Discussed the Covid challenge, our Connectivity Partnership and development cooperation. Underlined the importance of equitable vaccine access and a fair travel regime.” India has linked the issue of so-called “vaccine passports” to equitable access to doses around the world. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said on June 17 that many developing countries had not yet been able to vaccinate a large percentage of their population. “We would favour discussions on the subject of vaccine passport with greater focus on vaccine equity,” he had said, hinting that India had no plans to issue vaccine passports. The EMA had said on Monday that is only responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines and vaccines in connection with their marketing authorisation in the EU, and that it is not responsible for travelling conditions associated with Covid-19 vaccination, such as the Digital Covid Certificate. The agency further said the only Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca that had been authorised in the EU was Vaxzevria and that Covishield did not currently have marketing authorisation. “Even though it may use an analogous production technology to Vaxzevria...Covishield as such is not currently approved under EU rules. This is because vaccines are biological products. Even tiny differences in the manufacturing conditions can result in differences in the final product, and EU law therefore requires the manufacturing sites and production process to be assessed and approved as part of the authorisation process,” an EMA spokesperson said. “Should we receive a marketing authorisation application for Covishield or should any change to the approved manufacturing sites for Vaxzevria be approved, we would communicate about it,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-pass-not-precondition-to-travel-says-eu-official-101624966769698.html

The 79-year-old South African leader was found guilty of defying a court order to appear at a corruption inquiry earlier this year. Zuma was facing an inquiry probing wide-ranging allegations of corruption during his tenure from 2009 to 2018. The Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma defied an order by the country’s highest court by refusing to cooperate with the commission of inquiry, chaired by deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo."Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma is sentenced to undergo 15 months' imprisonment," a constitutional court judge said, reading out the court's order.South Africa's apex court has ordered Zuma, who was not present in court for the ruling, to hand himself over within five days to a police station in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province, his hometown, or in Johannesburg.For the first time in South African history, a former president has been sentenced to a prison term.Also Read | Former South Africa President Zuma accused of taking 'hundreds of bribes'Among several allegations, Zuma is accused of allowing three businessmen brothers -Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta- to plunder state resources and influence policy.

Commenting on the letter, the judge said that the former president attempts to "evoke public sympathy through unfounded allegations fly in the face of reason.""If his conduct is met with impunity, he will do significant damage to the rule of law," she added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-court-jails-ex-president-jacob-zuma-for-15-months-for-contempt-101624962385880.html
29-06-2021||World||South Africa considers letting women have multiple husbands. Uproar follows||A proposal in South Africa to allow women to have multiple husbands has led to uproar among the conservative section of the country’s society. The green paper containing the proposal has been prepared by the country’s home department.The polyandry proposal is one among the many in the green paper which seeks to make marriage more inclusive. But it has turned out to be the most controversial one.The government has invited comments on the green paper till June 30. The paper was prepared in April, and opened for suggestions in May.The government document has said that the legislation that regulates marriages in South Africa is not based on the provisions of the Constitution of the country. The law has some legacy issues, it further said.“The purpose of the marriage policy is to establish a policy foundation for regulating the marriages of all persons that reside in SA. The envisaged marriage statute will enable South Africans and residents of all sexual orientations, religious and cultural persuasions to conclude legal marriages that will accord with the principles of equality, non-discrimination, human dignity and unity in diversity, as encapsulated in the Constitution,” the document said.The government said that the green paper is based on extensive research and consultation, and the process began in 2019. Consultations were held with religious and traditional leaders as well had human rights activists. The rights activists said that the right to equality demands that polyandry be legally recognised, the government document further said.But the opposition is fierce. One of the prominent faces to oppose the proposal is Musa Mseleku, a reality TV star. “Protecting our existence, our spiritual its important for both the current generation and future generations. Let us defend our culture, tradition and customs by participating in this process. Let us object to Polyandry outright,”. He said in a Facebook post.South Africa has one of the most liberal constitutions and allows polygamy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-considers-letting-women-have-multiple-husbands-uproar-follows-101624961675794.html

The Russian government agency added that the analysis of the efficacy is on the basis of data collected on June 8, according to a report published by news agency ANI. The vaccine is fully effective against severe infections and there were no instances of adverse aftermath after vaccination, the report added.RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said that inoculating the Russian vaccine helps in creating “durable immunity among the population and provides for lifting the restrictions and returning to normal life.”He further termed the Sputnik V as “one of the best Covid vaccines in the world” as confirmed by data from Bahrain, Hungary, Mexico, Serbia, Argentina, San Marino, and other nations.Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released a summary report of its preliminary findings during a visit to a Sputnik V vaccine filling site in Russian capital of Moscow from May 31-June 4. The report detailed the identification of around six issues related to the monitoring and control aseptic operation and filling of the vaccine, news agency PTI reported.“Identified concerns with the implementation of an appropriate Environmental Monitoring Program to monitor and control the aseptic operation and filling of Gam-COVID-Vac,” the WHO said in its interim report.The Sputnik V, which has so far been registered in 67 countries worldwide with a total population of more than 3.5 billion people, is awaiting a nod from the WHO. Earlier this month, Dmitriev told reporters that the approval from the public health agency is expected to come within two months.Notably, India had approved Sputnik V for emergency use in April 2021 following “positive results of local Phase 3 clinical study,” the official Twitter account of the vaccine stated.At the time, India had become the 60th nation to give a nod to the vaccine. Dr Reddy’s laboratories tied up with the RDIF earlier this year to roll out the first 125 million people doses of Sputnik V (250 million vials) across India. It has also received at least 3 million doses of the Russian vaccine, which is the third vaccine to have received approval from the Drug Controllers General of India (DCGI) besides Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-v-showed-97-8-efficacy-in-uae-no-adverse-cases-seen-says-rdif-101624961459957.html

The island nation which serves as burgeoning business and tourism hub lost out on two important global events, the World Economic Forum and Formula One night race, both have been scrapped due to the pandemic. The move to vaccinate non-residents lines up with its efforts of opening up much like rival Hong Kong has done.Also Read: Singapore plans to shift to new normal amid Covid. Check detailsThe interval between two doses have also been reduced from six to eight weeks to four weeks to accelerate efforts at opening up. Jeremy Lim, associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health under the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg that the island nation needs its open borders to survive. “Singapore cannot and will not remain closed. Open borders and trade are our lifeblood,”Singapore reported five new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, all were linked to cases of earlier infections, reported Bloomberg.

A team of researchers from the University of Otago, New Zealand, and the UK collaborated to develop the magnetic device that limits the wearer to a liquid diet, but “allows free speech and doesn’t restrict breathing.”“The main barrier for people for successful weight loss is compliance and this helps them establish new habits, allowing them to comply with a low-calorie diet for a period of time. It really kick-starts the process,” Paul Brunton, the lead researcher and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the University of Otago Health Sciences, said in a statement.Trial participants lost an average of 6.36 kilograms within two weeks and were motivated to continue with their weight loss journey, the University said. The magnetic device is fitted by a dentist, can be released by the user in the case of an emergency and can be repeatedly fitted and removed.Otago and UK researchers have developed a world-first weight-loss device to help fight the global obesity epidemic: an intra-oral device that restricts a person to a liquid diet. Read more: https://t.co/eLhXwipiqs pic.twitter.com/Of6v3uvVbXAlso Read | Propaganda value, optics behind thinner Kim Jong Un, say analystsThe announcement drew a massive backlash on social media as users termed it a “torture device” meant to force people to go on a liquid diet. “And this, kids, is why ethics needs to be taught in science. Good God, I thought medicine was past these kinds of torture devices,” replied one user.The outrage on social media prompted the University to issue a clarification, saying the device is not intended as a quick or long-term weight-loss solution, but to assist people who need to undergo surgery and who cannot have the surgery until they have lost weight. It stated that users can have the magnets disengaged and the device removed after two or three weeks.“They could then have a period with a less restricted diet and then go back into treatment. This would allow for a phased approach to weight loss supported by advice from a dietician,” the University of Otago tweeted.However, the University, in its earlier statement, had said that the device has been developed to “help fight the global obesity epidemic,” adding that the tool could be “particularly helpful” for those having to lose weight before they can undergo surgery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/torture-device-scientists-develop-weight-loss-tool-that-locks-jaw-spark-outrage-101624960888959.html

The study is based on phase 1/2 trial data of the vaccine.The randomised trial on 550 young people found that over 96 per cent of children and adolescents who received two doses of the vaccine, manufactured by Sinovac, developed antibodies against Sars-CoV-2. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate, with pain at the injection site the most commonly reported symptom, the researchers said, according to news agency PTI."Children and adolescents with Covid-19 usually have mild or asymptomatic infections compared with adults. However, a small number may still be at risk of severe illness. They can also transmit the virus to others, making it vital to test the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in younger age groups,," said Qiang Gao from Sinovac Life Sciences, China.The vaccine - either 1.5 microgram (μg) or 3μg per dose or a control was given by intramuscular injection in two doses, at day 0 and day 28. Among the 550 participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or the control, adverse reactions within 28 days occurred in 56 (26 per cent) of 219 participants in the 1.5μg group. Such adverse incidences were reported in 63 (29 per cent) of 217 participants in the 3μg group, and 27 (24 per cent) of 114 in the control group.Only one serious adverse reaction, a case of pneumonia, was reported in the control group, however, this was unrelated to the Covid-19 vaccination. In phase 1, 100 per cent of participants in both the 1.5μg and 3μg groups generated antibodies against SARS-CoV-2., the researchers said.Stronger immune responses -- determined by the amount of antibodies produced that can neutralise the virus -- were detected among the 3μg group compared with the 1.5μg group. In phase 2, 97 per cent of participants in the 1.5μg group produced antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, compared with 100 per cent in the 3μg group. Participants in the 3μg group again produced a stronger immune response than those in the 1.5μg group, the study stated.The researchers noted that immune responses among children and adolescents were higher than those measured in adults aged 18-59 years and elderly aged 60 years and older. The researchers recommended two 3μg doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for children and adolescents aged 3-17 years based on their results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-found-effective-in-children-adolescents-lancet-study-101624950956752.html

Platforms such as Alphabet Inc’s Google, YouTube, and Gmail were down, with users pointing out issues with logging into their accounts and also accessing the website in parts of North America, according to Downdetector.At one point in time, more than a thousand users faced difficulties with the search engine, the outage monitoring website revealed. Furthermore, users also came across glitches in accessing Google Drive and YouTube. Reports of Google outage on Downdetector declined to single digits early Tuesday.In December last year, Google services were down for a brief period of time globally during which users of the search engine in Europe, India, the US and other parts of the globe could not access their mobile video games, online documents, and Gmail accounts. YouTube was also impacted by the outage as users were unable to watch anything on the video-sharing platform.After nearly an hour passed, the Alphabet-owned firm stated on its support page that services were restored for users. However, the reason behind such a worldwide outage was not reported or mentioned by Google.The December issue occurred after several such outages took place throughout last year, including in January, August and September. In the August issue, Google services – Google Meet, Google Chats, Google Drive, and Google Docs, among others – were down in most parts of the world, including India, and were restored after seven hours. Google, however, did not cite the reason behind the global outage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-restores-services-of-youtube-gmail-after-several-users-face-outage-101624951205105.html
29-06-2021||World||Propaganda value, optics behind thinner Kim Jong Un, say analysts||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been under the spotlight this time for his weight loss and analysts think it could be related to the "tense" food situation in the country. They say there is propaganda value in showing that Kim Jong Un has lost weight amid food shortages in North Korea, which is one of the most secretive countries in the world.Kim Jong Un, who is said to be 37 years old, reappeared in public after nearly a month earlier in June sparking speculation over the health of the leader and the focus was on his apparently slimmer wrist. Reuters reports that analysts at NK News, a Seoul-based website that monitors North Korea, noted that his watch appeared to be fastened more tightly on his wrist.And then came the tightly controlled state media's rare mention of the issue last week. An unidentified resident of Pyongyang was quoted on KRT that everyone in North Korea is heartbroken over Kim Jong Un's apparent weight loss. "Seeing respected general secretary (Kim Jong Un) looking emaciated breaks our people's heart so much," the man said in an interview aired by the state broadcaster on Friday.Also read | Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the worldJenny Town, director of the US-based 38 North project which monitors North Korea, said the reason behind Kim's weight loss is unclear--whether it is because of an illness or whether he decided that it was time to get fit-- and the intention behind the state media coverage is also unknown, according to Reuters. "It is a little strange that they would show him in such ill-fitting clothes, as the optics do seem to emphasise his weight loss," Town was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also read | US has 'wrong' expectation for dialogue: Kim Yo JongChristopher Green, a Korea specialist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told Reuters that the emphasis was on the fact that Kim is working hard for the people at a time of widespread hardship. "What matters is that the North Korean regime will have received word from its many, many, many informants that Kim's condition was a talking point among ordinary people," he said. "From there it is a simple matter to respond by designing a propaganda strategy to use the existing public discussion to the regime's advantage," he added.Kim has talked about a "tense" food situation that could worsen if this year's crops fail, worsening economic problems amid strict self-imposed border and movement restrictions that have massively affected trade.Also read | Kim Jong Un 'solemnly swears' to salvage North Korea's economyChad O'Carroll, CEO of the Seoul-based Korea Risk Group, said in his opinion the most likely reason they would mention his declining weight would be related to ongoing Covid-19-related border measures. "Regardless of the motivation for Kim's rapid weight loss, it seems there is propaganda value in showing that even the leader of North Korea is enduring the same food shortages that are hitting the country at the current time," O'Carroll told Reuters.This is not the first time that the North Korean state media has mentioned Kim Jong Un's health. Kim suffered from "discomfort" after a prolonged period out of the public eye, it reported in 2014. Speculation about Kim’s health spilled over after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15 last year. However, he reappeared the very next month.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/propaganda-value-optics-behind-thinner-kim-jong-un-say-analysts-101624948448353.html

The Spelling Bee was cancelled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.The US Spelling Bee reflects the dominance young kids from the small ethnic community have had on this prestigious and high-pressure endurance test for more than a decade now.During the in-person finals, the Bee will have the option of activating a spell-off if needed. The spell-off would be activated in the closing minutes of the competition if a champion has not yet been declared in a traditional, one-person, one-word round, the statement added."We are honoured to introduce our 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee Finalists. Round after round, this group of spellers proved their mettle, and we look forward to seeing them show off their knowledge and hard work as they square off against the dictionary on the national stage,” said Dr J Michael Durnil, executive director of the Bee, reported PTI.“Congratulations to all of this year’s 209 national qualifiers – they’ve persevered over a year that has been challenging in many ways, and our team is proud to have witnessed their journey,” he added.The National Bee is a high-profile test as much as a nerd spelling match and spellers spend months preparing for it. The final rounds of this year’s contest will be hosted in person at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida and will be broadcast live in prime time on ESPN2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-indian-americans-make-it-to-us-spelling-bee-final-2021-101624940469946.html

29-06-2021||World||'Mix and match' of Covid-19 vaccines generate robust immune response: Oxford study||A study led by the Oxford University has discovered that alternating doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines generate robust immune responses against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The researchers, who are looking into the feasibility of using a different vaccine for the initial “prime” vaccination to the follow-up “booster” vaccination, discovered that alternating doses of the two vaccines generated strong immunity.The study, published on the Lancet pre-print server, says "mixed" doses of these vaccines induced high concentrations of antibodies against the SARS-CoV2 spike IgG protein when they were given four weeks apart. The study indicated that all possible vaccination schedules involving the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines could potentially be used against coronavirus disease (Covid-19)."The Com-COV study has evaluated 'mix and match' combinations of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines to see to what extent these vaccines can be used interchangeably, potentially allowing flexibility in the UK and global vaccine roll-out," Matthew Snape, an associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford and the chief investigator, said.The results show that when given at a four-week interval both mixed schedules induce an immune response that is above the threshold set by the standard schedule of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine," he noted.However, the study found that the immune responses differed according to the order of immunisation, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot followed by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generating the better immune response out of the two mixed schedules.Snape said that these results are an invaluable guide to the use of mixed dose schedules, but the interval of four weeks studied is shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The United Kingdom's vaccination program has been applauded for its speed and agility so far. It was quick to authorise and deploy vaccines and is now offering all over-18s their first shots while giving the remainder of people their second doses. To date, 84.1% of all UK adults have had the first dose and 61.6% have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, government data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mix-and-match-of-covid-19-vaccines-generate-robust-immune-response-oxford-study-101624930160887.html

Sheikh Rashid Ahmed comments come after another senior minister denied claims that there are any safe havens for the Taliban in Pakistan."Taliban families live here in Pakistan in areas like Rawat, Loi Ber, Bara Kahu and Tarnol," Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said in an interview aired by private Pakistani TV channel Geo News on Sunday as he mentioned Islamabad's suburbs. "Sometimes their (fighters) dead bodies arrive and sometimes they come here to hospitals to get medical treatment,” Rashid told the Urdu-language network.Pakistan is often accused of hosting and supporting the Taliban, who have been fighting the Afghanistan government for about the last two decades, and has always rejected allegations levelled by Afghan leaders that the Taliban use Pakistani soil to direct and sustain insurgent activities in Afghanistan.Also read | Pakistan providing pension to terrorists, must be held accountable: IndiaEarlier this month, Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi denied the presence of Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US aviation regulator, has pushed the tentative date for certification back to "mid to late 2023", noting that two more years from now are needed for additional testing and safety checks. The American manufacturer of airplanes has faced heavy critique in recent years after the lengthy grounding of its infamous 737 MAX series following two fatal crashes.Boeing, it seems, can't escape the legal scrutiny that it has been subjected to following the unfortunate accidents, and neither is the FAA willing to let the company have a free pass -- both of them were hounded by the legislators at the Capitol Hill over the question of aviation safety.The FAA has sent a letter to Boeing informing the aviation giant that the 777x jet requires a "root cause" investigation following an "uncommanded pitch" event on December 8, in which the airplane performed unexpectedly, news agency AFP reported. Ian Won, an acting manager in the FAA's aircraft certification service, said that Boeing is expected to undergo comprehensive validation, verification reviews and must also document the process improvements and the lessons learned. All of these measures will "realistically" push the expected timeframe of certification at least by two more years, he said.Boeing's newest 777x series and the popular 737 Next Generation (NG) airplanes are both going to undergo reevaluation, with the later models having already finalised a set of three safety enhancements to prevent debris from escaping in case of a failure.There have been several recent episodes in which debris broke loose from the engine inlets. A chunk of metal flew off a Southwest Airlines Co. engine over Pennsylvania on April 17, 2018, killing a woman who was seated where the metal hit a window. Following this incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), had also recommended improvements in the engine designs on how to strengthen the smooth curved surface at the front of the engine that guides air into the turbine.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-asked-to-undergo-more-safety-checks-no-certification-for-777x-just-yet-101624923827677.html
29-06-2021||World||EU’s ‘green pass’ for Covishield: What is the document all about||India will take up the issue of approval of the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with the European Union during discussions between Indian and EU officials on the margins of the G20 meeting in Italy on Tuesday. Those vaccinated with Covishield, the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine being manufactured in India by SII, are not eligible for the EU Digital Covid certificate or “green pass”. It is an immunity document to ease travel within and to the 27-member bloc. It will be in place by July 1.Comirnaty of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca’s Vaxzervria and Janssen by Johnson & Johnson are the only four Covid-19 vaccines approved by EMA, which have received EU-wide marketing authorisation. Covishield is also a version of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine and is being manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India.Also read | Covishield’s green pass approval by EMA to be discussed on G20 sidelinesSerum Institute of India’s chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said on Monday he has taken up the matter “at the highest level” to ensure Indians don’t face any travel restrictions. “I realise that a lot of Indians who have taken Covishield are facing issues with travel to the EU. I assure everyone, I have taken this up at the highest levels and hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries,” Poonawalla tweeted.The Serum Institute of India is approaching the EMA for approval of its Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, for the European Union’s Green Pass.What is the EU Digital Covid Certificate?An EU Digital Covid Certificate is digital proof that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, received a negative test result or recovered from Covid-19. The certificate is both in digital and paper format, comes with a QR code is free of charge, is in the national language and English, is safe and secure and valid in all EU countries.How can one get the certificate?National authorities are in charge of issuing the certificate, for example, it could be issued by test centres or health authorities or directly via an eHealth portal. The digital version can be stored on a mobile device and at the same people can also request a paper version. Both versions will have a QR code with essential information and a digital signature to make sure the certificate is authentic.How will it help free movement?The EU Digital Covid Certificate will be accepted in all member states of the EU and will help ensure that restrictions currently in place can be lifted in a coordinated manner. The EU Digital Covid Certificate holder should in principle be exempted from free movement restrictions when travelling and member states should refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on them. Also read | Covishield excluded from new EU Covid 'Green Pass' eligibility listThey can stop holder from travelling if it is necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health. In such a case – for instance as a reaction to new variants of concern – that member state would have to notify the Commission and all other member states and justify its decision.Also watch | Travel hurdle over made-in-India vaccine: What SII CEO said on Covishield-EU row How will the certificate work?The EU Digital Covid Certificate contains a QR code with a digital signature to protect it against falsification. When the certificate is checked, the QR code is scanned and the signature verified. Each issuing body (e.g. a hospital, a test centre, a health authority) has its own digital signature key. All of these are stored in a secure database in each country.The European Commission has built a gateway through which all certificate signatures can be verified across the EU. The personal data of the certificate holder does not pass through the gateway, as this is not necessary to verify the digital signature. The European Commission also helped member states to develop national software and apps to issue, store and verify certificates and supported them in the necessary tests to onboard the gateway. Can unvaccinated people travel to another EU country?Yes. The EU Digital Covid Certificate should facilitate free movement inside the EU. It will not be a pre-condition to free movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU.The EU Digital Covid Certificate will also prove the results of testing, which is often required under applicable public health restrictions. The certificate is an opportunity for member states to adjust the existing restrictions on public health grounds. The currently applicable recommendation on coordinating free movement restrictions in the EU will also be amended by mid-June with a view to the holiday season.Does the vaccine matter? Vaccination certificates will be issued to a vaccinated person for any Covid-19 vaccine. Member states will have to accept vaccination certificates for vaccines, which received EU marketing authorisation, when it comes to waiving free movement restrictions. They may decide to extend this to EU travellers who received another vaccine as well. Member states can also decide whether they accept a vaccination certificate after one dose or after a full vaccination cycle has been completed.What data does the certificate include?The EU Digital Covid Certificate contains necessary key information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine/ test/recovery and a unique identifier. This data remains on the certificate and is not stored or retained when a certificate is verified in another member state. The certificates will only include a limited set of information that is necessary. This cannot be retained by visited countries. For verification purposes, only the validity and authenticity of the certificate is checked by verifying who issued and signed it. All health data remains with the Member State that issued an EU Digital Covid Certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-green-pass-for-covishield-what-is-the-document-all-about-101624923539169.html
29-06-2021||World||Covid pass to come into force amid fears of Delta variant||An EU-wide Covid-19 certificate for easier travel will come into force on Thursday, just in time for Europe’s busy summer vacation period, but the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus is threatening to curtail its use.The EU document - sporting a QR code and available in digital form on smartphones or hard copy - shows whether the bearer is vaccinated with one of the EU’s approved jabs (from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson), has recovered from a Covid-19 infection, or has a recent negative test.Under an EU law adopted this month, the certificate does away with the need for quarantines or further testing when travelling between the EU’s 27 countries or four associated European nations: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.Twenty EU countries have already started issuing and accepting it. But a surge in the Delta variant, now rampant in the UK, could trigger an “emergency brake” provision suspending its acceptance.Portugal and Spain on Monday announced entry restrictions for travellers from Britain, with Lisbon requiring them to be fully vaccinated and Madrid demanding proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test.Earlier, Britain’s senior military commanders were self-isolating after chief of defence staff Nick Carter tested positive for Covid-19.In Australia, new cases popped up in various cities on Monday, prompting local authorities to impose restrictions. Brisbane, Darwin, Perth and Sydney have all reported new cases of the Delta variant.In Luxembourg, PM Xavier Bettel has tested positive for Covid-19 with mild symptoms and is self-isolating for 10 days.Italians were able to go outside without masks on Monday after the whole country became a “low-risk” zone, a milestone for the country hit badly by the pandemic in 2020. In a decree, the health ministry for the first time said masks were not compulsory in outdoor areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-pass-to-come-into-force-amid-fears-of-delta-variant-101624922392943.html
29-06-2021||World||Donald Trump’s business empire targeted||New York prosecutors have told lawyers for former US president Donald Trump they must respond by Monday with any last arguments as to why criminal charges should not be filed against his family business, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.The Post, citing two people familiar with the matter, said the deadline was another strong signal that Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance and New York attorney general Letitia James are considering criminal charges against the company as an entity.On Friday, The New York Times reported Vance could announce charges against Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, likely next week.Vance’s office said it was investigating “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.Meanwhile, Trump’s attorney general Bill Barr told him a month after the 2020 election that allegations of voter fraud were groundless, but he rejected that, the Atlantic magazine reported. “We realised from the beginning it was just bullshit,” Barr told Jonathan Karl, an ABC News reporter who will publish a book on Trump’s last days in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-business-empire-targeted-101624922350881.html
29-06-2021||World||Brazil senators file case against President Jair Bolsonaro for malfeasance||Three Brazilian senators formally accused President Jair Bolsonaro of malfeasance before the Supreme Court Monday over allegations he failed to have a top ally investigated for suspicions of massive corruption in the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.The criminal complaint comes after a Senate commission investigating the administration's pandemic response uncovered explosive accusations last week that Bolsonaro knew about suspected corruption in Brazil's $300 million deal for Indian-made vaccine Covaxin and failed to intervene."I filed a criminal complaint today with the Supreme Court because of the serious accusation that the president took no action after being notified of a gigantic corruption scheme at the health ministry," said opposition Senator Randolfe Rodrigues, the commission's deputy chair.A criminal case against Bolsonaro before the Supreme Court could see him removed from office -- though Prosecutor General Augusto Aras, an ally, would have to bring charges.More immediately, the case risks damaging Bolsonaro politically at a time when his support is dwindling and polls place him far behind leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva heading into elections next year.Massive overbillingThe allegations emerged when a Singapore-based firm now suspected of being a shell company billed the Brazilian health ministry $45 million for yet-to-be-delivered doses of Covaxin, which did not have regulatory approval in Brazil.That raised red flags for a health ministry official named Luis Ricardo Miranda.He refused to sign off on the advance payment, given that Brazil's contract for Covaxin did not mention any firm in Singapore and said payment was to be made on delivery.Miranda told the Senate inquiry his superiors at the ministry exerted "atypical, excessive" pressure on him to approve the transaction.He took his concerns to his brother, Luis Miranda, a congressman and Bolsonaro supporter, who arranged a meeting for them with the president.Congressman Miranda testified Friday that Bolsonaro told them at the March 20 meeting he suspected the Covaxin deal was a corrupt scheme set up by Ricardo Barros, a powerful lawmaker who is head of Bolsonaro's coalition in the lower house.Congressman Miranda said Bolsonaro told him he would order the police to investigate, but never did.Other irregularities in Brazil's Covaxin deal soon emerged, forcing the administration to cancel it under pressure.According to newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo, the vaccine's manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, initially quoted a price of $1.34 a dose.But Brazil agreed to pay $15 a dose, more than for any other vaccine it purchased.Pro-impeachment protestsThe scandal could mark a turning point in the Senate investigation, which has already been damaging for Bolsonaro.For two months, a parade of witnesses have testified how the far-right leader and his government blatantly flouted expert advice on containing Covid-19, which has now claimed more than half a million lives in Brazil, second only to the United States.Bolsonaro minimized the virus as a "little flu," fought lockdowns, questioned face masks and rejected various offers of vaccines -- including shots that were cheaper and more effective than Covaxin -- meanwhile pushing unproven drugs such as chloroquine and urging Brazilians to get back to work.Now, however, he faces accusations his pandemic response has been not only inept, but criminal.Opposition leaders have called mass protests for Wednesday and Friday demanding Bolsonaro's impeachment.The polarizing president already faces more than 100 impeachment requests in Congress, but has been shielded so far by his alliance with the powerful "Centrao," a loose coalition of conservative parties.Barros, the congressman now suspected of masterminding the Covaxin deal, is a top figure in that coalition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-senators-file-case-against-president-jair-bolsonaro-for-malfeasance-101624917307648.html
29-06-2021||World||Abu Dhabi to only allow people vaccinated against Covid-19 in some public places||Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates, has announced that a wide range of public places will soon be accessible only to those vaccinated against the coronavirus in a bid to encourage more people to get shots.The Emirati government on Monday said that starting August 20, authorities will begin restricting access to shopping malls, restaurants, cafes, sporting activities, museums, gyms, schools and universities. The unvaccinated will effectively be barred from entering any business in the city except for supermarkets and pharmacies.Abu Dhabi has already rolled out a “green pass” system that limits public access to those who have either received the shot or can show a negative virus test.It comes as the country increasingly bets its economic reopening on its speedy vaccination campaign. The government says at least 93% of Abu Dhabi's population has received at least one dose of the vaccine.The neighbouring travel hub of Dubai, home to long-haul carrier Emirates, also has introduced some vaccination restrictions on mass entertainment and sporting events. However, malls and other businesses remain open to the unvaccinated.The UAE boasts one of the world's fastest inoculation campaigns, with 15.1 million doses administered to its population of some 9 million. The country has relied heavily on the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abu-dhabi-to-only-allow-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19-in-some-public-places-101624912383853.html

29-06-2021||World||Tropical Storm Danny forms off South Carolina, nearing land||Tropical Storm Danny formed Monday afternoon off South Carolina's coast, and forecasters said the storm is expected to race inland over the US Southeast while dumping several inches of rain in some spots.The fourth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season formed close to South Carolina's coast and had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) with higher guests.Tropical storm force winds were already being felt in South Carolina on Monday afternoon. A weather station at Folly Beach — just outside Charleston — recorded a wind gust of 41 mph (66 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.At 3 p.m., the storm was about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southeast of Charleston, the hurricane center said.The storm was headed to the west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph) and was expected to dump several inches of rain on some parts of South Carolina and Georgia during its trek inland.Danny emerged from a tropical depression off the coast, and forecasters said rapid weakening is expected after landfall.A tropical storm warning was posted earlier Monday for a swath of the Southeast coast from Edisto Beach to South Santee River, South Carolina.The storm could produce between 1 and 3 inches (3 to 8 centimeters) of rain with higher amounts in some coastal areas.In Savannah, Georgia, all systems were go for Tuesday night’s Savannah Bananas home baseball game as organizers eyed the storm. Officials for the collegiate summer league team planned to cover the field with tarp on Monday in preparation for the game.“For us, being on the coast and being in Savannah, we get some nasty pop-up storms that can dump an inch of rain in just a few hours,” Bananas President Jared Orton said Monday. “This one doesn’t look like much more than just a nice, passing day of rain. I think we’re good to go as long as the sun comes out tomorrow and it should be a beautiful night in Savannah, I would think.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-danny-forms-off-south-carolina-nearing-land-101624909494821.html
29-06-2021||World||UK health secretary Sajid Javid says confident of removing Covid-19 restrictions by July 19||Britain's new health secretary said Monday he is confident that England is on track to remove the country's remaining coronavirus restrictions on July 19, stressing that the rapid vaccination rollout is “breaking the link” between soaring infection numbers and serious illnesses and deaths.Sajid Javid told Parliament that all the figures he's seen suggested that the country is “heading in the right direction,” and said that “the restrictions on our freedoms must come to an end.”His confident tone came despite widespread concerns about a third surge in infections in the UK driven by the spread of the more contagious delta variant. Government figures on Monday showed another big spike in infections, with 22,868 confirmed cases.That's the highest daily figure since late January, though the number was likely inflated by the fact that the previous day's figure of 14,876 was artificially low because of incomplete data for England."No date we choose comes with zero risk for COVID — we know we cannot simply eliminate it, we have to learn to live with it,” Javid said. “People and businesses need certainty, so we want every step to be irreversible."Javid was named health secretary Saturday after his predecessor, Matt Hancock, stepped down following revelations that he was having an affair with an old friend he had hired as an adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care.Hancock was forced to step down amid outrage that he had broken social distancing rules by kissing his adviser in his office.Critics saw Hancock's exit as the latest example of cronyism and hypocrisy at the heart of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government, which has been accused multiple times of not practising what it preaches throughout the pandemic.Though the number of people in hospitals and dying have been edging up over the past couple of weeks, they haven't risen at the same rate as infections. A large proportion of infections were reported among younger people.On Monday, another three virus-related deaths were reported, taking the UK's total to 128,103. Throughout the pandemic, death figures on Monday have traditionally been lower because of weekend reporting lags.Still, many virus experts and National Health Service officials urged the government not to speed up the timetable, saying they need time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid the rapid spread of the highly infectious delta variant, first discovered in India.“It's so important that we get the vaccination rates as high as we can before there's any consideration of easing the current restrictions, which are not really holding the outbreak,” Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, told Sky News.The speed of the UK's vaccination rollout has been widely praised. As of Monday, around two-thirds of the British population had received one dose of vaccine, while nearly 50% has had two.Johnson disappointed some members of his Conservative Party earlier this month when he extended the COVID-19 restrictions until July 19, saying it was “sensible” to provide more time for people to be vaccinated.The Hancock scandal fuelled anger over the continued restrictions after the Sun published photos of the health secretary kissing his adviser, Gina Coladangelo, on May 6. At the time, people were barred from meeting indoors with people from outside their household, except when it was necessary for work, and were supposed to stay apart.Coladangelo, a friend of Hancock's since university days, was appointed to the Health Department's board of directors in September, a role that pays 15,000 pounds ($20,800) a year.As the chief enforcer of the government's coronavirus measures, Hancock's position became untenable when he was seen to have violated the rules.“Those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them, and that's why I've got to resign,” Hancock said in a video posted on Twitter.Public trust in Johnson's government has also been eroded after allegations that officials handed contracts for personal protective equipment and other supplies to friends and party donors during the early days of the pandemic.In November, Johnson said he had “full confidence” in Home Secretary Priti Patel, even after his own ethics adviser found that she had violated the rules governing ministerial conduct.Johnson was caught up in his own ethics scandal in April, when newspapers reported that he had failed to disclose that wealthy supporters had donated 58,000 pounds to cover the cost of redecorating his official residence. An ethics adviser cleared Johnson of breaking the law, but said he should have been “more rigorous” in finding out who was funding the project.Ian Murray of the Labour Party said Hancock's affair was just “the tip of the iceberg.”“There are huge problems in this government in terms of its secrecy and in terms of the way operates,” Murray told the BBC.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland defended Johnson's handling of the Hancock situation and said “due process” had been followed in Coladangelo's appointment as an adviser.“The truth is a lot of people just don't like the PM,” he told the BBC. “They can't get over the fact he's popular.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-secretary-sajid-javid-says-confident-of-removing-covid-19-restrictions-by-july-19-101624905899269.html
29-06-2021||World||Ethiopia declares immediate, unilateral cease-fire in Tigray||Ethiopia’s government on Monday declared an immediate, unilateral cease-fire in its Tigray region after nearly eight months of deadly conflict and as hundreds of thousands of people face the world’s worst famine crisis in a decade.The cease-fire could calm a war that has destabilized Africa's second most populous country and threatened to do the same in the wider Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia has been seen as a key security ally for the West. It comes as the country awaits the results of national elections that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed promoted as the centerpiece of reforms that won him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.Abiy's transformation from making peace to waging war has appalled many observers since the fighting in Tigray erupted in November. Since then, the world has struggled to access much of the region and investigate growing allegations of atrocities including gang rapes and forced starvation.Ethiopia's statement was carried by state media shortly after the Tigray interim administration, appointed by the federal government, fled the regional capital, Mekele, and called for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds so that desperately needed aid can be delivered. Meanwhile, Mekele residents cheered the arrival of Tigray forces.The cease-fire “will enable farmers to till their land, aid groups to operate without any military movement around and engage with remnants (of Tigray's former ruling party) who seek peace,” Ethiopia's statement said, adding that efforts to bring Tigray's former leaders to justice continue.Ethiopia said the cease-fire will last until the end of the crucial planting season in Tigray. The season’s end comes in September. The government ordered all federal and regional authorities to respect the cease-fire — crucial as authorities and fighters from the neighboring Amhara region have been accused of atrocities in western Tigray.“The government has the responsibility to find a political solution to the problem,” the head of the interim administration, Abraham Belay, said in calling for the cease-fire, adding that some elements within Tigray’s former ruling party are willing to engage with the federal government.There was no immediate comment from the Tigray fighters, with whom Ethiopia had rejected talks. And there was no immediate comment from neighboring Eritrea, whose soldiers have been accused by Tigray residents of some of the worst atrocities in the war.Thousands of people have been killed in the conflict as Ethiopian and allied forces pursue Tigray’s former leaders and their supporters, and as humanitarian groups plead for more access to the region of 6 million people.The region in recent days has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict. International pressure on Ethiopia spiked again last week after a military airstrike on a busy market in Tigray killed more than 60 people.Amid the upheaval on Monday, the United Nations children’s agency said Ethiopian soldiers entered its office in Mekele and dismantled satellite communications equipment, an act it said violated the world body’s immunity. UNICEF last week warned that at least 33,000 severely malnourished children face “imminent risk of death” without more aid reaching Tigray’s people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-declares-immediate-unilateral-cease-fire-in-tigray-101624905923317.html
