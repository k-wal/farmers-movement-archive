None of us got whatever we all wanted. I clearly didn’t get all I wanted. They gave more than, I think, maybe they were inclined to give in the first place. But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up in the United States Congress. We actually worked.”In a tweet, he added, “We’ve struck a deal. A group of senators - five Democrats and five Republicans - has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.”The deal was worked at back-to-back meetings between White House officials and senators, with the key difference being on how to pay for the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-senators-strike-deal-on-1-2-trillion-infra-bill-101624556691365.html
24-06-2021||World||'We have deal': Biden gives green light to bipartisan infrastructure plan||President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that “we have a deal,” signaling a bipartisan agreement on a $953 billion infrastructure plan that would achieve his top legislative priority and validate his efforts to reach across the political aisle.Biden made a surprise appearance in front of the cameras with members of the group of senators, Republicans and Democrats, after an agreement was reached Thursday. Details of the deal were scarce to start, but the pared-down plan, with $559 billion in new spending, has rare bipartisan backing and could open the door to the president’s more sweeping $4 trillion proposals later on.The president said not everyone got what they wanted and that other White House priorities would be done separately in a congressional budget process known as reconciliation“We’ve struck a deal,” Biden then tweeted. “A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.”We’ve struck a deal. A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.The senators have struggled over how to pay for the new spending but left for the White House with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed.Biden’s top aides had met with senators for back-to-back meetings on Capitol Hill and later huddled with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Also Read | Hunter Biden’s escapade with escort woman cost Joe Biden over ₹18 lakh: ReportThe agreement comes with a complex legislative push. Pelosi on Thursday welcomed the bipartisan package, but she warned that it must be paired with the president’s bigger goals now being prepared by Congress under a separate so-called the budget reconciliation process.“This is important,” Pelosi said. “There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,”The Democratic leader vowed the House would not vote on it until the Senate had dealt with both packages.The major hurdle for a bipartisan agreement has been financing. Biden demanded no new taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, while Republican lawmakers were unwilling to raise taxes beyond such steps as indexing the gasoline tax to inflation. But senators departed for the White House Thursday with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed.“We’re still refining the details, but from my perspective, it is paid for," said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican and one of 10 lawmakers who met with Biden for roughly 30 minutes.Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he was confident the agreement had Biden's backing.“We wouldn’t be going there if he wasn’t supportive of the deal,” said Cassidy, adding that the president ”wants to make it flourish.One member of the bipartisan group, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, met privately ahead of the White House meeting with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol and said afterward that the Kentucky senator “remains open-minded and he’s listening still.”Biden has sought $1.7 trillion in his American Jobs Plan, part of nearly $4 trillion in broad infrastructure spending on roads, bridges and broadband internet but also including the so-called care economy of child care centers, hospitals and elder care.With Republicans opposed to Biden’s proposed corporate tax rate increase, from 21% to 28%, the group has looked at other ways to raise revenue. Biden rejected their idea to allow gas taxes paid at the pump to rise with inflation, viewing it as a financial burden on American drivers.The broad reconciliation bill would likely include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, so a tension still exists over funding for some Republicans and business groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out Thursday applauding the bipartisan infrastructure agreement, but Neil Bradley, its executive vice president, warned that “some in Congress are trying to torpedo the deal” unless they get trillions in additional spending.“These are the kind of tactics that have created the mess we are in today, and they must be rejected,” Bradley said.According to a White House readout of the Wednesday meeting with Schumer and Pelosi, the leaders talked with acting Budget Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, and they discussed the two-track approach — the smaller bipartisan deal now emerging and the more sweeping plan of Democratic priorities.Schumer said the leaders “support the concepts” they have heard from the bipartisan negotiations.The Democratic leaders also insisted on the two-part process ahead, starting with initial votes in July to consider the bipartisan deal and to launch the lengthy procedure for the Democrats' proposal, now drafted at nearly $6 trillion.The Democrats' bigger proposal would run through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow passage of Biden's priorities by majority vote, without the need for support from Republicans to overcome the Senate's 60-vote threshold. It would require multiple rounds of voting that are likely to extend into fall.Like Pelosi, Schumer said, “One can’t be done without the other.”That's a signal to both parties of the road ahead. Liberal Democrats have been wary of the bipartisan effort because they see it as insufficient and worry it will take the place of Biden's bigger plan. Republicans are also skeptical of passing a bipartisan bill only to be faced with an even bigger Democratic plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-deal-biden-gives-green-light-to-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-101624555443173.html
24-06-2021||World||Astronomers find out when first stars shone, could be seen by Nasa’s Webb telescope||Astronomers have calculated the period when the universe was first bathed in starlight, known as the “cosmic dawn”. According to a new study, the first stars started shining as early as 150 to 250 million years after the big bang, when dark matter haloes were sufficiently massive to induce star formation.The astronomers analysed six of the most distant galaxies and worked out their age to calculate the start of cosmic dawn. The study, led by Dr Nicolas Laporte, from the Kavli Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, was published on Thursday in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.“The Holy Grail has been to look back far enough that you would be able to see the very first generation of stars and galaxies. And now we have the first convincing evidence of when the Universe was first bathed in starlight," BBC News quoted Richard Ellis, co-author of the study, as saying.According to the BBC report, the results suggest that the first galaxies will be bright enough to be seen by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope, the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope targeted for October 31 launch.Also Read | Mystery of ‘see-through’ galaxy deepens after new Hubble observation: NasaA team of scientists will train Webb on six of the most distant and luminous quasars, the active supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. A quasar’s light outshines that of all the stars in its host galaxy combined, and its jets and winds shape the galaxy in which it resides.The Webb telescope will actually look back in time as light from these distant quasars began its journey to Webb when the universe was very young and took billions of years to arrive. The team will study the properties of these quasars and their host galaxies, and how they are interconnected during the first stages of galaxy evolution in the very early universe.“So these observations give us the opportunity to study galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation and evolution at these very early times,” team member Santiago Arribas explained, as per the statement published by Nasa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronomers-find-out-when-first-stars-shone-could-be-seen-by-nasa-s-webb-telescope-101624552700891.html

Our vaccines do not come with strings attached. We are doing this with the singular objective of saving lives," said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-send-3-million-johnson-johnson-one-shot-covid-19-vaccine-to-brazil-101624549994474.html
24-06-2021||World||51 people unaccounted for in Florida building collapse, say officials||Hundreds of fire and rescue workers scoured through tons of rubble on Thursday after a 12-story oceanfront residential building partially collapsed in southern Florida, with at least one person dead and 51 still unaccounted for, officials said.Sally Heyman, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, said officials have been unable to make contact with 51 people who "supposedly" live in the building, home to a mix of people including families and part-time "snow birds" who spend the winter months in Florida."We have 51 people that were assumed to have been there, but you don't know between vacations or anything else, so we're still waiting," Heyman told CNN by phone. "The hope is still there, but it's waning."A fire official said 35 people were rescued from the building in Surfside, a seaside enclave of 5,700 residents on a barrier island across Biscayne Bay from the city of Miami, including two who were pulled from the rubble as response teams used trained dogs and drones in a search for survivors.After speaking with local officials, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said it was possible that more victims could be found in the rubble. He said he planned to go to scene."We'll hope for the best in terms of additional recoveries, but we are bracing for some bad news, just given the destruction that we’re seeing," DeSantis said at an event at a community college near Tampa.Built in 1981, the Champlain Towers South had more than 130 units, about 80 of which were occupied.It was unclear how many people were inside at 1:30 a.m. (0530 GMT), when an entire side of the building pulled away and fell to the ground below."It's hard to imagine how this could have happened," Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told reporters. "Buildings just don't fall down."Construction work was being done on the roof, he said, but it was unclear whether the project involved any heavy gear.Footage from WPLG Local 10, a Miami TV station, showed a rescue team pulling a boy from piles of debris and rebar, and firefighters using ladder trucks to rescue residents trapped on balconies.Assistant Fire Chief of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Raide Jadallah said that rescuers were moving in "heavy equipment" and working to support the remaining structure of the building."We are still continuing the search and rescue operations," Jadallah said.Burkett said that part of the building with balconies facing the beach "pancaked" where one floor appears to have fallen atop another, cascading down."The back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked," he said.Resident Barry Cohen and his wife were rescued from the building."At first it sounded like a flash of lightning or thunder," Cohen, a former vice mayor of Surfside and a resident of the building, told reporters at the scene. "But then it just kept on -- steadily for at least 15 to 30 seconds -- it just kept on going and going and going."Cohen also said there had been construction for more than a month on the building's roof.The Miami-Dade Police have assumed control of the investigation. More than 80 fire and rescue units responded, the Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue Department wrote in a Twitter message early Thursday.Eyewitness video obtained by Reuters showed neighbors gathering across the street from the rubble."This whole building here, it's completely gone," a person can be heard saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/51-people-unaccounted-for-in-florida-building-collapse-say-officials-101624548531545.html
24-06-2021||World||WHO estimates most vulnerable to Covid-19 would require annual vaccine boosters||The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to Covid-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO's Covid-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.Vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its "indicative" baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document while Gavi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The document, which is dated June 8 and is still "work in progress", also predicts under the base case that 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signalling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and "transition away from some technology platforms" as potential drags on supplies next year.It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world's largest volume of Covid-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.Worst-case scenarioThe scenarios will be used to define the WHO's global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerge on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi's estimates.This gap could widen next year under the WHO's most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could push once again poorer nations to the back of the queue.In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-estimates-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-would-require-annual-vaccine-boosters-101624546684129.html

In an interview with CNN, Wu said that the government of Taiwan cannot take any chances, given China’s unwillingness to renounce the use of force and frequent military exercises around the island.The warning comes a week after the island reported the largest daily incursion by the Chinese air force as they entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The incursion involved 14 J-16 and six J-11 fighters, as well as four H-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft, as per Taiwan’s defence ministry.The latest incursion is the largest since the defence ministry began regularly reporting PLA activities in Taiwan's ADIZ last year. The previous record was of 25 aircraft reported on April 12, 2021. In the past, China has described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and to deal with "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States."As Taiwan decision makers, we cannot take any chances, we have to be prepared," Wu told CNN in Taipei. "When the Chinese government is saying they would not renounce the use of force, and they conduct military exercises around Taiwan, we would rather believe that it is real.”Also Read | Taiwan condemns political oppression after closure of Hong Kong dailyBeijing has been pushing for “peaceful reunification” of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems”, which has threatened Taiwan’s claim of sovereignty. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-Wen has long maintained that the self-governed island can not accept China’s “one country, two systems” policy which undermines the “cross-strait status quo.”Wu said that China’s attempt to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy using draconian security law has shown that Taiwan’s sovereignty is crucial to protect the world’s only Chinese speaking democracy. "If you look at the situation in Hong Kong, it is a modern tragedy," Wu said.The Group of Seven richest democracies, or G7, recently issued a joint communique underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-needs-to-prepare-for-military-conflict-with-china-says-foreign-minister-wu-101624543961154.html
24-06-2021||World||China carries out military drill in Tibet||China’s armed forces recently took part in a “record-breaking” high-altitude drill in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) focusing on combat training, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday.Organised by the Tibet Military Region, the training simulated battle situations that required integrated operations or joint training between different units of the troops deployed in the region.The ministry added that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has carried out more than 100 tactical exercises this year in which the quantity of ammunition had significantly increased.The Tibet Military Region is part of PLA’s Western Theatre Command (WTC), China’s largest command, which oversees the long and disputed border with India.The ministry did not say where in the TAR, which borders India, Nepal and Bhutan, the large-scale training took place but said the intensive training was held in altitudes over 3,700m.The drill took place in the backdrop of the ongoing military friction between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Answering a question, the defence ministry spokesperson Colonel Ren Guoqiang said the exercise “Peak of the Snowy Region 2021” was a record-breaking mass training event for the PLA.The drills focused on three aspects: Actual combat training, training with science and technology and training soldiers according to the traits required to fight on high-altitude plateau.The activities were carried out on 23 subjects related to high-altitude battles, which included comprehensive operations by combat and sniper teams, field repair and rescue.The drills were carried out under unfamiliar geographical conditions around the clock, the spokesperson said.Earlier this year, the Tibet Military Region held a rare multi-dimensional exercise amid the ongoing New Delhi-Beijing dispute.The exercise involved ground assault forces as well as PLA’s aviation unit, which deployed attack helicopters, China’s official military media reported.The report published in the PLA Daily said a multi-dimensional exercise was being held to improve combat capabilities. “A composite brigade of the Tibet military region joined hands with the Army Aviation Force to launch a three-dimensional assault, starting a normalised joint exercise and training.”Spokesperson Ren said China has been focusing on combat-level drills through 2021.Answering a related question on PLA’s training this year, Ren said the armed forces had taken part in at least 100 tactical joint training exercises and that the use of ammunition had “significantly” increased.Ren added that all the theatre commands launched real-world mission exercises, continued to focus on the periodic rotation of combat readiness missions for trial troop training and deepened cross-domain and cross-service arms joint special training.President Xi Jinping, in 2021’s first order issued in January to the PLA, had focused on the need for “full-time combat readiness” and said the armed forces must use frontline conflicts to polish troop capabilities.Xi said the PLA must be ready to “act at any second”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-carries-out-military-drill-in-tibet-101624544749959.html

Cowessess and the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN), which represents Saskatchewan's First Nations, said in a statement that the number of newly found unmarked graves was "the most significantly substantial to date in Canada."The unmarked graves were found at the former Marieval Indian Residential School, in Saskatchewan, which operated from 1899 to 1997 about 140 kilometres east of Regina. In the 1970s, the First Nation took over the school's cemetery from the Catholic Church, which ran most of the schools. While the group didn’t reveal specific numbers, it said it would announce at a news conference on Thursday morning "the horrific and shocking discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School."The reports reveal Canada’s legacy of an abusive and assimilationist system under which the country's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 indigenous children from their families between 1831 and 1996. The Marieval residential school hosted indigenous children between 1899 and 1997 before it was demolished and replaced by a day school.Also Read | Canada minister says lack of papal apology in indigenous school abuse 'shameful'Many indigenous children were subjected to ill-treatment and sexual abuse, and more than 4,000 died in the schools, according to Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission which called the system "cultural genocide" in its report.Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the news was "absolutely tragic, but not surprising. I urge all Canadians to stand with First Nations in this extremely difficult and emotional time."While Canada's federal government apologised for the system in 2008, the Roman Catholic Church, which ran most of the schools, has not apologised.Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he was pained by the news, a statement dismissed by survivors.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrific-hundreds-of-unmarked-graves-discovered-by-indigenous-group-in-canada-101624537595260.html
24-06-2021||World||China deleted Covid data ‘gold mine’ in possible cover-up: Study||China deleted early data on novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 in a possible attempt to conceal its existence and, therefore, impeding the investigation into its origins, a researcher has claimed in a new study. According to a scientific paper, over a dozen coronavirus test sequences that were taken during the early months of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic were removed from an international database used to track the virus' evolution."The fact that such an informative data set was deleted has implications beyond those gleaned directly from the recovered sequences. Samples from early outpatients in Wuhan are a gold mine for anyone seeking to understand the spread of the virus," the author said.Jesse Bloom, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said in the report that he identified a data set containing Sars-CoV-2 sequences that had been deleted from the National Institutes of Health's Sequence Read Archive. For the study, Bloom recovered the deleted files from the Google Cloud and reconstructed partial sequences of 13 viruses from the initial outbreak.Also Read | What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probeThe report suggests that the sequences from Huanan Seafood Market that were the focus of the joint report prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and China are not “fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic.” According to Bloom's research, Sars-Cov-2 was circulating in Wuhan before it was detected at local wet markets, including the Huanan Seafood Market.“There is no plausible scientific reason for the deletion...It therefore seems likely the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence,” the report said.“Particularly in light of the directive that labs destroy early samples...and multiple orders requiring approval of publications on [Covid-19], this suggests a less than wholehearted effort to trace early spread of the epidemic,” it added.The report titled ‘Recovery of Deleted Deep Sequencing Data Sheds More Light on the Early Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic’ has not been peer-reviewed yet and is available on a pre-print server.In a statement on Wednesday, NIH confirmed that some of the earliest samples of coronavirus in China were removed from the international database where they were initially stored at the request of Chinese researchers. The researcher asked that the data be removed “to avoid version control issues”, saying the sequence information had been updated and was being submitted to another database, according to the US agency.“Submitting investigators hold the rights to their data and can request withdrawal of the data,” the agency said. “NIH can’t speculate on motive beyond the investigator’s stated intentions.”The mystery around the source of Covid-19 has further intensified after a series of revelations gave the lab-leak theory a fillip. Last week, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said China will face 'isolation in the international community' if Beijing does not cooperate with a further probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deleted-covid-data-gold-mine-in-possible-cover-up-study-101624535964659.html
24-06-2021||World||UK man tested Covid positive for 10 straight months, hospitalised 7 times||A 72-year-old British man tested positive for coronavirus for 10 months in what is thought to be the longest recorded case of continuous infection, researchers said on Thursday.Dave Smith, a retired driving instructor from Bristol in western England, said he tested positive 43 times, was hospitalised seven times and had made plans for his funeral."I'd resigned myself, I'd called the family in, made my peace with everybody, said goodbye,", he told BBC television.His wife, Linda, who quarantined with him at home, said: "There was a lot of times when we didn't think he was going to pull through. It's been a hell of a year".Ed Moran, a consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, said Smith "had active virus in his body" throughout."We were able to prove that by sending a sample of his virus to university partners who managed to grow it, proving that it was not just left-over products that were triggering a PCR test but actually active, viable virus."Smith recovered after treatment with a cocktail of synthetic antibodies developed by the US biotech firm Regeneron.This was allowed on compassionate grounds in his case but the treatment regime is not clinically approved for use in Britain.Results of a clinical trial published this month showed the treatment reduced deaths among severe Covid patients who are unable to mount a strong immune response."It's like you've been given your life back", Smith told the BBC.He and his wife cracked open a bottle of champagne when he finally tested negative, 45 days after receiving the Regeneron drug and some 305 days after his first infection.Smith's treatment was not part of an official medical trial but his case is now being studied by virologist Andrew Davidson at the University of Bristol.A paper on his case will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in July, saying that his is thought to be "the longest infection recorded in the literature"."Where does the virus hide away in the body? How can it stay just persistently infecting people? We don't know that," Davidson said.Smith had a history of lung disease and had recently recovered from leukaemia when he caught the virus in March 2020.He told The Guardian daily that since his recovery, he still gets breathless but has travelled in Britain and is teaching his granddaughter to drive."I've been down to the bottom and everything's brilliant now," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-tested-covid-positive-for-10-straight-months-hospitalised-7-times-101624531352127.html
24-06-2021||World||'Spoke with Bill Gates last night': Imran Khan on Pakistan’s polio eradication programme||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday tweeted about his interaction with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates about the Gates Foundation’s support of Pakistan’s polio eradication programme. “Spoke with Bill Gates last night and thanked him for the help his Foundation provided for polio eradication in Pak,” Khan tweeted on Thursday.Khan mentioned that polio cases in Pakistan have come down drastically in one year after just one case was recorded as against the 56 cases recorded a year before. He also expressed his hopes of eradicating polio in the coming year.“This time last year we had 56 reported cases - this year so far only 1 case. InshaAllah we will eradicate polio completely in the coming year,” Khan said.The Gates Foundation in collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) supplies technical and financial resources for community-driven immunisation programs. The foundation also runs emergency operations centres in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Wild poliovirus currently impacts only two countries in the world-Afghanistan and Pakistan. In early June, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led government launched a nationwide drive to eradicate polio by the end of this year. However, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has hampered the drive’s reach to a considerable extent, according to UNICEF’s estimates.The eradication programme is also marred by frequent attacks on local healthcare workers. A few days after the launch of the national program gunmen on a motorcycle shot and killed two police officers assigned to protect polio vaccination workers in northwest Pakistan, reported the Associated Press.Khan also said that he asked Bill Gates’s if a Microsoft incubation lab could be set up in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spoke-with-bill-gates-last-night-imran-khan-on-pakistan-s-polio-eradication-programme-101624531254046.html
24-06-2021||World||Tibet’s 1st electric railway line near India border to be inaugurated on Friday||China is set to inaugurate its first electric train service in Tibet between capital Lhasa and Nyingchi city close to the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on Friday, a week before the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrates its 100th birthday on July 1.The inauguration of the new line marks a key milestone in Beijing’s long-term vision to build infrastructure in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and connect the remote border areas and Lhasa to interior China.The terminus of the railway line is likely to be close to the Bayi town area, near the border with India.With a speed of 160kmph, the railway service will be the fastest in Tibet.The 435km rail line passes through 47 tunnels and 120 bridges, according Tibet Railway Construction, a subsidiary company of China State Railway Group, which built it.Construction had started in 2014 on the railway line connecting Lhasa and Nyingchi in southeastern Tibet.Until the end of last year, 31.2 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) had been invested in the project, according to official data.A state media report said on Thursday the new railroad is an important part of the Sichuan-Tibet railway link under construction and a common line of the planned Yunnan-Tibet rail service. The Sichuan-Tibet railway is a major transport construction project of the 14th five-year plan that covers the period from 2021 to 2025.China has been rapidly developing infrastructure in Nyingchi, which like the rest of TAR is not accessible to foreign journalists and diplomats. The Chinese government is building the Sichuan-Tibet railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section, which will be 1,011km in length and include 26 stations when completed - taking the railway right up to the boundary with India.The state media report added that its completion and opening is a realisation of “everyone’s dream of ‘getting on a train to Nyingchi’, and it is of great significance to help rural revitalisation and promote the high-quality development of Tibet”.The city of Nyingchi already has a functional airport, which is said to be of dual use – civil and military.The Lhasa-Nyingchi highway, too, has been in operation for two years.The 409.2km highway cuts travel time between the two cities in TAR from eight hours to four hours.In May, China completed the construction of a strategically significant highway through the world’s deepest canyon in TAR on the Brahmaputra river (known as Yarlung Zangbo in China), connecting remote areas along the Arunachal border.It was the “second significant passageway” to Medog county that borders Arunachal, the Xinhua news agency reported in May, directly connecting the Pad township in Nyingchi to Baibung in Medog county.Earlier this year, China’s state planning organisation, the National Development and Reform Commission, said it will strengthen construction of railway projects, which are strategic for border defence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibets-1st-electric-railway-line-near-india-border-to-be-inaugurated-on-friday-101624520926137.html

It reads, "‘$WHACKD.’ In a related tweet, he wrote, “Getting subtle messages from U.S. officials saying, in effect: “We’re coming for you McAfee! We’re going to kill yourself”. I got a tattoo today just in case. If I suicide myself, I didn’t. I was whackd. Check my right arm.”McAfee was found dead on Wednesday in prison outside Barcelona. He was 75. He was discovered dead in his prison cell hours after Spain’s National Court approved his extradition to the US over multiple tax fraud charges.McAfee had been in Spanish custody since October on a June 2020 US indictment in which he was charged with failing to file four years of tax returns while concealing assets. Spain’s National Court had approved the extradition of detained antivirus software entrepreneur John McAfee to the United States, where he was wanted on tax-related criminal charges that carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona’s international airport.In March, he was indicted and accused of fraud and money laundering over his use of social media to promote cryptocurrencies, which prosecutors said generated $13 million in illicit gains for McAfee and a co-conspirator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-john-mcafee-s-death-his-old-tweet-with-whackd-tattoo-goes-viral-101624518085751.html

The terror attack claimed 329 lives. The flight used to operate on the Montreal to Delhi route via London.The terror attack is recognised in Canada as a National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “despicable act of terror remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canada’s history. Sadly, it was not the last time Canada had to confront the malice of terrorism”.Family members of the victims said Canada needed to remain “vigilant” about terrorism. Among them is Deepak Khandelwal, who was 17 when he lost his elder sisters, Chandra and Manju. “Canada has to learn from the past, from these types of mistakes,” he said, adding that he was painfully reminded of his sisters’ absence at this time particularly because of the pandemic as both were in the medical field. Susheel Gupta, who lost his mother Ramvati on the flight, visited a memorial in Ottawa. Such memorial services, he said, “advocate on behalf of victims of terrorism, and we feel a responsibility to remind people that terrorism has occurred here and could happen again”.Indian officials laid wreathes at memorials, with India’s high commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria doing so in Ottawa; consul generals in Toronto and Vancouver, Apoorva Srivastava and Manish, in their respective cities; and the representative of India to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Shefali Juneja, visiting the site in Montreal.Among the video services to be held were one by the Air India 182 Victims’ Families Association.The commemorative services took place under the shadow of a recent revival of the pro-Khalistan movement in Canada.Over the past few months, pro-Khalistan groups in Canada have been repeatedly voicing support for the ongoing protests in India against farming deregulation laws, with the aim of drawing attention towards their own movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/36-years-after-kanishka-bombing-canada-remembers-the-dead-with-commemorations-101624513606421.html

And we have seen a surge here too. So I am worried.”Dr Murthy said he is worried for those people who haven’t been administered the vaccine against the Covid-19 disease. Referring to studies from the United Kingdom, he added that if people are completely vaccinated, they are well protected against hospitalisations and deaths.“The worry is if you’re not vaccinated, that you’re at even greater risk than you were before. So, what I don’t want to see is a growing divide in our country between the unvaccinated and vaccinated. We’ve got to close that gap. That’s why we’re working so hard to get people vaccinated everywhere,” the top doctor said while responding to a question.The United States, which is currently the worst-hit from the pandemic, has so far inoculated nearly 56 per cent of its citizens with both doses of the vaccine and 65.4 per cent have received the first dose. The vaccination rate for children aged 12 years and above is 62.5 per cent and over 65 per cent are over 18 years.Dr Murthy pointed out the level of risk of getting infected with the variant depends on where people live and how high the vaccination rates are. “And this is why we always say - and I say this as a dad who’s got two young kids, three and four, whose -… we don’t have a vaccine available for kids that young. So, I’m worried about my kids, just like any other parents are,” he further told MSNBC news.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Delta variant has been reported in 85 countries so far and is continuing to be detected in more countries. “Delta, now reported in 85 countries globally, continues to be reported in new countries across all WHO Regions, 11 of which were newly reported in the past two weeks,” the WHO said in its weekly updated, adding this variant is more transmissible than Alpha variant and can become a dominant lineage if current trends continue.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-more-transmissible-says-us-top-surgeon-as-85-nations-report-cases-101624512027261.html

Though the number of cases is still high, and new variants are emerging every few weeks, the countries are learning to live with the disease. Many of them have chalked out a plan for the new normal and Singapore is one of them. "The bad news is that Covid-19 may never go away. The good news is that it is possible to live normally with it in our midst," Singapore's three ministers of a multi-ministry task force on coronavirus said on Thursday as they outlined the plan for the new normal.Focussing on vaccination against the virus, a roadmap is being drawn up to shift to this new normal and it will be done in tandem with achieving certain vaccination milestones, said the co-chairmen, minister for trade and industry Gan Kim Yong, minister for finance Lawrence Wong and minister for health Ong Ye Kung.Also read: Singapore shortens stay-home notice for travellers from higher-risk countriesThe ministers said that with enough vaccinated people, Covid-19 can be managed like other endemic diseases like common flu, hand, foot and mouth diseases in Singapore.Here's how the task force plans to shift to the new normal:The priority in the next few months will be to prepare the country for life with Covid as a recurring, controllable disease, the ministers were quoted as saying by The Straits Times, reported PTI.To prepare for Covid becoming an endemic Singapore has ramped up its vaccination drive amid the fight to reduce the spike in cases. Vaccination has reported to appear effective in reducing the rate of infection and transmission. Fully vaccinated people showed mild or no symptoms in case of contraction.The ministers said that by early next month, two-thirds of the population will have received at least one dose of the vaccine. "Our next milestone will be to have at least two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated with two doses around National Day, supply permitting. We are working to bring forward the delivery of vaccines and to speed up the process," they said.Next, the ministers said in time, people infected with the virus will be allowed to recover at home to reduce the stress on the healthcare system. The close contacts of the infected people can purchase test kits from pharmacies to test themselves.Testing will be made universal and will no longer remain a tool for ring-fencing and quarantining people. They said that it will be used to screen those who enter office buildings, malls, schools and other places.The daily updates on the coronavirus numbers will shift to focus on outcomes like home many people fell severely shift and how many ended up needing the intensive care unit, the same way the flu is monitored. Eventually, safe management rules can be eased and large gatherings will be allowed like the National Day Parade or New Year's Eve countdown, The Straits Times report said.Travel will begin again, with vaccination certification, with countries that have also controlled the contagion and turned it into an endemic. The travellers may even be exempted from quarantining with a negative test on arrival.Also read: Singapore latest to cast doubt over Chinese Sinovac efficacy. Here’s whyThe fear of economic disruptions from the lockdowns will also not exist for the businesses, the report said."Science and human ingenuity will eventually prevail over Covid-19. Cohesion and social consciousness will get us there faster. We must all do our part," the ministers said.Singapore, as of Wednesday, had reported a total of 62,470 Covid-19 cases. The country has recorded 35 deaths from the infection to date.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-plans-to-shift-to-new-normal-amid-covid-check-details-101624508545585.html
24-06-2021||World||US intelligence warns Kabul could fall in 6 months after US pull-out: Report||US intelligence has warned that Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, could fall to the resurgent Taliban group within six months of the departure of the last of the US and international troops, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday - ahead of a White House meeting on Friday between President Joe Biden and top Afghan leaders Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah.The warning came amid growing international concern about Taliban making gains since May 1, when the US and allied troops began leaving Afghanistan in accordance with a timeline announced by Biden for complete the withdrawal by September 11 - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that had led to the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.India, a key stakeholder in Afghanistan’s reconstruction, called for a UN-led ceasefire in the country during a UN Security Council debate on Monday, pointing to a sudden escalation in violence in the country since May 1.The Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence experts had earlier assessed that the government of President Ghani would survive for two years after the US withdrawal based roughly on the time it took for the fall of Saigon in Vietnam after US troop pull-out in 1975.US intelligence and military analysts have since revised their assessment and now believe that Kabul could fall in six to 12 months after the departure of American troops, the WSJ reported, adding that officials in other western countries fear the capital could fall far sooner, possibly in three months.US military has planned to wind up the withdrawal by as soon as July, going down from the 3,500 currently stationed there to zero, barring a small force to be left behind for the protection of American diplomatic missions and officials. “I will say that while, in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF (Afghan National Defence and Security Forces) and Afghan government versus a year ago, we have not seen an increase in attacks on our military presence since February 2020,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in response to a question about the rapid military gains made by the Taliban. “We also assess that, had we not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1, because that was what the Taliban were clearly conveying. So, the status quo, in our view, was not an option,” Psaki added.American lawmakers, too, are worried by Taliban’s advances and sought assurances from US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.Miley said, “Yes, we’re concerned, we’re watching it, but there’s a 300,000 plus or minus military force” of the Afghan army and the police “and it is their job to defend their country”. He said the Taliban group currently controls 81 district centres of Afghanistan, but not any of the provincial capitals yet.Austin sought to address concerns expressed by lawmakers about US ability to prevent Afghanistan from sliding back under the control of terrorists after the withdrawal of troops, saying America has “very” effective over-the-horizon capability in keeping an eye on Afghanistan, currently from partner countries in the Gulf region and from platforms at sea.“What we’d like to do going forward is shorten the legs that were required to utilise by getting an agreement with one of the neighbouring countries to base some of our ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) in one of those countries,” said Austin.Austin did not name these countries, but Pakistan appears to be a leading candidate, as has been clear from repeated public protestations from Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has said his country won’t agree to give the US bases on its soil.Asked about Khan’s position, a US state department spokesperson told HT, “As President Biden said, the United States will reorganise our counterterrorism capabilities and substantial assets to prevent reemergence of terrorist threats, in Afghanistan or anywhere else.“The United States respects the sovereignty of other nations and their ability to make decisions about what is in the best interest of their national security.”Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are also options for the US to have bases because of their shared boundaries with Afghanistan.The US had bases there in the past, but people familiar with the region said getting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nod might be a problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-warns-kabul-could-fall-in-6-months-after-us-pull-out-report-101624510365558.html

Also, most patients with myocarditis and pericarditis who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better," the CDC said in a press release on Wednesday.The release, however, urged vaccine recipients to "be on the lookout for any of the following symptoms: chest pain; shortness of breath; feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart" and to seek medical care if any of the symptoms occur following the first or second jab.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to add similar warnings accompanying both vaccines, according to media reports.The CDC release was issued following a day in which the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) began reviewing reports of myocarditis connected with the two vaccines - the most detailed data coming from the Israeli Health Ministry, according to one presentation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccine-recipients-to-watch-for-enlarged-heart-symptoms-101624509428428.html
24-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris to make 1st visit to US-Mexico border area regarding migration||Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first visit on Friday to the US-Mexico border since taking office, following criticism from members of both parties for failing to go earlier despite her role leading the Biden administration’s response to a steep increase in migration.Harris will visit the El Paso area, accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, according to a statement Wednesday from Harris senior adviser Symone Sanders.Harris has faced months of criticism from Republicans, and even some frustration from those in her own party, for not visiting the area.She was tasked earlier this year by President Joe Biden with taking on the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States, and so far she's focused largely on outreach to local leaders and advocacy groups with the goal of improving economic and living conditions in the region. Harris has said her goal is to offer residents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico hope for their future, so they no longer feel compelled to leave home for better opportunities.Her aides have repeatedly insisted her efforts are distinct from the security issues that plague US. officials trying to handle a spike in border crossings. But Republicans have pointed to the failures by both Harris and Biden to visit the border to paint the administration as absent in a crisis.Harris will arrive in the area just days before former President Donald Trump is to visit the border with a group of House Republicans and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and Trump is certain to use the opportunity to drive Republican attacks on Democrats as soft on immigration.The border issue shadowed Harris’ first foreign trip earlier this month, to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met with both nations’ presidents and local officials to discuss economic and humanitarian solutions to the significant outmigration from both countries.During that trip, she sat for an interview with NBC News in which she dismissed a question about why she hadn't made a trip to the border by responding, “I've never been to Europe,” and adding, “I don't understand the point you're making.” Harris and White House aides were subsequently forced to parry repeated questions about the decision and her remarks.Harris said she was focused on “tangible” results “as opposed to grand gestures," but she also said she might visit in the near future.She has noted that as a senator from California, she has visited the border in the past, and she has asserted that unless the root causes of migration are addressed the situation there will never be fixed.It's unclear what Harris' plans include during her visit to the area, but one migrant detention facility in El Paso, at the Fort Bliss military post, has drawn criticism from advocates who have described unsafe conditions and allegations of abuse toward some of the thousands of children housed there.On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the trip was “part of the coordinated effort between her office, her work, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, to continue to address the root causes and work in coordination to get the situation under control.”While Psaki emphasized that border security is under Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas' purview, she added that “it’s important every component of our government is coordinated” on the issue.US Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 180,000 encounters on the Mexican border in May, the most since March 2000. Those numbers were boosted by a pandemic-related ban on seeking asylum, which encouraged repeated attempts to cross the border because getting caught carried no legal consequences.The numbers have led even some centrist Democrats to join Republicans in their calls for Harris to make a trip to the area. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district stretches from south of San Antonio down to the southern border, wrote a letter to Harris earlier this month inviting her to “observe the ongoing humanitarian crisis and share the perspective of Americans who live there.”“I believe it is critical that you meet with local stakeholders and residents, consider their concerns, and use their lived experiences to implement more effective policies,” he wrote.Cuellar issued a tweet Wednesday thanking Harris for her plans to visit.But his engagement on the issue underscores the potential political peril for Democrats on immigration. An AP-NORC poll conducted in April found that more Americans disapprove than approve of how Biden is handling the sharply increasing number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the US-Mexico border.And Trump's trip to the border marks another sign of how closely Republicans continue to align themselves with Trump and the extent to which they see the border as a winning campaign issue. The former president immediately took credit for Harris' trip, speculating in a statement that the vice president would not have made plans to go if he hadn't been headed there himself.Psaki said the administration "made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go the border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-make-1st-visit-to-us-mexico-border-area-regarding-migration-101624508957764.html
24-06-2021||World||Hong Kong residents snap up final edition of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily||Hong Kong's pro-democracy Apple Daily tabloid said it was a "victim of tyranny" in a defiant final edition on Thursday after it was forced to close under a new national security law, ending a 26-year run of taking on China's authoritarian leaders.The sudden death of the popular newspaper is the latest blow to Hong Kong's freedoms, deepening unease over whether the international finance centre can remain a media hub as China seeks to stamp out dissent.Queues formed across Hong Kong on Thursday as residents raced to snap up one of the one million copies Apple Daily said it planned to print. Many vendors sold out within minutes and were awaiting fresh deliveries.The swansong front page featured the paper's own journalists waving goodbye to crowds outside its headquarters."Apple Daily is dead," deputy chief editor Chan Pui-man, who was arrested last week on a national security charge, wrote in a farewell letter to readers."Press freedom became the victim of tyranny."In the working-class district of Mongkok, hundreds queued through the early hours of the morning to get their hands on the final edition, some chanting "Apple Daily we will meet again!""It's very shocking," a 30-year-old woman, who was in the queue and gave her first name as Candy, told AFP."Within two weeks, authorities could use this national security law to dismantle a listed company."Asset freezeHong Kong's most popular tabloid had long been a thorn in Beijing's side, with unapologetic support for the city's pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China's authoritarian leaders.Those same leaders used a new security law to bring about its rapid demise.Owner Jimmy Lai, currently in jail for attending democracy protests, was among the first to be charged under the law after its imposition last year.But the final chapter was written over the last week when authorities deployed the security law to raid the newsroom, arrest senior executives and freeze its assets.That last move crippled the paper's ability to conduct business or pay staff and the news group decided Thursday's newspaper -- a run of one million copies in a city of 7.5 million -- would be its last.Overnight it took down its website, Twitter and Facebook accounts.Some 1,000 people, including 700 journalists, are now out of work."Hong Kongers lost a media organisation that dared to speak up and insist on defending the truth," eight local journalist associations said in a joint statement, as they called on colleagues to dress in black on Thursday.Forbidden opinionsChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019.The prosecution of Apple Daily was sparked by articles and columns that allegedly supported international sanctions against China, a view now deemed illegal.Lai, chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung have all been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China's national security and remanded into custody.On Wednesday, Yeung Ching-kee, one of the paper's top columnists, was arrested on the same charge.The decision to freeze Apple Daily's assets also laid bare the sweeping powers now at the disposal of authorities to pursue any company deemed to be a national security threat.Multiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city's mini-constitution.But many local and international outlets are questioning whether they have a future there.First trialHong Kong has plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year. Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.China and Hong Kong's authorities have hailed the security law for successfully restoring stability after the 2019 demonstrations and said media outlets must not "subvert" the government.Authorities initially said the law would only target "a tiny minority".But it has radically transformed the political and legal landscape of a city that China promised would be able to keep key liberties and autonomy after its 1997 return by Britain.On Wednesday, the first trial under the new law got under way for a man accused of riding a motorbike into police officers.His trial is not being heard by a jury, a major departure from Hong Kong's common law traditions.His case is unusual because he is the only Hong Konger so far charged under the security law with an explicitly violent act.More than 60 people have now been charged under the law, including some of the city's best-known democracy activists, but their offences are related to political views or speech that authorities have declared illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-residents-snap-up-final-edition-of-pro-democracy-newspaper-apple-daily-101624508501602.html
24-06-2021||World||Britney Spears tells judge: 'I want my life back'||After 13 years of near silence in the conservatorship that controls her life and money, Britney Spears passionately told a judge Wednesday that she wants to end the “abusive” case that has made her feel demoralized and enslaved.Speaking in open court for the first time in the case, Spears condemned her father and others who control the conservatorship, which she said has compelled her to use birth control and take other medications against her will, and prevented her from getting married or having another child.“This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” the 39-year-old Spears said. “I deserve to have a life."She spoke fast and sprinkled profanity into the written speech that lasted more than 20 minutes as her parents, fans and journalists listed to an audio livestream. Many of the details Spears revealed have been carefully guarded by the court for years.Spears told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny that “I want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated."Penny thanked the pop star for her “courageous” words but made no rulings. A long legal process is likely before any decision is made on terminating the conservatorship.Spears said she wants to marry her boyfriend Sam Asghari and have a baby with him, but she is not allowed to even drive with him.“All I want is to own my money and for this to end and for my boyfriend to be able to drive me in his (expletive) car,” Spears said.“I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive," Spears said, adding at another point, “I want my life back.”When an attorney representing her co-conservator said the hearing and transcript should be kept sealed if private medical information was to be revealed, Spears shouted her down, saying her words should be public.“They’ve done a good job at exploiting my life,” Spears said, “so I feel like it should be an open court hearing and they should listen and hear what I have to say.”She went on to say she was forced to take lithium — which made her feel “drunk” — after rehearsals broke down for a Vegas residency in 2019, which was subsequently canceled.She said all she had done was disagree with one part of the show's choreography.“I’m not here to be anyone’s slave,” Spears said. “I can say no to a dance move.”“Not only did my family not do a goddamn thing, my dad was all for it,” Spears said.She accused her father of relishing his power over her, as he showed when she failed a series of psychological tests in 2019 and forced her to go into a mental hospital.“I cried on the phone for an hour, and he loved every minute of it," Spears said. ”The control he had over someone as powerful as me, as he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%."Spears said she felt forced to do the Las Vegas residency on the heels of a tour, and felt like a great weight was lifted when it was canceled. She has not performed or recorded since.Spears also said several nurses often watch her every move, not even letting her change her clothes in private.Vivian Thoreen, attorney for Spears’ father, James Spears, gave a brief statement on his behalf after conferring with him during a recess.“He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,” Thoreen said. “Mr. Spears loves his daughter, and misses her very much.”James Spears serves as co-conservator of his daughter’s finances, and also had control of her life decisions for most of the conservatorship. He currently serves as co-conservator of her finances.Britney Spears said her years-long public silence has falsely created the impression that she approved of her circumstances.“I’ve lied and told the whole world, ‘I’m OK, I’m happy,' ” she said. “I’ve been in denial, I’ve been in shock. I am traumatized.”More than 100 fans from the so called #FreeBritney movement gathered outside the courthouse before the hearing, holding signs that read “Free Britney now!” and “Get out of Britney's life!”Fan Marissa Cooper was inside the courtroom, and cried and occasionally clapped during the remarks.“It was insane,” Cooper said outside court. “Everyone that’s been following this has been called crazy since the beginning, and conspiracy theorists, so it just feels really really good to actually hear it from her.”Spears said she has not felt heard in any of her previous appearances before the court, all of which were sealed from the public.Her court-appointed attorney, Samuel Ingham III, said he made no attempt to “control, or filter, or edit” his client’s words. He said Spears has not officially asked him to file a petition to end the conservatorship.Spears said she had done research that showed her conservatorship could be ended without further evaluation of her. But under California law, the burden would be on her to prove she is competent to manage her own affairs, and an intensive investigation and evaluation is probably inevitable before it can come to an end.The conservatorship was put in place as she underwent a mental health crisis in 2008. She has credited its initial establishment with saving her from financial ruin and keeping her a top flight pop star.Her father and his attorneys have emphasized that she and her fortune, which court records put at more than $50 million, remain vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. Under the law, the burden would be on Spears to prove she is competent before the case could end.Britney Spears' ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake was among many who expressed outrage at her revelations.“What’s happening to her is just not right,” Timberlake tweeted. "No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britney-spears-tells-judge-i-want-my-life-back-101624508229884.html
24-06-2021||World||Delta variant now reported in 85 countries globally: WHO||The Delta variant, the significantly more transmissible strain of Covid-19, is expected to become a “dominant lineage” if current trends continue, the WHO has warned after it was reported in 85 countries and continues to be detected in more places around the world.The Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update released on June 22 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that globally, the variant Alpha has been reported in 170 countries, territories or areas, Beta in 119 countries, Gamma in 71 countries and Delta in 85 countries.“Delta, now reported in 85 countries globally, continues to be reported in new countries across all WHO Regions, 11 of which were newly reported in the past two weeks,” the update said.WHO said the four current 'Variants of Concern' being monitored closely – Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta - are widespread and have been detected in all WHO regions.“The Delta variant is significantly more transmissible than Alpha variant, and is expected to become a dominant lineage if current trends continue.”The update said that India reported the highest numbers of new Covid-19 cases, 441,976 over the past week (June 14-20, 2021), a 30 per cent decrease as compared to the previous week. The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (16,329 new deaths; 1.2 new deaths per 100,000; a 31 per cent decrease).The South-East Asia Region reported over 600,000 new cases and over 19,000 new deaths, a 21 per cent and a 26 per cent decrease respectively compared to the previous week.“Decreasing trends in weekly case and death incidence in the Region are predominantly associated with decreases reported in India,” the update said.WHO noted that since the last detailed update on June 8, new evidence has been published on the phenotypic characteristics of the Delta variant. “A study from Singapore showed that infection with Delta variant was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death,” it said.Further, a study in Japan "estimating the relative instantaneous reproductive number (a measure of transmission at a specific point in time) showed that the Delta variant was associated with greater transmissibility" when compared to the Alpha variant.“When compared with the variants circulating in Japan before December 2020, the relative instantaneous reproduction number for Alpha was estimated to be at 1.56 and for Delta 1.78. Overall, this study showed Delta was associated with 1.23 times higher transmissibility than Alpha,” the update said.The update also took note of two studies that have provided evidence of the effectiveness of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines against the Delta variant. One study reports on the effectiveness of these vaccines against severe disease (hospitalisation) due to Delta among persons over the age of 16 years in the United Kingdom.Vaccine effectiveness estimates against hospitalisation due to Delta and Alpha variants over 14 days post second dose was estimated to be 96 per cent and 95 per cent respectively for Pfizer BioNTech- Comirnaty and 92 per cent and 86 per cent respectively, for AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria.Single dose effectiveness against hospitalisation over 21 days after immunisation remained high for Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty at 94 per cent against Delta and 83 per cent against Alpha. Effectiveness of one dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria against hospitalization was similar for Delta and Alpha variants.A second study from Scotland found that two doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty were 83 per cent and 79 per cent effective against symptomatic disease and infection due to Delta, respectively, over 14 days after receipt of second dose in persons 15 years and older.“Together, these studies suggest moderately reduced VE at preventing symptomatic disease and infection due to the Delta variant as compared to Alpha...The studies also provide further evidence of the importance of two doses of both Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria in preventing hospitalisation, symptomatic disease and infection due to both Delta and Alpha variants,” the update said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-now-reported-in-85-countries-globally-who-101624506558825.html
24-06-2021||World||US confirms removal of Wuhan coronavirus sequences from database||Details of the genetic makeup of some of the earliest samples of coronavirus in China were removed from an American database where they were initially stored at the request of Chinese researchers, US officials confirmed, adding to concerns over secrecy surrounding the outbreak and its origins.The data, first submitted to the US-based Sequence Read Archive in March 2020, were “requested to be withdrawn” by the same researcher three months later in June, the US National Institutes of Health said in a statement Wednesday. The genetic sequences came from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the Covid-19 outbreak was initially concentrated.The reason cited at the time for withdrawal was that the sequence information had been updated and was being submitted to another database, the agency said. The researcher asked that the data be removed “to avoid version control issues,” it said.“Submitting investigators hold the rights to their data and can request withdrawal of the data,” the agency said. “NIH can’t speculate on motive beyond the investigator’s stated intentions.”The disappearance of the genetic sequences from the database raises questions about what else from the Wuhan outbreak has been shielded, said American virologist Jesse Bloom, who publicized his discovery that they were missing earlier this week. Bloom, who subsequently recovered the information, said it didn’t provide definitive details on where or how the virus originated.Politicians and scientists from around the world have grown increasingly frustrated by China’s efforts to deflect an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, especially the possibility that it leaked from a Wuhan laboratory. Though a World Health Organization expert team visited China earlier this year for an investigation, they were not allowed access to raw data and their conclusion -- that the virus likely crossed over from animals -- has been criticized as being premature.US President Joe Biden has ordered American intelligence agencies to probe the issue again, while China has strenuously denied that the Wuhan laboratory had any link to the outbreak.“I don’t think we can say very much with high confidence,” said Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, referring to the virus’s origins. He added that his findings “reminds us of how little we know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-confirms-removal-of-wuhan-coronavirus-sequences-from-database-101624506061204.html
24-06-2021||World||Scientists developing universal vaccine to fight Covid-19 variants, human trials next year||Scientists at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health have come out with news of major relief amid the rising concerns of Delta and Delta Plus variants of coronavirus. They have developed a hybrid vaccine, being dubbed as 'super vaccine', which is expected to prevent infections from future coronavirus variants.The vaccine effectively generated neutralising antibodies, when injected in mice, against the multiple spike protein, which coronaviruses use to latch onto healthy cells, including one associated with B.1.351 that was first identified in South Africa, the scientists said.Also read| More Delta Plus cases reported in India: How this variant is rapidly spreadingThe researchers further said that the universal vaccine protected mice not just against Covid-19, but also other group 2B coronaviruses. It even triggered the immune system to fight off a dangerous Covid variant. They designed the vaccine to provide protection against the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and a group of coronaviruses that have the potential to transmit from animals to humans."Our findings look bright for the future because they suggest we can design more universal coronavirus vaccines to proactively guard against viruses we know are at risk for emerging in humans,” said PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the Gillings School. “With this strategy, perhaps we can prevent a SARS-CoV-3," he added.Within the extensive family of different coronaviruses, Sarbecoviruses are also called "group 2B". Sarbecoviruses are a priority for the virologists after two coronaviruses outbreak--SARS and Covid-19--in the past two decades."The vaccine has the potential to prevent outbreaks when used as a new variant is detected,” said Ralph Baric, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Gillings School and professor of immunology and microbiology at the UNC School of Medicine.Additional testing could also lead to human trials next year. The paper includes data from mice infected with SARS-CoV and related coronaviruses. The vaccine was noted to prevent both infection and lung damage in the mice.The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Science' by lead authors Martinez and a Hanna H. Gray Fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute along with Baric.The lead authors worked with a team of scientists from UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke University School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.Also read: Delta sparks fears and fresh curbsAccording to Baric, the researchers also pivoted to look at a second-generation vaccine after testing the effectiveness of the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines.The approach to the development of the vaccine began similar to the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccine ie with the mRNA. However, instead of including the mRNA code for only one virus, the researchers welded together mRNA from multiple coronaviruses.The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health and the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory, with funding from the North Carolina General Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-developing-universal-vaccine-to-fight-covid-19-variants-human-trials-next-year-101624499580298.html
24-06-2021||World||US negotiators prepare for return to Iran for 7th round of nuclear talks||US negotiators are prepared to return to a seventh round of indirect talks with Iran on re-entering on 2015 nuclear deal once the leadership in Tehran is ready, a senior administration official said.President Joe Biden’s negotiating team, led by Iran envoy Robert Malley, could return to talks in Vienna as early as next week, though that date might be pushed back, according to the official, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.Earlier Wednesday, the Jerusalem Post said the administration wanted to delay the start of the next round of talks to hear from Israel’s new government on the issue. The newspaper said the administration believes it’s worth a delay to better cooperate with Israel.But the administration official said Malley’s team has consulted with Israeli officials, including the new government, regularly, and described those conversations as “substantive.” The US is ready to go back to Vienna when Iran, which recently elected a new, hard-line president, Ebrahim Raisi, has completed its own process.In comments to state TV, Raisi called on the US this week to fulfill its commitments under the nuclear deal by lifting sanctions. He said Iran would continue to diplomatic efforts to revive the accord and sought verification for sanctions removal, in his first remarks as the country’s president-elect.Oil markets are closely watching the negotiations for signs of how soon the US penalties are likely to be removed and how quickly Iran, a member of OPEC, will increase oil production and boost exports of crude.Israel’s new government, like its predecessor, is opposed to a re-entry to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the accord that former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. But top American officials say they consult regularly with Israel on the matter given their close alliance.“The fact is the United States and Israel are absolutely united in the proposition that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a news conference in Jerusalem last month. “We share exactly the same goal. It’s no secret that we sometimes have our differences with regard to the best way to achieve that goal, and that’s what allies and partners do. We work together, try to find the best way to achieve a common objective.”Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, met Wednesday with Aviv Kohavi, chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Emily Horne, a National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement.“The officials discussed the challenges to security and stability in the Middle East, including the threat posed by Iran’s malign activities in the region, and Mr. Sullivan affirmed the president’s commitment to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” Horne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-negotiators-prepare-for-return-to-iran-for-7th-round-of-nuclear-talks-101624496810240.html

But she added that she was hopeful that “many people are becoming more and more ready to tell it like it is”.Policy choices made now, like promoting plant-based diets, can limit these health consequences - but many are simply unavoidable in the short term, the UN report says. The 4,000-page draft report is scheduled for release next year. It predicts that up to 80 million more people than today will be at risk of hunger by the year 2050.“The basis for our health is sustained by three pillars: the food we eat, access to water, and shelter,” said Maria Neira, director of public health, environmental and social determinants of health, at the World Health Organization. “These pillars are totally vulnerable and about to collapse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uns-draft-report-on-climate-lets-us-face-reality-greta-101624492595058.html

The final chapter of the 26-year-old paper was written over the last week when authorities raided the newsroom, arrested senior executives and froze its assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/embattled-newspaper-in-hk-set-to-shut-shop-101624492063617.html
24-06-2021||World||Delta sparks fears and fresh curbs||The Delta variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in the US and now accounts for a fifth of recent Covid-19 cases, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, as the variant continues to spread fear and trigger fresh curbs around the world.Rochelle Walensky, CDC head, said on Wednesday the rapid growth in the Delta variant is being seen after it had accounted for just 3% of Covid-19 cases analysed several weeks ago.The news in Europe was grim as well, with the highly transmissible variant showing the potential to account for 90% of new Covid-19 cases in the EU in the coming months, the bloc’s disease control agency said. “It is likely the Delta variant will circulate extensively during the summer, particularly among younger individuals not targeted for vaccination,” Andrea Ammon, director of the European CDC said, adding that “by the end of August, it will represent 90%” of new cases in the EU.In Russia, authorities warned of an “explosive” spread of the Delta variant amid rapidly rising infections and deaths. “The situation has become explosive,” said Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin.Fears over the Delta variant also forced authorities in Sydney to bring back curbs, while Wellington upgraded its alert level.In England, meanwhile, officials have tracked 41 cases of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19, an even more transmissible strain.AZ, Pfizer jabs effective against Delta: StudyCovid-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance remain broadly effective against Delta and Kappa variants, according to a scientific study.

24-06-2021||World||Boris Johnson told lack of climate action puts COP26 in jeopardy||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson risks failure when he hosts key climate change talks this year, unless he delivers on promises to eliminate greenhouse gas pollution, an independent government watchdog said.Two years after the U.K. government enshrined in law a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050, strategies covering everything from transport to home heating have been scrapped, delayed, or fell short when they were published, the Climate Change Committee said Thursday.As a result, Johnson’s promises may ring hollow with other leaders when they convene in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year for a round of global talks known as COP26, said John Gummer, chairman of the committee. As COP26 president, the U.K. will need to encourage other nations to set their own mid-century decarbonization goals, putting the world on a path to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius.Other countries “want us to say and do the same thing. And if we do that, then I think we can make a real success of COP26,” said Gummer, who is also a member of Parliament’s upper chamber, the House of Lords. “If we don’t, then it seems to me that it puts the whole process into jeopardy.”The government has set targets to reduce greenhouse gases by 68% in the four decades to 2030 -- rising to 78% by 2035 -- as it plots a course to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. These are some of the world’s most ambitious climate targets, aligning with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5. Celsius. But the government watchdog said these lofty targets have yet to be backed by firm policies.The business department scrapped its Green Homes Grant less than a year after launching it and has yet to announce a replacement program to encourage people to insulate their homes.The committee, which advises the U.K. government on climate change, singled out Rishi Sunak’s Treasury Department as “procrastinating” over its review into the costs of meeting net zero. The review was initially slated to be published in autumn 2020 but still hasn’t got a publication date. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak told lawmakers in Parliament this week that it would come “imminently.”The watchdog also criticized the government for failing to incorporate the net zero targets into planning laws. That led to a local government last year approving plans for a new coal mine in the north of England, said Gummer, a former secretary of state for the environment.Progress WoefulThe watchdog estimates U.K. emissions fell by 13% in 2020, compared with a global decline of 6% from 2019 levels. However, the dramatic drop was caused by pandemic lockdowns and is likely to rebound, said Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee. He said the U.K.’s progress has been “woeful” on cutting emissions from farming, while advances in the waste industry have stalled.“The targets they have set are not going to be achieved by magic,” Stark said.A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy defended the government’s climate policy, saying the U.K. had decarbonized faster than any other Group of Seven nation. “Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-told-lack-of-climate-action-puts-cop26-in-jeopardy-101624490988535.html

Mothballing them cut the sovereign’s income to 9.4 million pounds ($13.1 million) in 2020-21 from 20.2 million pounds a year earlier, according to annual accounts published Thursday.British taxpayers funded the Queen to the tune of 85.9 million pounds in 2020-21, the royal accounts show. Of that, 51.5 million pounds went toward official travel, property maintenance and the operating costs of the monarch’s household. An additional 34.4 million pounds went toward renovating Buckingham Palace in London.The queen’s official expenditure is paid for by the British public in exchange for the surrender of the revenue from the Crown Estate -- lands traditionally held by the monarch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-s-uk-tourist-income-falls-53-in-covid-19-pandemic-101624491004609.html
24-06-2021||World||Countries dependent on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines reporting surge in cases||Seychelles, Mongolia, Chile and Bahrain have in recent months relied on China’s vaccine diplomacy to propel their inoculation drives and get back to a version of normalcy in the time of a pandemic.The four countries have administered at least one dose of the vaccine to a large chunk of their populations, ranging between 58.7% for Mongolia to nearly 72% for Seychelles.Yet, they are now battling a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections that scientists say shouldn’t be happening.Some experts say one of the key reasons could be the vaccines themselves. The millions of doses provided by China to the countries in recent months may not be very effective in containing the coronavirus disease, especially when faced off against the new virus variants that have triggered outbreaks in regions world over.“If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern,” Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, told the New York Times, which first reported about this on Tuesday.“The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this,” he added.Others referred to the scarcity of data that emerges out of China, be it the clinical trials for the vaccines or efficacy and safety results. The country has approved seven domestically developed vaccines, including two of them for children as young as three years old.Of these, the two widely made available across the world – the shots developed by Chinese firms Sinovac and Sinopharm – have been given the World Health Organization’s emergency use listing (EUL).Sinovac’s CoronaVac shot has a low efficacy of 51%, and Sinopharm’s 79% against symptomatic disease. In contrast, both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines – primarily deployed in the western world – have shown efficacy rates of well over 90% against symptomatic disease in clinical trials.The last few weeks have seen cases jump in the four countries. Mongolia, which is largely relying on Chinese vaccines, recorded 2,400 new infections on Sunday -- a quadrupling from a month before.In Seychelles – where the vaccination drive was largely based on the Sinopharm shot – the number of daily new cases is more than 716 per million, according to the NYT report. The country has administered at least one shot to nearly 72% of its population.This too is stark shift from Israel, which has vaccinated 63% (at least one shot) and where daily new cases are at six per million of its population.Similarly, a virus surge in Chile has overwhelmed hospitals and prompted the government to extend border closures through June. Bahrain, where nearly 50% of the population is fully vaccinated and most received the Sinopharm jab, earlier this month allowed people to take a third booster shot as it recorded a spike in infections.Officials from the four countries, however, say there may be other reasons for this uptick in cases. A health ministry official in Mongolia told NYT that the country may have eased restrictions too quickly, adding that the Chinese vaccines likely prevented severe illness and a higher mortality rate.Authorities in Seychelles, too, defended the vaccine.The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement there was no direct link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines, and that the vaccination rate in some regions may not be high enough to prevent the disease from spreading.William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University, told the NYT that the efficacy rates of the Chinese vaccines may be low enough “to sustain some transmission... even though it keeps people largely out of the hospital”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-dependent-on-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-reporting-surge-in-cases-101624482868372.html
24-06-2021||World||Nepal SC ousts most of PM Oli’s cabinet||Nepal’s Supreme Court delivered a fresh blow to embattled communist Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli by removing 20 recently appointed ministers, pending a ruling on whether a caretaker premier can make such sweeping cabinet changes.“This is an interim order and the court will give its final verdict later,” court official Bhadrakali Pokharel told news agency Reuters on Wednesday, a day after the decision by a two-judge bench.With the Himalayan country struggling to contain a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections and beset by political turmoil, Oli lost a vote of confidence in May as a result of factional infighting within his Communist Party of Nepal (UML).Oli dissolved parliament and ordered fresh elections for November, while staying on as caretaker prime minister until the elections are held.In a bid to hold onto power and ditch opponents within his own party, Oli ealier this month dropped most ministers from his cabinet, and named 20 replacements, who were mainly members of a junior coalition partner.The ministerial appointments had been “against the spirit of the constitution”, the Supreme Court judges said, as Oli was only a caretaker prime minister.The court’s removal of the 20 ministers means the cabinet is left with just five members, including the prime minister.“The prime minister had completely disregarded the constitution in making the appointments … the court has applied a brake to this,” petitioner Dinesh Tripathi said.There was no immediate comment from Oli but his aide Rajan Bhattarai said the government would comply with court order, though he described it as “politically incorrect”.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a five-member Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court began hearing nearly 30 petitions challenging Oli’s dissolution of parliament.The hearing began with the writ jointly filed by 146 lawmakers backing Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s claim to prime ministership.According to the apex court’s order, 15 hours have been allocated to the writ petitioners and respondents for pleading.On June 9, the court had issued a show-cause notice to the defendants -- Office of the President and Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers -- seeking explanation on their decision to dissolve the House, within 15 days.Both, the Office of the President and the Prime Minister, in their written replies to the court, had justified their move to dissolve the House.Asserting that the House of Representatives was dissolved as per the constitutional provisions, Bhandari told the Supreme Court that it cannot overturn her decision on the matter or subject it to a judicial review.On his part, Oli told the court that it is not up to the judiciary to appoint a premier as it cannot undertake the legislative and the executive functions of the state.The petitioners, however, say the President should have left it for the House to test if Deuba had a majority or not. Had he failed to prove a majority, he would have been unseated, thereby leading to the automatic dissolution of the House.While Nepali politicians are locked in a power struggle the coronavirus continues to spread, with levels of testing and vaccination both woefully inadequate. Still, official data suggested that the second wave probably peaked in May. Some 3,703 new infections were reported on Tuesday, compared with a daily peak of 9,305 reported on May 12.Meanwhile, Nepali Congress president Deuba has called a meeting of the opposition alliance on Wednesday evening.The meeting will discuss the latest political developments, and the Supreme Court’s decision on Cabinet expansion, a Nepali Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-sc-ousts-most-of-pm-oli-s-cabinet-101624482691547.html

A building was severely damaged by the explosion, which blew out the windows of nearby structures and hit several cars. The windows and walls of Saeed’s house, too, were damaged.“As far as the question of the house of a high-value target is concerned, you would have seen there is a [police] picket near the house, and the car couldn’t get close to that house only because of the picket,” Punjab province’s police chief Inam Ghani told reporters at the site of the attack when he was asked if the blast was aimed at Saeed’s house. “Our view is that the target was the police and they wanted to undermine law enforcement agencies.”There was no claim of responsibility for the blast and Ghani said officers were trying to ascertain whether the car bomb was triggered by a suicide attacker or detonated remotely.Ghani confirmed three deaths.

24-06-2021||World||WHO finds problems at Russian vaccine plant; flags data, testing results||The World Health Organization said Wednesday it had uncovered problems at a Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine production site which Moscow insisted had been resolved.WHO approval has been sought for the Sputnik V jab created by Russia's Gamaleya research institute, which is already being used in 40 countries.The UN health agency inspected four Sputnik V manufacturing sites.On Wednesday, it released a summary report of its preliminary findings, detailing six issues found during its May 31 to June 4 visit to the Pharmstandard Ufa Vitamin Plant in Ufa, southern Russia.The inspectors had concerns with the data integrity and testing results from monitoring during manufacturing and quality control, and with the monitoring and control of aseptic operation and filling.The inspection identified issues with the traceability and identification of vaccine batches.There were also concerns over the filling lines, sterility assurance, sterile filtration validation and the risks of cross-contamination."Communications have been initiated with the relevant manufacturer, the applicant and the respective national regulatory authority with the view that the preliminary findings outlined in this report are investigated and addressed as quickly as possible," the WHO told AFP.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were "some shortcomings identified by the inspection group, and from what we know, they were taken into account and all that needed to be changed was changed."Of course the necessary controls by the control bodies are in place. It is obvious that this is the strictest control possible", he added.- WHO approval process -The WHO's emergency use listing (EUL) approval is the green light that gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that a vaccine has met international standards.The WHO said it had so far conducted nine inspections of the Sputnik V manufacturing sites.They included five clinical trial sites jointly visited with the European Medicines Agency regulator and four manufacturing sites, two of which were joint visits with the EMA.Out of the latter four inspections, the WHO "found non-compliance with good manufacturing practices at one manufacturing site", it said."Findings from the other manufacturing sites of the Sputnik V vaccine that WHO has inspected are still being assessed but they have not raised similar concerns."The organisation said it would continue to assess Sputnik V vaccines from different manufacturing sites and publish its decision on EUL status once all the data is available and the review is complete.EUL paves the way for countries to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-class regulator of their own.It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine distribution facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses in poorer countries.The WHO has so far given EUL status to vaccines created by AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac.The WHO's vaccine overview shows that of the other vaccines yet to receive EUL status, the Sputnik V is the furthest ahead in the process.Sputnik V is already being used in 40 countries, according to an AFP count.Besides Russia, those nations include Argentina, India, Iran, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-finds-problems-at-russian-vaccine-plant-flags-data-testing-results-101624479338542.html

A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee.Spain’s National Court had approved the extradition of detained antivirus software entrepreneur John McAfee to the United States, where he was wanted on tax-related criminal charges that carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.The decision can be appealed and the final extradition will need to be approved by the Spanish Cabinet.Tennessee prosecutors charged 75-year-old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.The charges refer to the three fiscal years from 2016 to 2018, according to the Spanish court's ruling on Wednesday.The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona’s international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition.In a hearing held via videolink earlier this month, McAfee argued that the charges against him were politically motivated and said he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antivirus-creator-mcafee-found-dead-in-prison-after-court-allows-extradition-101624477673723.html
24-06-2021||World||Republicans block voting bill. What happens next?||Senate Republicans have blocked debate of a sweeping overhaul of how elections are run in the US. The bill was pushed by congressional Democrats who argued it was needed to counter a spate of new GOP laws this year tightening voting rules in the states.A look at what has happened so far, what’s in the bill and what happens next:WHY DID SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK THE BILL?Republicans have long opposed Democratic efforts to overhaul elections in the US and say the reforms being proposed are more about ensuring Democratic victories than fairness in voting. They note that Democrats introduced their overhaul two years ago, before the 2020 election, and say the massive bill amounts to a federal takeover of elections, which are run by state and local election offices. Congressional Republicans argue increased voter turnout in the 2020 election is proof that reforms are not needed. But, at the same time, their counterparts in state legislatures have pointed to unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud as justification for tightening rules and increasing election oversight at the state and local level.WHAT DOES THE BILL DO?The bill, known as the For The People Act, would create minimum standards for voting in the US and establish Election Day as a federal holiday. It requires all states to offer automatic voter registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Some states already do this, but others do not. And Democrats argue that federal standards would reduce confusion among the public. They also say the standards would blunt the impact of new state laws creating barriers for voters.But the bill doesn't just address election issues. There are scores of other provisions packed into the 888-page bill, including a broad expansion of public funding for campaigns, a revamp of redistricting and ethics reforms. Written when Democrats were out of power, it was more a statement of priorities than legislation to be ultimately enacted. It’s been refined a few times and more changes are expected.IS THIS THE END OF THE ROAD?Democratic leaders expected Tuesday's vote and their efforts to pass the bill will continue. “In the fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish line,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in remarks after the vote. But with a 50-50 split in the Senate, they have few options due to the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. Now the fight turns to whether Democrats can agree that voting legislation is so important it's worth changing or setting aside the filibuster.They'll also continue to try to build public support for their efforts. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, said Tuesday she would hold a hearing in Georgia on a law approved earlier this year by the GOP-dominated Legislature that has raised concerns of more hurdles for voters and the potential for partisan interference in local election administration.ARE DEMOCRATS UNITED?At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have said they oppose eliminating the filibuster rule. Sinema supports the voting reform bill but argued in a recent opinion piece that the rule “compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings.”Manchin, who initially opposed the bill, has crafted a new version that would remove some of the more contentious provisions such as same-day voter registration and the public financing option. His proposal also calls for a national ID requirement, something Democrats have not done previously but appear open to considering. The requirement would be less strict than ones pushed by Republicans in certain states and allow voters to provide nonphoto ID such as a utility bill.WHAT SORT OF CHANGES ARE DEMOCRATS CONSIDERING?Discussions are ongoing among congressional Democrats on how to proceed, with leaders noting privately that both Sinema and Manchin oppose eliminating the rule — but that doesn't mean they would oppose changing it. And President Joe Biden has signaled a willingness to consider a change. Democratic leaders argue there is an opportunity to improve the process and are weighing three potential changes:—require that 41 senators of the minority party be present if they want to block a vote on any legislation.—create a narrow exemption for the rule to be suspended for any legislation dealing with voting and elections. There is precedent for this. Democrats previously eased the rule to allow most executive branch nominees to be confirmed with a simple majority, and Republicans eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees during the Trump administration.—require opposing lawmakers to speak on the floor continuously to block the legislation from advancing — a version of a talking filibuster that would include a gradual reduction in the number of senators who can prevent a vote -- starting at 60 and eventually reaching a simple majority over a period of weeks.WHAT DOES THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DO NEXT?Biden has pledged to wage what the White House calls the “fight of his presidency” over ensuring Americans’ access to voting, but he hasn't been at the center of the fight yet. Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the administration’s efforts, speaking with lawmakers and various voting rights’ advocates in recent weeks and meeting with Democratic state lawmakers from Texas who are pushing against a GOP effort there to tighten voting rules.On Wednesday, Harris met virtually with leaders from several voting and civil rights groups. She noted her visit the day before to the Senate chamber to preside over the vote was to “make clear that our administration takes the issue very seriously, we are paying close attention and we will be actively involved.”In the weeks ahead, Biden will use the “bully pulpit” of the presidency to highlight the importance of voting rights, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.“What you should expect to hear from him is that there are many ways to work across the country — with activists, with states, with legislators — using every lever at our disposal to expand access, improve access to voting across the country,” Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-block-voting-bill-what-happens-next-101624477126621.html
