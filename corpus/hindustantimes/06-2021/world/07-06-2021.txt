But New Delhi hasn’t yet approved any China-made vaccine in India. So the group of Indians went to countries such as Nepal, UAE, Maldives and Malaysia where Chinese vaccines are available to get the jabs.Moderna seeks nod for teens in Europe, CanadaUS firm Moderna is seeking conditional approval for use of its Covid-19 vaccine on teens in the European Union and Canada, in a boost for inoculation campaigns as the summer begins. The firm said it also plans to file for emergency approval with the US FDA, where the Pfizer is being administered to adolescents aged 12 and up.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-force-china-on-origin-affair-who-101623088661637.html

The Weibo page of Xiaohongshu, a Pinterest-like platform, made a post on June 4 saying, “Tell me loudly, today’s date is....!” The date was the 32nd anniversary of the crackdown.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lodges-formal-protest-with-us-over-senators-101623088406548.html

He is of Iranian origin and disappeared during a shipwreck in the English Channel off the coast of France on October 27,” said Camilla Tjelle Waage, head of investigations at the sheriff’s office in Karmoey. “Both parents died, as well as Artin’s two older siblings who were found dead.”Police were able to confirm the identity of the toddler by matching his DNA with that of a relative close enough in lineage who lives in Norway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-of-toddler-who-died-trying-to-cross-english-channel-identified-101623088213487.html

Two weeks after we extended the invite to all over 30s, we are now extending the offer to everyone aged 25 and over,” he said.The National Health Service (NHS) has dubbed the latest expansion of its vaccination programme as the “Home Straight” phase, as around 3 million people aged between 25 and 29 will begin being invited to book their first vaccine dose.The move comes as NHS data shows that more than half of all adults in the country are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“We have one of the highest uptake rates in the world with over half of the UK population having the fullest possible protection from two doses, and over three quarters receiving at least one dose. The vaccine is our way out of this pandemic so when you get the call, get the jab,” said Hancock.According to previously released expert advice, both doses of the Covid-19 vaccines are needed for strong protection against the Delta variant – which is now feared to be the dominant variant of concern (VOC) behind infections in the UK."It is too early to make decisions on step four, the road map has always been guided by the data and as before, we need four weeks between steps to see the latest data and a further week to give notice of our decision. So we'll assess the data and announce the outcome a week today," Hancock told the Commons, in reference to the June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown restrictions.Hancock also informed Parliament that he has asked the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to provide clinical advice on the vaccination of 12-17-year-olds after the Pfizer/BioNTech jabs received regulatory approval for children last week.Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, hailed the “watershed moment” of a further extension of the vaccination programme six months since 90-year-old Maggie Keenan became the first person anywhere in the world to receive her first dose on December 8, 2020.“The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,” said Stevens.“Getting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do, with NHS staff vaccinating at over 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship, sport stadiums and other convenient locations,” he added.The latest Covid-19 statistics released on Monday recorded one more death from the deadly virus in the UK and 5,683 cases of coronavirus infections within the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expands-covid-vaccination-drive-to-inoculate-people-above-25-yrs-101623084652412.html
07-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris says leaders need to restore hope in Guatemala||Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday emphasized the need to restore hope for residents of Northern Triangle countries in order to address the increase in migration from the region as she faced the first major test of her diplomatic skills on a three day foreign trip meant to stem migration to the US from those countries.Her comments came at the start of her bilateral meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei Monday morning. She plans to address everything from vaccine sharing to corruption in the region. But in her opening remarks, she emphasized the need for both leaders to act to improve the situation on the ground for Guatemalans, whom she said don’t want to leave their homeland but are forced to by poor living conditions.“Hope does not exist by itself, it must be coupled with relationships and trust, it must be coupled with tangible outcomes in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children,” she said.Harris also said the fact she chose Guatemala and Mexico for her first overseas trip was a “reflection of the priority President Biden placed on this region.” She said the two nations are “interconnected and interdependent” and it’s in “our collective interest that we work together.”Their meeting came as the Biden administration is expected to announce new anti-trafficking and smuggling measures, and hopes to deliver new anti-corruption measures Monday as well, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview announcements before they have been made public. Harris is visiting Guatemala and Mexico as part of her role in dealing diplomatically with the irregular migration to the US, and she will meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Tuesday.In Guatemala, the country’s widespread corruption will loom over the discussions, even as Harris seeks new agreements with Giammattei to help stem the spike in migration.Nongovernmental organizations placed Guatemala’s widespread corruption at the top of their list of concerns before Harris’ visit. Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei’s administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them.The selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and allegations of corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her.“Corruption really does sap the the wealth of any country, and in Central America is at a scale where it is a large percentage of GDP across the region,” said special envoy Ricardo Zúñiga, who joined Harris in the meeting with Giammattei. “We see corruption as one of the most important root causes to be dealt with.”Besides her meeting with Giammattei on Monday morning, Harris will participate in a roundtable with Guatemalan community and civil society leaders, and she’ll meet with young innovators and entrepreneurs, including a number of female entrepreneurs.In addressing the root causes of migration, Harris has laid out an approach centered on creating better opportunities and living conditions in the region through humanitarian and economic aid. She’s focused many of her public events and listening sessions before this visit on work with civil society organizations and international businesses, which her aides say is an acknowledgement that the work of improving the situation in the region cannot be done by its governments alone.Harris announced plans to send $310 million to provide support for refugees and address food shortages, and she recently secured commitments from a dozen companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle countries to promote economic opportunity and job training.Washington won some goodwill through its vaccine diplomacy this past week. Giammattei and López Obrador both received calls from Harris on Thursday telling them the US would be sending 500,000 doses and 1 million doses, respectively, of Covid-19 vaccine.But Harris’ aides say corruption will continue to be a central focus of her bilateral meetings with both Giammattei and López Obrador.While in Latin America, Harris will also have to navigate the politics of immigration. Congressional Republicans have criticized both President Joe Biden and Harris for deciding not to visit the US-Mexico border and contend the administration is ignoring what they say is a crisis there. April was the second-busiest month on record for unaccompanied children encountered at the border, following March’s all-time high. The Border Patrol’s total encounters in April were up 3% from March, marking the highest level since April 2000.Conservatives will be watching Harris closely for any missteps, hoping to drag her into further controversy on an issue that they see as a political winner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-leaders-need-to-restore-hope-in-guatemala-101623083075183.html

07-06-2021||World||Maldives' foreign minister Abdulla Shahid elected president of UN General Assembly||Foreign minister of the Maldives Abdulla Shahid was elected as the President of the 76th United Nations General Assembly with an overwhelming three-fourth majority, with143 in favour, 48 against and no abstentions and no invalid votes.This is a post held on an annual basis, rotated amongst various regional groupings. The 76th session (2021-22) is the turn of the Asia-Pacific group. This is the first time that the Maldives will be occupying the office of the President of the UN General Assembly.The Maldives had announced Shahid’s candidature in December 2018. At that time, no other candidate was in the fray. Shahid is eminently qualified to hold the top office of UN General Assembly, with vast diplomatic experience and strong credentials, especially in the multilateral fora.India announced its support for Shahid during the visit of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to the Maldives in November 2020. Even at that time, he was the only candidate in the fray.Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday took to Twitter to congratulate Shahid on his selection.This is a testimony as much to his own stature as to the standing of Maldives. We look forward to working with him to strengthen multilateralism and its much needed reforms.In mid-January 2021, in a surprising development and with less than six months before the elections, Afghanistan's foreign minister Zalmai Rassoul entered the fray. While Rassoul also has strong credentials, by the time his candidature was announced, the Maldives had already garnered extensive support. Moreover, the island nation has never held the office of General Assembly, while Afghanistan held this post during the 21st GA session in 1966-67.In response to media queries on remarks made by President of the United Nations General Assembly with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, the official spokesperson said, "We express our strong opposition to the unwarranted references made with respect to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir by the President of the United Nations General Assembly (PGA) Volkan Bozkir during his recent visit to Pakistan.His remarks that Pakistan is "duty bound” to raise this issue in the UN more strongly are unacceptable. Nor indeed is there any basis for comparison to other global situations.When an incumbent President of the UN General Assembly makes misleading and prejudiced remarks, he does great disservice to the office he occupies. The UNGA President's behaviour is truly regrettable and surely diminishes his standing on the global platform."Both the Maldives and Afghanistan have excellent relations with India, and both candidates are friends of India. However, since India had already committed its support to Maldives at a time when no other candidate was in the fray, India voted in favour of Maldives.The office of UNGA President is the highest office in the UN System, and reflects the collective goodwill of the 193 Member States of the UN. India remains committed to supporting the office, as it has consistently done in previous years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-abdulla-shahid-elected-president-of-un-general-assembly-101623081279055.html

Other doctors said clinical trial results were inconsistent and more proof was needed.The FDA said Biogen must conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify the drug's clinical benefit."If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market," it said.Aducanumab was studied in patients with early disease who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques. Some trial patients experienced potentially dangerous brain swelling.Biogen has estimated that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for treatment with aducanumab, which is given by monthly infusion, raising concerns about costs to the healthcare system.Shares were halted pending the news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-approves-biogen-inc-s-drug-for-alzheimer-s-disease-101623080586498.html

He will be aboard New Shepard, a reusable rocket of his space company Blue Origin, with his brother Mark Bezos and one more person, the winner of an auction for the third berth, when it lifts off on July 20, two weeks after Jeff is scheduled to step down as CEO of Amazon.“Ever since I was five years old, I’ve dreamed of travelling to space,” Jeff said in a post on Instagram on Monday. “On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend. #Gradatim Ferociter (a Latin phrase that is Blue Origin’s motto, and translates to ‘step by step, ferociously’).”“I wasn’t even expecting him to say that he was going to be on the first flight,” said Mark, who is senior vice-president at Robin Hood, a poverty-fighting charity in New York City, in a video in the Instagram post. “What a remarkable opportunity, not only to have this adventure but to do it with my best friend.”If nothing changes between now and July 20, Jeff Bezos will become the first billionaire to go into space, beating fellow “Space Barons” Elon Musk, whose SpaceX has been flying crewed missions to the International Space Station since 2020, and Richard Branson, who has announced plans several times before to go up in a Virgin Galactic rocket, but hasn’t yet.Jeff’s space company Blue Origin, which is based outside Seattle in Washington state, has been conducting flight tests of the New Shepard and its safety systems since 2012, and the company said it had 15 successful consecutive missions, including three successful escape tests, demonstrating its crew escape system can activate safely in any phase of flight missions. New Shepard, which is a reusable rocket system, is named after Alan Shepard, the first American to go into space.The 59ft rocket, with a six-seater capsule, will take off on July 20, the anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The flight will last 11 minutes and will travel 60 miles above Earth to the edge of space, according to reports.Along with Jeff’s brother will be the winner of an auction that is under way, with the highest bid standing at $2.8 million. The winner will be declared at a live auction on June 12; participants have until June 10 to communicate their bidding limits. Earnings from the auction will go to foundation step to up to promote education in STEM courses - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.Jeff founded Blue Origin in 2000 to enable, the company said on its website, a “future where millions of people are living and working in space to benefit Earth. In order to preserve Earth, Blue Origin believes that humanity will need to expand, explore, find new energy and material resources, and move industries that stress Earth into space”.Musk founded SpaceX two years later in 2002 and Branson followed up with Virgin Galactic in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bezos-going-into-space-on-july-20-beating-space-barons-musk-branson-to-it-101623078516249.html

During the eclipse, the Moon will move between the Sun and the Earth, and with the three celestial bodies exactly in line with each other the Sun's light will be blocked from reaching the Earth.This eclipse is going to appear as a 'ring of fire'. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), in solar eclipses the Moon isn't close enough to Earth to entirely block the view of the Sun from the planet, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon.The solar eclipse, also called Surya Grahan in India, will not be visible in the entire country. While only some parts of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh will witness it, people in other regions can see the eclipse via a live webcam. To watch this rare phenomenon, people are advised to use protective solar eclipse-viewing glasses. The website timeanddate.com has published the live stream link which people can tune in to on June 10 to watch the eclipse.Parts of Canada, Greenland, and Russia will be able to witness the eclipse, according to Nasa. Cities like New York, Washington DC, London, and Toronto will see a partial eclipse. New York will witness more than 70% coverage of the Sun.Last month, too, a celestial event in the form of a super blood moon was witnessed. After the upcoming eclipse on June 10, people will get to see the second solar eclipse of the year on December 4. This will also not be visible in India. People from South America, the Pacific, the Atlantic, parts of the Indian Ocean and Antarctica will get to see the last solar eclipse of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2021-to-occur-on-june-10-timing-how-to-watch-ring-of-fire-101623070867234.html
07-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Over 300 stranded Indians petition for return to China||More than 300 Indians who live and work in China but are currently in their home country have petitioned the Chinese government to allow them to return after taking Chinese vaccines from a third country.In March, Chinese missions in many countries including in India said they will facilitate issuing visas to foreigners who need to travel to China if they have taken a China-made Covid-19 vaccine.The rule, however, did not make it easier for Indians to the visas since New Delhi hasn’t yet approved any China-made vaccine in the country.The group of Indians, however, found a way out - they travelled to countries like Nepal, UAE, and Maldives where Chinese vaccines are available to get the jabs. A few also went to Malaysia.Many of them took China’s Sinopharm vaccine, which was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) in May.After returning to India, the group - which calls itself Indians of China - sent representations to the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, requesting the mission to issue visas as they had complied with the vaccine criteria. They also wrote to the Indian embassy in Beijing to take up the matter with the Chinese foreign ministry.Many among the petitioning Indians have been separated from their families for over 16 months while others are finding it tough to hold on to their jobs in China.For many, the emotional trauma of staying separately from their families is taking a mental toll.The Indians have pressed home the point that since they have complied with the directive to take China-made jabs, they should be allowed to return to China.They have assured Chinese authorities of complying with all necessary pandemic-prevention rules, testing and quarantine procedures once they arrive in China.The Indians, however, have not yet received any response from the Chinese authorities.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin on Monday said those eligible are being helped to return but did not give details. “In order to restore the normal order of cross-border travel for those foreigners, who have been vaccinated with Chinese vaccines, holding the certificates and meeting the eligibility, we are providing facilitations for their travel. But, for the details, please contact the Chinese Embassy in India,” Wang said when asked about the status of stranded Indians.When asked whether China will recognise vaccines approved by the WHO for travelling to China, Wang said it was important to have a safe system of international travel. “Essentially, this is about cross-border travel and the order to be maintained. We have already stated our position on this issue. I’d like to reiterate that since the outbreak of the pandemic, drawing on the experience of many countries we have rolled out measures to ensure safety, while building a safe and orderly cross-border travel.”Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities but stranded in their home country have also not been allowed to return to China because of the continuing and strict restrictions imposed on international travel related to the Covid-19 pandemic.In March, Beijing suggested that Indian students stay in contact with their universities in China and follow their instructions - in effect saying that they should continue with their online studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-stranded-indians-petition-for-return-to-china-101623076056437.html

07-06-2021||World||Pak, China plan to create media house to challenge West’s ‘info dominance’||Pakistan and China are working on plans to create a television channel and media organisation with the aim of achieving “information dominance” and offering an alternative to the narrative of Western news media, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The two countries are exploring the possibility of creating an organisation on the lines of Qatar’s Al-Jazeera or Russia’s RT network, complete with journalists of international stature, which would be backed by Chinese funding, the people said. The thinking behind the move is that China’s internal dynamics preclude an open media but the country has financial muscle, while Pakistan’s internal scenario is favourable for such a media organisation but the state lacks financial resources, the people said, citing internal documents accessed by Indian security agencies. Also Read | On Israel-Palestine, resist the temptation to mediateThe two countries feel there is a need for a media house of the stature of Al-Jazeera and RT to “propel amenable narratives” and such an organisation could be established in Pakistan and funded by China to achieve the objectives of both sides, the people added. The move comes on the heels of Pakistan’s failed effort about two years ago to launch an English television channel along with Turkey and Malaysia that was to have projected a correct image of Islam and confronted challenges due to Islamophobia. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had spoken about the venture following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad in New York in September 2019. That project was apparently shelved last year because of lack of interest from Turkey and Malaysia and there have been no updates from the Pakistani side. The people also pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s remarks at a May 31 meeting of the Politburo of the Communist Party about the need to create a “trustworthy, lovable and respectable” image for the country and said this reflected a move by Beijing to tone down its recent “wolf warrior” diplomacy. Xi told senior Communist Party leaders that the country must “make friends extensively, unite the majority and continuously expand its circle of friends with those who understand and are friendly to China”, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. China needs “a grip on tone” in its communications with the world and should “be open and confident, but also modest and humble”, he said. One of the people cited above said: “The current project aims to establish a media house to project a so-called correct image of Pakistan. Though the documents do not refer to China directly in terms of content, the very fact that financing would be provided by China is proof that China intends to use this channel as a platform to improve its image.” One of the documents accessed by security agencies states that China is competing with the West in technology and economy but lags in “information dominance”. It further states that in a world dominated by social media, winning the “battle of narrative is more important than winning of physical battle”, and domination in technology and economy may not be fully realised without domination in the information domain. The proposed media organisation will build “capacity to contest inimical narratives through counter or alternate narratives” and that Sino-Pakistan collaboration is necessary to build “this critical capacity”. The proposed organisation will give significance to information dominance and attempt to quash “engineered misperceptions”, the document adds. In recent months, Pakistan’s powerful military has taken several steps to browbeat and silence its critics in the media. Popular TV anchor Hamid Mir was taken off the air by Geo News, one of Pakistan’s most-watched channels, after he threatened to divulge details of the alleged shooting of a senior military official by his wife during a protest in Islamabad on May 29 against the assault of a Pakistani reporter by intelligence operatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-china-plan-to-create-media-house-to-challenge-west-s-info-dominance-101623069334228.html
07-06-2021||World||France fines Google 220 million euros for abusing market spot with online ads||France's competition regulator on Monday fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) after finding it had abused its dominant market position for placing online ads, as US tech giants face growing pressure in Europe.The penalty is part of a settlement reached after three media groups -- News Corp, French daily Le Figaro, and Belgium's Groupe Rossel -- accused Google of effectively having a monopoly over ad sales for their websites and apps.The competition authority determined that Google gave preferential treatment to its own ad inventory auction service AdX and to Doubleclick Ad Exchange, its real-time platform for letting clients choose and buy ads."It is the first ruling in the world to scrutinise the complex algorithmic processes for the auctions that determine online 'display' advertising," the authority's president Isabelle de Silva said.Media groups looking to sell ad space on their internet sites or mobile apps using rival platforms often found that Google's services were unfairly competing against rivals, using a variety of methods.For example, regulators found that Doubleclick would vary the commission it took when making a sale based on prices offered by other so-called ad servers.At the same time, Google arranged for AdX, its own supply-side platform (SSP), to give preferential treatment to offers emanating from Doubleclick -- effectively squeezing out competitors such as Xandr or Index Exchange."The practices are particularly serious because they are penalising Google's competitors in the SSP market as well as the editors of websites and mobile apps," the regulator said in a statement.'First in the world'Media groups saw their online ad revenues crimped "even as their business model has been strongly undermined by the decline in paper subscriptions and the associated drop in advertising revenue," it said.Le Figaro eventually dropped its complaint.Google did not contest the findings, and the regulator said the company has committed to operational changes including improved interoperability with third-party ad placement providers."We are going to test and develop these changes in the coming months before deploying them more broadly, including some on a global scale," Maria Gomri, legal director at Google France, said in a statement.The fine represents just a tiny fraction of the $55.3 billion in revenue booked by Google in the first quarter of this year alone, mainly from online ad sales.The ruling comes as American technology firms are drawing closer scrutiny from European authorities, which are giving themselves new resources to better understand the complex workings of fast-evolving markets.Last week, Germany's competition regulator said it was expanding an antitrust investigation into Google and its parent company Alphabet to include Google News Showcase, a service aimed at increasing revenue for media publishers.Facebook also found itself targeted last week by parallel competition inquiries from the European Union and Britain, into whether the social media giant uses data from advertisers to unfairly dominate the online classifieds market.Google had already been fined 150 million euros by the French regulator in December 2019 over "opaque" operating rules for its advertising platform, which were deemed to be applied in "an unfair and random manner."And in December last year, Google, as well as Amazon, were fined a total of 135 million euros by France's privacy watchdog for placing advertising cookies on users' computers without consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-fines-google-220-million-euros-for-abusing-market-spot-with-online-ads-101623061315948.html
07-06-2021||World||Singapore’s fresh Covid-19 infections lowest since mid-May||Singaporean authorities detected five new coronavirus cases in the community, marking the lowest daily total since the government tightened restrictions on May 16 for a month following an outbreak.All five of these Covid-19 cases were linked to earlier infections, government data showed on Monday. No new cases were discovered in the foreign worker dormitories, while nine imported cases were already under quarantine.The decline in cases comes ahead of a possible easing of restrictions after June 13. It is unlikely, however, that recent measures will be fully removed as the easing will be done in a controlled manner, government officials have said.On Sunday, the Ministry of Health said a hospital cluster, one of the biggest during a recent outbreak driven by more infectious variants, has been closed after no new cases were linked to them for 28 days.“We are heading in the right direction because of the contribution of everyone,” Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who also co-chairs the virus taskforce, said in a Facebook post on Sunday. Ong said the proportion of untraceable cases “have fallen from 18% to 15%” since the start of the curbs last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapores-fresh-covid-19-infections-lowest-since-midmay-101623057723012.html
07-06-2021||World||Trial of Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi to begin next week||The trial of ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will begin next week, her lawyer told AFP Monday, with the Nobel laureate facing an eclectic raft of charges, from possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies to flouting coronavirus restrictions during last year's election campaign.Myanmar has been in uproar since Suu Kyi was ousted in a February 1 coup, with near-daily protests and a nationwide civil disobedience movement.Almost 850 people have been killed by the military, according to a local monitoring group.The junta has hit Suu Kyi, 75, with a string of criminal charges. The most serious alleges that she violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act.Her trial will start on June 14 and is expected to wrap up by July 26, according to her legal team.Her lawyers have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest, with weeks of delays to her legal case."We will get testimonies from plaintiffs and witnesses starting from next hearing," on Monday, lawyer Min Min Soe said after meeting with Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyidaw.There was a heavy police presence around the Naypyidaw council compound, close to where the court is located, with roadblocks along streets leading to the area, an AFP reporter said.Suu Kyi "asked all (people) to stay in good health," Min Min Soe added.Suu Kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous military rule before her 2010 release and rise to power in elections held five years later.Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the November poll, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.The junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the NLD.The continuing violence in Myanmar has pushed some in the anti-junta movement to form a so-called "People's Defence Force" (PDF) in their townships -- made up of civilians who fight back against security forces with homemade weapons.But they are often outnumbered and outgunned in clashes with Myanmar's military -- one of Southeast Asia's most battle-hardened and brutal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-of-myanmar-s-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-to-begin-next-week-101623055797464.html
07-06-2021||World||US lawmakers push Biden for more Covid-19 vaccines and medical aid to India||Several US lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to ensure that India receives enough Covid-19 vaccines and medical aid, saying the health crisis in the country is "devastating" and America has a responsibility to help its close allies defeat the pandemic.The American lawmakers called on the US government to send more vaccines and medical assistance to India after President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses - of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa by the end of June.Biden said the US will share the vaccine to many countries to fight the pandemic through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme as part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally."The crisis in India is devastating and demands more action from (President Joe) Biden. More Covid-19 vaccines and medical supplies are needed to help one of our most important global allies fight this virus," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.In a tweet, the Republican governor urged US citizens to join him in praying for India.Republican Senator Ted Cruz said that almost 300 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US."India is a critical friend of the US. Biden's vaccine sharing programme is flawed: We should prioritise our allies such as India, and make sure it receives the Covid-19 vaccines they desperately need," he said.Senator Roger Wicker from the Senate Armed Services Committee said that it is important for the US to continue helping other nations beat the coronavirus. "Sending excess vaccines to close allies like India doesn't just make sense, it is the right thing to do," he said.Congressman Michael McCaul, a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs, tweeted, "Glad to see critically needed vaccines and other therapeutics will be sent to India to continue to support a longstanding partner and ally."He said as Texans, this reinforces close ties between "our community and the Indian-American diaspora".Congressman Adam Smith lauded President Biden for the steps taken to assist countries that need help."The Covid-19 crisis in India and other countries has been devastating, and more vaccines and medical supplies are still needed," said the chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee."To defeat Covid-19, we must fight it both at home and around the world," Smith, a Democrat, added.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, also a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said to help India deal with shortage, the US needs to send those vaccines that it will never use, just like India helped America in its time of need.Congressman Dan Crenshaw said Houston is home to a large Indian community with friends and families in need back in India. "It should be a priority within this international programme," he tweeted.Observing that the Covid-19 situation in India is "heartbreaking", Congressman August Pfluger said that the US has a responsibility to help its ally."We should immediately send additional vaccines and critical medical supplies," he said.The US has also sent critical medical equipment and medicines to India to fight the second wave of Covid-19.Congressman Darren Soto said as a member of the India Caucus, he thanked President Biden for announcing 25 million in vaccines to hard hit places like India."Let’s continue to take the necessary steps to address the deadly second wave of Covid-19 there with surplus medical supplies and vaccines," said the member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman John Curtis said that while 63 per cent of adult Americans have received at least one shot, many of the US' friends have no access to vaccines."It's important we share with countries like India — a return to normalcy and an eventual end to this brutal pandemic will require some global cooperation," said Curtis, who is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman Troy Nehls urged Biden to immediately send surplus vaccines to India to help it in its fight against Covid-19. He is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.In this global health crisis, it is important that America targets excess Covid-19 vaccines to those around the world that need it most, said Congressman French Hill.“The situation in India, one of our closest allies, is dire. I encourage the Biden administration to support India with vaccines in their time of need," said Hill, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee.Congressman Tim Burchett said that the US needs to make sure that India gets the Covid-19 vaccines.“The response to the tragedy of the Covid-19 pandemic must be global. We must work to close the gaps in our global alert system and work with our allies to make sure this never happens again,” tweeted Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick.India reported 1,00,636 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, the lowest in 61 days, taking the infection tally to 2,89,09,975, according to the Union Health Ministry's latest data. The death toll due to coronavirus reached 3,49,186 with 2,427 new fatalities, the lowest in around 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-push-biden-for-more-covid-19-vaccines-and-medical-aid-to-india-101623046785943.html
07-06-2021||World||Pandemic wanes in US, other markets, China's exports and imports surge||China has reported its exports and imports surged in May on growing demand as the pandemic was waning in the US and other key markets, though the pace of growth is leveling off.Customs data released Monday showed exports rose 28% from a year earlier and imports soared 51% — at the fastest annual pace in over a decade. Total exports climbed 40% in the first five months of the year from a year earlier. They were up 29% from the same period in 2019.China has led the global recovery from the pandemic, which is still raging in many parts of the globe but receding in some places, mostly where vaccinations have been widely deployed.Chinese manufacturers benefited from strong demand for protective gear and other products as other countries battled Covid-19, gaining market share from competitors.The base-level boost from last year’s slump is fading, however, and the $263.9 billion in Chinese exports in May was about level with the previous month. China’s imports of $218.4 billion in May were 1.2% lower than in April.Beijing's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose 14% to $31.8 billion, while the surplus with the European Union fell 43% to $12.7 billion.China’s total trade surplus in May was $45.53 billion, down 26.5% from a year earlier.While the increase in exports was robust in May, it was lower than some economists had forecast and analysts said one reason might be delays at ports in southern China, the main shipping hub, due to increased precautions to fight an outbreak of coronavirus cases.Shortages of semiconductors that are plaguing many industries have likewise hit exports of electronics. Demand for products that surged while people were staying home due to the pandemic, such as toys and furniture, also weakened, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.“Headline trade growth remained elevated last month. But trade volumes dropped back in levels terms and, while supply constraints are partly to blame, there are signs that demand may be peaking, too," he said in a report.A key factor behind last month's rapid increase in imports was rising prices for oil and other commodities needed to fuel the country's industries. But it also reflects demand for the inputs needed to make so much of what China exports.The recovery in demand is helping neighboring countries in Asia that supply many such goods, such as electronics components. Imports from the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations soared nearly 54% from a year earlier, to $33.1 billion. Exports to the region, where many countries are contending with their worst coronavirus outbreaks so far, rose 40% to $39.2 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-wanes-in-us-other-markets-china-s-exports-and-imports-surge-101623046772591.html

Apart from the death of 36 people, Geo TV said that more than 50 others were injured and several passengers remained trapped under the rubble.A rescue operation is underway for passengers trapped inside the trains. All sides of the tracks have been closed after the incident.In March this year, Lahore-bound Karachi Express had derailed in Sindh province.Later, a probe launched under the federal government inspector of railways (FGIR) had blamed the "poor condition of the track" for the accident in which a woman was killed and 13 others sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-36-killed-in-train-collision-in-pakistan-s-sindh-101623046805857.html
07-06-2021||World||Covid-19 origins: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in news||It's been months since a World Health Organization (WHO) investigation into the coronavirus disease's (Covid-19) origins concluded it was "extremely unlikely" that the highly transmissible virus "escaped" from a laboratory in China's Wuhan. Although this idea, dubbed by the media as the "lab leak" hypothesis, has its advocates in certain quarters, the reluctance of the wider scientific consensus to endorse it following the WHO report quickly led to it being branded a "conspiracy theory". However, some new developments put forward by media outlets in the US—White House-led investigation efforts and statements by President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci—have brought the idea back into consideration.Also Read: Covid-19 virus may have escaped from Wuhan lab: Ex-CDC chiefCovid-19 origins: The debateThe debate on the pandemic's origins primarily consists of two contending theories—that of a "natural spillover" hypothesis and of a "lab leak".The first hypothesis brings with it the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, most likely "spilled over" from animals to humans through an emissary animal. This was also the favoured hypothesis of the team of Chinese and international experts constituted by WHO to investigate the pandemic's origins. In its 120-page report, the team said that the virus probably originated in a bat or a pangolin before making the leap to human beings, due to close contact which is not unlikely in a wet market.Also Read: China must hand over the keys to Wuhan lab for Covid-19 origins and global goodThe second idea, far more controversial, projects that SARS-CoV-2 accidentally leaked from a maximum-security biological laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and began to circulate soon after the onset of the pandemic. Lab leaks are rare, compared to the huge work on infectious diseases all over the world. Yet, they are not unknown — the smallpox virus leaked from a lab in the UK, anthrax from the US and SARS-1 may have had a few lab leaks after its natural spillover.'Lab leak' hypothesis, back to notorietyA few recent developments have somewhat revived the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the Wuhan lab.In an open letter published in the journal Science last month, more than a dozen scientists—top epidemiologists, immunologists and biologists—called for further investigation into both the hypotheses currently on the table and urged that they "be taken seriously" until we have sufficient data. Moreover, they questioned the WHO report and whether China was being fully transparent during that visit, stressing that an investigation should ideally minimise conflicts of interest as much as possible.US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci isn't far behind in the race to scepticism, either. In what can be seen as a complete U-turn from his earlier interview to the National Geographic last year, Dr Fauci acknowledged on May 11 that he is now "not convinced" that the virus developed naturally and called for a more thorough investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Two weeks later, President Biden, with the green signal from his adviser, instructed his intelligence agencies to double-down on their investigations into a possible laboratory leak of the virus responsible for the current pandemic.Recent revelations by the Wall Street Journal have also pointed out that several WIV researchers became sick in the fall of 2019 with symptoms similar to “both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses,” and that at least three were hospitalised, adding fuel to the idea that the Covid-19 virus escaped from the Wuhan lab.It is true that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is one of the top virology labs in the world and research on coronaviruses is intensely conducted there, but China's lack of openness in this matter has only fueled further speculation and distrust among the global scientific community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origins-here-s-why-the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-is-back-in-news-101623049171660.html
07-06-2021||World||Nepal signed non-disclosure agreement for Sinopharm jabs: Report||Nepal has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the makers of China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine in order to gain access to doses amid questions about the legality of such an undertaking, according to a media report on Monday. The Nepal government has been desperately looking for alternate sources of vaccines after India temporarily halted the export of jabs in late March to cope with a devastating second wave. Close to a million people in Nepal who received the first dose of the Covishield vaccine are currently waiting for their second dose after the passage of more than two months. Also Read | AIIMS Delhi begins screening of children for Covaxin trialsSinopharm’s proposal for a non-disclosure agreement created a dilemma among officials of Nepal’s health ministry as the country’s laws don’t have a provision for non-disclosure agreements in public procurements, The Kathmandu Post reported. “The non-disclosure agreement was signed on Friday [June 4] between the Department of Health Services and Sinopharm electronically,” an unnamed official of the department told The Post. “After the Health Ministry authorised the director general to sign the agreement with Sinopharm, the agreement was signed.” The official further said the China National Pharmaceutical Group, the maker of Sinopharm, will quote a price after Nepal states how many doses it intends to procure. “Then the procurement process will move forward. I cannot say when the vaccines will be available,” the official said. Roshan Pokharel, the chief specialist at Nepal’s health ministry, said the government plans to buy 10 million doses but the Chinese side has said it cannot make this quantity available immediately. “We will initially get probably two million doses,” he said. China earlier supplied 1.8 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as grants to Nepal. Nepal’s Public Procurement Act of 2007 and the recent Covid-19 Crisis Management Ordinance are silent on non-disclosure agreements, though they allow the government to procure directly from suppliers or manufacturers without competitive bidding in extraordinary situations. According to Nepal’s Public Procurement Monitoring Office, details of all procurements must be disclosed under the existing law, except in situations where the government procures defence-related materials that are sensitive from a national security point of view. “If the existing procurement law and the ordinance don’t allow us to procure the much-needed vaccines through the non-disclosure agreement, the procurement process can move ahead only through a policy decision of the Cabinet,” said Taranath Pokharel, director of the Family Welfare Division of Nepal’s health ministry. “I think the Cabinet will take a decision to facilitate the vaccine procurement in the current pressing time,” he added. The controversy over Sinopharm vaccine in Nepal follows rows related to the jab in other countries. The procurement price of the Sinopharm vaccine in Sri Lanka triggered a row after reports emerged that Colombo paid a higher per-dose price than Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is paying $15 a dose, or $5 higher than what Bangladesh paid. Bahrain, which was one of the first countries to back the Sinopharm vaccine last year, has raised doubts about the jab’s effectiveness. Bahraini officials recently told the media that authorities will offer the Pfizer vaccine to high-risk individuals who had received two Sinopharm doses because these jabs didn’t appear to be enough in the face of a new wave of Covid-19 infections in the West Asian country. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted emergency use listing to Sinopharm, making it the first vaccine developed by China to be given such an approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-signed-non-disclosure-agreement-for-sinopharm-jabs-report-101623050553205.html
07-06-2021||World||Switzerland could become first European nation to ban artificial pesticides, referendum on June 13||Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agrochemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer and BASF.Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss winemaker Roland Lenz said."Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered," said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%."The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment," a Syngenta spokesman said.Life under siegeThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using the imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water."People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality," said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege."A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming," said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association."I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe," said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Winemaker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was "sheer lunacy", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant."With a 'Yes' vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-could-become-first-european-nation-to-ban-artificial-pesticides-referendum-on-june-13-101623047791685.html

These apps will offer their users special stickers, badges and bonuses to show if they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Tinder, Bumble and Hinge are some of the apps which are working together with the government, the Department of Health said on Sunday.This comes as the UK rollout this week reaches the under-30s, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed on Sunday.The United States launched a similar initiative in May, linking up with apps including Tinder, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish.The apps are also advertising the British government's "Every vaccination gives us hope" campaign.The Department of Health even suggested that users could boost their romantic chances by telling potential dates they are vaccinated.Meanwhile, the UK's department of health informed on Twitter that 67,994,584 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the country till June 6. "A brilliant team focused on protecting the Nation @NHSuk When you get the txt get the jab," vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Twitter.The unique tie-up between the UK government and dating apps comes after a YouGov poll in May found that 28 per cent of adults would not date someone who was unvaccinated and 31 per cent would prefer not to.However, despite turning to dating sites for help, the UK government has not formally given the green light to casual dating during the pandemic.British health minister Matt Hancock said on Sunday that the country's swift vaccine rollout had weakened, but not broken, the link between the virus, hospitalisation and death. Britain's overall death toll from the pandemic stands at 127,836 and is the sixth-highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Britain on Sunday reported 5,341 new cases of Covid-19, up 68 per cent from a week ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dating-apps-to-feature-covid-vaccine-stickers-in-the-uk-101623046285633.html

No further details were provided.Also Read: Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bidHarris has been tasked by President Joe Biden with addressing the root causes of the spike in migration to the U.S.-Mexico border, and her aides say corruption will be a central focus of her meetings with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday and Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday.“Corruption really does sap the the wealth of any country, and in Central America is at a scale where it is a large percentage of GDP across the region,” said special envoy Ricardo Zuniga.“We see corruption as one of the most important root causes to be dealt with,” Zuniga added.The trip got off to a rocky start when Harris' plane returned to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland about 30 minutes after takeoff because of what her spokesperson said was a problem with the landing gear. She departed on another plane and landed late Sunday in in Guatemala City, where she was met by Foreign Minister Pedro Brolo.Also Read: Plane, with VP Kamala Harris onboard, forced to return due to 'technical issue'Harris is seeking to secure commitments from Guatemala and Mexico for greater cooperation on border security and economic investment, and aides say she will also discuss vaccine sharing during her meetings. But corruption in the region — a far more intractable challenge — will complicate her efforts.It’s already had a significant impact on her work in Central America. Harris has yet to engage substantively with the leaders of Honduras and El Salvador, who are both embroiled in corruption scandals.Giammattei has faced criticism over corruption within his own government. Zuniga acknowledged that the U.S. government faces a challenge in working with him but argued Harris was in the country in part to have a direct conversation with the president about this and other issues.“The best way to deal with these cases where you have a very complex relationship in a country like Guatemala is to talk clearly and plainly as partners, as countries that have to get along” he said.Harris has laid out an approach centered on creating better opportunities and living conditions in the region through humanitarian and economic aid. She announced plans to send $310 million to provide support for refugees and address food shortages, and recently secured commitments from a dozen companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle countries to promote economic opportunity and job training.Washington won some goodwill through its vaccine diplomacy this past week. Giammattei and López Obrador both received calls from Harris on Thursday telling them the U.S. would be sending 500,000 doses and 1 million doses, respectively, of COVID-19 vaccine.While in Guatemala, Harris also plans to meet community leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. In Mexico, she will speak with female entrepreneurs and hold a roundtable with labor workers.She’s underscored the need to address corruption in public remarks and events. In a May meeting with a number of leading voices on Guatemala's justice system, she noted her work as a prosecutor and said that “injustice is a root cause of migration.”“Part of giving people hope is having a very specific commitment to rooting out corruption in the region,” she said.Harris has also raised the issue during virtual meetings with the leaders of both countries, and aides say she will do it again during meetings on her trip. During their past conversations, they have discussed areas of mutual interest — improving port security, fighting smuggling networks, going after corrupt actors — and the goal of this trip is to turn that talk into action, aides say.While the vice president will make announcements concerning new efforts at cooperation and new programs, she’s not expected to announce any new aid during her trip.While in Latin America, Harris will also have to navigate the politics of immigration. Congressional Republicans have criticized both Biden and Harris for deciding not to visit the border, and contend the administration is ignoring what they say is a crisis there. April was the second-busiest month on record for unaccompanied children encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border, following March’s all-time high. The Border Patrol’s total encounters in April were up 3% from March, marking the highest level since April 2000.Conservatives will be watching Harris closely for any missteps, hoping to drag her into further controversy on an issue that they see as a political winner.In her efforts to win commitments on corruption from the region's leaders, Harris can point to a number of moves by the Biden administration last week.Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the problem during his own recent trip to Central America. The White House issued a memo elevating foreign corruption to a major national security issue, and directed all federal agencies to prioritize it and modernize their foreign corruption-fighting tools.Eric Olson, director of policy at the Seattle International Foundation, which works to promote good governance in Central America, said that addressing corruption will take particular diplomatic skill. Harris will need to hold the leaders of Guatemala and Mexico accountable while also deepening trust and cooperation with the two nations.“The challenge that she faces is how to, on the one hand, have a conversation, keep the door open — while not seeming to ignore the obvious elephant in the room, which is this incredible penetration of the state by corrupt actors,” he said.In Mexico, López Obrador continues to face a complicated security situation in many parts of the country. Nearly three-dozen candidates or pre-candidates were killed before this weekend’s midterm elections as drug cartels sought to protect their interests. The government’s inability to provide security in parts of the country is of interest to the U.S. in an immigration context, both for the people who are displaced by violence and the impact it has on a severely weakened economy trying reemerge from the pandemic.The number of Mexicans encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection rose steadily from December through April. Mexico remains a key U.S. ally in trying to slow immigration, not only of its own citizens, but those crossing its territory. Successive U.S. administrations have effectively tried to push their immigration enforcement goals south to Mexico and Guatemala.Nongovernmental organizations placed Guatemala’s widespread corruption at the top of their list of concerns before Harris’ visit.Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei's administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them.The selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and alleged corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her.Harris’ visit comes with high expectations, but experts say clear progress on corruption may be elusive.“These are societies built on corruption,” said Olson. “You’re not gonna have an impact in six months.”___Sherman reported from Mexico City.

07-06-2021||World||World Food Safety Day on June 7: WHO underlines value of food security in Covid-hit era||June 7 each year is marked globally by the 'World Food Safety Day' as per the World Health Organization (WHO), observed annually to raise awareness about foodborne risks and help prevent, detect, and manage untoward diseases, in essence contributing to sustainable human development through proper food security. This year, i.e. on June 7, 2021, the global food safety watchdogs are especially highlighting the risks associated with harmful eating practices, in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which is believed to have begun spreading among humans two years ago from a 'wet market' in China's Wuhan.The need to establish a world food safety day was discussed in several sessions of the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) from 2016 onwards. A resolution was adopted on December 20, 2018, by the assembly to mark June 7 as the day to "celebrate the myriad benefits of safe food". Through World Food Safety Day, WHO works to mainstream food safety in the public agenda and reduce the burden of foodborne diseases globally. "Food safety is everyone's business," according to the public health agency.The World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution on August 3, 2020, to declare June 7 - the World Food Safety Day - as an important day to raise awareness at all levels about the importance of food safety, and for promoting and facilitating actions to prevent foodborne diseases at local, national, regional and global levels; to strengthen global efforts for food safety to reduce the burden of foodborne diseases.On World Food Safety Day this year, the theme is 'Safe food today for a healthy tomorrow'. With this, WHO intends to stress the fact that the production and consumption of safe food have immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet, and the economy. "Recognizing the systemic connections between the health of people, animals, plants, the environment, and the economy will help us meet the needs of the future," WHO stated.Since foodborne diseases are usually invisible to the eye and infectious or toxic in nature, Food safety has a critical role in assuring that food stays safe at every stage of the food chain - from production to harvest, processing, storage, distribution, all the way to preparation and consumption. A key precaution is preventing contamination through bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemical substances."Food safety is a shared responsibility between governments, producers, and consumers. Everyone has a role to play from farm to table to ensure the food we consume is safe and healthy," read an event update on the WHO website.On World Food Safety Day, it must be mentioned that while there is currently no evidence that suggests that the transmission of Covid-19 is associated with food, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that proper food safety etiquette is followed in general. This includes washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before preparing or eating food, and keep strict checks on the possibility of contamination of food products during storage or packaging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-safety-day-on-june-7-who-underlines-value-of-food-security-in-covid-hit-era-101623033898648.html

Officers can be seen grabbing and pushing people as an order to disperse is announced.A police spokesperson said eight officers suffered minor injuries while trying to clear the park. Most of the 23 people arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and given desk appearance tickets, the spokesperson said.The park in the heart of Greenwich Village has long been a scene of protests and vigils and is a popular gathering place for young people, including students from nearby New York University.The 10 pm curfew was first instituted during Memorial Day weekend after some neighborhood residents complained of late-night noise and drug use. The move was criticized Sunday by multiple Democratic mayoral candidates on social media.A spokesperson for the city Parks Department said Washington Square Park will close at 10 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights until further notice. The park is open until midnight Monday through Thursday.“Enforced closures are focused on addressing large after hours gatherings, amplified sound, excessive trashing of the park and other conditions on weekends,” the spokesperson, Crystal Howard, said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-say-23-arrested-during-clashes-over-nyc-park-curfew-101623033094883.html
07-06-2021||World||Nigeria's Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau 'kills himself': ISWAP||The Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) militant group said in an audio recording heard by Reuters on Sunday that Abubakar Shekau, leader of rival Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram, was dead.Shekau died around May 18 after detonating an explosive device when he was pursued by ISWAP fighters following a battle, a person purporting to be ISWAP leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi said on the audio recording."Abubakar Shekau, God has judged him by sending him to heaven," he can be heard saying.Two people familiar with al-Barnawi told Reuters the voice on the recording was that of the ISWAP leader.A Nigerian intelligence report shared by a government official and Boko Haram researchers have also said Shekau is dead.Last month, Nigeria's military said it was investigating Shekau's alleged death, also reported in Nigerian and foreign news outlets. The audio statement, first obtained by local media https://humangle.ng/iswap-confirms-shekaus-death-says-its-fighters-were-following-isis-orders, is ISWAP's first confirmation that its arch rival in the Lake Chad region has been killed.Islamic State "are consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and (Shekau's stronghold)," said Bulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change."ISWAP had framed Shekau as the problem and he was the only person they wanted to remove," Bukarti said of Islamic State's attempt to lure Boko Haram commanders and fighters to their side.Shekau's death could lead to the end of a violent rivalry between the two groups, enabling Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) to absorb Boko Haram fighters and consolidate its hold on territory in northeastern Nigeria, political analysts said.That would allow ISWAP to focus its attention on the government and military, whose war efforts are languishing.SHEKAU 'KILLED HIMSELF INSTANTLY'Boko Haram's leader was reported to have been killed on several occasions over the last 12 years, including in announcements by the military, only to later appear in a video post.In the audio recording, the man identified as al-Barnawi said his fighters had sought out the warlord on the orders of the Islamic State leadership, and battled Boko Haram insurgents until Shekau fled.ISWAP chased him down and offered him the chance to repent and join them, he said."Shekau preferred to be humiliated in the afterlife than getting humiliated on earth, and he killed himself instantly by detonating an explosive," he said.Boko Haram grabbed headlines worldwide with its 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, sparking a global campaign for their return dubbed #BringBackOurGirls, backed by the likes of Michelle Obama.Around 100 of the Chibok Girls are still missing, and some are thought to have died in captivity.Shekau led the transformation of Boko Haram from an underground Islamic sect in 2009 to a full-fledged insurgency, killing, kidnapping and looting its way across northeast Nigeria.The group has killed more than 30,000 people, forced around 2 million people to flee their homes and spawned one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.ISWAP was previously part of Boko Haram before its split five years ago, pledging allegiance to Islamic State. The schism was caused by religious ideological disagreements over the killing of civilians by Boko Haram, to which ISWAP objected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerias-boko-haram-leader-abubakar-shekau-kills-himself-iswap-101623030208687.html

07-06-2021||World||Trump back on stage, calls for China to pay $10tn reparations||Former US president Donald Trump has returned to public limelight with a speech in North Carolina in which he exhorted Republicans to gear up for the 2022 midterm elections, repeated allegations over his election loss, attacked top epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, and called for China to pay $10 trillion in “reparations” for the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump spoke at a convention of North Carolina Republicans, which his advisers have said will be the first of more such events. “The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump said in a characteristically rambling speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes.Republicans are hoping to win the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, closing and overtaking their eight-seat deficit in the 435-member chamber (they trail 211 to 219 Democrats, with five vacancies), and the 100-member senate, which they split evenly with Democrats. Midterms have tended to favour the party not holding the White House.Trump has managed to keep a tight grip on the Republican Party despite the initial outrage felt among many over his incitement of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, which houses the two chambers of US congress, as his party’s base, which plays a key role in the party primaries, remains largely loyal to him.“We are going to have a tremendous 2022 like we did frankly in 2020, more votes than any sitting president in the history of the US. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election,” Trump said, repeating claims of election fraud that were dismissed by more than 60 times by courts and the authorities.Since leaving office, Trump has kept a relatively lower profile. Deprived of social media accounts — Twitter has banned him permanently and Facebook and Instagram have suspended him until January 2023 — communicating largely through short statements, some interviews and advisers.He has teased a run for the White House in 2024 but has not committed himself to it yet. “We’re gonna take back the Senate, take back the House, we’re gonna take back the White House, and sooner than you think,” he said in a short fundraising video released ahead of the North Carolina speech.The former president went on to attack the Biden administration in his speech. “As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding, police departments are being ripped apart and defunded,” he said. He called the surge of immigrants at the border the start of the “Biden disasters”, criticised the president for rejoining the Paris climate accord and for his proposal to raise corporate tax.“Drugs are pouring in, gas prices are soaring, our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyberattacks,” he went on to say. “That’s a lack of respect for our country and our leaders.” Trump was referring to recent cyber-hacking of US companies. Experts pointed out that the most sweeping and egregious of them -- the SolarWinds attack -- took place on his watch.The former president also attacked Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying he is “not a great doctor, but a hell of a promoter”. Trump clashed with Fauci even while in office, which turned the epidemiologist into a target for the then president’s supporters.“Fauci said at the beginning, ‘no masks.’ Remember that? Then he became a radical masker. Get three, four. Get a pair of goggles, ideally. Wear them for another five or six years,” Trump said to laughter.The former president also doubled down on China over the Covid-19 pandemic, even as his administration was accused of poor handling of the public health crisis. “The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay -- they must pay,” he said, going on to suggest the amount be around $10 trillion, with extra tariff.Turning to his own legal troubles, he dismissed them as an extension of the “five-year witch-hunt” he said he had faced from the time he announced his candidature for the White House. He called the Manhattan district attorney’s case “the ultimate fishing expedition”. “It’s been a five-year witch hunt, hoax after hoax,” he added. “They’ll never stop until November of 2024.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-back-on-stage-calls-for-china-to-pay-10tn-reparations-101623014838178.html
07-06-2021||World||Mehul Choksi’s identity was known 3 days later; charged after 4 days: Dominica Police||The Dominica police has claimed in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi was found seated in suspicious condition on the bayside near the Jetty at Toucarie Bay around 11.30pm on May 24.However, the police charged him with “illegal entry” offence around 9pm on May 28, according to details of Dominica’s police affidavits exclusively accessed by HT.The affidavits filed by Dominica police have several new revelations as well as multiple contradictions. For example, one of the affidavits filed by a Superintendent of Police of Dominica says that after Choksi was found on May 24 and taken to the police station in Roseau, he was given a mattress and clothing at his request, a courtesy usually not extended to other normal prisoners in Dominica.It, however, doesn’t explain why this courtesy was extended to Choksi by the Dominica police.A Sergeant of Police deployed with Border Control in Dominica, who found Choksi at Toucarie Bay around 11:30pm on May 24 (a day after he went missing from Antigua), has said in his affidavit that the individual (Choksi) had a shopping bag in his hand. He stated his name as Choksi from Antigua and said that he was brought to Dominica on a boat, according to the Sergeant.After Choksi could not produce documentation regarding his visit to the country, the cops informed him that he was being arrested on the suspicion of entering Dominica at a place not appointed as an approved point of entry, according to this officer’s affidavit in the court.However, this officer’s added, even though Choksi was brought to the police station in Roseau on May 25 and a report of ‘illegal entry’ was made the same day, he was formally charged for the offence around 9pm on May 28.Choksi’s lawyers have argued last week in the ECSC that he was kept under illegal detention for almost 96 hours and was not produced within 72 hours in the court, according to the local law there. The Dominica police has denied these charges in its affidavits.All the officers of Dominica, in their affidavits, have claimed that Choksi repeatedly said he was abducted and brought to Dominica. However, they have claimed there were no signs that he was kidnapped and they didn’t see any boat.Interestingly, the Dominica police has claimed that it was on May 27 (Thursday), the department obtained his drivers’ licence which proved he was born in India and his name was Mehul Choksi, according to the details of affidavit filed by the Sergeant.However, an Inspector of Police of Dominica, in his affidavit, has claimed that identity of Choksi remained a matter of grave concern until May 28 (Friday) as he had no form of identification to ascertain his identity, age, place of residence or place of birth.At the same time, the Dominica police has stated in its affidavits that attorney-at-law Cara Shillingford (one of the lawyers of Choksi) had contacted them on May 26 to have access to Choksi.The Dominica police has said they didn’t allow Choksi any legal access as he refused to meet any legal representatives and insisted on going back to Antigua.The island’s police has further said they spent US$400 to buy new clothes for Choksi on May 26 and he had been provided access to four lawyers by May 27.It has also claimed that Choksi had refused medical attention after his capture even though he had injuries on his body.While in custody, Choksi was kept away from all the persons as extreme precaution as identity of kidnappers or his associates was not disclosed by him, the affidavit by Border Patrol officer states.While the Dominican police’s affidavits do not yet advocate repatriating Choksi back to India, they claim that investigation is being carried out in respect with his escape from India; the manner in which he fled Antigua after proceedings of revocation of his citizenship and extradition were filed there; and his motive behind coming to Dominica.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-s-identity-was-known-3-days-later-charged-after-4-days-dominica-police-101623008107379.html

However, he pointed out that a majority of those in hospital as a result of the Delta variant haven’t had a vaccine at all and only a “small minority” have had both doses.Asked if there could be a delay to the June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown restrictions in the UK, Hancock said the government is “absolutely open” to a delay if it needs to happen.US senators promise to give vaccines to TaiwanThe US will give Taiwan 750,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, part of President Joe Biden’s move to share tens of millions of jabs globally, three American senators said on Sunday, after the self-ruled island complained that China is hindering its efforts to secure vaccines as it battles an outbreak. Tammy Duckworth, who made a three-hour stop in Taiwan with Christopher Coons and Dan Sullivan, said their visit underscores US support for the democratic island.Study: HIV+ woman had Covid-19 for 216 daysA study has revealed that a 36-year-old woman in South Africa with advanced HIV had carried the coronavirus for 216 days.

The summit comes amid the biggest crisis in ties between the two countries in years, with tensions high over a number of issues.In an op-ed for The Washington Post published on Saturday, Biden promised to shore up Washington’s “democratic alliances” in the face of multiple crises and mounting threats from Moscow and Beijing.“We are standing united to address Russia’s challenges to European security... and there will be no doubt about the resolve of the United States to defend our democratic values, which we cannot separate from our interests,” he wrote.‘US can’t get away by threatening others’Putin earlier said the US was wrong to think that it is “powerful enough” to get away with threatening other countries, a mistake, he explained, that led to the downfall of the former Soviet Union.Putin made the sharp comments during a press briefing late on Friday as he spoke about US sanctions against Moscow, according to Russia’s news agency TASS.In April, the US imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market. “We hear threats from the Congress, from other sources. It is all done within the context of the US domestic political process.”Putin said such behaviour reminded him of the Soviet Union. “The problem with empires is that they think they are powerful enough to make some mistakes.“We will buy these [people], bully them, make a deal with them, give necklaces to them, threaten them with battleships. And this will solve all the problems. But problems accumulate.
