But political observers said it was unlikely to end the ongoing power tussle between him and state party president DK Shivakumar. It all started with the polls to elect the president of state youth Congress in February when Shivakumar-backed candidate Mohammed Harris Nalapad, the son of Congress legislator N A Harris, was disqualified after winning 64,203 votes out of the over 150,000 valid votes polled. In his place, Raksha Ramaiah, who polled 57,271 votes with Siddaramaiah’s backing, was declared the winner.The result led to an impasse and worsening of relationship between the two factions led by the two tallest Congress leaders in the state, in turn making it harder for the party to put up a united fight against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been beset with its own problems.People aware of the developments said that both Ramaiah and Nalapad have now agreed to a compromise, allowing the former to retain the position till the end of the year and pass it on to the latter thereafter.“Both of them have mutually come to an understanding that Raksha will remain [the youth congress president] till 31 December and then [the post] will be given to Nalapad,” Srinivas BV, the national president of the Indian Youth Congress told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Siddaramaiah too acknowledged that he favoured a compromise. “Now, the election officer has said that he will broker a compromise [between Raksha and Mohammed]. Make both of them sit together and get whatever compromise is all I have said,” Siddaramaiah said on Wednesday.However, Shivakumar refused to comment on the issue on Wednesday.People aware of the developments said that Raksha’s supporters were also not happy with the decision.This is not the first tussle between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. Both had also locked horns over the issue of party’s chief ministerial candidate in the run up to the state polls||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-says-he-backs-compromise-to-end-karnataka-feud-conflict-remains-101625075362509.html

30-06-2021||India||No weekend shutdowns in 20 Odisha districts, but malls to remain closed||Bhubaneswar: The Naveen Patnaik government on Wednesday extended the Covid lockdown till July 16 but relaxed restrictions in 20 of the state’s 30 districts where the infection is on the wane.Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said the statewide lockdown, which started on May 2, has yielded results and helped reduce the positivity rate from a high of more than 24% in April to 4.4% on Wednesday. Positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and over time it provides an idea of whether a region’s testing strategy is adequate to contain the virus. Mohapatra said 20 districts have been classified as category A where fewer restrictions will be in place as compared to the remaining 10 districts, classified as category B district because they are reporting a positivity rate of more than 5% and a higher number of active Covid cases. The category B districts on Wednesday account for 70% of the 3,371 fresh Covid cases.“We thank the people of Odisha for helping the state government achieve the objective of bringing the epidemic scenario in the state under control,” he said, as Odisha reported 3,371 new Covid cases and 48 Covid deaths over the last 24 hours. The cumulative Covid cases in Odisha climbed to 9,09,800.In the 20 category A districts, the government has allowed all activities including shops and commercial establishments to remain open between 6 am and 6 pm. Shops in malls, spas and beauty parlours will still remain closed and street food vendors can only serve take-away food only.Inter-district and intra-district public transport by buses will remain functional while two wheeler with pillion rider and four wheelers, auto rickshaws, taxis, including cabs/auto rickshaws by aggregators like Ola, Uber would be allowed with driver plus up to two passengers in the rear seat.The 20 districts in Category A are Angul, Baragarh, Bolangir, Boudh, Dhenkanal, Deogarh, Gajapati, Ganjam, Jharsuguda, Kandhamal, Kalahandi, Keonjhar, Koraput, Malkanagiri, Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Subarnapur and Sundargarh.The 10 districts in category B are Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh, Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur and Kendrapara. In these districts, the government has decided to continue with the weekend shutdown which will start from Friday 2pm and continue till Monday 6 am. Malls, cinema halls, jatras, or open air theatres, have been barred from reopening for now.Besides, the restrictions on marriages, funerals and thread ceremony will continue as usual in these 10 districts, the chief secretary said.Meanwhile, the Odisha government has directed all district administrations and civic bodies to ensure dignified disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients by local authorities in consultation with the bereaved family members while observing all Covid-19 protocols.Additional Chief Secretary (Health) PK Mohapatra in a letter to all district collectors, municipal commissioners and health officials said the authorities should sanitise and pack the bodies as per the central government guidelines. Bodies of Covid negative patients can be handed over to their relatives only if the family members so desire and give an undertaking to abide by Covid protocols like not opening the body bag or touching or kissing the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-weekend-shutdowns-in-20-odisha-districts-but-malls-to-remain-closed-101625072842455.html
30-06-2021||India||G20 for investment to ensure food security as part of Covid-19 emergency funding||The G20 on Wednesday called for investments to ensure food security, sustainable food systems and territorial development as part of Covid-19 emergency funding and long-term national recovery plans.It also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic was likely to add more than 100 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world in addition to more than 840 million people, who were likely to be affected by hunger by 2030, missing the target to end malnutrition and achieve “Zero Hunger” under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The meeting also called for accelerating adaptation of agriculture and food systems to climate change, which impacts agriculture output and is among the forces driving the rise in global hunger.The call was part of the Matera Declaration on food security, nutrition and food systems adopted at the conclusion of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy that was attended by external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The meeting was held to prepare for the G20 Summit later in the year.The Matera Declaration warned that as per current trends, the number of people affected by hunger will exceed 840 million by 2030.“These figures do not take into account the toll of the Covid-19 pandemic that is likely to add more than 100 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world, as people lost their jobs and income, with consequences on their food security,” the declaration said.Post-pandemic recovery efforts and equitable access to Covid-19 diagnostics and vaccines were among the other key issues discussed by the ministers of the bloc, which includes the European Union.Jaishankar appreciated Italy’s role in highlighting food security and said in a tweet: “The Matera Declaration reflects the Indian concern for the welfare of small & medium farmers, promoting local food cultures and recognising agri-diversity.”He said he had shared his views on contemporary challenges at the G20 meeting, adding that livelihood, health, digital access and climate action should constitute the new developmental priorities.“Covid has impacted the fight against poverty, hunger and disease across the world. It has pushed back the global development agenda, increasing vulnerability in many societies. India is today at the forefront of the response, giving food support to 800 million citizens,” he tweeted.The Matera Declaration sought enhanced “catalytic investments for food security, nutrition, and sustainable food systems and territorial development, as part of the substantial Covid-19 emergency funding and longer-term national recovery plans and packages”.It said this should be done “consistent with WTO obligations and taking into account the voluntary Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems”.All actors across the international financial architecture and financial ecosystem need to play a role in improving availability of and access to sustainable finance in the food and agriculture sector to enable small scale and family farmers and fisherfolk, agro-enterprises, cooperatives and other operators within food value chains to invest more in sustainable food systems, the declaration said.The meeting welcomed the establishment of a “Finance in Common” working group on financing sustainable food systems, led by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and highlighted the private sector’s critical role in supporting public efforts to improve agri-food systems.It also emphasised the importance of accelerating digital transformation and innovation, with adequate protection of intellectual property rights and data privacy and the voluntary transfer of technologies, for sustainable and resilient agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g20-for-investment-to-ensure-food-security-as-part-of-covid-19-emergency-funding-101625071284014.html

The testing facility will begin functioning from June 30. All railway stations in Goa along the Konkan Railway route will also have Covid testing centres, Udayavani quoted Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant as saying on Wednesday.Anyone entering Goa for work or for the purpose of tourism will need to undergo Covid-19 test on the spot. “Thousands of workers who had returned to their hometowns due to Covid-19 induced lockdown are now returning to Goa to resume work, which is why our railway stations are brimming with people. Madgaon station, which is also a major junction, is seeing a boom in the footfall of people. We have ramped up the Covid-19 testing facilities here,” Sawant said.Workers are returning to Goa from Karnataka, Odisha, and Maharashtra in big numbers. In addition, the state government has also ramped up testing facilities at Majali, a border fishing town between Goa and Karnataka. Following the return of the workers, many industries, including mining in north Goa, tourism in south and central Goa are coming back to life.Both Karnataka and Goa governments have set up special medical outposts on their respective side of the border where Covid test results are given on the spot to the persons who enter. Those who already have the RT-PCR negative report obtained within the last 72-hours will have free access to both sides of the border, say district authorities in Uttara Kannada district.On the southern border of Karnataka with Kerala, the respective governments have made RT-PCR reports compulsory for entry into both sides of the border. Testing facilities have been set up at border checkpoints in Mangaluru, Sullia, Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district, parts of Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, and Mysuru districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-puts-goa-karnataka-border-under-scrutiny-101625070741594.html
30-06-2021||India||NIA arrests 2 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in Darbhanga station blast case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in connection to the Darbhanga railway station blast that took place earlier this month in Bihar.NIA arrested two key accused -- Imran Malik and Mohd Nasir Khan -- from Hyderabad after visiting the scene of crime and noting the key inputs from the probe.The preliminary probe, NIA said, has revealed a trans-national conspiracy hatched by top operatives of terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba to execute terror acts across India and cause large-scale damage to life and property.The accused terrorists acted under the directions of Pakistan-based handlers of LeT, the investigative agency said. Khan and his brother Malik fabricated an incendiary IED and packed it in a parcel of cloth and booked the same in a long-distance train from Secunderabad to Darbhanga.The low intensity blast at the station was aimed at causing an explosion and fire in a running passenger train resulting in huge loss of lives and property.One of the accused, Khan had visited Pakistan in the year 2012 and had received training from handlers of LeT in fabrication of IED from locally available chemicals.Khan and Malik were also in touch with Pakistan based handlers of LeT over encrypted communication platforms, the NIA said. The accused will now be produced before the Special NIA Court in Patna, following which a detailed examination and probe will continue.On June 17, the parcel, booked in the name of one Mohd Sufian from Secunderabad, exploded upon arrival at Darbhanga junction. No one was injured in the low intensity blast.In the early probe, the NIA Investigation revealed that a forged PAN card was used in booking the packet from Secunderabad station.They said the income tax department revealed that the PAN card details were forged and the original card belonged to someone abroad. Forensic report of the empty 50 ml glass bottle retrieved from the site is still awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-2-lashkar-e-taiba-terrorists-in-darbhanga-station-blast-case-101625069499313.html

A bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that such a provision is doubtful given the current situation.“Can a citizen refuse to take a vaccine as a matter of right? It is doubtful whether the right to refuse to take the vaccine can be exercised in such circumstances,” the court observed according to a report by news agency PTI.The court also pointed out that vaccination is not only to protect an individual but to cater to the larger interest of public health. The court said that when the question of public health arises there is a possibility that an unvaccinated person may be asymptomatic and yet be a carrier of the disease therefore casting doubt over the ‘right to refuse’ vaccination.The court made this observation after the State observed an element of reluctance in some quarters regarding the Covid-19 vaccine. The court asked the authorities to persuade citizens with awareness campaigns, scientific data and inform them that the vaccine is indispensable when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.The court also highlighted that there needs to be a plan to vaccinate persons with disabilities and also those who do not have resources to travel in semi-urban or rural areas. The court said that it hopes that people with disabilities irrespective of their status and resources will be taken care of by the State in due course. The matter was adjourned till July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-refuse-vaccine-doubtful-in-present-situation-madras-hc-101625069215214.html
30-06-2021||India||India asks EU member states to accept Covishield and Covaxin vaccines||India has asked European Union (EU) member states to accept Covid-19 vaccines authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) or national authorities, such as Covishield and Covaxin, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. The Indian side also informed EU member states that it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the “green pass” from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc includes vaccines being administered in India in the EU Digital Covid Certificate, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. The EU had clarified on Tuesday that the green pass is not a precondition to travel and individual member states have the option to accept vaccines approved by WHO such as Covishield. The clarification came against the backdrop of speculation about the possible impact of the green pass on Indian nationals as the regime doesn’t include any of the vaccines currently being administered in India. The green pass framework is set to be in place from July 1 to facilitate free movement within the 27-member bloc during the Covid pandemic. Under this framework, persons vaccinated with four vaccines currently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU. Questions have arisen about Indian travellers to Europe facing problems as EMA has cleared Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine, Spikevax or the Moderna vaccine, and Vaxzevria or the European version of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Serum Institute of India (SII), which makes Covishield or the Indian version of the AstraZeneca shot, is approaching EMA for its approval. “We have requested EU member states to individually consider extending exemption to travellers who have taken Covid-19 vaccines in India, such as Covishield and Covaxin, and to accept the vaccination certificate issued through the CoWIN portal,” said one of the people cited above. The genuineness of Indian vaccination certification can be authenticated on the CoWIN portal, the people said. India has also conveyed to EU member states that New Delhi will institute a reciprocal policy for recognising the EU Digital Covid Certificate. “Upon notification of Covishield and Covaxin for inclusion in the EU Digital Covid Certificate framework and recognition of Indian CoWIN vaccination certificates, Indian health authorities will reciprocally exempt travellers from the concerned EU member state carrying the green pass from mandatory quarantine,” the person said. External affairs minister S Jaishankar took up the issue of approving the Covishield vaccine for travel to Europe during a meeting on Tuesday with Josep Borell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The two leaders met on the margins of a meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Italy. “A comprehensive review of our relationship with EUHR VP @JosepBorrellF. Taking forward the agenda of the Leaders’ Summit. Discussed vaccine production and access. Took up ‘Covishield’ authorisation for travel to Europe. Will be following up,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting. On Tuesday, German ambassador Walter Lindner tweeted that his country recognises a double shot of Covishield as “valid proof of anti-Covid vaccination”. He added that this “does nevertheless not modify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern/virus variants areas”. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being used for India’s immunisation programme. The EU Digital COVID Certificate will serve as proof that a person was vaccinated, received a negative test result or recovered from Covid-19. Temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU are currently in place from many countries, including India, due to the pandemic. EU member states are expected to gradually lift these restrictions at external borders as the health situation improves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-eu-member-states-to-accept-covishield-and-covaxin-vaccines-101625068162125.html

Police are investigating the threat. The senior leader said the letter, written in Malayalam, was mailed to the MLA hostel, where he stays. He surmised that the language suggested the letter was written by someone from north Kerala. “It said I will be targeted for including more names in [the] criminal list. It seems it could be a move from some of the accused in T P Chandrasekharan murder case,” the MLA said. Radhakrishnan was the state home minister when Chandrasekharan, a rebel communist leader, was hacked to death by a group owing allegiance to the CPI (M) in 2012.

Priyanka held a meeting with Sidhu at her residence this morning.After meeting Sidhu, Priyanka went to Rahul Gandhi's residence and had a 40-45-minutes-long meeting with him, reported news agency ANI.Post this round of meeting with Rahul, Priyanka again held a meeting with Sidhu at her residence.Also read: ‘Capt Amarinder is not the Congress... he lies every day’, says Navjot Singh SidhuThe cracks from the infighting appeared for the public view after Sidhu, who is critical of party leader and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, accused him of colluding with the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Congress’s arch-rival in Punjab.Sidhu arrived in Delhi on Monday ahead of his meeting with the Gandhis and was scheduled to meet the leaders. The meeting has been dubbed as a crucial one for the party which does not want to part ways with the cricketer-turned-politician.Rahul Gandhi has attempted to address the growing factionalism in Congress’ Punjab unit. He held one-to-one meetings with over 20 party leaders from the state last week.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi formed a three-member committee to resolve the rift. In its report on June 10, the panel suggested that Sidhu be suitably accommodated in the state unit.Also read: Sidhu meets Priyanka Gandhi amid rumblings within Congress’s Punjab unitSidhu has expressed his desire to be the state unit chief. But the chief minister, the biggest vote-catcher for the party in the poll-bound state, is averse to the idea. Differences between the two led to Sidhu’s resignation from the state Cabinet in July 2019.In their last seen episode of contention, former Punjab minister Sidhu on May 21 challenged CM Singh to prove that he had met any leader of another party for switching sides.“Prove one meeting that I have had with another party’s leader. I have never asked anyone for any post till date. All I seek is Punjab’s prosperity. Was invited and offered Cabinet berths many times but I did not accept. Now, our esteemed high command has intervened, Will wait,” the Amritsar East MLA tweeted.Amarinder and Sidhu had met over tea in March following reports that the Congress central leadership had been trying to rehabilitate the MLA who had resigned as minister after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio in 2019. After the meeting, Amarinder had expressed confidence that Sidhu would be back in his cabinet.Sidhu had joined the Congress after leaving the BJP before the 2017 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-reaches-rahul-gandhi-s-residence-amid-turbulence-in-punjab-congress-101625061428990.html
30-06-2021||India||SC calls for Baba Ramdev’s speech on allopathy, plea listed for Monday||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed yoga guru Baba Ramdev to produce the original text of his speech questioning the efficacy of allopathy that made the Indian Medical Association (IMA) register multiple FIRs against him in different states.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana has asked him to file the document by Monday, the date for next hearing on the yoga guru’s plea to stay arrest following two criminal cases filed by IMA in Patna and Raipur. Ramdev has also sought that these two cases be clubbed.The Patanjali Yogpeeth founder made disparaging remarks held to be unscientific and promoting vaccine hesitancy while questioning allopathy’s efficacy vis a vis coronavirus while talking to followers on May 19.Ramdev stirred controversy claiming he didn’t need Covid-19 vaccine since he had dual protection of yoga and Ayurveda. He also claimed that the thousands of fatalities caused by Covid-19 showed that allopathy was not 100% effective. He also alleged that a section of the society was deliberately engaged in discrediting the ancient Indian science of healing. Several experts said Ramdev’s comments could be seen as promoting vaccine hesitancy at a time when it was the only effective way of fighting the global pandemic.Although, he later clarified that he intended no ill-will to doctors. Delhi Medical Association filed a suit against him in the Delhi high court and IMA lodged FIRs in several other states including Bihar and Chhattisgarh..Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the yoga guru before the Supreme Court, said that Ramdev had no axe to grind against doctors. “I propounded that ayurveda is better than allopathy. I am a public figure and I am entitled to have a view. I am not against anybody but everybody has a right to freedom of speech and expression.”The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, could not find the original text of Ramdev’s speech, leading to Rohatgi seeking an adjournment to bring it on record.Ramdev has pleaded that despite his apology, the IMA went ahead to file cases against him. The FIRs at Patna and Raipur include charges of intentionally causing insult with the intent to provoke breach of peace, punishable with a maximum sentence of two years under Section 504 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Ramdev has also been charged with other offences under the IPC and the Disaster Management Act.Rohatgi said Ramdev being a public figure seeks protection of the highest court since it was not feasible to approach individual high courts in view of multiple FIRs filed by IMA branches across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-calls-for-baba-ramdev-s-speech-on-allopathy-plea-listed-for-monday-101625063841899.html

Besides, kiranas are expected to achieve approximately USD 1.5 trillion sales by 2030.The insights were presented during RedSeer's Ground Zero 5.0 event."Today, over 50 per cent of customers say they use online services because of convenience. A few years back, almost 70 per cent used to say the key reason is discounting but with the hit of COVID, digital services have undoubtedly served the customers very well, which is evident in high customer satisfaction and customers willingness to keep using the digital as a key channel to fulfill their needs," RedSeer founder and Chief Executive Officer Anil Kumar said.He added that the next wave of entrepreneurs will create innovations that will make the Indian model successful globally.In a fireside chat, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said massive disruption is taking place globally amid the pandemic. He noted that companies are looking for alternate destinations and that India can become an integral part of the global supply chain.Former Infosys executive and Manipal Global Education Services Chairman TV Mohandas Pai stated that India doesn't have a chip industry, which requires huge investments. He called on industrialists like RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekhar to invest in the semiconductor ecosystem because "without the chips, our future electronics are not going to be so good"."There's a lot of work going on in this direction right now...this is our top priority," Kant said. The digital economy includes 60 per cent of travel, 40 per cent of non-grocery retail, 30 per cent of education, 25 per cent of food and beverages services, and 6 per cent of pharma/grocery going through digital channels by 2030.As per RedSeer data, 88 per cent of the online shoppers that will be added between 2020-2030 will be from tier II cities and beyond.Further, more than 7 billion cumulative incremental online retail transactions to be added from customers in tier II cities and beyond, while over USD 150 billion worth of cumulative incremental online retail GMV is expected to be added from these locations between 2020 and 2030.RedSeer said e-logistics in India has become the fastest-growing market globally with over 3 billion shipments in 2020, and new-age logistics players are expected to deliver 2.5 billion D2C (direct to customers) shipments by 2030.With the rise of e-commerce, the need for specialised delivery services emerged, which led to the overall growth of the logistics segment. Emergence of this sector is creating 5 lakh employment opportunities for gig workers in 2021.According to RedSeer research, shared mobility saw a sharp decline due to the second wave-led lockdowns in the last two months. Although the autos segment recovered the fastest, the overall sector merely clocked 18 million rides, a drop from 113 million rides in January last year.However, while the shared mobility is dipping, personal mobility space is riding on a wave of strong traction seen since last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-consumer-digital-economy-to-touch-800bn-backed-by-e-commerce-redseer-101625062493762.html

30-06-2021||India||Death within 2-3 months of testing positive to be counted as Covid death: SC||New Delhi: People who died within two to three months after testing Covid-19 positive will be counted as death due to Covid-19, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday as it directed the Centre to incorporate this benchmark in its guidelines for death certificates in case of Covid-19 deaths. The procedure followed by states and union territories in registering deaths came under the judicial scanner in two public interest litigations filed by advocates Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal.The court had repeatedly observed throughout the proceedings that persons affected by Covid-19 can die due to other complications. Unfortunately, the judges noted in its verdict on Wednesday, the guidelines issued by the Centre and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) did not specifically deal with this aspect.Also Read: SC grants Centre 6 weeks to fix ex-gratia for deaths due to Covid-19According to Union health ministry data, 3,98,454 people have died due to Covid since the first death was reported in Karnataka in March last year.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah directed the appropriate authority to frame a “simplified procedure or guidelines” for issuing an official document or death certificate to the family of those who died due to Covid-19. This document should state the exact cause of death as “Death due to Covid-19”, added the bench.“If a person has died after he was found Covid positive and he has died within two to three months, either in the hospital or outside the hospital or at home, the death certificate or official document must be issued to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 stating the cause of death as ‘Died due to Covid-19’,” the bench said.Presently, death certificates do not mention cause of death. This is due to the bar placed under Section 17 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969. This provision states that “no extract relating to any death, issued to any person, shall disclose the particulars regarding the cause of death as entered in the register.”For families who have already received death certificates and intend to apply for correction with regard to cause of death, the court directed the authority concerned to provide the remedy available to such families under the guidelines.The court while considering the petitions recognised the plight of many families who lost their dear ones due to after-effects of Covid-19 but the cause of death was not certified as due to Covid.The bench said, “It is the duty of every authority to issue accurate/correct death certificates stating the correct and accurate cause of death, so that the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 may not face any difficulty in getting the benefits of the schemes that may be declared by the Government for the death of the deceased, who died due to Covid-19.”During the arguments in the case, the central government pointed out that it is mandatory for states to register all deaths due to Covid-19. It referred to an October 2020 communication issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to all states/UTs. It said, “All deaths with a diagnosis of Covid-19, irrespective of comorbidities, are to be classified as deaths due to Covid-19. It is submitted that the only exception could be where there is a clear alternative cause of death, that cannot be attributed to Covid-19 (e.g., accidental trauma, poisoning, acute myocardial infarction, etc), where Covid-19 is an incidental finding.”Broad guidelines for recording of Covid-19 related deaths in India were prepared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and issued in May 2020 to all states. These guidelines stated that positive deaths would imply deaths related to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-within-2-3-months-of-testing-positive-to-be-counted-as-covid-death-sc-101625062941973.html

30-06-2021||India||Top army officer says state help from across border possible for drone attack||Indian Army’s 15 Corps Commander hinted on Wednesday at the possibility of Pakistan aided terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish –e- Mohammed being responsible for the drone attack on a Jammu Air Force base considering the technology involved.“We are well aware that these assets and tech [for] drone warfare, for example, cannot just be made on the roadside. These indicate state-supported systems and technology… and state supported, or state sponsored, technology definitely indicates Jaish and Lashkar,” Lieutenant general DP Pandey, Corps Commander of the 15 Corps in Srinagar, told NDTV in an interview.On Sunday, two air force personnel were injured and a building was damaged when suspected drones dropped two explosive payloads on the high security air force station in Jammu. The case is now being investigated by multiple agencies including the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State (IS) fighters.Soon after the attack, a high alert was issued around Srinagar airport and major army installations and security camps in forward areas.The corps commander said the investigations into the attack are going on and an initial analysis of data indicated “a certain level of guidance from state actors”.“The capability or capacity exists to modify drones, which are locally available as well… with a certain level of guidance from state actors, they can be modified to carry out these attacks.”Terrorists organisations based in Pakistan have been using drones to drop off arms, ammunition and money in bordering areas to help militants carry out attacks. Analysis of one such captured drone had revealed that it had been assembled using parts made by different manufacturers for deniability.“The next level in this is greater deniability – an attempt to say this is possibly internal,” he said.The army officer said that the drone threat was likely to keep on increasing. “We are aware and have taken advanced measures over the past few days to re-orient ourselves. As a unit, the army is looking for proactive solutions and I am very confident that we can take care of this challenge as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-army-commander-says-state-help-from-across-the-border-possible-for-drone-attack-101625060901701.html

Another such attack was thwarted within 24 hours by alert security forces that opened fire on unidentified drones hovering over Kaluchak military base in Jammu. Several such sightings have taken place since then over military bases in the region.Experts have said that this is the first time that drones are being used in an attack on a major defence installation in the country. There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs, and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts said Sunday’s attack represented a new security threat.The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State fighters for one, to target forces in Iraq and Syria for years that prompted the United States and drone manufacturers to spend millions of dollars on research to stop what are sometimes called, the “killer bees”.Initial investigations into Sunday’s attack have pointed to the role of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the drone strike at a Jammu air force station.Following the development, armed forces and military installations at forward bases have been alerted and asked to maintain full vigil to counter this new threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-low-flying-objects-banned-in-rajouri-following-jammu-drone-attack-101625058261757.html

Bhagat, who was 24 at the time of murder, cited slow pace of trial in the case, which has been delayed further due to the pandemic, to seek bail. The trial is set to resume on July 14, but is expected to face further delays. Advocate Vikram Varma, who is representing the family of the victim, said the bail plea was firmly opposed by the family and the prosecution.Danielle’s mother Andrea Brannigan had earlier said that if allowed to walk out on bail, Bhagat may disappear making her wait for justice even longer. “I was so anxious and scared he would get bail today. I have been waiting for justice since the 14th of March 2017, even though I was promised it would be fast tracked. It is causing me great anxiety and worry,” Brannigan said. McLaughlin, 28, who hailed from Donegal in Northwest Ireland, visited Goa in 2017 with a friend and celebrated Holi in coastal Canacona village, known for its popular beach Palolem. She was befriended by Bhagat during the trip and murdered on March 14 after the two spent an evening together. Danielle was reportedly attacked with a stone and was found lying in a pool of blood without clothes with injuries to her head and face.A post-mortem concluded that McLaughlin died due to brain damage and constriction of the neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goan-man-accused-of-killing-irish-girl-danielle-denied-bail-101625056101774.html

The clarification by the ministry comes in response to the media reports that expressed concerns regarding infertility due to Covid-19 vaccination amongst the population of reproductive age and its safety for lactating women."None of the available vaccines affects the fertility of either men or women, as all vaccines and their constituents are tested first on animals and later on humans to assess if they have any such side effects. Vaccines are authorized for use only after their safety and efficacy are assured," the health ministry said in an official statement.Also read: India has administered over 330 million Covid vaccines till nowIn order to curb the prevalent myths regarding vaccination, the government has been fact-checking several claims. The ministry also cited such myths busted by the government through PIB Fact Check regarding infertility due to vaccination.It further said that there is no scientific evidence to suggest Covid-19 vaccination can cause infertility in men and women. "The vaccines have been found to be safe and effective," the ministry said as it cited fact-checked claims.Dr N K Arora, chairperson of Covid-19 Working Group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) also countered such fears and allegations and said that such misinformation was also created during administering Polio vaccine in India and abroad, as it was claimed that children who get the vaccine may face infertility in future. Dr Arora assured that all vaccines go through intense scientific research and none of the vaccines have this sort of side-effect, in a recent interview, the ministry said.Meanwhile, regarding safety concerns for lactating women, the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) had recommended vaccination for all lactating women and termed it safe without the need to stop or pause breastfeeding before or after the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-vaccine-affects-fertility-clarifies-health-ministry-101625050744190.html

Covid-19 in children is often asymptomatic and seldom requires hospitalisation, officials said in a statement."During the Covid-19 second wave in the country, several questions have been raised in the media regarding higher vulnerability of children to get adversely impacted by Covid-19 during the subsequent waves, if any," officials said in a statement.The experts have allayed these fears and apprehensions on several platforms," the statement added.Stating that children who catch Covid-19 often remain asymptomatic, officials said there is a possibility of a small percentage of children who get infected requiring hospitalisation."The healthy children recovered with mild illness without need for hospitalisation while the ones admitted in the hospital due to Covid-19 infection during second wave either had co-morbidities or low immunity," the statement added.Moreover, officials said that there is no data, either from India or globally, to show that children will be seriously infected in the subsequent Covid-19 waves.The government said adequate arrangements are being made in terms of healthcare infrastructure in a bid to provide effective care and treatment to children who may get infected.The government has also ramped up its efforts to bring children under the vaccination ambit and said Covaxin trials have also been started in children between 2-18 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-not-to-be-affected-severely-in-next-covid-19-waves-govt-explains-why-101625049027192.html
30-06-2021||India||Jaishankar calls for debate on responsibility, accountability of Big Tech firms||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called for a debate on the responsibility, accountability and influence wielded by big tech companies as “non-state players”, saying such issues cannot be brushed under the carpet.Jaishankar’s remarks came against the backdrop of a tussle between social media giant Twitter and the Indian government following the implementation of controversial new digital media rules. He made the comments while participating in a virtual conversation with former UK prime minister Tony Blair.The minister said there was a debate in different parts of the world on big tech, including a “very vigorous one in India”. While acknowledging technology and innovation as forces of progress that had opened new vistas, Jaishankar said there is also a need for democratic societies to debate the responsibility that comes along with the power wielded by big tech companies.Without naming any particular company, Jaishankar said, “In a democratic society, we have to ask ourselves...big tech is there, it’s very visibly in my life. You have a big presence [but] where is the responsibility which comes with it? They have huge power, where is the accountability?”He added, “This is again not an issue limited to India. They harvest our data as they do across the world. So you have, in a sense, the opposite of the American revolution, which is you have representation and no taxation.”Besides looking at the role of big tech as a governance issue, a political issue, and a democratic issue, there is also the need to examine the influence such firms command, he said.“International relations have been devised on the basis of state-based players. What happens when you have non-state players who in some ways are bigger than many states? These are very serious questions which need debating,” Jaishankar said.“I think they can’t be brushed under the carpet, saying you shouldn’t question them because then you are attacking freedom of speech. I think that’s a cop out. It obviously serves their interest, so it’s a very, very legitimate debate.”Blair, while responding to a question on big tech companies challenging democracy from the moderator of the conversation organised by India Global Forum, described such firms as “vast behemoths with enormous power”.He said many firms should now be seen as public interest companies since they have enormous impact on the lives of people, and there is a need for a regulatory framework within which they should operate.Blair said another key issue is the digital divide, as hundreds of millions of people don’t have access to technology. He also called for focus on the power of China in the technology sphere.Twitter is currently engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new IT rules, which came into effect on May 23. The government has criticised Twitter for deliberate failure to comply with the new guidelines that mandate appointments of chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with more than 500 million users. The US giant also recently lost its intermediary status in India, making Twitter liable for any unlawful user-generated content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-calls-for-debate-on-responsibility-accountability-of-big-tech-firms-101625052021600.html

Kant will succeed incumbent DGP Loknath Behera, who retired on Wednesday. He is reported to the be first Dalit officer on the chief post in the police department of the southern state.Kant is a 1988 batch officer and was picked by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for the top post from the list of officers recommended by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).Kant's selection came as a surprise as media reports have predicted vigilance director Sudesh Kumar and Fire and Rescue Services director general B Sandhya as the primary contenders of the post.Hailing from New Delhi, Kant began his police career in the Kerala cadre as an assistant director in the Intelligence Bureau. This was followed by his stints under various designations in the state as the chief of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, Prisons and Correctional Services and Fire Force. He has also received the President's police medal for meritorious services.Kant is still additional director general of police (ADGP) and would be promoted to the rank only by the end of the next month, PTI reported quoting officials aware of the development. Interestingly, he has only seven months of service but may get an extension according to the new guidelines relating to the appointment of the state police chief.Meanwhile, Behera during his farewell stressed the need to regulate drone usage in Kerala in view of the recent terror attack in Jammu airport using the unmanned aerial vehicle. Retiring after 36 years of service, Behera, who is an Odisha native said he is a Malayalee at heart and would continue to wear 'mundu', as part of his love for the state.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-kant-to-be-new-police-chief-of-kerala-101625047479916.html

Three members of the council, including Safina Baigh, are independents.The couple quit Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP last year after Safina Baig was denied a ticket to contest the DDC election. She successfully contested as an independent and was later elected the chairperson with the support of five members of the Apni Party and People’s Conference.The People’s Conference disassociated itself from Muzaffar Hussain Baig after disagreements over the stand he took at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s all-party meeting with leaders from Jammu & Kashmir last week. Lone and Muzaffar Hussain Baig attended the meeting together.People Conference leader Imran Reza Ansari said that Muzaffar Hussain Baig was never with their party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cloud-over-baramulla-ddc-chairperson-after-lone-s-party-disassociates-with-baig-101625048781348.html

There are more like him who move around in vehicles fitted (with) beacons and (government) logos. I have a doubt that such fake officers were introduced in the election process, and they manipulated the polling and counting. I have also heard that Deb was once the convener of the (ruling) TMC (Trinamool Congress)’s IT (information technology) cell in south Kolkata. He was involved both with the government and with the party. Senior TMC leaders knew everything about him and that is why he was able to continue the racket for so long,” said Ghosh.Deb, who is accused of masquerading as a bureaucrat, has been arrested for allegedly organising fake Covid-19 vaccination camps in Kolkata. He has been seen in photos with many TMC leaders. TMC leaders have maintained it is impossible to check the credentials of everyone in public programmes where photos are being clicked.The TMC rubbished Ghosh’s allegations. “Ghosh seems to know many things about these imposters. He could have lodged a complaint before the elections. I will urge the Kolkata Police to make him a party to the case relating to the fake vaccination racket so that more details could be retrieved. The BJP is trying to find an excuse and hide its face after the humiliating defeat in the assembly polls. But there is a limit even to wild allegations,” said TMC leader Kunal Ghosh.Election Commission officials in Kolkata refused to comment on Ghosh’s charges.The BJP set a target to win more than 200 assembly seats in the assembly polls but could manage only 77. The TMC returned to power for the third time by winning 213 seats out of the 292 for which the polls were held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-officers-planted-to-manipulate-bengal-polls-alleges-bjp-101625047640943.html

Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners of Jammu & Kashmir and the three states are ex-officio members of the commission.HT on June 26 reported the commission was planning interactions with the stakeholders in Jammu & Kashmir. The commission, which has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise, will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir.Also Read | J&K police recruitment: Large number of women turn up for PETThe constituencies are being created on the basis of “physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience”.The commission, which was granted a yearlong extension in March to complete the exercise, has collated census and geographical data to factor in the existing difficulties and communication needs of the region.“There are considerations of a geographical nature, such as access in hilly districts. The Commission will have to ensure that the most basic administrative block, whether it is the tehsil or the district, is not broken down in the process. This way there can be seamless elections and effective implementation of government schemes,” said a person familiar with the matter on June 26.The delimitation of new assembly constituencies will be based on the 2011 census data. The constituencies will go up from 107 to 114.The last redrawing of constituencies was done in 1995 on the basis of the 1981 census when the erstwhile state was governed under its own Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir Representation of the People Act because of the region’s special status. The status was revoked in 2019. After the 2001 census, the Jammu & Kashmir assembly passed a law putting delimitation on hold until 2026.The issue of delimitation was discussed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir last week. This was the first meeting of its kind since the Centre ended the region’s special status.Former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has said the delimitation exercise should be undertaken with the rest of the country due after 2026. An amendment was passed by Parliament to freeze the constituencies demarcated in 2002 until 2026.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-commission-to-visit-j-k-from-july-6-to-july-9-101625046802042.html

The price rise will be effective on all brands of Amul milk, including Gold, Taaza, Shakti, T-special, as well on cow and buffalo milk etc. The price is being hiked after a gap of nearly one year and seven months, officials said. An increase in the production cost is the reason behind the price rise, the company said. "Prices of Amul milk will be increased by ₹2 per litre across India from tomorrow. The new prices will be applicable on all Amul milk brands like Gold, Taaza, Shakti, T-special, as well on cow and buffalo milk," said RS Sodhi, Managing Director, GCMMF, which markets Amul brand of milk and dairy products. Sodhi said the hike in the milk price became necessary due to the rise in food inflation. "Additionally, the cost for packaging has gone up by 30 to 40 per cent, the transportation cost by 30 per cent, and the energy cost by 30 per cent, which led to the increase in the input cost," he said.Though the price hike may come across as a jolt to many consumers amid the soaring price of fuel and vegetables, the company said that the increase is much lower than the average food inflation. "The increase of ₹2 per litre translates into a 4% increase in MRP, which is much lower than average food inflation," the company statement read."Given the increase in input costs, our member unions have also increased farmers' price in the range of ₹45 to ₹50 per kg fat, which is more than 6% over the previous year," the company said.The price rise in turn will benefit milk producers as it is the company's policy to pass on almost 80 paise of every rupee paid by consumers for milk to the milk producers.Milk price in the country was last revised in December 2019 when Amul raised the price by ₹3 per litre in Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, West Bengal and Maharashtra. At the same time, Mother Dairy too announced an increase in milk prices by ₹3 per only in Delhi-NCR owing to a lower supply.Amul's business grew during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown as the consumption of milk products has seen a steep rise during the period. In April 2020, Amul's milk cooperatives sold around 255 to 260 litres of milk every day, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amul-milk-price-to-increase-by-rs-2-per-litre-across-india-from-july-1-101625046486950.html

In both the case, the beneficiaries raised suspicion after they did not receive any message from Co-Win, the one-stop-shop IT platform for India's vaccination drive. Both the cases are under investigation and it is yet to be found whether what was administered to these people were harmful or not.In a first official comment, the Union health ministry on Wednesday said these instances are "individual aberration", which could be caught only spotted because of the centralised IT platform Co-Win. "As we have vaccinated over 33 crore people, such instances of individual failure now can be easily spotted the moment you do not receive an SMS from Co-Win. We are in touch with states which are taking action against such scams," Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the Union health ministry said on Tuesday when asked about the vaccination scam in Mumbai and Kolkata.TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty recovering now after falling prey to fake vaccine campPrime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised strict monitoring of two things, whether there is any adverse impact after vaccination and whether everyone is getting the second dose of the vaccine, Lav Agarwal said, explaining how Co-Win checks all the boxes, apart from alerting people if they have been subject to any scam.#LargestVaccineDrive #Unite2FightCorona कोरोना पोर्टल पर टीकाकरण के लिए पंजीकरण करवाने में आने वाली सभी समस्याओं के लिए भारत सरकार ने आईटी टीम का गठन किया है। वो इस पर कड़ी नज़र रख रही है।-लव अग्रवाल, संयुक्त सचिव, स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय @PMOIndia @drharshvardhan pic.twitter.com/ZhnAR87R0PWhat happened in MumbaiThe residents of a highrise in Mumbai were conned when an event management company got them vaccinated but they were neither registered on Co-Win, neither did they receive their certificates promptly. Several incongruities emerged when they were issued their certificates. Several production companies have been duped like this. According to preliminary reports, the residents were given saline water. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the government will do antibody tests of everyone who have been apparently conned and then these people will get Covishield depending on what ICMR suggests.What happened in KolkataDebanjan Deb, a 28-year-old man, impersonated as Kolkata Municipal officer and organised two vaccine camps in Kolkata. In one of these vaccine camps, Trinamool MP Mimi Chakraborty was invited. As the MP took the jab but did not receive any SMS, she raised an alarm based on which the entire fake vaccine racket got busted. It is not yet known what was administered to these people in the name of vaccines. An SIT has been set up for investigation and an attempt to murder charge has been slapped on Debanjan Deb. An expert committee has also been formed to find out whether these people will need to take the first dose once again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-vaccination-in-mumbai-kolkata-what-health-ministry-says-on-this-101625044852637.html
30-06-2021||India||Centre seeks report on fake vaccination racket busted in Bengal||The Centre has sought a report from the West Bengal government by Thursday on the fake vaccination racket busted by the Kolkata Police last week.Over 800 people, including ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) Member of Parliament Mimi Chakraborty, are suspected to have been injected with antibiotic amikacin instead of Covid-19 vaccines at fake vaccination camps organised in Kolkata earlier this month. Debanjan Deb, 28, who impersonated as a bureaucrat, allegedly organised the camps.“It is requested that the matter may be urgently enquired into and the factual position about the serious allegations clarified immediately and that, suitable and strict action may be taken in the matter, if necessary. It is also requested that a factual report on the matter may be sent to the ministry in the next two days,” said a Centre’s letter to the state’s chief secretary on Tuesday.On June 25, Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan seeking a probe by a central agency into the racket.The Kolkata Police have set up a Special Investigation Team to probe into the case and six persons have been arrested to date.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have alleged Deb shared close links with TMC leaders, including ministers after their pictures together surfaced. TMC leaders have rubbished the charges. “It is not possible to check the credentials of each and every person attending a public programme where anyone may click pictures,” state minister Firhad Hakim has said.TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said the BJP cannot digest the defeat in the assembly elections and is hence resorting to “back-door politics”. “I don’t know whether the Union health secretary asked for a report from BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government when dead bodies of Covid-19 victims were dumped in the river. Where was he when West Bengal was requesting oxygen, medicines and vaccines? The state government is doing whatever is necessary. Police have started a probe and the state health department and civic body have held camps for the victims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-report-on-fake-vaccination-racket-busted-in-bengal-101625045540757.html

However, the court has now deferred the matter for July 2.The panel, led by former Intelligence Bureau chief, Rajiv Jain – who became an NHRC member on June 2 - was put together on orders of the court. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government had soon after filed a review petition to the court, seeking for the order’s recall, but it was eventually dismissed.The committee was asked to “enquire into complaints of post-poll violence” in West Bengal, and also to recognise those who were prima facie accountable for the violence and the officers who maintained a “calculated silence”.This development comes following the alleged attack on Atif Rasheed, vice-chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities and a member of the NHRC panel on Tuesday during his visit to south Kolkata’s Jadavpur area to look into complaints of post-poll violence.The alleged incident occurred in Dompara region, with Rasheed claiming before a section of the media that he and his NHRC team members were attacked by goons.The deputy commissioner of police (south suburban division), Rashid Munir Khan told HT that no complaint has been registered by either Rasheed or any other NHRC member. “A police force was escorting the NHRC team. It gave me a report. At Dompara, some people shouted slogans at the NHRC team. Some of the agitators were apparently under the influence of alcohol,” Khan said, adding that if Rasheed files a complaint, the police will certainly look into it.A few days ago, the panel visited Kolkata and Sitalkuchi in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, police officials said. They met and recorded statements of the family of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Abhijit Sarkar in Kolkata, who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in the city’s Narkeldanga area on May 2, the day Assembly election results were announced, police officials added.A second team of the NHRC visited Sitalkuchi to meet the family of a BJP worker, whose son was allegedly kidnapped and killed. Furthermore, the team also went to the home of Ananda Burman, a young BJP supporter shot dead on April 10.Police officials had stated that the two NHRC teams – part of the seven-member committee - will be visiting several parts of north and south Bengal before submitting the report on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-team-submits-report-on-bengal-post-poll-violence-to-calcutta-high-court-101625041388960.html

With Wednesday’s tweet, the Congress leader continued his attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over rising fuel prices and inflation.The Congress party will launch a countrywide agitation from July 7 to July 17 to protest against the rising fuel prices. The party made the decision at a meeting of the party general secretaries and various state in-charges which was chaired by the Congress president Sonia Gandhi on June 23.The leaders of the opposition party accused the Centre of reaping profits from people using excise duty and taxes on petrol and diesel which have led to a spike in fuel prices across the country.Petrol prices have risen above ₹100 in megacities like Mumbai and Bengaluru.

The Delhi Police had registered a case later on Tuesday for "availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material" on its platform.The case was registered after National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to the police saying it had received a complaint about online threats against a minor girl, and found pornographic material on Twitter, according to a letter written by the rights group to police."Investigation has been taken up," a statement from the Delhi police said.Twitter, meanwhile, said it has a zero tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation.The company is already facing a case for displaying a wrong map of India, which showed Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country. The map was taken down from the company’s website after the case was registered.These cases have compounded the problems of Twitter which is already involved in a tussle with the Centre over new IT rules. Many central ministers have repeatedly criticised Twitter for not complying with the new rules, which came into effect in May.Companies such as Twitter must now appoint a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer and another executive to liaise with law enforcement and the government on legal requests. LinkedIn job postings show the three positions are open at Twitter.Non-compliance with those rules means Twitter may no longer enjoy the legal privilege in India that allowed it to not be held liable for user-generated content.Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-asked-to-share-details-of-accounts-sharing-child-sex-abuse-content-101625038754159.html

CoWIN is the backbone of national Covid-19 immunisation delivery management system. The new procurement process will be operational from July 1.There will be a slot on CoWIN for private hospitals to register as private Covid-19 vaccinate centres to be able to avail of the facility.The approval will be granted on CoWIN itself, and the payment for vaccine doses will also have to be made electronically through the National Health Authority Portal (NHA), after which the order will be processed.Also Read | When will Covaxin get WHO nod? Rolling data submission to begin in JulyThe Centre is procuring 75% of the vaccine supplies produced in a given month to be distributed under its free supply scheme, and the remaining 25% is left to be taken up by the private hospitals across the country based on doses allocated in advance.The Centre recently advised states to aggregate Covid-19 vaccine distribution in private hospitals on monthly basis, and to either procure the doses themselves or allow the Centre to facilitate procurements for them, in order to equitably distribute vaccine doses among private hospitals.The step was taken after a huge disparity was seen in the private sector with Covid-19 vaccination largely limited to big private vaccination centres that tend to buy a major volume from the available 25% quota allotted to the private sector, leaving the smaller hospitals in want of adequate doses.India began implementing the liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy from May 1, wherein 50% of the available doses were earmarked for supply to states and Union Territories, as free of cost supply from the Centre, while the remaining 50% was available for direct procurement from the vaccine manufacturers by states and private hospitals.In his June7 address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced modifications in the vaccine policy, under which 75% of the total central drugs laboratory cleared doses are being procured by the Centre for distribution to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-hospitals-to-procure-covid-vaccine-doses-through-cowin-from-july-1-101625038160430.html

They are hot dry winds blowing from Pakistan. We cannot say they are unlikely in June because heat waves are recorded in early and mid-June,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Also Read | As monsoon plays truant, Delhi suffers first heat wave of season“The pressure gradient is very high so strong westerly winds are blowing. Easterly winds did not set in because monsoon weakened and did not cover the northwestern region entirely. We are not expecting monsoon to progress for at least a week,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.“These are Loo winds which are commonly experienced in May and early June. It’s very unusual to record them in July or the fag end of June. The wind speed at Palam in Delhi is around 40 to 45 kmph. Till Tuesday, the winds were easterly at the lower level and westerly at the higher level so it was a mix of humidity, dry winds making conditions extremely uncomfortable. The temperature is also very high,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.The normal date for monsoon to set in over Delhi is June 27. It is delayed by 3 days and is likely to be further delayed by a week, according to IMD.The northern Limit of monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar. It has been in the same position for over a week now. “Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next five days,” IMD said in its bulletin on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hot-dry-loo-like-winds-blow-over-nw-india-instead-of-humid-easterlies-101625036240457.html

Mohapatra said the Covid situation has not worsened in 17 districts, while in eight districts in coastal and northern Odisha the situation has not improved much.On Tuesday, while reviewing the situation of Covid-19 in Odisha, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said that the second wave is not over yet and experts are warning about the third wave of Covid. “We should not let our guards down but be much more careful. He stressed on door-to-door surveys to be intensified and said that doctors should be prepared to handle cases related to children as the third wave is likely to impact the young.Also Read | Parents protest, Odisha board denies errors in matric assessmentOn Wednesday, Odisha reported 3,371 new Covid cases as the daily infection numbers continued to hover above 3,000.

30-06-2021||India||Bharat Biotech says it received no advance payment from Brazil govt for Covaxin||As the Brazil government suspends the deal to purchase 20 million doses of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin over allegations of graft in the deal, the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker on Wednesday issued a statement and said as of June 29, the vaccine maker has not received any advance payment from the Brazil government. "In the case of procurement of Covaxin by Brazil, a step-by-step approach was followed towards contracts and regulatory approvals, during the 8-month-long process. EUA received was received on June 4. As of June 29, we haven't received any advance payments nor supplied vaccines to Brazil," the company said in a statement.Brazil suspends Covaxin deal as Bolsonaro faces graft charges"The pricing of Covaxin has been clearly established between $15-20 per dose for supplies to Governments outside India. The pricing for Brazil has also been indicated at $15 per dose," Bharat Biotech said.The ₹2,400 crore has turned the heat up for the Jair Bolsonaro government as it was alleged that the government struck a deal with Bharat Biotech to acquire about 2 crore doses of Covaxin at a higher price, and at a time when the vaccine was not approved by the regulator of Brazil. Covaxin received emergency use authorisation in Brazil in the first week of June, though the negotiation process has been going on for the last seven-eight months.Here's what happened> Brazil Health ministry official Luis Ricardo Miranda who acted as a whistleblower in this case raised suspicion about the deal as Pfizer was reportedly offering Brazil its Covid-19 vaccine at a lower price.> Miranda looks after the imports of the health ministry and when he had to approve an import licence, he refused to do so as the company mentioned in the invoice was not Bharat Biotech, the company with which the deal was signed, but some Singapore-based Madison Biotech.> Luis Ricardo Miranda also told senators that he was under pressure to clear the deal.> Bolsonaro defended the allegation saying that there was no corruption as the government did not pay any money and did not receive any vaccine.> Covaxin was granted emergency use approval on June 5. Bharat Biotech also corroborated Bolsonaro's statement that no vaccine has been sent and no money has been received.> Bharat Biotech has, however, said that Madison Biotech is its global sales and marketing arm.> An investigation into the deal began in April.> Brazil's newspapers reported that Bharat Biotech had initially quoted a price of $1.34 per dose, the government agreed to pay $15 per shot.> Whistleblower Miranda and his brother who is a lawmaker met Bolsonaro “The President looked me in the eye and said, ‘This is serious’,” adding, “'If I interfere with this thing, you know what kind of shit it’s going to stir up. This must be so-and-so’s deal.’” the whistleblower has told the investigators.> Bharat Biotech said it followed all processes in Brazil as in other countries while the price of the vaccine in the international market was made public beforehand.Explaining the process of how a country can procure vaccines from Bharat Biotech, the vaccine maker said that the company first received a letter of intent, following which it applues for emergency use authorisation in the country. Once the vaccine gets approval, the health ministry of that country releases a purchase order. Even if the order is placed before the approval, the procurement happens only after the approval.Once the purchase order is released, the company raises a Pro Forma Invoice based on which the ministry makes the payment. Once the payment is received, the company proceeds to supply the vaccines. In this case, the company received no money from the health department of Brazil, Bharat Biotech said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-says-it-received-no-advance-payment-from-brazil-govt-for-covaxin-101625034370081.html

The resolution said the second Covid-19 wave was so severe that the health care system was overwhelmed due to the sudden increase of severe cases in April and May. It added in spite of the best efforts of the doctors and other health care staff, several people succumbed to the severity of the disease. The resolution said the government “bravely battled the pandemic” by strengthening the health infrastructure.Also Read | Goa oxygen shortage deaths: HC declines to entertain pleas for probeThe BJP described the meeting as “routine” while expressing full confidence in Sawant’s leadership. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was among those who criticised the government for failing to impose restrictions to check Covid-19 spread in time, did not attend the meeting. Rane has also called for an inquiry into the deaths due to oxygen shortage in the state. He expressed his inability to attend the meeting since he was not in the state.Rane was unavailable for comments.State BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade said they commended the state government for the way it handled the pandemic as well as other calamities like the cyclone. “So, putting all this together, a congratulatory motion was passed, and several ministers and MLAs (members of legislative assembly) spoke. This was passed unanimously.”Goa’s positivity rate touched 51% at the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, which was the highest in the country at the time. The Bombay High Court at Goa was forced to take cognisance of the situation when the inadequate supply of oxygen left 75 people dead at a government hospital.The state has reported 16,60,00 cases and more than 3,000 deaths since the second wave of the pandemic hit Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bjp-backs-cm-sawant-s-handling-of-pandemic-101625034680714.html
30-06-2021||India||When will Covaxin get WHO nod? Rolling data submission to begin in July||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin inches a step closer to get approval from the World Health Organization as rolling data submission will begin in July, as per the WHO website. The pre-submission meeting has been held and as this data submission begins, Covaxin will only be one step away from getting the nod — which is the evaluation that may take some time. The Hyderabad-based company earlier said it expects the emergency use listing to arrive by September.What is the evaluation process?WHO's emergency use listing is a standard list that every country is more or less accepting. Though there is no vaccine passport yet, many countries have decided to allow travellers vaccinated with WHO-listed vaccines. So, getting recognised by WHO is crucial for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. And the sooner the result comes, the better for Indian travellers vaccinated with Covaxin.Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy boosterFor EUL, the vaccine maker first needs to apply which is the submission of the expression of interest, which involves some amount of paperwork. Once the EOI is accepted, a pre-submission meeting is held between the company and the WHO. Covaxin has reached this stage.Now, the vaccine maker will have to present all clinical trial data conducted in all sites to WHO, which will be evaluated simultaneously. Then WHO will give an anticipated date when the approval is likely to be given only when all data is submitted and follow-up inspection observations are also completed.What WHO examines whether the product has been able to eradicate the disease or prevent outbreaks and whether the manufacturing is compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices.Covaxin and controversiesAt home and abroad, Covaxin has been the centre of several controversies beginning its approval in India in January in the "absence of adequate data". After the vaccine makers provided their latest data, its high price in India came on the radar as the vaccine in the private market costs more than Covishield and Sputnik V. Meanwhile, Brazil has suspended the purchase of the vaccine from Bharat Biotech following allegations of corruption in the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-covaxin-get-who-nod-rolling-data-submission-to-begin-in-july-101625033261383.html

It said ₹10 lakh compensation is not even equal to the two-month average net earnings of the pilots.In an email on Tuesday, Vidya Prasad Karmarkar, the widow of Prasad Karmarkar who operated Boeing 777 for Air India, requested the airline to grant the pilots Permanently Medically Unfit (PMU) grants as per the Air India circular of 2016.Officials said under rules, there is no provision for declaring pilots PMU unless they personally appear before a designated medical board for a medical evaluation. But as per the circular, the airline’s medical board in cases of critical medical situations can declare a pilot PMU for compensation under this category.Also Read | New UK travel rules amid Covid cause travel uncertainty: AirlinesVidya Prasad Karmarkar said, “In almost all of the unfortunate deaths, the pilots have suffered Covid related multi-organ failure with them being in critical condition and abjectly poor prognosis, before giving up their individual battle against the virus.

On March 14, 2020, the Centre had declared Covid-19 to be a disaster under DMA. The court said under Section 12(iii) of DMA, it was mandatory for NDMA to issue guidelines on ex-gratia under minimum standards of relief as the word used in the Act is “shall”.“The statutory duty is cast upon the authority to frame guidelines for ex-gratia. By not recommending ex-gratia, it can be said that the national authority (NDMA) failed to perform its statutory duty under Section 12 of DMA,” said the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah.The guidelines for ex-gratia would be guided by the requirement, availability of funds, and money allocated for other measures needed for mitigation, prevention and relief with regard to Covid-19.The Centre had argued that while passing the DMA, the legislature did not contemplate a pandemic situation as the Act was meant to provide relief for one-time events such as earthquakes, cyclones, etc or a few incidents taking place periodically for some time. Further, the Centre argued that during Covid-19, it had adopted a multi-pronged approach in containing the harm caused by disaster by augmenting hospital infrastructure, medical supplies, drugs, insurance to health care providers and food safety to poor citizens. According to the Government, in such a scenario, granting ex-gratia may not be understood as “shall” but “may”. In an affidavit filed before the top court on June 19, the Centre claimed that granting ₹4 lakh ex-gratia for Covid-19 deaths was “beyond fiscal affordability” of states. However, during arguments, the Centre said this did not mean that it had no money but considering the fact that the pandemic is ongoing, funds need to be allocated on multiple fronts. The petitioners argued that fiscal constraint can never be a ground to deny relief entitled to citizens under the DMA. The court also directed Centre to issue simplified guidelines for issuance of certificate of death due to Covid-19 and for making corrections in the certificate already issued. The bench further directed Centre to take appropriate steps for providing insurance cover as recommended by the finance commission||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-centre-6-weeks-to-fix-ex-gratia-for-deaths-due-to-covid19-101625032400245.html

The scheme was among the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC)’s poll promises and was approved by the state Cabinet on June 24.Around two million students are eligible for the scheme. “Parents would not have to sell their properties to help their children pursue higher education. With this money, students can pursue graduation, post-graduation, professional courses, diploma, PhD, post-doctorate and can even go for research...in both India and abroad,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said last week.There will be a credit limit of ₹10 lakh under the scheme at the interest rate of 4% with the provision of easy repayment. “Anyone aged up to 40 and who has resided in the state for at least 10 years can avail this. It is a soft loan for the students for which they do not have to bring any guarantor. The state government would be the guarantor. Students can repay the loan within a period of 15 years after getting a job,” said an official.Banerjee will launch the scheme. The state government will also launch a portal for students to register for it.The TMC government has also started distributing ₹10,000 among students of Class 12 to help them purchase laptops for online classes during the pandemic. Schools and colleges are closed in West Bengal and the state government has also cancelled the board exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-launch-credit-scheme-for-students-to-pursue-higher-studies-101625030601712.html

The parents said that though the high court had ordered in November 2020 that schools will only collect tuition fees until physical classes are resuming, some schools are taking the entire fee, even during the lockdown.ये हैं @Indersinghsjp मप्र में स्कूल शिक्षा के राज्यमंत्री और@ChouhanShivraj के बेलगाम प्यादे!पालक संघ से कह रहे हैं - "जो करना हो, कर लो, जाओ जाकर मर जाओ!"#कोरोनाकाल में स्कूल फीस माफी की मांग पर दिया जवाब, बताता है कि सत्ता की गंध से सरकार का दिमाग चढ़ा हुआ है!#अहंकार pic.twitter.com/E9UIUgFG2q"What to do, sir? We will die," the parents could be heard pleading in the video after which the minister reportedly said 'Go, die". Parents — 80 of them went to meet the minister — then shouted, 'Shall we die?' As seen in the video, the minister then went inside his car without responding to the parents.During the interaction, the minister also asked the parents to switch the camera off once. Following the interaction, which the minister left in the midway, the parents demonstrated outside his residence. NSUI burnt en effigy of the minister and demanded his resignation. The parents' organisation too demanded his resignation over his insensitive remark and said that they will complain to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Congress state president Jitu Patwari shared the video on social media and wrote, "This is Madhya Pradesh's education minister and Shivraj Singh Chouhan's uncontrolled horse. He is telling the parents' union 'do whatever you can, go and die'. This response to the demand of fee waiver in schools during the pandemic shows how the government is blinded by the power."The minister has not commented on the viral video so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-die-madhya-pradesh-minister-tells-parents-who-complained-of-high-fees-101625028900192.html
30-06-2021||India||Lower exposure to Covid among persons with HIV: AIIMS study||The exposure to Covid-19 infection last year among people with HIV/AIDS was almost half that of the general population, according to a pre-print study of New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Antibody prevalence was found to be 14% among the 164 persons with HIV/AIDS, who visited the hospital for their anti-retroviral therapy, added the study uploaded to medRxiv, a free online archive, and distribution server.The average seropositivity in Delhi was 25.7% at the time when the samples from persons with HIV/AIDS were collected between September and November 2020.“This captures the data after the first wave of the infections; we do not know yet what happened during the massive second wave of infections. However, the lower infection prevalence among people with HIV is likely to be because they might have followed precautions more rigorously being at a higher risk of contracting infections,” said Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine at AIIMS.Also Read | Fewer women taking Covid-19 shots in India? Here’s what govt data saysAnother reason ascribed by the study for the low prevalence of antibodies among the people living with HIV/AIDS is that the persons might not have generated antibodies after getting Covid-19 or might not have sustained it.Delhi’s population level seroprevalence shot up after November’s surge in infections to over 56% in the January round. The scheduled April round of the survey was cancelled because of rising Covid-19 cases. Another AIIMS study found a higher seroprevalence of 74.7% in urban areas of Delhi in March, again before the devastating wave of infections in April-May.Interestingly, the study also found that majority of the patients had either no or minimal symptoms.“We are still gathering evidence as to how Covid-19 affects people with HIV. Based on limited evidence, we believe people with HIV who are on effective HIV treatment and have suppressed viral load with good CD4 counts have the same risk of severity of Covid-19 as people who do not have HIV. So, it is important that all such people continue taking their anti-retroviral therapy,” said Nischal.A previous AIIMS study showed that over 97% of the patients had minor or no symptoms. In South Korea, more than 60% of the people with HIV were asymptomatic for Covid-19 at the time of diagnosis, according to the study.Nischal warned that the small study from one centre should not be used to generalise trends across the country. Wider studies were needed to understand the impact of Covid-19 on people with HIV, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lower-exposure-to-covid-among-persons-with-hiv-aiims-study-101625028500069.html

Another such attack was thwarted attack on Monday and three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1 am and 4.30 am on Tuesday.The fresh drone sighting was reported a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of top ministers to discuss a long-pending policy on the management of and ways to deal with emerging security challenges.Senior police superintendent (Jammu) Chandan Kohli said, “The Army informed us that they again spotted drones over Kaluchak and Kunjwani military stations around 4 am (Wednesday).

The 3907 MW project, if cleared, will involve clearing at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests in a vital tiger area, according to the fact sheet of the Union environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC).The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL) at the cost of about ₹25,296.95 crore, according to the fact sheet.In response to a conservationist’s RTI query about the cost-benefit ratio on June 21, the state government said the information pertains to a third party and consent for disclosure was sought. “M/S Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited does not want to disclose information till FAC reconsiders it.” Also Read | Supreme Court pulls up environment ministry over ‘diluting green standards’HT reached out to JPL for a response via email on June 27 but there has been no response yet.Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer, said the cost-benefit ratio analysis is mandatory under the National Forest Policy and the Forest Conservation Act. “Whatever diversion of forest area takes place on account of a project (cost-benefit ratio analysis) is done by the government and not by the project developer. So, the application for forest clearance is normally done by the state government to the Centre... it is their (state government)’s job to do the cost-benefit analysis.”Dutta said the analysis is not third-party information. “It is a public document for the benefit of the public at large. So, denial of information is illegal,” said Dutta. “Some information can be the third party such as those involving patents or design of the project, but the ratio analysis can never be third party information. The state should make it public. They do not need the company’s permission to do that.”The FAC examined the project last year and sought key details related to the ecological impact and economic viability of the project. It sought the power ministry’s response on the economic feasibility. FAC referred to the delay in the project by six years and said the country’s energy plan may have changed during the period. It noted a large number of hydroelectric projects were pending due to environmental and forest clearance concerns.The FAC directed Arunachal Pradesh to submit a cost-benefit ratio analysis for the project as per the latest guidelines of the Union environment ministry, which was directed to monitor the exercise.Environmentalists working in the region said the analysis is an important document based on which a recommendation is made by the FAC, and the Union environment ministry takes the decision on a project. The application forms for forest clearance are public documents available on the ministry’s website when the FAC examines a matter. The environmentalists say this also enables members of the public to make informed submissions to the FAC when it takes up specific projects for forest clearance.In a February 29, 2012, order, the Central Information Commission said documents related to the forest clearance process be uploaded online. It said in case any additional documents/reports/studies are sought by the FAC or it undertakes any site visit, then such information should also be uploaded on the ministry’s website within 10 days of receipt of information.The ministry guidelines on cost-benefit analysis say: “While considering a proposal for diversion of forest land for non-forestry use, it is essential that ecological and environmental losses and eco-economic distress caused to the people who are displaced are weighted against economic and social gains.”The RTI applicant first sought information from the environment ministry, which shared the relevant information. The application was transferred to the state public information officer as the document related to the analysis is with the Arunachal Pradesh government. The applicant can file a complaint with the state appellate authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-declines-to-share-cost-benefit-analysis-of-mega-hydro-project-101625026400336.html

Here's what govt data says||India has vaccinated more people than the entire population of Canada in eight days between June 21 and June 29, but the male-female ratio of vaccination coverage remains skewed. From June 21, India entered a new phase of vaccination where the Centre procures 75 per cent of vaccines from the vaccine makers and distributes them among states so that people can be vaccinated at an accelerated pace. Over 4.61 crore doses have been administered in the last eight days, which the government said is more than the population of Iraq (4.02 crore), Canada (3.77 crore), Saudi Arabia (3.48 crore) and Malaysia (3.23 crore).However, as far as the male-female ratio is concerned, government data reveals that women are left behind men by over 3 crore doses as 14.99 crore doses have been administered to women since the beginning of the vaccination drive, which is 46 per cent of the total doses. Around 17.8 crore doses have been given to men, which is 54 per cent of the total vaccination. In India, 54,693 people belonging to the other gender category have received vaccination till date.Moderna’s Covid vaccine approved for use in India"We would like to see increased proportion of women coming to vaccination booths for receiving the vaccine so that skew in gender can also get corrected," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said commenting on the gender gap.What might have held women back from getting vaccinatedWhen the vaccination drive began in India on January 16, pregnant and lactating women were kept outside the coverage of vaccination, which might be one of the reasons, according to experts, behind the skewed ratio. Rumours like women should not take Covid-19 vaccines during menstruation or that vaccines will affect fertility might have also deterred women from coming forward to take vaccines.For both men and women, Covid-19 vaccines have no impact on fertility and there is no such question as all these are investigated during the trial, Dr Paul said on Tuesday, during the press meet of the health ministry. "With full authority and science and research, I want to say there is no side effect of infertility associated with vaccines and it is rumour mongering and raising doubts so please don't believe them. There is no chance with any infertility, male or female, in relation to any licensed vaccine -- Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik-V and Moderna," Dr Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-women-taking-covid-19-shots-in-india-here-s-what-govt-data-says-101625024549589.html

The proposed bill for the same is now with the ministry of home affairs awaiting the assent of the President after being passed by the Odisha Legislative Assembly in February 2021. There is no provision in the Indian Ports Bill, 2021 to include a State Maritime Board which is constituted at a later date by a state enactment. The Union government, through Maritime States Development Council (MSDC), seeks to appropriate this authority of the state through the proposed bill,” Behera wrote.Also Read | Over 16,000 pre-activated SIM cards seized from cybercriminal gang in OdishaWhile passing the bill in February this year, the state government had said the State Maritime Board will be the authority that allows construction, maintenance and operation of ports in the state directly or through PPP mode. It will also regulate and control navigation within the limits of the port and port approaches. “The proposed provision, instead of making India a strong maritime nation, through its centralisation of authority will stunt the growth of port-led development in the nation. Also, this proposal is against the very spirit of cooperative federalism and empowerment of states,” he said.Behera said MSDC has been in existence as a notified advisory body since 1997, focusing on integrated planning and development of ports and inland waterways. “MSDC should only comprise ministers of coastal states and the Union minister for ports, like the GST council...The draft Bill mandates centralisation of many routine functions to MSDC such as, conducting enquiry, deciding tariff structure etc. which will be very limiting and less efficient. MSDC’s role should continue to be recommendatory and advisory as before,” Behera said in the letter.Behera also requested that important bills are not expedited and proper deliberations are done with stakeholder states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-provision-for-state-maritime-board-in-proposed-indian-ports-billodisha-101625023879799.html

30-06-2021||India||Is Delta Plus more virulent? Can a recovered patient get reinfected? 5 big questions answered||The world is grappling with the more virulent strain of the coronavirus, the Delta Plus variant. It has been spreading rapidly, causing more infections. Some reports even claim that it is impervious to vaccines and therapies generally used to treat Covid-19 patients.But is that a reality? How dangerous is the delta plus variant? And how long with the coronavirus disease continue to wreak havoc. Dr Tanu Singhal, Consultant, Paediatrics and Infectious Disease at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, speaks to hindustantimes.com on these and other issues.Q: Does Delta Plus variant adversely affect vaccine efficacy?Dr Singhal: The Delta Plus variant is a mutation in the Delta variant. The original Delta variant was first discovered in India and drove the second wave. It had acquired two new mutations - one was L452 R and other was E484 Q. We know that this variant is highly transmissible and possibly more virulent and less impacted by vaccines. This Delta Plus variant has been recently discovered and has another mutation - K417 N - which is also found in the beta and gamma variants which is the South American and the Brazilian variants but the practical experience with Delta Plus variant has been very less because there are only about 50-odd cases which have been sequenced in India so far. So, the first important point I would like to make is we don’t have sufficient knowledge about the transmissibility or the virulence or the immune escape properties of this Delta Plus variant. It has been hypothesised that because it has the K417 N mutation, which was also there in the Brazilian variant, it may escape vaccine induced immunity but there is no practical data to support it so far.There is one woman in Rajasthan who was fully vaccinated yet got infected with Delta Plus variant but her disease was mild. So until now it has been discovered that while variants can cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated people overall the severity of the disease is milder.Q: What happens if a recovered patient contracts the infection again, this time the Delta Plus variant?Dr Singhal: Firstly, so far reinfections have been few. That means most of the patients who got infected in the first wave did not get infected in the second wave. So we know that prior infection with the other original virus did give long-lasting protection even against the delta variant. But we do not know how common that is going to be for reinfection with the delta plus. But until now all reinfections have been mild and not required hospitalisation unless person is vulnerable.Q: What are the symptoms of infection with Delta Plus variant? Are they different from the Delta or Alpha variants?Dr Singhal: We do not have data so far to establish that the symptoms are milder or more severe as compared to the delta variant.Q: Is the third wave of Covid-19 going to be as devastating as the second one? Are we better prepared for it in terms of vaccines and oxygen supply?Dr Singhal: We have sero-prevalence surveys that says about 60-70% of our population is immune which was about 25-30 per cent at the end of the first wave. Therefore, chances are that natural immunity is comparatively higher now than what it was after the first wave. Also we have vaccinations levels now which are much better. Hence, possibility of third wave being as severe as second wave is unlikely and it should rather be a smaller and less ferocious wave hopefully. This could change though if we have a new variant which emerges and is able to escape immunity provided by either previous infection or vaccination.We will be better prepared to handle the third wave as compared to the second wave because what happened was after the first wave everybody became complacent as there were very few cases in the months that followed the first wave and people thought that India has achieved herd immunity and Indians are more immune than other people and Covid is gone from India and we did not build infrastructure which we should have between the first and second wave. So I think the message is gone through clear and authorities are trying to ramp up the infrastructure. Which is a good step and much desired for regular health services and also builds our preparedness for other future pandemics if they were to occur.Q: How many waves are expected to hit before Covid-19 is declared under control? When are we expected to reach herd immunity?Dr Singhal: No one has an answer to this question. But looking at the previous pandemics like Spanish flu, the Asian flu of 1957-58, the Hong Kong flu of 1967, or SARS or MERS outbreaks, or H1N1 flu of 2009, most pandemics have lasted for two years. As an extension to that, and also with the world achieving herd immunity and vaccinations increasing, I feel personally in another six month time we should have better control of this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-a-covid-recovered-patient-get-reinfected-with-delta-plus-expert-answers-101625020118869.html

The speculation arose after the actor-turned-politician posted a pro-Modi tweet."There are four kinds of unhappy people: Those who are unhappy with own sorrows, with others' sorrows, how happy others are and a new variant of people being unhappy with Modi without any reason," Sinha had said in his tweet posted on Sunday in Hindi.दुनिया में चार तरह के दुःखी लोग होते हैं..१. अपने दु:खों से दु:खी,२. दूसरों के दु:ख से दु:खी,३. दूसरों के सुख से दु:खी,और*New Variant*४. बिना बात खामखां मोदी से दु:खी!😁😁😂😂"It was a Sunday humour for entertainment. I make some tweets for fun every Sunday and no political meaning should be derived from them," the Congress leader told news agency PTI.The 75-year-old added that he doesn't have any feeling to leave Congress and join the BJP again.Sinha had surprised the political circles last year by praising PM Modi over the evacuation of Indians from China in wake of the coronavirus.“With an attitude of gratitude, I salute you & your people for having done the needful in an emergency situation so soon, as I always say soon, sooner the better,” Sinha said in a string of tweets in September, 2020.The Indian government had evacuated hundreds of its citizens, most of them students, from Wuhan from where the coronavirus disease is believed to have emerged.Sinha quit the BJP and joined the Congress just before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and unsuccessfully contested from his native Patna Sahib constituency on a Congress ticket. He had earlier served as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.Sinha had twice won with a handsome margin from the Patna Sahib seat on a BJP ticket in 2009 as well as 2014. But in 2019, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad defeated Sinha from the seat by securing 62 per cent of the votes as against the actor-politician's 33 per cent.Before walking out of the saffron party, Sinha had targeted PM Modi and Union Home minister Amit Shah. He used to say that BJP has become "one-man party and two men army" without naming anybody.Sinha had debuted in politics three decades ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shatrughan-sinha-on-pro-modi-tweet-it-was-sunday-humour-101625018342877.html

The only licensing and regulatory body for the financial audit and accounting profession in India will celebrate the 73rd Chartered Accountants day this year.ICAI is deemed as the second biggest accounting organization in the world with about 2.5 lakh members.In his radio address 'Mann Ki Baat' on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that Chartered Accountants Day is celebrated on July 1 and reminded them about a gift he sought from them. “A few years back, I had asked chartered accountants of the country for a gift of Indian audit firms of global level. Today, I want to remind them of this. Chartered accountants can play a very good and positive role in bringing transparency to the economy. I extend my best wishes to all chartered accountants and their family members,” he said.History and Significance of National Chartered Accountants DayBefore India's Independence, the British government had established a rule that expected firms to keep track of their accounts under the Companies Act of India. An auditor was also appointed to audit these books. The auditors were expected to gain a certificate certifying them for this task. In the ensuing years, the role and designation of an auditor morphed to various degrees where the accountancy profession became largely unregulated and created confusion in terms of the qualifications of auditors.After Independence in the year 1948, an expert committee recommended that a separate autonomous association of accountants should be set up to regulate the profession of accountants in the country. The Indian government adhered to the recommendation and passed an act in the Parliament that gave birth to a statutory body named The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-chartered-accountants-day-on-july-1-all-you-need-to-know-101625013069567.html

The Prime Minister may also review the performance of some ministries.The performance review usually happens before a cabinet reshuffle, and the buzz around the agenda for today's virtual meeting has fuelled speculation that the Prime Minister can indeed expand the Union Cabinet. The exercise is expected to take place before the monsoon session of Parliament begins next month.The strength of PM Modi's is 60 and is expected to go upto 79.PM Modi has held meeting with the chief ministers of various states, including the election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.However, the expected agenda is to discuss various schemes launched by the Centre to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). A senior functionary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that the the Prime Minister may ask the ministers in today's meeting to spread the message to the public about the measures taken by the government to mitigate the pain and problems of the people.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced eight new schemes on Monday to boost the economy battered by shutdowns causes by the pandemic. Among the measures announced by Sitharaman is ₹1.5 lakh crore of additional credit for small and medium businesses, more funds for the healthcare sector, loans to tourism agencies and guides, and waiver of visa fee for foreign tourists as part of the package to support the economy.The central government is in high gear to dispel perception about its lack of preparation for the second wave of Covid-19 and the meeting is a step towards that. The BJP too has started preparations to change the perception on the ground.The steps are needed to be taken in the wake of assembly elections due in a number of states next year. BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda held a meeting with party functionaries last week and discussed ways to amplify the message around government's achievements in mitigating the effects of the second wave of the pandemic.Nadda also discussed with national general secretaries of the party and senior members the preparations for the anticipated third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-council-of-ministers-today-covid-vaccination-likely-on-agenda-101625012321853.html
30-06-2021||India||India, China to discuss disengagement at LAC||The dates of the agreed 12th round of the India-China senior commanders’ dialogue will be fixed through military channels, but the discussion will be restricted to disengagement and de-escalation of armies of the two countries from general areas Gogra and Hot Springs. The issue of Depsang Bulge will be dealt with by local commanders as it was a 2013 legacy issue, HT learns.According to South Block officials, the decision to discuss Hot Springs (patrolling point 14) and Gogra (patrolling point 17A) was taken at the virtual meeting of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India China border affairs on June 25.The two friction points, which are near the Kugrang and Chang Chemmo rivers respectively, were transgressed by the PLA on May 17-18, 2020 (apart from north banks of Pangong Tso).The 2013 friction point of Depsang Bulge, south of Daulet Beg Oldi, will not be taken up by the senior military commanders but dealt at the local commanders level, the officials added, asking not to be named. In April 2013, PLA transgressed the Raki and Jeevan nullah with the aim of blocking Indian Army from patrolling points 10 to 13A within the bulge area.While disengagement has taken place from the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, a larger de-escalation remains work in progress due to mutual mistrust and suspicion after the PLA’s 2020 transgressions.Both the Indian Army and the PLA Army have three divisions of troops with support elements all along the 1597 kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh with artillery, armour and rocket elements in addition. The Indian Army troops led by Lt General P G K Menon of 14 Corps are on constant vigil and are conducting patrols within limits defined by the Cabinet Secretary in 1976. There has been no accretion of troops from the Indian side since the August 29-31, 2020 incident on south banks of Pangong Tso. That was when the Indian army beat the PLA in the race to occupy commanding heights in the southern bank.While the Army is monitoring the Chinese activity along the LAC, the Indian Navy is keeping a close watch on PLA warship from the Gulf of Aden to the Malacca Straits including the south Indian Ocean. Apart from some research activity in deep south Indian Ocean which is being monitored, the Chinese ships are confined around the Gulf of Aden or Makran Coast off Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-discuss-disengagement-at-lac-101625012060549.html

30-06-2021||India||US resolution recognises India's Covid-19 help, urges govt to facilitate aid||The US House on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution recognising the devastating impact of Covid-19 in India and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to urgently facilitate assistance. The bipartisan resolution had 41 cosponsors including 17 cosponsors from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.The resolution recognised that when the United States was witnessing a devastating spike in the number of Covid–19 cases, India lifted its export ban on certain therapeutics in response to a request by the US government.It also said that India's pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of the global solution to the pandemic and accounts for over half of global vaccine manufacturing.The resolution titled “Urging the Administration to facilitate assistance in response to the devastating impact of Covid–19 in India” was introduced last month by Congressman Brad Sherman, the Democratic Co-Chair of the House Caucus on India and India Americans, and Rep. Steve Chabot."The resolution stands with the people of India as they collectively work to stem the spread of Covid-19," said Congressman Sherman. "The US must work with our partners around the world to quell the virus everywhere it persists."As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as the Democratic Co-Chair of the India Caucus, Congressman Sherman has worked, alongside the Republican Co-Chair Steve Chabot, to address the devastating effects of this second Covid-19 wave in India.In April, Reps. Steve Chabot, Ro Khanna, Michael Waltz and others joined Congressman Sherman in formally requesting that the White House increase its assistance for India's battle against Covid-19. By early May, the United States had provided more than $100 million worth of medical supplies to India, including oxygen support, personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid diagnostic tests, and therapeutics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-resolution-recognises-india-s-covid-19-help-urges-govt-to-facilitate-aid-101625010051462.html
30-06-2021||India||In India, ‘woke’ politics a liability: Pew survey||Indians, across religions, are not just believers but also conservative in their attitude towards religion. Political support, even for the rationalist and communist political formations, does not change this fact. While they claim to have respect for people from other religious persuasions, they are not very keen on promoting western style secularism, which calls for separation of religion and politics.Some of the most controversial and divisive political positions around religion, such as the bogey of Love-Jihad sustain themselves not on facts but the widespread disapproval of such ideas in principle. These findings, if true, suggest that radical secularism or ‘woke’ politics is unlikely to work politically in India and mainstream politics will continue to pander to conservative values around both caste and religion.These are among the interesting findings of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, a Washington based “nonpartisan fact tank” that offers some useful insights on the role of religion in politics. The survey, Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation, is based on 30,000 interviews conducted between November 2019 and March 2020.The intersection of religion and politics has always been a contested terrain in India. The Indian nation suffered a partition on religious lines at birth, yet adopted a secular form of state. This question has gained renewed salience since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a political affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), stormed to a parliamentary majority in 2014, becoming the first party to get a majority after 1984. It replicated that feat in 2019. The BJP’s political victory has come on the back of a massive consolidation of Hindu votes, and almost negligible representation of Muslims in the ruling party’s support base or elected representatives.The Opposition, having realised the gravity of political challenge, has tried many tricks to counter the BJP. The most common among them has been what is often described as the “soft-Hindutva” approach. This is characterised by political leaders openly associating with Hindu religious symbols such as visiting temples or even reciting scriptures during political campaign. The success of such as an approach has been mixed, which also means it is difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship. There is also a small but vocal minority which advocates a radical approach to questioning and undermining established religious and cultural norms.It is this background that makes the findings of the survey interesting. Here are some of the key ones:Most Indians are believersIndians are overwhelmingly believers when it comes to God. This trend holds across religions, except among Buddhists where one-third list themselves as non-believers. While the overall share of non-believers is small across major religions, the probability of finding a Muslim or Sikh non-believer is three times that of finding one among Hindus and Christians. The disproportionately large share of non-believers among Buddhists seems to be driven by the conversion of Bhim Rao Ambedkar to Buddhism in 1956. 89% of Buddhists identified themselves as members of the Scheduled Castes (SC) in the survey. “It does seem like the concentration of Buddhists who are also Dalit and atheist is higher in Maharashtra (5% of Maharashtra’s total population vs. 0.5% nationally). Of course, though, the overwhelming majority of Indian Buddhists (85%) are located in Maharashtra”, Neha Sahgal, associate director of research at Pew Research, told HT.Voting for communists and rationalists does not change faith in a big wayWhat is also interesting is that one’s attitude to God does not change significantly with political persuasion. The share of believers among those who voted for the Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) does not differ significantly from the group which did not vote for such parties. This is contrary to perceived wisdom, given the fact that the leadership of the communists and DMK does not acknowledge religion in their political positions. However, this statistic does explain why the CPI (M) was so vulnerable to a Hindu backlash when it supported a Supreme Court decision (now stayed) allowing entry to women of all ages in the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala, which was against established custom.On the face of it, communal harmony coexists with segregationA large majority of Indians, across religious persuasions, sees respecting other religions as an important part of being Indian and true to their own religion. This feeling exists despite a majority of Hindus, Muslims and Christians seeing each other as very different from other religions and displaying a high desire for religious segregation, especially when it comes to marriage. The statistics speak for themselves. 80% and 79% of Hindus and Muslims believed that respecting other religions is a very important part of their religious identity. To be sure, experts believe that such responses might not reveal the true picture. “That people tend to hide or underreport politically incorrect views or responses in surveys is a well known fact and the scale of communal polarisation in India could be far greater”, said Neelanjan Sircar, assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University and a visiting fellow at Centre for Policy Research.66% Hindus and 64% Muslims also thought that they were very different from each other. 67% and 80% of Hindus and Muslims, respectively, believed that it was very important to stop women from their community from marrying outside their religion. The numbers are not very different even when it comes to men marrying outside their religion.To be sure, the high preference levels for communal harmony could be a result of a tendency to appear as being politically correct among respondents. When asked whether they saw religious diversity as beneficial to their country, only 53% (52% Hindus and 56% Muslims) said yes.What makes people outcastes from their religion?Eating prohibited meat (beef among Hindus and pork among Muslims) is the biggest disqualifier when it comes to being seen as part of the community. 72% Hindus and 77% Muslims believe that a person cannot be a Hindu/Muslim if they eat beef/pork. Sikhs and Jains are also highly disapproving of eating beef. While this is the common factor among both Hindus and Muslims, the two groups differ on other triggers of being considered outcastes. Observing festivals of other religious communities is a bigger taboo among Hindus than Muslims. Muslims are relatively more forgiving when it comes to observing other religious festivals than not participating in their own rituals and festivals. “Disrespecting India” is also a big trigger for being considered an outcaste, both among Hindus and Muslims. These statistics underline the political risk which a politician advocating tolerance of eating beef or pork, or questioning “nationalism” would attract.The fear of perceived religious transgressions is what feeds communal politicsWhy does something like ‘Love-Jihad’, a term used by many Hindu majoritarian organisations to claim large scale inter-religious marriage and conversion of Hindu women, manage to find political traction in India? Almost all Indians do not report having ever faced religious conversion in their lives. The occasionally rare instances of conversion, even when they occur, are present across all religions. What explains the paranoia such issues generate then?One possible explanation could be the fact that most Indians are not averse to politicians influencing religious affairs. Politicians may be exploiting entrenched religious fears, such as aversion to inter-religious marriage or the disproportionate opposition to a uniform civil code among Muslims – 74% Muslims support allowing Muslims to go to their own religious courts to settle a family dispute as opposed to just 30% Hindus – to build a political constituency around such issues. That preference for an authoritarian leader is almost the same among many Indian religions, including Hindus and Muslims, must be encouraging such tendencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-woke-politics-a-liability-pew-survey-101625007559312.html
30-06-2021||India||Chhattisgarh health minister has doubts on CM’s announcement on pvt sector role||Raipur: Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo on Tuesday struck a discordant note on the government’s announcement of a plan to provide grants to the private sector to open hospitals in rural areas of the state, saying he only heard about the reported move through the media.“If you are promoting private doctors funded by the government, who are again going to charge people for treatment, it will be against the concept of free healthcare. If they are funded by the government and they are working without charging people, then there is no objection in giving them grants,” the health minister said, according to news agency Press Trust of India.Singh Deo’s remarks come days after chief minister Bhupesh Baghel directed officials to seek the support of the private sector to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas and has asked the industries department to draft an action plan to see how the private sector can be provided grants to set up hospitals. In Saturday’s statement, Baghel spoke about taking help from the private sector to make services of specialist doctors available in rural areas.Singh Deo said: “A discussion in this regard has not been held with me so far and I came to know about it through the media. I am assuming that it must be a proposal as no discussions have been held at the cabinet level in this connection”.The minister said he was in favour of the universal healthcare scheme right from the beginning and recalled the Congress had referred to ‘right to health’ in its manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. “Chhattisgarh’s Congress unit and the AICC also spoke about introducing a universal healthcare scheme in 2018 state Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” the minister said.Activists have also questioned the decision of the state government while the opposition claimed that the state government is not taking the decision ‘unanimously’ and infighting is clearly visible.“Providing health services to the public is the responsibility of a welfare state and the right to get these services is a constitutional right. To provide health services to the people is the only way is to strengthen the public health system ..The state government’s decision to privatize health services is in stark contrast to the concept of a welfare state,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan. Former Chief Minister and BJP leader Raman Singh said Singh Deo’s public statement reveals the infighting that is going on in the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-health-minister-has-doubts-on-cm-s-announcement-on-pvt-sector-role-101624996219623.html
30-06-2021||India||40-yr-old woman reported missing by husband found locked in bank. She had a plan||Shillong: A 40-year-old woman, reported missing for two days, was found on Monday in a Meghalaya bank, starving and dehydrated. It turns out, police said, that she was trying to pull off a bank heist but got a couple of things wrong. One was that every fourth Saturday in a month is a bank holiday.Isabella Marboh, who was sent to a hospital after she was found was formally placed under arrest by the police in Shillong on Tuesday.When she entered the bank a short distance from her house on Friday evening, Marboh thought she had the perfect plan. On her visits to the bank, Marboh had apparently noticed that no one went into the bank’s server room.The plan was to hide in this room when it was time for the bank to close for the day, get into the room where the bank kept the money and take all the cash she could carry when the bank reopened the next day.On Friday, police said, she left home telling her family that she was stepping out to buy vegetables. Instead, she went to the bank, ostensibly to deposit some money and quietly parked herself in the server room.When the bank closed, she went straight for the strong room. But it turned out that she did not have the requisite tools. She tried to prise it open with a pair of scissors but didn’t get far. A police officer who spoke on conditions of anonymity said they did find some tools used by carpenters in her hand bag but did not elaborate. There is no clarity on how she expected to break into the strong room.It is around this time, the officer said, that Isabella Marboh figured that the CCTV camera would have recorded her. So she broke them without realising that the footage was still safe.Marboh planned to leave the bank the following morning when it opened. But June 26 was a bank holiday; all second and fourth Saturdays are.She had brought a stock of chocolate bars and ORS fluid to keep her going for the planned overnight stay in the bank. She had to make her stock last through the weekend.By the time the bank manager opened the premises on Monday morning, she was “dehydrated and weak” and the CCTV cameras were broken. The manager called up the police and her husband, who had been desperately looking for his wife for two days and had floated multiple appeals to find her on social media.According to news website East Mojo, announcements to seek help to locate the missing woman were also made via the public address system in Bishnupur. She didn’t respond to them.Shillong city superintendent of police Vivek Syiem told HT on phone that the woman has been sent to the Shillong Youth Centre quarantine centre where she is awaiting her Covid test report. The SP said of all the angles that he could think of in case of a woman reported missing, an attempted bank heist certainly wasn’t one. “She has been booked under various offences which include criminal trespass, burglary, breaking and entry amongst others and we are awaiting the test report before producing her in court.”Later, her family distanced themselves from her. “We would like to clarify that we have no knowledge and we do not condone the actions committed by Isabella. The act was her own personal choice, and the families don’t stand by her acts,” read a statement issued by Isabella Marboh ’s family on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40yrold-woman-reported-missing-by-husband-found-locked-in-bank-she-had-a-plan-101624995084012.html
30-06-2021||India||Old allies planned and murdered former BJP corporator, say police||Bengaluru: Police investigating the murder of Rekha Kadiresh, the 45-year-old former corporator who was hacked to death on June 24, have said that personal rivalry is the motive behind the murder. So far, police have arrested seven people including Rekha’s sister-in-law in the case. Talking to HT, a senior investigator, who didn’t want to be named, said that from the investigation so far, police have learnt that the plan was made by the accused after they felt Rekha was side-lining them. So far, the police have arrested Peter, Surya, Stephen, Ajay Mala, Arun and Purushottam. Among them, Peter, the prime suspect in the case was a close associate of Kadiresh. “Kadiresh had a criminal past. In fact, it was a gang rivalry that caused his life in 2018. Peter was his right-hand man before Kadiresh decided to enter politics. Realising that the criminal past would not help win an election, he made his wife contest the election. Even during this time, Peter was a close ally of Kadiresh,” said the official. Following this murder, even though Peter remained with the Kadiresh family, Rekha wanted to move past the criminal past of her husband. “She began to keep Peter and other associates away from her political activity, which irked Peter,” said the officer. The side-lining meant that the financial aid Peter received from Kadiresh stopped over a period of time. “In fact, Peter was in the middle of constructing a new house, which he was doing with the money he was getting from Kadriesh’s family. Once the money stopped and Rekha began to distance Peter from her, he planned the murder,” the officer added. Talking about the involvement of the sister-in-law, the officer said that Mala, the elder sister of Kadiresh, and her son, were in touch with the alleged killers and thus were arrested. He added that while Peter was planning the murder, he realised that Mala too facing a similar problem, where Rekha was distancing her. “Even Mala had a criminal background. She was involved in sales of illegal alcohol and some drug-related cases. Rekha had kept them away from her political activities. So, Peter approached Mala for help,” he added. Police who recreated the crime said that the suspect felt it was a well-planned conspiracy since many CCTV cameras in the locality were unable to capture the crime. Around 10.30 am on June 24, while Rekha was walking home after taking part in a free meal distribution programme at her home in Chalavadipalya, a gang led by Peter waylaid her. “They chased her down and stabbed her multiple times, particularly on the neck and the throat. There were more than 10 stabs on her body. She was taken to Victoria Hospital but wasn’t treated there in view of Covid-19. She was declared brought dead at KIMS Hospital around 11 am,” the officer explained. Even though the attackers had turned the CCTV camera away, eyewitness accounts and a mobile phone video helped the police quickly identify the attackers. Soon after the murder, Peter and Surya fled towards the Tamil Nadu border in an autorickshaw . “During the investigation, we have questioned more than 50 people, who we suspected were in constant touch with the suspect. One of them was of particular interest since we knew he was close to Peter. During his interrogation, we learnt that Peter was using a new mobile number since the murder,” said the officer. The tracking of the new number revealed that these men were moving between locations and finally, police were able to track them down to Sunkadakatte, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-allies-planned-and-murdered-former-bjp-corporator-say-police-101624994237744.html
30-06-2021||India||SC notice to govt on dropping of charges against Lankesh’s killer||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Karnataka government and state police on a plea filed by slain journalist Gauri Lankesh’s sister challenging the dropping of charge under the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused. Lankesh was shot dead in Bengaluru in September 2017.Kavitha Lankesh, working as a filmmaker, had approached the court for staying the Karnataka HC order of April 22, 2021 which had quashed the charges under KCOCA against accused Mohan Nayak who is one of the accused facing trial in Gauri Lankesh murder. Pursuant to this order, Nayak had applied for bail in the Karnataka high court and was awaiting a decision.A three-judge bench of the top court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar issued notice on the petition and observed that the Karnataka high court shall pass bail order without being influenced by the April 22 order under challenge. The bench posted the matter for hearing on July 15. The Karnataka Police is yet to file an appeal against the HC order in question. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for Lankesh pointed out Nayak’s involvement in multiple murders involving activists Narendra Dabholkar in 2013 (Pune), Govind Pansare in 2015 (Kolhapur, Maharashtra), and noted Kannada writer MM Kalburgi in Dharwad (Karnataka) in 2015.According to the petition filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, Nayak was involved in arranging logistics for the killers both before and after the crime. It stated that the HC erred in setting aside the order of the Bengaluru Police Commissioner passed in August 2018 invoking KCOCA against Nayak and the subsequent supplementary charge sheet filed by the Special Investigation Team under provisions of KCOCA .The police claimed Nayak to be part of a crime syndicate operated by Amol Kale. Over the past decade, two charge sheets were filed against this syndicate and hence Lankesh claimed that the invocation of KCOCA against Nayak was fully justified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-govt-on-dropping-of-charges-against-lankesh-s-killer-101624993638387.html
30-06-2021||India||To get better prices, BSY flags off ‘Kisan Rail’ with 250 tonnes mangoes for Delhi||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday flagged off a Kisan Rail from Yelahanka railway station in Bengaluru with 250 metric tonnes of mango from Chintamani taluka to ferry the fruits to the national capital, in the hope of getting better prices for farmers’ produce. “Kiran Rail scheme plays a crucial role in providing good prices for the farm products and thus enhances farmers’ income,” Yediyurappa said on Tuesday. The chief minister added that since June 20, at least 1,250 metric tonnes of mango have been sent to Delhi, which, according to experts, gives farmers an additional ₹10 per kg for their produce. The rail services, which were introduced in August last year, give 50% subsidy in freight rates for transportation, with an aim to expand the market for the farming community, which has been hit hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Kisan Rail service, which was announced in the 2021-22 Union budget, has been functional in full steam, most farmers in Karnataka struggle have struggled to make the best use of the same to fetch good prices, largely due to the Covid-19 induced pandemic and its impact on economic activities. Though agricultural activities were allowed to operate even during the nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 last year, farmers have been unable to sell their produce in markets, resulting in more losses and piling debts. The state is also at the receiving end of heavy rains that have added to the possibility of crops getting damaged in several parts of the state. Between June 1 and June 23, Karnataka received 197.1 mm of rains, 35% excess from the normal 145.8 mm rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD-Bengaluru). However, several regions in the state have also received deficient rains, impacting sowing of crops and causing huge losses, farmers and activists said. Gopal, an office-bearer of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), a farmers’ union, said there is barely any prices available for the produce in the market, adding that they have not received any support from the government--Union or state. The Covid-19 pandemic has also triggered a mass reverse migration of workers across India with people going back to their villages and home-towns from urban centres. The reverse migration has also added pressure on the already small-land holdings and those dependent on them. The Karnataka government is yet to release payments for the Minimum Support Price (MSP), according to state agriculture minister BC Patil. Patil said that around ₹200 crore was released a couple of weeks ago and more would follow in the next few days. Meanwhile, small farmers and vendors said they were reeling under huge debt due to poor business during this year’s lockdown, which came into force due to the ravaging second wave of the pandemic. In May this year, Yediyurappa announced a ₹1,250-crore financial package, aimed at providing relief to unorganised workers and the farming community. The financial package involved a one-time payment of ₹10,000 for about 20,000 flower growers and 69,000 farmers, who produce fruit and vegetables costing the exchequer a total of around ₹81.73 crore. The package also included the extension of the loan period for short, medium and long-term availed by around 425,000 farmers and others by three months, which would entail the government bearing the interest payment of ₹134.38 crore. Citing the package would do little to alleviate their suffering, several farmer unions have claimed that they are yet to receive the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-get-better-prices-bsy-flags-off-kisan-rail-with-250-tonnes-mangoes-for-delhi-101624993577656.html
30-06-2021||India||SSLC exam decision not unilateral: CM||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday cleared the air on conduct of the Karnataka Secondary School Leaving Certification (SSLC) examination, after the health and education ministers locked horns over the announcement.Announcing the dates of the Class 10 examinations, S Suresh Kumar, Karnataka’s minister for primary and secondary education, on Monday said that the two exams for Class 10 will be held on July 19 and July 22 respectively. A total of 876,581 students are eligible for the SSLC exams which were delayed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The decision drew criticism as the third wave of infections, expected by the end of the year or earlier, is likely to impact children below the age of 18. Moreover, this age category is yet to be eligible for vaccination in India.However, hours after the decision was announced, state health minister Dr K Sudhakar said at a press conference that he was not aware of the examination dates, as he had not yet spoken with the education minister. He added that he did not know whether the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) was also consulted regarding the matter.“I am unaware of this decision, and I need to consult the education minister on this announcement. I cannot say whether the exams shall be conducted or not. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) will give its opinion on this,” said Sudhakar.He added that the education department is yet to submit the number of teaching and non-teaching staff for vaccination before the exams.Responding to this allegation, education minister Kumar said that officials of the health department were kept in the loop before making the decision. “The commissioner of the health department was present during the two-hour-long meeting with district administrations on holding SSLC examinations, and also directed district administrations on following the SOP,” he said.While this issue expectedly caused confusion within the cabinet, CM Yediyurappa intervened and dismissed allegations of lack of communication. He confirmed that the education minister took the decision after consulting him.Later in a tweet, Yediyurappa said: “Minister of education S Suresh Kumar had discussed with me in advance and took the decision to schedule the SSLC exam in July. The decision was taken after a thorough discussion of the subject and is in the best interest of the students. It is not a unilateral decision. Let there be no confusion over the subject.”After the CM’s tweet, health minister K Sudhakar, who an evening before stated that he was unaware of the decision, retracted his statement, saying that the education minister had discussed with health experts before taking the call, and CM Yediyurappa was also informed.“He (Kumar) told me last evening that he had discussed with the CM regarding the decision as I was in another meeting, I was not aware of.... in the evening he informed me about it. I think the discussions were also held with the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC),” he said.During the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, too, the government had drawn criticism over the lack of coordination between the departments, with the then health minister Sriramulu and medical education minister Sudhakar occasionally competing with each other, creating confusion.Subsequently, Sriramulu, who is now the social welfare minister, was divested of the health and family welfare portfolio by the chief minister, which was then allocated to Sudhakar with the intention that one minister handling the related portfolios amid the pandemic would be beneficial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sslc-exam-decision-not-unilateral-cm-101624993517695.html
30-06-2021||India||Amid Delta+ spike, K’taka tightens curbs for visitors from Maha, Kerala||Bengaluru In a bid to restrict the spread of the new Delta Plus variant of the novel coronavirus, the Karnataka government on Tuesday made it mandatory for all travellers coming into the state from neighbouring Maharashtra to carry Covid-19 negative certificates. “Negative RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours or vaccination certificate of at least one dose of Covid-19 shall be compulsorily produced by the passengers coming to Karnataka by flight, bus, train, taxi, personal transport, etc. This will also be applicable for all the flights originating from Maharashtra to Karnataka,” according to the guidelines released on Tuesday. The state government directed that airlines shall issue boarding passes only to passengers carrying RT-PCR negative certificates or proof of at least one dose of vaccination. Similarly, district authorities in regions like Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru also have imposed similar restrictions on those coming in from neighbouring Kerala, which like Maharashtra, continues to reel under the impact of the pandemic. Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education on Tuesday travelled to Kodagu, Mysuru and Dakshina Kannada districts and held meetings with officials to review the Covid-19 situation there. “Among the ones (districts), these places have a high positivity and there have been higher deaths. On this, I called for a meeting to discuss the same,” Sudhakar said on Tuesday. The minister said that the positivity in Mysuru was coming down but the fatality rate continues to remain at 3.85%. Sudhakar has also directed officials to undertake a death audit in the district, which is about 125 kms from Bengaluru. One of the two Delta Plus variants in Karnataka is from Mysuru district and Sudhakar said that a genome sequencing lab will be set up in the district. Karnataka has seen a steady decline of new Covid-19 infections in recent weeks, prompting the BS Yediyurappa-led government to ease lockdown restrictions that have been in place since mid-April. Sudhakar also said that he will visit Delhi to meet union government ministers and officials to request a higher allocation of vaccines for Karnataka. Karnataka has administered a total of 2,24,58,057 doses of Covid-19 vaccines until 7.47 pm on Tuesday, according to data from the CoWin portal. Of this, the first dose accounts for 1,87,76,663 while the second dose accounts for 36,81,394, data shows. The state administered 2,51,185 doses until 7.47 pm on Tuesday, according to information on CoWin. “I will be visiting Delhi in the coming days and will be discussing with the union health minister to allocate more vaccines to the State. But I have never said we are short of vaccines in the State and we have never stopped vaccinating people. Everyday over 2-3L people are being vaccinated. The moment we get vaccines from the union government, we will distribute them,” Sudhakar said. The minister claimed that no other state has administered as many vaccines as Karnataka had in south India. Karnataka was placed in the ‘fourth or the fifth position’ in the entire country, he said. The health minister’s denial of any shortage of vaccines in Karnataka came amidst suspension of the vaccination programme in government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) in Mysuru for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. “I have never said we are short of vaccines in the state, and we have never stopped vaccinating people. Every day over 2-3 lakh people are being vaccinated. The moment we get vaccines from the union government, we will distribute them,” he said. Karnataka recorded 3,222 more infections, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department, released on Tuesday. The positivity rate stood at 2.54% as the state conducted over 126,000 tests, including 83,874 RT-PCR tests.There were 14,724 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 85,997, government data shows. The fatality rate continues to be high at 2.88% as 93 more succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 34,929. Bengaluru recorded 753 new infections, 10,722 recoveries and 16 deaths which brings down its active caseload to 52,445 and toll to 15,615.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-delta-spike-k-taka-tightens-curbs-for-visitors-from-maha-kerala-101624993458343.html
30-06-2021||India||Biden administration names Atul Keshap as new chargé d’affaires in India||New Delhi The Joe Biden administration on Tuesday named Atul Keshap, a career diplomat and an old South Asia hand, as the new chargé d’affaires in India, saying the appointment will reinforce the bilateral partnership and collaboration in the fight against Covid-19.Keshap will replace former deputy secretary of state Daniel Smith, whom the US had appointed the chargé d’affaires in New Delhi in May to spearhead cooperation on shared priorities, including overcoming the global pandemic. Keshap will depart for New Delhi following the retirement of Smith, the US state department said.“Ambassador Keshap will bring a wealth of experience to the role, having served previously at US embassy New Delhi and as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia,” the state department spokesperson said.Keshap most recently served as the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs in the state department and as the US envoy to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. He has also been active in advancing the US agenda for the Indo-Pacific.The appointment of Keshap, a career member of the senior foreign service, “will reinforce the close US partnership with the government and people of India, demonstrated by our collaboration to overcome global challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic”, the spokesperson said. The ambassadorial position in New Delhi is among several key posts around the world that are yet to be filled by the Biden administration. The previous ambassador, Kenneth Juster, was a political appointee of the previous administration and stepped down following Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. Smith carried the highest US foreign service rank of career ambassador. His appointment was announced a day after the US began rushing equipment and materials, including oxygen-related gear and raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines, to support India’s response to a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections.Keshap’s appointment comes at a time when the focus in the region is on the fallout of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan. Indian officials believe the drawdown of American forces could be completed as early as July, well ahead of the Biden administration’s deadline of September 11. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan amid a surge in attacks by the Taliban has become a cause for concern across the region. The son of Keshap Chander Sen, a UN development economist from the Punjab, and Zoe Calvert, a member of the US foreign service, Keshap served at the US embassy in New Delhi during 2005-08 and was involved in negotiations that led to the India-US civil nuclear agreement. His parents met and married in London and Keshap was born in Nigeria in 1971. He also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia during 2013-15 and did a stint as director of the office of human rights, humanitarian and social affairs during 2008-10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-administration-names-atul-keshap-as-new-charg-d-affaires-in-india-101624993337622.html

We as an NGO are representing a vast majority of hospitals and have given a letter of intent to have 100 million doses for India. It is currently being processed,” Dr Girdhar Gyani, AHPI director general said.He said the AHPI has also approached the manufacturer directly and is waiting to see how that will materialise.As the Johnson&Johnson vaccine is a single-dose vaccine, while others in the Indian market require two doses, it is eagerly awaited. Experts believe it will be cost-effective and will be especially beneficial for the rural population.“J&J being a single-shot vaccine has tremendous value for a country like India. There is so much hesitancy prevailing and it would be easier to convince people to go for vaccination if it were just one dose. It is also difficult for the rural population and those Below the Poverty Line have to keep track and get their second dose,” Dr Gyani said.India is currently administering Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccine, produced locally by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin which is being manufactured by Bharat Biotech. Russia’s Sputnik V has been approved for emergency use in the country.The vaccine is likely to cost ₹450 to 550 per dose, if procured through the EU route, he said. “We have data from 750 hospitals that want the vaccine. They wanted 6 million doses. We have not asked for any specific brand. Once we get the confirmation we shall again take a revised estimate from hospitals. In any case, we are targeting tier-II/III cities where vaccines have not reached,” he said.Dr Gyani also pointed out that trials may not be required for the vaccine in India.“According to our understanding of the policy, if a vaccine is approved by other developed countries, it will get approval in India. Of course, formal process of approval will be required but trials may not be needed as clarified in the case of Pfizer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-in-india-100-million-doses-of-j-j-vaccine-likely-to-be-procured-from-eu-101624992788697.html

It gave me a report. At Dompara, some people shouted slogans at the NHRC team. Some of the agitators were apparently under the influence of alcohol... Rasheed did not lodge any police complaint. If he files one, we will certainly look into it,” Khan said.Rasheed is among the seven people in the NHRC panel, which includes a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority. The panel is led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2. Other members include National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee.Also Read| Violence after Bengal polls was premeditated: ReportThe panel members have split themselves in two teams that are visiting north and south Bengal districts. They have already met members of more than 100 families. A camp was held in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata on Monday, where many people came to give their statements.On June 21, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence soon after the results of the recently concluded assembly polls were announced.The high court asked the NHRC to submit its report by June 30, which is the next date of hearing of this case.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari and Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee raised the allegation of attack on social media and demanded action.Debabrata Majumdar, Trinamool Congress legislator from Jadavpur, said, “I heard local people protested because the NHRC team was accompanied by many outsiders.

30-06-2021||India||Our anti-drone technology can stave off threats: DRDO chief||Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief G Satheesh Reddy on Tuesday said that the counter-drone technology developed by his organisation could provide the armed forces with the capability to swiftly detect, intercept and destroy small drones that pose a security threat.He said DRDO’s anti-drone system would give the military both “soft kill” and “hard kill” options to tackle the new and fast-emerging aerial threat. The first refers to jamming the hostile drone, while the second involves a laser-based kill system.Reddy’s comments came two days after small drones were used to target the Jammu air force station. The June 27 attack was the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility.DRDO’s counter-drone technology uses a variety of methods to neutralise the danger from such aerial attacks, officials familiar with it said on condition of anonymity.The officials explained how the system works. The solution consists of a radar system that offers 360-degree coverage with detection of micro drones when they are 4km away, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors for detection of micro drones up to 2 km and a radio frequency (RF) detector to detect RF communication up to 3 km“The RF/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammer can detect the frequency being used by the controller and jam signals from a distance of 3 km. The laser-based hard kill system can neutralise micro drones at distances between 150 m to 1 km. The system is integrated through a command post,” said one of the officials cited above.DRDO demonstrated its counter-drone technology to different security agencies at the Hindon air force station in January 2020 and at the National Security Guard (NSG) campus in Manesar in August 2020 and January 2021.“The radar detects micro drones and hands over the track for soft kill and hard kill after due verification by a sensor. Once confirmed by RF detection and verified by EO/IR sensor, the system is ready to jam RF/GNSS signals or use laser weapon as per standard operating procedures,” said a second official.The system was deployed for VVIP protection duties during Republic Day 2020, the visit of US President Donald Trump to Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, Independence Day 2020 and Republic Day 2021.“Prototypes for one vehicle-based and one ground-based set up have been prepared and evaluated by DRDO,” the second official added.DRDO has transferred the technology for the production of the anti-drone system to Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), and also written letters to the three services informing them about the system’s capabilities, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday.DRDO is also ready to transfer technology to private companies to produce the anti-drone system.The Jammu drone attack is a watershed in asymmetric warfare and underlines the need for the armed forces to build capabilities to counter the aerial threat, experts previously said.Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday said that India has to start preparing for future generation warfare. He said the three services, DRDO, academia and other stakeholders were working together to develop technology to counter the threat from drones at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-anti-drone-technology-can-stave-off-threats-drdo-chief-101624993037673.html
30-06-2021||India||Forces on alert amid more drone sightings in Jammu||JAMMU: Three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1am and 4.30am on Tuesday, an indication that terrorist groups could be trying to replicate Sunday’s drone strike at the Jammu air force station.“The army informed us that they spotted drones over Kaluchak, Ratnuchak and Sunjuwan early Tuesday. We are looking into it,” Jammu’s senior superintendent of police Chandan Kohli said. This is the third straight day that security forces have spotted drones near military installations.The first sighting on Tuesday was reported at 1.08am at Ratnuchak. Two hours later, military personnel at Kaluchak camp 300 metres away spotted the drone at 3.09am and finally at 4.19am, a drone was spotted near Sunjuwan, seven km away. Kaluchak and Ratnuchak are smaller military stations.The Sunjuwan military station, the largest of the three, was the target of a pre-dawn attack on 10 February 2018 carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. Six soldiers and a civilian were killed in this attack. The Kaluchak military station was attacked by terrorists on May 14, 2002 who hijacked a state roadways bus and used it to storm into the camp.A six-member team of Delhi Police officers has also reached Jammu to analyse the threat posed by the drones. “The team has come to be part of the probe and at the same time analyse the modus-operandi of the terrorists because Delhi is the capital and is densely populated ,” a person familiar with the development said, reflecting the concern that terrorists could next use drones to carry out attacks in cities like Delhi too.The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State fighters for one, to target forces in Iraq and Syria for years that prompted the United States and drone manufacturers to spend millions of dollars on research to stop what are sometimes called, the “killer bees”.As reported by HT on 20 October 2020, India’s intelligence community did warn that terror groups based in Pakistan were attempting to replicate the IS successes in use of cheap drones to carry out small bomb attacks.Initial investigations into Sunday’s attack have pointed to the role of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the drone strike at a Jammu air force station. Two Indian Air Force personnel were injured in the explosions that took place within six minutes of each other on Sunday. The first blast ripped off the roof of a single-storey building at the high security technical area of the airport manned by the IAF in Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbag Singh confirmed suspicions about the involvement of the Pakistan-based LeT. “The same group may also be behind the drones spotted near a military facility on Monday”, Singh told private news channel NDTV..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-on-alert-amid-more-drone-sightings-in-jammu-101624992977614.html

By filing this petition, Maheshwari has ensured that no order is passed by the top court without hearing him. The UP Police will also be required to serve a copy of its petition to Maheshwari’s legal team prior to the hearing.Also Read| Trouble mounts for Twitter amid new FIRs over map rowIn a related development, the Karnataka high court adjourned proceedings in Maheshwari’s petition on the request of Uttar Pradesh Police. On a request made by advocate P Prasanna Kumar representing UP Police, the single-judge bench of Justice G Narendra adjourned the matter to July 5. Though no reason was cited by Kumar, it is understood that time was sought to facilitate hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court.Law officers assisting the UP Police were tight-lipped about the contents of the appeal even as they hinted that the matter will be mentioned for urgent listing before the top court.The Uttar Pradesh Police had earlier summoned Maheshwari for questioning in connection with the viral video.

30-06-2021||India||Trouble mounts for Twitter amid new FIRs over map row||Madhya Pradesh police registered an FIR against Twitter India managing director Manish Maheswari on Tuesday, the second complaint in as many days against the company’s officials over a distorted map of India, showing both Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh outside the country, displayed on its website.The map was discovered on Monday, and taken down the same day.On Monday evening, Bulandshahr Police registered an FIR against Maheshwari and Amrita Tripathi at Khurja Nagar police station on the basis of a complaint by an advocate and office-bearer of Bajrang Dal, Praveen Bhati, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police S K Singh said.Maheshwari’s lawyer has previously clarified, in a different case, that he in charge of sales. Tripathi tweeted on Tuesday that she was in charge of partnerships at Twitter India. The FIR was registered under section 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code ((statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and Section 74 of the IT (Amendment) Act, 2008.In his complaint, Bhati said that he came across the distorted map on Monday while browsing the company’s website, Suresh Kumar, CO of Khurja Nagar said. Bhati added that the map was meant to “hurt the sentiments” of Indians.The Bhopal case was filed on a complaint by Sadbhavana Adhikar Manch, a Bhopal-based organisation, that alleged that Twitter was creating unrest and hurting the sentiments of people.“On Monday, the management of Twitter India crossed all the limits and uploaded a wrong map which hurt our sentiments. They tried to divide the country,” said Manch chief Durgesh Keshwani, also a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Bhopal cyber cell superintendent of police Gurukaran Singh said, “We received a complaint in the morning. After investigation, we found that Twitter India tried to promote enmity and hatred among a class of people, so we have registered a case against them.” The case was filed under section 505 (2) of the IPC.Earlier in the day, state home minister Narottam Mishra instructed the police to initiate legal action against Twitter. “Something or the other has been going on continuously against the country for a long time. Sometimes unrestrained words are spoken against Bharat Mata and sometimes a wrong map of the country is displayed on Twitter. These issues cannot be taken lightly,” Mishra said in a statement posted on Twitter.Twitter declined to comment on the two developments.Twitter has been in the eye of controversy over the past few months. On May 20, it labelled a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra “manipulated media” prompting a Delhi Police investigation. The special cell of Delhi Police questioned Maheshwari in late May.The company then missed a May 25 deadline to comply with the new guidelines for intermediaries and social media firms, and an official in the IT ministry previously told HT that the company would lose the protection it enjoyed as an intermediary under the country’s IT law as a result.The Ghaziabad Police has been wanting to question Maheshwari over a video clip that went viral earlier this month. The police believe Twitter did not do enough to halt the circulation of the clip which they believe misrepresents the nature of an attack on an elderly Muslim man as a communal hate crime. The Karkataka high court gave the Twitter executive protection from arrest and told the Ghaziabad Police that they could question him virtually, a ruling that has since been challenged in the Supreme Court.The map that caused the latest controversy was part of a larger image depicting the world map on the company’s website under the careers sections on the page titled Tweep Life. While it showed the disputed Aksai Chin area of Ladakh, illegally occupied by China, as part of that country, it depicted the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country.The misrepresentation caused an uproar online amid the ongoing impasse between the government and the micro-blogging firm.This is the second time that Twitter has run into trouble over a map in the past year. In October last year, the Centre had served Twitter with a notice over the geotag for Leh showing it as a part of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trouble-mounts-for-twitter-amid-new-firs-over-map-row-101624992677720.html

The new guidelines mandate that the social media firms appoint a compliance officer, liable for non-observance of rules, a grievance redressal officer and a nodal officer. Google and Facebook have both said they have complied with the guidelines.Issues regarding user safety and compliance with the new guidelines were part of the conversation, the person quoted above said on condition of anonymity. The issue of end-to-end encryption and the feasibility of traceability was also discussed. The matter was raised by Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, the person added. “Both companies told the panel that they did not read emails or messages exchanged between anyone as they were end to end encrypted,” the person said. “The panel was informed that adopting traceability would have to be a global practice, and doing it just in India is not really possible.”Also Read| Facebook to release its first compliance report in JulyFacebook-owned WhatsApp has already challenged the traceability clause in the court, arguing it invades privacy and negates end-to-end encryption.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked Google about whether it listens to conversations on “Ok Google”, its voice command-based platform, another person said.In a statement later, Google said it welcomes the chance to engage with policy makers and ensure the safety of its users. “We always welcome opportunities to engage in dialogue with the policy makers and share details of our efforts in combating illegal content and ensuring the safety of users across our platforms,” a Google spokesperson said. “We have consistently invested in significant product changes, resources, and personnel and have made significant progress in balancing the openness of our platforms with the responsibility of keeping the community safe in compliance with the local laws in the country.”HT reached out to Facebook but did not receive a response immediately.Also Read| WhatsApp, Facebook widely used for news, trust in television low: ReportThe panel, which is headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, has also decided to send a letter to Twitter, seeking an explanation over briefly locking out Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Tharoor from their accounts for alleged copyright infringement. “The panel has sought an explanation from Twitter as to why they had to lock the two accounts instead of taking down the content,” the second person said.On Friday, Ravi Shankar Prasad said he was denied access to his account by the company, which said he violated the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

30-06-2021||India||PM Modi to review Covid-19 vaccine drive with council of ministers today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a meeting of the Union council of ministers on Wednesday to discuss the Covid-19 vaccination program across the country and may also review the functioning of few ministries, officials familiar with the matter said.The meeting comes at a time when the Centre is going full steam ahead to prepare for the anticipated third wave of the Covid pandemic and simultaneously working out relief measures for various sectors to revive the economy. The last meeting of the council of ministers was held on April 30.A senior functionary who did not wish to be named indicated that the meeting is likely to discuss how the vaccination drive is gaining pace across the country.“The prime minister might also apprise the ministers of the recent relief packages announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and ask them to spread the message to the public about the measures taken by the government to mitigate the pain and problems of the people,” the functionary said.Over the past month, a series of review meetings have been chaired by the prime minister to oversee the work undertaken by various ministries in the last two years of the government’s term in office.According to a person aware of the developments, ministers who gave presentations on the achievements of their respective sectors were also asked to provide details of the key schemes that will require additional funding.“There are many schemes that require more funding but with the additional pressure on resources because of the pandemic, there is a need to rationalise the allocation. The review exercise also sought to assess which of the social schemes have scope for further enhancement,” the person cited above said.Wednesday’s meeting also comes in the wake of speculation that a cabinet expansion is on the cards.Modi also held meetings with chief ministers of various states, including the election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where the BJP is in power.The Union government has been on an overdrive to dispel perceptions about its lack of preparation for the second wave of the pandemic. Severe shortages of essential medical care including oxygen, drugs and hospital beds were reported from across the country, exposing the deficiencies in the healthcare system.Amid fears that these deficiencies may cast a shadow on the forthcoming set of assembly elections in seven states, the BJP has begun preparations to change the perception on the ground.On Saturday, party national president JP Nadda chaired a meeting with several Union ministers, national general secretaries of the party and senior party members to tick-tock other parties’ preparation for the anticipated third wave. The meeting also discussed how coordination between the party and the government can be improved so as to create more awareness about the social welfare schemes and the steps taken by the government to offer relief during the second wave.With the economy and employment taking a hit in the wake of the pandemic, the government has stepped up efforts to provide relief. On Monday, Sitharaman announced eight new schemes to boost the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-review-vaccine-drive-with-council-of-ministers-today-101624992557706.html
30-06-2021||India||TN to get its own whole genome sequencing lab||Tamil Nadu is set to establish a whole genomic sequencing lab so that it doesn’t have to send samples to other cities such as Bengaluru and Pune as it is doing so now. Health minister M Subramanian on Tuesday said that it will be set up in Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University located in Chennai to study Covid-19 variants. After holding a review meeting on Tuesday with the institution’s senior members, including vice-chancellor Dr Sudha Seshayyan, the minister told reporters, “This is already a nationally accredited microbiology and immunology lab, and soon it will function to research on the Delta Plus variant.” The university is currently researching diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, HIV and leptospirosis. Tamil Nadu has reported nine Delta plus variant cases so far. “Having a lab of our own will give us better advantages,” he said. The state has already written to ICMR to set up the lab. The union health ministry had also written to the state to take immediate measures as the Delta plus variant is of concern due to its characteristics of being highly transmissible and stronger bonding to lung cells’ receptors. The union had also asked the state to send adequate Covid-19 positive samples to INSACOG, a consortium of designated labs for whole-genome sequencing. Since the second wave saw a high prevalence of more transmissible variants associated with reinfection and vaccine breakthrough cases, Tamil Nadu began the exercise to identify the variants circulating in the state.

On June 23, Alipiri police in Tirupati found the charred body of the woman in a suitcase in bushes near Sri Venkata Ramana Ruia (SVRR) government general hospital. With the help of forensic experts, police identified the body as that of M Bhuvaneshwari, from Ramasamudram village in Chittoor district. Police said she was working as a software engineer with an IT company in Hyderabad. Alipiri circle inspector Devendra Kumar said the woman, along with her husband M Srikanth Reddy, from Badwel in Kadapa district, and their 18-month-old daughter, had been residing in Tirupati for the last three months due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to the police, the video footage obtained from the CCTV cameras showed Reddy entering the apartment complex with a red suitcase and after sometime, leaving the apartment, rolling it along, and carrying his daughter in one hand. The CCTV camera footage also showed him moving around the hospital area in cab. Police picked up the cab driver, who confessed to have helped Reddy in disposing the body. “We have launched the manhunt for Srikanth Reddy, who had been absconding since the incident happened. We are yet to gather complete details about him,” Kumar told HT. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Reddy, also a techie, lost his job during the pandemic, which led to frequent quarrels between the wife and husband. “He might have killed Bhuvaneshwari in a fit of rage during an argument,” a police officer said. Before absconding, Reddy told his wife’s family that she died of Covid-19 and hospital authorities conducted the last rites as per protocol, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/burnt-body-of-woman-found-in-a-bag-police-on-lookout-for-husband-in-andhra-101624992017563.html
30-06-2021||India||Andhra govt to merge anganwadis with schools||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to do away with anganwadi centres in rural areas and merge them with pre-primary and primary schools to form “Foundation Schools”, with effect from the current academic year, people aware of the development said. Anganwadi centres, set up under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme of the central government way back in 1975, have been functioning as rural childcare centres, providing health care facilities and nutritious food to children up to six years of age, besides taking up non-formal pre-school teaching. According to a senior official from the state women development and child welfare department, a total of 55,607 anganwadi centres with the total strength of 870,000 children are currently functional in Andhra Pradesh. Of these, 11,448 anganwadis are located within the premises of local schools. The state government has been providing nutritious food to children from the age of seven months to six years in these anganwadis. “Now, all these anganwadi centres will be converted into Foundation Schools, which comprise pre-primary classes, Class 1 and Class 2. They will teach Telugu and English, besides moral science, teamwork and self-awareness,” the official said on Tuesday. The proposal was discussed at a convergence meeting of the school education and women development and child welfare departments convened by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in May. At the meeting, it was decided to bring anganwadi workers into the teaching stream at the foundation schools. Officials also proposed to the chief minister that as per the Centre guidelines, anganwadi teachers would have to study diploma courses in teaching methods where they are taught easy ways to teach children. “They would be absorbed into the education department as special grade teachers through promotions,” the official said. As regards health-related activities of anganwadi centres, which are being taken care of by anganwadi workers, it was proposed that all these activities be brought under YSR Village Clinics and urban clinics being set up by the state. The health, nutrition awareness, health screening, vaccination for immunisations and referral services, presently being looked after by anganwadi centres, will be shifted to YSR Village Clinics, the official added. It was also decided that classes 3, 4 and 5 of primary schools will be transferred to nearby upper primary schools and high schools. The upper primary schools will be converted into high schools. At the meeting, the chief minister suggested that all foundation schools should be set up within one kilometre‌ radius of villages and high schools should be within three km radius so as to reduce the transportation cost of students, the official said. Meanwhile, the state government’s proposal to merge anganwadis with foundation schools triggered protests from anganwadi workers. “The proposed changes have created a lot of insecurity among us. The government has not made it clear on what basis these changes are being made without any prior notice,” K Subbaravamma, general secretary, Andhra Pradesh Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union, told HT. She said the anganwadi workers were extending six different types of services including neo-natal care and prevention of malnutrition, but not just pre-school education. “The merger of anganwadi centres with pre-schools is against the spirit of the ICDS project,” Subbaravamma said. The official quoted above, however, said the CM had given a clear instruction to the officials that not a single employee of anganwadi centres should be laid off. “There is no closure of any anganwadi centres, but they are only being merged with the foundation schools as part of the reforms in the education system,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-merge-anganwadis-with-schools-101624991957664.html
30-06-2021||India||Kerala HC stays demolition of houses close to sea in Lakshadweep||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday stayed the demolition of houses and structures in Lakshadweep situated close to the sea for flouting coastal norms. People living in at least 100 houses were served notices by the island administration, and aggrieved parties later moved the court. In their petition, two residents of Kavaratti said since the sea was their main source of living, they have been staying close to it for years, and the order to demolish their dwellings was illegal and arbitrary. They were served notices last month saying that their structures were against the integrated island management plan, and they lie within 20 metres from the high tide line. NEED QUOTE HEREBut petitioners contended that all dwellings were constructed before the enactment of the island management plan which came later and cannot be applied retrospectively. They also argued that a special permit was not required to construct any building on their land, that the notices were arbitrary and with ulterior motives. and that the notices were a clear infringement of the rights of scheduled tribes. About 90% of the island’s population are Muslims and they come under the scheduled tribe category. The administration cited many existing laws to buttress its point and said most of the buildings under notice were constructed illegally and against the integrated island management plan. After hearing both sides, a single bench of Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan stayed all proceedings till further notice. Last week, the high court stayed two other controversial orders of administrator Praful Khoda Patel relating to the closure of dairy farms and exclusion of meat from the midday meal scheme.Residents of the island have been protesting against some of the regulations brought by the new administrator for more than a month, saying they will dilute their customs and traditions. They are up in arms against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination, proposed goonda act and plan to ban cow slaughter on the island. Meanwhile, filmmaker Aisha Sultana who returned to Kochi, after being questioned for five days by the Lakshadweep police, in connection with a sedition, said she will continue her fight for the self-respect and identity of the island people. Talking to a news channel, Sultana said she will make a movie on her experience. A sedition case was slapped on her by the island police for calling the administrator a bioweapon during a panel discussion on a news channel. Later, the Kerala High Court had granted her anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stays-demolition-of-houses-close-to-sea-in-lakshadweep-101624991897619.html
30-06-2021||India||Madras HC questions TN govt over panel on NEET||The Madras high court has ordered notice on a petition moved by the state BJP unit challenging the former justice A K Rajan-headed committee, constituted by the new Tamil Nadu government, to study the impact of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on students from socially backward classes. The court has directed the state to respond in a week and the union government is also at liberty to submit its stance on the issue. The interim orders were passed by the first bench, comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on a writ petition filed by BJP’s state general secretary Karu Nagarajan, seeking to quash the order that constituted the 9-member committee. The court took note of the plea that there isn’t much room for the state to look for an alternative in the light of the Supreme Court’s August 2017 judgement (in the case of R Nakkiran versus the state of Tamil Nadu) that directed the state to implement NEET. The justice Rajan committee had also sought suggestions and objections from the public before June 26 on the matter. The plea had stated that the committee is ‘arbitrary, illegal, unconstitutional and unreasonable. Advocate general R Shunmugasundaram submitted that the move was backed by the party’s election manifesto as well as people’s demands. NEET is an emotional issue in the state where several students died by suicide either due to failure in the exam or due to fear of failure. Before NEET came into Tamil Nadu in 2017, entrance to medical colleges was based on class-12 marks. The state is of the view that medical aspirants from rural and poor backgrounds were discriminated against by competing with other students, who could afford coaching for NEET from top institutions. The previous AIADMK regime had introduced a horizontal reservation of 7.5% for government school students who cleared NEET for admissions into medical colleges.The case has been posted to next Monday.Health minister M Subramanian accused the BJP of double speak. Last week chief minister M K Stalin stated that the DMK and AIADMK were on the same page on the issue and asked the BJP in the assembly if they will lend their voice when Tamil Nadu seeks an exemption from NEET. The national party’s legislative party leader Nainar Nagendran responded that they would support a decision taken through legal means. “Nainar Nagendran said that they will support any legal decision but, in a contradiction, they have filed a writ petition against it which shows their double speak to the whole world,” Subramanian told reporters. He added that the AIADMK, which leads the NDA alliance, should also make clear its stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-questions-tn-govt-over-panel-on-neet-101624991717570.html

30-06-2021||India||India records large deficiency as monsoon enters break phase: IMD||The country recorded a “large deficiency” of rain on Tuesday, which was 60% less than normal, due to the ‘break monsoon’ period that began on Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The shortfall was 43% between Monday and Tuesday.The southwest monsoon has weakened in the past week, or taken a ‘break’, as weather scientists put it.“The models indicate that a very weak or break monsoon period will continue till July 5. Such a phase is part of the monsoon’s internal dynamics. Sometimes it’s in an active phase and sometimes it moves over to a very subdued phase. We can predict these fluctuations,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Experts say the ‘break monsoon’ phase happens when the monsoon has already covered the entire country. “The monsoon trough moves to the foothills and wind flow is mostly westerly, there is little contribution from Bay of Bengal and hence little convective activity. During break monsoon phases, rains are limited to northeast India. But this time the trough is not near the Himalayan foothills, but the monsoon flow itself has weakened,” said O P Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD.IMD thinks the monsoon will remain “extremely subdued” till at least July 5. “We do not have model outputs for dates ahead of that. There is no indication of any low-pressure area developing over the Bay of Bengal before July 10. Low-pressure systems help monsoon advance, but other factors could also help,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Scientists had predicted this last week. “Up to the first week of July, there are no indications of monsoon reviving. The cross-equatorial flow has weakened, and the pressure gradient is less. Normally, monsoon flow moves from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The monsoon current itself has weakened, so its onset is unlikely over the remaining parts of the country till it revives,” Sreejith had said on June 26.Overall, the country has recorded 13% excess rain since June 1 with 3 of 36 subdivisions recording “large excess” (60% or more), 15 recording “excess” (20% to 59%), 11 recording “normal” (-19% to 19%), and seven recording “deficient” rain (-59% to -20%).“We expect monsoon rains to be only 10 to 12% excess for June. In July, the normal thresholds also increase because normally more rain is recorded in July, but let’s see how monsoon makes up for the gap,” Jenamani added.The northern limit of southwest monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar. It has been at the same position for a week now.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamic models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next five days,” IMD said in its bulletin on Tuesday.Subdued rain is very likely to prevail over northwest, central and western parts of Peninsular India during the next five days. Isolated/scattered thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and rain are also likely over these regions during this period.Under the influence of strong moisture-laden southwesterly winds, widespread rain is very likely over Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and the other northeastern states in the next five days.Subsequently, moist easterly winds are likely to pick up in strength, causing enhanced rain all along the Himalayan foothills of north Bihar, north Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand from July 1 to 3, leading to increased inflow into the rivers originating or flowing through these regions. Isolated heavy to very heavy rain is very likely over Uttarakhand and the Himalayan foothills of east Uttar Pradesh during July 1 to 3.Strong surface winds, with speeds reaching 20-30 km/hr, are likely to blow over Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh on June 30 and July 1.Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning are very likely over Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during the next 24 hours. IMD warned that this could cause serious harm to both people and animals staying outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-large-deficiency-as-monsoon-enters-break-phase-imd-101624991177581.html
30-06-2021||India||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha told to prepare for a ‘normal session’||New Delhi: The union government has asked Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to prepare for a “normal session” of Parliament that is likely to begin from third week of July, two officials familiar with the matter said.“The tentative schedule of the session is from July 19 to August 13. The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary affairs, headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh will meet to decide the schedule,” said said one of the people cited above, who asked not to be named. The communication to the presiding officers was sent three days ago.The last three Parliament sessions were cut short due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, with the winter session in both Houses being skipped altogether. HT reported on June 8 that the session is likely be held in July, the normal schedule of the monsoon session, quoting a top functionary.The second official added that an ebbing second wave of the pandemic coupled with the full vaccination of more than 75% of the MPs (across both houses) means that a full session could be conducted as per the usual schedule.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla recently told HT that the upcoming session will follow usual Covid safety protocols, but that vaccination will not be a pre-requisite for attendance. The last session saw mandatory and regular RT-PCR tests.At least 40 bills and five ordinances are awaiting Parliament’s approval and a normal session that usually lasts for a month, can give the government enough room to push through its legislative agenda. The Opposition too, can demand discussion on issues that could not be accomodated in the past few session due to paucity of time. “Subjects such as the economic situation, vaccination policy, spiraling price rise and fuel price hike are some that we want to take up,” a senior Opposition leader said on condition of anonymity.Five ordinances are currently in force. The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance and The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance need to be replaced with bills as the Indian Constitution gives a window of only six weeks from the beginning of a parliament session after ordinances are rolled out.The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for seven consecutive weeks in the country. The seven-day average of new infections touched a peak of 391,819 new cases a day on May 9, has dropped to 48,423 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 88% from the peak.The rate of vaccinations, meanwhile, has picked up pace with the introduction of a new vaccine policy starting June 21. Between June 21 and June 28, nearly six million doses of the vaccine were administered across the country every day on average – the highest ever. Till Tuesday evening, 56.3 million Indians had received both doses of the vaccine and another 211 million had received one dose. That means around 28.5% of the eligible population (those over the age of 18 years) has received at least one shot of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-rs-told-to-prepare-for-a-normal-session-101624991117625.html
30-06-2021||India||After protests over ‘forced conversion’, Sikh woman married within community||An 18 year-old Sikh woman from Srinagar, whose alleged abduction and forced conversion to Islam sparked protests in Kashmir, married a man from her faith at a ceremony arranged by her parents and community leaders on Tuesday.The woman, who was sent to her family after she appeared in court on Sunday, married Sukhbir Singh, also from Srinagar, said Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Delhi unit president Paramjit Singh.“I met the family of the girl. This issue was settled today. The girl was married by her family to a person she wanted. She knew the person,” Singh said. He also refuted reports of the woman’s marriage to her alleged abductor, a 29-year-old Muslim man.The woman was not available for comment, and it was unclear whether she had converted to Islam, or acted out of her free will. The man is in police remand till July 1. His family could not be reached for comment.The controversy broke on Saturday after the woman’s family filed an abduction complaint and protests sparked largely helmed by SAD leaders. On Tuesday, a delegation led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader RP Singh met Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy in Delhi.“The delegation submitted a memorandum about the alleged forced conversion and wedding of Sikh girls in Kashmir. I will discuss the matter with the Union home minister (Amit Shah) about the action that is required to be taken,” said Reddy.But in Srinagar, local leaders appeared to dial down the intensity of the protests, calling for communal harmony and saying that they did not want any anti-conversion law.“The majority community has to take care of the minority community. A law can’t do it but only mutual love and brotherhood can do it,” Paramjit Singh said. Sikhs form roughly 2% of the population of Jammu and Kashmir.He also condemned the statements made by some leaders and reached out to the Muslim community. “Although I have no concern with them but since a Sikh came from Delhi and gave a statement, I apologise for that…we also met people from Mirwaiz (Umar Farooq) and Muslim organisations. The way all of them collaborated with us, we won’t forget that for the rest of our lives,” he said.On Monday, SAD leader and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa alleged that four Sikh women were forcibly married and converted to Islam in Kashmir.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said that he has no information on the issue.“I will have to find out how much truth is in these claims,” he said.At least one of these four women approached the Jammu and Kashmir high court in May, seeking protection from family and police and saying that she changed her religion and married a Muslim man willingly.The court granted Viran Pal Lour, who became Khadeeja after marrying Manzoor Ahmad Bhat on January 20 this year as per Islamic rituals, police protection.In a statement, Mutahida Majlis-e-Ulema, a prominent Islamic religious body headed by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, refuted the claims of forced conversion.The chairman of All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee, Jagmohan Singh Raina, said that outsiders were trying to provoke the situation. “There were many wrong statements like claims of abduction at gun point and other things. Many outsiders have exploited the situation rather for their vested interest,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-protests-over-forced-conversion-sikh-woman-married-within-community-101624991057568.html
30-06-2021||India||Govt apathy to migrants unpardonable, says Supreme Court||Citing the tribulations of the migrant workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that “the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the ministry of labour and employment is unpardonable”, and directed the Centre to make the national portal for registration of unrecognised workers operational by July 31 so that various benefits could flow to the marginalised section.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah also ordered all states and Union territories to implement the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme by July 31 to help beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, to avail of subsidised food commodities from anywhere in the country.The court, which passed a slew of directives in the matter registered suo motu (on its own motion) to ameliorate the miseries of the migrant workers affected by the pandemic, took a stern view that the national portal for the registration of unorganised workers remained in limbo even after 30 months of the central government’s assurance to the Supreme Court on making the facility fully functional by the end of 2018.Relying on a survey by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in 2017-2018 that reckoned the number of persons in the unorganised sector as 380 million and 94% of the total workforce, the bench bemoaned the fact that unrecognised workers might have failed to avail of the benefits available to them under the laws during the pandemic because of the laxity by the Union labour ministry in operationalising the portal for registration under the National Database for Unorganised Workers project.“When the unorganised workers are waiting for registration, and are waiting to reap the benefit of various welfare schemes of the states and the Centre, the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the ministry of labour and employment is unpardonable. There was urgency in the portal to be finalised and implemented looking at the pandemic and dire need of unorganised workers to receive the benefit,” regretted the bench, adding that registration was the first step to grant benefits to migrant workers.“The attitude of the ministry of labour and employment in not completing the module even though directed as early as on August 21, 2018 shows that ministry is not alive to the concern of the migrant workers and the non-action of the ministry is strongly disapproved,” maintained the court as it rejected a request by the ministry to give it at least three months more to operationalise the portal.It directed the secretary, ministry of labour, to ensure that the national portal commences by July 31, and called for a compliance report by the end of August. The court also asked states and Union territories to cooperate with the Centre and upload the data of the workers on the portal “at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021”. It further directed states and Union territories to register all establishments and license all contractors who must furnish particulars of the migrant workers employed with them.Shortly after the nationwide lockdown was imposed last year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers spilled out on the to the highways, walking and cycling hundreds of kilometres back to their homes in the hinterlands. Many went without food for days, boarded packed trains back to their homes, faced hostility and bias as ‘outsiders’ and perished on the way. Their plight prompted the Union and state governments to set up relief measures. On the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card scheme, the court called it “an important citizen centric reform” to extend food security to migrants who were covered under the National Food Security Act Scheme as it emphasised that providing food security to impoverished persons was the bounden duty of all states and governments.“When migrant workers are spread throughout the country, each state has to implement the scheme, which is a necessary welfare measure towards food security to this class of persons. The states are duty-bound to implement this scheme, which is a welfare scheme in the interest of poor and marginal sections of the society,” said the court, directing all states to implement the scheme by July 31 so that nobody is denied ration for not being in his native state.According to the Centre’s submissions in the apex court, three states -- West Bengal, Assam and Chhatisgarh -- were yet to implement the scheme, while Delhi had not implemented it fully. The scheme is currently functional in 32 states and Union territories and allows eligible beneficiaries to get food grain under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops across India without securing a new ration card.In other directives, the bench told the states to frame proper schemes for distributing dry ration to migrant workers who may not have ration cards while obligating the Union government to allocate additional foodgrains in terms of demands made by the states. Community kitchens, the court said, must also continue till the pandemic prolongs. The court noted as many as 2.8 crore were identified as migrant workers by the states during the first Covid-19 wave and that dry ration should be made available to them.About the coverage of rural and urban population under National Food Security Act, 2013, the court noted that state-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (now Niti Aayog) by using the household consumption survey data for 2011-2012 and if a fresh survey were to be carried out now, number of beneficiaries would go up drastically benefitting the large number of eligible persons.The bench urged the central government to carry out a fresh survey to redetermine the total number of people to be covered under the rural and urban areas of the states so that more persons eligible for the benefits under the act could also be covered.At the same time, the court refused to issue any directive to the Union or the state governments to implement direct bank transfer to the migrant workers. “The direct bank transfer, being matter of policy and being in domain of the state, no direction can be issued by this court. We only observe that in event any person is entitled for direct bank transfer as per the existing scheme in any state, he can avail the said benefit by the mechanism as provided in the policy decision,” it held.With these directions, the bench drew the curtains on the public interest case that it had registered last year and passed orders from time to time.Meanwhile HT also reached out to the labour ministry for a comment over the current status of this registration portal. DPS Negi, Director General of labor bureau, the data arm of the ministry, said that the issue of registration portal pertains to the Labour Welfare Department. Director General Labor Welfare Department, Ajay Tiwari did not respond to the repeated calls from HT.HT also talked to Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Gangwar over the issue.Gangwar said that he does not have the immediate knowledge of the directions that Supreme Court has given, however, he assured that the ministry will abide by all these directions. He added that he would review the status of the registration portal tomorrow and update HT with the details on it. The story will be updated after a response from the minister.“We had floated tenders to implement the scheme twice, but no bidder could be selected due to technical issues. That’s why the scheme got delayed in Assam. We have finally zeroed in on one bidder after the third tender. Negotiations are underway with the latest bidder, and we are confident of launching the scheme soon,” said a senior government officer on condition of anonymity.West Bengal food and supplies minister, Rathin Ghosh could not be contacted but a senior officer of the department said on condition of anonymity that the government has started the paperwork for implementing the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on June 14 at the state secretariat that the Bengal government will implement it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-apathy-to-migrants-unpardonable-says-sc-101624991058214.html
30-06-2021||India||Violence after Bengal polls was premeditated: Report||A fact finding team set up by a civil society initiative, Call for Justice, has said in its report that the simultaneous beginning of violence across villages and towns in West Bengal hours after the poll verdict came in were “not sporadic but premeditated, organised and conspiratorial” , a finding that is likely to open a new front in the ongoing hostilities between the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government.The committee, headed by former chief Justice of the Sikkim High Court Permod Kohli, and comprising former chief secretary of Kerala, Ananda Bose, former DGP of Jharkhand, Nirmal Kaur, past president of ICSI Nisar Ahmed and former additional chief secretary of Karnataka, M Madan Gopal submitted its report to minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy on Wednesday. HT has seen a copy of the report.The BJP has alleged its workers and supporters have been the target of post-poll violence in West Bengal and has accused the TMC government in the state of failing to take action against the perpetrators of the crimes.The TMC says the BJP is a sore loser and has been building a narrative against it.The BJP expected to unseat the TMC and win over 200 seats in the state but could manage only 77. The TMC has alleged that action by enforcement agencies against its leaders since, the Governor’s ongoing criticism of the way the state is run, and proceedings against the state’s former chief secretary initiated by the Union government are all motivated by this loss.The report echoes the Union government and BJP’s position about “demographic changes in border districts” on account of the state’s “porous borders” with Bangladesh, and the resulting “increase in unlawful activities in these areas”. It calls for an investigation by the National Investigation Agency into the post-poll violence in this context. It also seeks the creation of an “empowered committee... to study the demographic changes that have taken place over the past few decades, specifically in the border districts”.“The Home Ministry will study the report and will try to implement its recommendations,” Reddy told reporters after the group submitted the report to him.The report also criticises the state’s police (“victims who gathered courage and went to the police were either turned away or asked to settle the matter with the culprits”) and says many people left “their homes in villages for safer destinations, to shelter camps within and outside the state.” It puts on record the state government’s silence in sharing its views on the post poll violence with the committee.“These are some wild allegations raised by a team, the members of which have no connection with Bengal. They have done what they have been instructed to do. The reality is somewhat different. There were some incidents of post-poll violence after May 2, till the time, when law and order was with the ECI. Even TMC workers were killed during that period. Ever since Mamata Banerjee took charge on May 5 there has been no such incidents. On the contrary there is a split in the BJP as the leaders are nowhere to be seen. BJP workers are now feeling ashamed of what they have said and done on the orders of their leaders,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The committee has also asked for a special relief package to be declared by the state government that includes resettlement and rehabilitation and interdisciplinary proceedings against “delinquent officers” who failed to discharge the duties in protecting lives and destruction of properties.In an address to party workers in Bengal on Tuesday, BJP president JP Nadda said, “The report says the violence was a well-planned conspiracy and criminals were involved with political workers. It says men were killed and women raped. Elections were held in so many states but nowhere did we witness such violence. Women faced most of the attacks although the chief minister of the state is a woman.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-after-bengal-polls-was-premeditated-report-101624990997564.html
30-06-2021||India||Moderna’s Covid vaccine approved for use in India||India on Tuesday approved the import of US pharmaceutical major Moderna’s mRNA technology-based coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, paving the way for the entry of the first international vaccine against the infectious disease into the country.On behalf of Moderna, Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla Ltd applied to the country’s drugs regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India, for grant of approval to import the vaccine to India.“An application received from Moderna through an Indian partner of theirs, namely Cipla, has been granted new drug permission for restricted use that is commonly known as emergency use authorisation. This is the first internationally developed vaccine for which now such permission exists today, and this potentially opens up a clear possibility of this vaccine being imported into India in the near future. Let’s see how this opportunity will be used for accessing the vaccine in the country. There must be other formalities that they will have to follow but a very important licensure has been given,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the Union health ministry’s media briefing on Covid-19 updates.Also Read| Moderna shares jump to all-time high amid Delta variant fearModerna is donating an unspecified number of doses to India through the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi’s COVAX mechanism; Cipla is facilitating this, and the approvals are part of the process. In a statement, Cipla said it is “supporting Moderna with the regulatory approval and importation of vaccines to be donated to India. At this stage, there is no definitive agreement on commercial supplies.” It wasn’t clear how many doses will be imported, and when.An official said the approval was not limited to donations. “Cipla has been given a licence to import, and it is applicable to the Moderna vaccine import in general, under which they are also allowed to distribute it here; since it is still under emergency use authorization retail sale of the product is not allowed. It does not matter whether the doses are a part of some donation or otherwise being exported by the US company, Cipla is now authorized to import the Moderna vaccine,” the official aware of the matter in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said on condition of anonymity.“Even though it is totally up to them how much they want to import and when, it is likely that about 7 million doses are imported, and the process should start in next 5-6 days. Moderna has definitely got the first mover advantage...,” the official added.In a statement, Moderna said the government of India issued a registration certificate and a permission to import the Covid-19 vaccine for restricted use in an emergency situation. “I want to thank the government of India for this authorization, which marks an important step forward in the global fight against the pandemic,” a statement by the company’s CEO said.Previously, news reports in May, citing unnamed people, said Cipla was considering spending up to $1 billion to import 50 million doses of the vaccine. HT learns that Cipla has also sought indemnity for the Moderna vaccine, much like other international vaccine makers negotiating their entry into India. The government is yet to take a call on indemnity for any foreign vaccine maker.“Moderna is coming in the ready-to-inject form. There is no manufacturing base as of now, like in case of Sputnik V, but we also hope that in the future, Moderna will produce this vaccine on Indian soil; and make this, therefore, into a made-in-India vaccine. There will be no need for a bridging study that has been already clarified, but recipients of first 100 doses of the vaccine will be closely watched. So, now there are four Covid-19 vaccines approved: Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik and Moderna; our vaccine basket is now richer by this addition,” Paul added.Also Read| Efficacy against Covid-19, safe for kids? All you need to know about ModernaThe vaccine, mRNA-1273, manufactured by Moderna TX, Inc., is a two-dose vaccine with the shots to be given 28 days apart. Messenger RNA vaccines, also called mRNA vaccines, are a new vaccine technology platform.The vaccine can be stored for up to seven months between -25 and -15 degrees Celsius; and its medium-term storage temperature is -20 degrees. In normal cold chains, where the temperature is between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, an unopened vial can stay effective for 30 days.The mRNA vaccines teach human cells how to make a protein, or even just a piece of a protein of the virus, triggering an immune response inside human bodies. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is that those vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with Covid-19.According to the evidence generated through clinical trials, in people aged 18 years and older, the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection.Experts welcomed the clearance of an mRNA vaccine.“There are likely going to be small numbers for next many months, so unlikely (to be a) major contribution to public health. But it is very valuable as a process and for a small group of people for whom other vaccines may not work well,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.In early June, after reports of a partnership with Moderna surfaced, Cipla said in a statement that it is “in the process of seeking clarity and guidance from the Government of India for exploring the possible road map for vaccine importation to India.” “At this stage, no definitive terms have been finalized and hence, the Company cannot comment further,” read the company statement.Paul also mentioned during the media briefing that the government was making necessary efforts to also bring in other foreign vaccines to India and that the sticky indemnity issue is under consideration and examination.“Our efforts to invite, and to have other internationally developed vaccines, specifically Pfizer and J&J, continue. Those processes are on, and we are also looking at increased production, and availability, of our own vaccines that are being manufactured already in our country. We look forward to the vaccination programme gaining further momentum.”“We have had multiple sessions with Pfizer; going through the agreements that are required for such an arrangement to be operationalised, and exchange of information and thoughts, and inputs are going back and forth. The process is very much on and we have done an intensive meeting last week. We are looking forward to receiving the feedback from their end now,” he added.In an emailed response, a Pfizer company spokesperson said: “We continue to engage with the government to make our Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available for use in the country.”A Johnson & Johnson India spokesperson said: “At Johnson & Johnson, we remain fully focused on bringing a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to people in India. We are in ongoing discussions with the Government of India and are exploring how best to accelerate our ability to deliver our Janssen single dose COVID-19 vaccine to India.”J&J already has a manufacturing tie-up with Biological E, which is also making a protein sub-unit vaccine of its own.To facilitate the entry of foreign made vaccines into India, the government earlier made regulatory modifications.On June 2, the national drugs controller announced that Covid-19 vaccines approved by specific countries and WHO would no longer require post-approval bridging trials and batch testing in India.“If the vaccine has been certified and released by the national control laboratory of certain countries or if it is listed in the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL), it can be exempted from the aforementioned requirement,” stated a letter issued by CDSCO that is headed by the drugs controller.However, additional scrutiny and review shall continue, DCGI said, and before the vaccine is rolled out for further immunisation programmes, the first 100 beneficiaries shall be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes, along with other procedures for the filing of applications and timelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modernas-covid-vaccine-approved-for-use-in-india-101624990937539.html
30-06-2021||India||Central Vista revamp: New Parl, Vice Prez house will be first to be completed||The vice president’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years.Documents seen by HT and officials aware of the matter said that the project’s progress and completion is built around finding temporary space on the Vista itself for the people working in buildings that will be renovated.The Central Vista Avenue, for which no staff needs to be relocated, will be completed by December 2021, officials said. They explained that the vice president’s estate, coming up on a corner of Rafi Marg that currently houses hutments and barracks, will be the first to be taken up because offices and people working there are the easiest to relocate (and do not need to be in the Central Vista at all).North and South Block, which house the Union home, finance and defence ministries, apart from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), will be the last to be vacated because these crucial departments will need to be set up in their newly built offices first.It is this carousel of movement – with the aim of minimally disrupting key government work – that will shape the schedule of the ₹13,500 project. A lack of space in Delhi’s power corridor means that buildings need to be vacated in phases, and ministries moved to new structures before tearing down old offices and rebuilding them.“The priority will be to first shift those existing ministries to the new buildings…we will not make the ministries in the North and South Block move twice where they are inconvenienced with moving to temporary accommodations first,” a senior official of the Union housing and urban development ministry said on condition of anonymity.Two other buildings that also don’t need any major structures to be torn down are the new Prime Minister’s residence to come up at a 15 acre plot near South Block, and the New Parliament at plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate.At the heart of the scheme is the sprawling 25 acre campus of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) – one of the few large open spaces in Lutyen’s Delhi with roughly 500 employees.IGNCA will be shifted first to Janpath Hotel and then to Jamnagar House by 2023, and the existing buildings at the IGNCA campus torn down to make space for the first three secretariat buildings. They are likely to be ready by May 2023 to receive officials from some major ministries, including those housed at Shastri Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan, though the final schedule is yet to be drawn.These decades-old bhavans will then be rebuilt as modern secretariat buildings and once ready, in the summer of 2024, they will take in more officials from across central Delhi. With each tranche of shifting, more buildings will free up for reconstruction. The final three secretariat buildings will be ready by June 2025, according to people familiar with the matter and official documents.Once all the secretariat buildings are functional – earliest by June 2025 -- work will begin on shifting the North and South Block ministries out of the heritage buildings. Then, the final stage of the Central Vista will commence by shifting antiquities from the National Museum.“We will start the work on that at a much later stage…work will start only after those ministries have been moved to the new common secretariat buildings first,” said the senior ministry official quoted in the first instance.A tentative completion timeline of the central public works department (CPWD) -- the nodal agency for the project -- showed that an underground Automated People Mover (APM) for Union government employees and a central conference centre will be the final two projects to finish by September 2026 and December 2026, respectively.The chief architect for the project, HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, began the work for the site map and retrofitting plan for the North and South Block before the pandemic but it was stalled due to a surge in infections and Covid-induced lockdowns, HT has learnt.“The retrofitting of North and South Block will be executed at a much later phase of the redevelopment. Relocating the ministries that presently function from the North and South Block to the proposed office buildings will be the first step. Detailed documentation and site study will follow to understand and analyse the space and the state of the structure. Specialist consultants will assist us with the retrofitting process,” the firm said.For now, completion schedules are finalised only for the Central Vista Avenue –which comprises Rajpath, leading from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate — and the new Parliament. “The new Parliament building is expected to be completed by the winter session of 2022. Central Vista Avenue is expected to be completed by end of 2021,” HCP said. Earlier, the government had planned to finish the new Parliament in time for India’s 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2022.According to the proposal submitted to the environment ministry last year, around 458,820 square metre of built-up area will need to be demolished. This includes the current building of IGNCA, Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, vice-president’s residence, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan and INS Hutments. The main building of the National Archives will not be demolished, but its annexe will be razed.The project to modernise India’s power corridor was first proposed in 2019 but quickly ran into controversy with opposition parties, civil society members and activists first questioning the need for the revamp and later the decision to continue with the project in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government repeatedly defended the project, saying decades-old buildings were run down and needed a facelift.On May 31, the Delhi high court turned down a petition that sought to halt a part of the redevelopment work and called the Central Vista an “an essential project of national importance”.The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the Delhi high court decision of May 31 which allowed the Central Vista project work in the national capital to go on. The high court had dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that sought stoppage of construction activity, terming it “motivated”.Under the project, a “Nav Bharat Udyan” is also going to be built on the western banks of Yamuna as part of the Centre’s plan to extend the Central Vista axis from India Gate till the river. It was earlier expected to be unveiled by August 15, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-revamp-new-parliament-vice-president-s-house-will-be-first-to-be-completed-101624990877593.html
30-06-2021||India||Security huddle over J&K drone sightings||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of top ministers to discuss a long pending policy on management of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones and ways to deal with emerging security challenges, said people familiar with developments.The meeting occurred in the backdrop of twin drone attacks at an airforce station in Jammu on Sunday and another thwarted attack in the early hours of Monday. Three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1am and 4.30am on Tuesday, indicating terrorist groups could be trying to replicate Sunday’s strike.The meeting in Delhi was attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri and national security adviser Ajit Doval. There was no official communication on what transpired at the meeting.Singh earlier held a meeting with Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on the National Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) traffic management policy, said one of the persons cited above.Aspects such as airspace management, the regulatory framework for the use of drones, their utility as future delivery systems, air passages in which they can be allowed to operate and security issues were discussed at that meeting, HT has learnt.At the meeting Modi chaired, discussions also touched on the need for a policy to deal with emerging security threats and “non-traditional” strategic challenges, news agency PTI reported.IAF, army and navy are among the key stakeholders in UAS traffic management. Air defence units of IAF are responsible for monitoring all manned and unmanned air operations in the country’s airspace. The task of these units is to ensure all aircraft operations in the country are identified and in line with the details submitted in the flight plans.A little after 1.30am on Sunday, two drones carrying explosives hit the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu, leaving two personnel injured. The blast at Jammu airport, which is used for VVIP movement and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1.37am, causing minor damage to the roof of a building, and the second one – weaker in intensity – was reported at 1.42am in an open area.Experts said this was the first time drones were used in an attack on a major installation in the country.Two more drones were spotted over the military area around 11.45pm on Sunday and 2.40am on Monday, prompting soldiers to open fire at the devices which flew away.There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts said Sunday’s attack represented a new security threat.Director general of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbag Singh told PTI that the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a terror outfit based in Pakistan, is suspected to be responsible for the attack.”In all likelihood, the unmanned aerial vehicles have flown in from across the border and returned after the operation...We are still probing the case and will extend all our findings with other security agencies,” Singh said.On Tuesday, the first drone sighting on Tuesday was reported at 1.08am at Ratnuchak. Two hours later, military personnel at Kaluchak camp 300 metres away spotted the drone at 3.09am and finally at 4.19am, a drone was spotted near Sunjuwan, seven kilometres away. Kaluchak and Ratnuchak are smaller military stations.“The army informed us that they spotted drones over Kaluchak, Ratnuchak and Sunjuwan early Tuesday. We are looking into it,” Jammu’s senior superintendent of police Chandan Kohli said.Discussions on a draft policy on drones have been on for over two years. The draft policy says the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS) presents a raft of challenges, both technically and operationally. Integrating the UAS operations within the current air traffic management (ATM) systems may bring in the need to equip UAS with additional hardware on board, it adds.The objective of the policy is to enable more types of unmanned aircraft operational scenarios, increase the ease of compliance for the unmanned aviation industry while ensuring safety and security.The ability to identify and track a UAS flying in the Indian airspace will prove to be a very important capability while enabling high density, complex UAS operations, the draft policy states.On March 12 this year, the Centre notified the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules that spell out the terms of usage of drones by individuals and businesses apart from laying down the ground rules for research, testing, production, and import of such vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-huddle-over-j-k-drone-sightings-101624990818290.html
30-06-2021||India||Delhi: SC dismisses plea against work on Central Vista redevelopment||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal against a Delhi High Court ruling that allowed construction work at the Central Vista Redevelopment Project during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and endorsed a ₹1 lakh penalty imposed by the high court on the petitioners.“If Covid-19 was of concern, how would one project alone be the concern of the petitioners,” a three-judge bench of the top court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said.The top court echoed the high court’s 31 May order that described the petition by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker as “motivated” since the plea did not raise objections about construction at other sites.“The impression before the high court is fortified before us that as a PIL (public interest litigation) petitioner, did you conduct your research about other similar construction projects in the city? You were selective about this one project only. The high court says it is a motivated petition as you have insisted upon the closure of one public project and not any other.”The bench said the view taken by the Delhi High Court “is a possible view” and that the “challenge” was “untenable as the petitioners have not pointed out as public-spirited persons, whether the petitioner made any enquiries about other public projects in the city.”The Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment project is part of the larger Central Vista project, which includes construction of a new Parliament building, Central government offices, including a common Central Secretariat, a new residence for the Prime Minister and the Vice President, and central conference facilities.On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra submitted that the petition did not seek a complete stoppage of work. Luthra said their only aim was to highlight a public health and safety issue as on May 3, when the petition was filed before the high court, the positivity rate in Delhi was 29.74% and the average number of daily deaths was around 353 a day.“Since it (construction work) had the potential of being a super spreader activity, on account of the to and fro movement of the workers from the site to their accommodation at Sarai Kale Khan, Karol Bagh, Kalkaji, Nizamuddin etc., it was posing a grave risk to the health and safety of the workers and the residents of Delhi,” the petition said.Luthra stated that according to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines that came into effect from April 19, only those construction activities were permitted that provided on-site accommodation for workers. This was lacking in the case of the Central Vista project, Luthra pointed out, stressing that the same was arranged subsequently.“When the petition was filed, the project was non-compliant with DDMA regulations,” the senior lawyer said.The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose, asked Luthra if he should have proceeded once the project managers complied with the guidelines. “If you are a public-oriented person, once there is a compliance report, should you pursue the petition so vigorously. Once it comes on record that the project is compliant, you must end there.”Luthra submitted that the high court was free to give a finding on merits, but the scathing observations affected the reputation of petitioners and the cost imposed had a chilling effect on citizens’ right to question the actions of the government. The bench observed, “Genuine PILs have done wonders but questionable PILs have caused problems to our (judicial) system. PIL has its own sanctity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sc-dismisses-plea-against-work-on-central-vista-redevelopment-101624988658121.html
