It also said that the extension for the contractual pilots would be at the discretion of Air India in view of their satisfactory performance.A detailed judgment on the bunch of pleas by the pilots challenging the termination on August 13 is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi High Court.The terminated pilots had initially moved the court in July last year seeking directions to Air India to accept the withdrawal of the resignations tendered by them. However, on August 13, 2020, Air India issued termination letters to several pilots including those who had wanted to withdraw their resignations.Subsequently, the pilots moved the High Court against the August 13, 2020, decision of Air India.Some pilots had initially tendered their resignations over delay by Air India in disbursing pay and allowances. They had also contended that neither were their notice periods reduced nor any no-objection certificate issued to them after receipt of resignation.They had further contended that the resignations were subsequently withdrawn, but the withdrawal was not accepted by Air India.Air India cited financial constraints and the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial functioning of the company for the decision taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcquashes-air-india-s-decision-to-terminate-pilots-101622570720009.html

In a letter to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Odisha health minister Naba Das said as the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech did participate in the pre-bid meeting, it is understood that at their present capacity they won’t be able to provide the required vaccines to the states.“There have been media reports that other states which have floated tenders are also facing non-response from vaccine manufacturers. It seems that the global vaccine manufacturers, like Pfizer and Moderna are concerned about indemnity related issues among others. Secondly, they are willing to deal with federal-level central procurement only. At this stage, global vaccine manufacturers will require the central government;s statutory clearances for supplying to the states,” said Das, stressing that it might be faster and economical if the procurement of global vaccines are made at the country-level rather than by individual states.Odisha last week extended the deadline for the global tender floated for procurement of Covid-19 vaccines till June 4 in view of cyclone Yaas. The tender was issued on May 14 for procurement of 3.8 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to inoculate its 18-44 population. The global tender had liberal conditions with respect to performance security, penalties and advance payments.“Vaccination has been a game changer in most countries in saving both lives and the economy. It is important that we complete vaccination on a war footing before the onset of a possible third wave. In view of the urgency of the issue we look forward to early action in this regard and assure our continued cooperation to defeat Covid-19,” said Das, emphasising that states may be given the given flexibility to design and decide on the distribution of vaccines taking local factors into consideration.The Odisha health minister said the vaccine supply constraint has forced the state to vaccinate only 60,000 -70,000 people per day even though it has the capacity to vaccinate at 3 lakh people per day. So far, Odisha has vaccinated 77 lakh people with at least one dose.The health minister in his letter said Odisha would like to do priority vaccination for senior school students and their families.“States may be given the flexibility to design and decide on distribution of vaccines taking local factors into consideration (for eg. in many hilly terrains, internet connectivity is poor and we can’t make online registration mandatory in those districts,” Das said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-buying-vaccines-will-be-cheaper-faster-says-naveen-patnaik-govt-101622570160072.html

The assault, recorded presumably on a mobile phone, triggered a sharp protest from doctors and others.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma called it a barbaric attack and ordered the Assam police to arrest the culprits.“Such barbaric attacks on our frontline workers won’t be tolerated by our administration,” Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted. GP Singh, special director general of police, responded to the chief minister, saying three people had already been arrested. Dr Seuj Kumar Senapati, who was posted at Udali CCC in Hojai district of central Assam was attacked by nearly 20 relatives of the patient including women.A video of the incident in which a group of persons is seen hitting the doctor with broom, utensils and kicking him while he lay on the ground has gone viral on social media platforms. Though a policeman is seen in the video, he’s not seen trying to stop the attack. According to a letter issued by the Hojai unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) to the deputy commissioner of the district, the patient was admitted on Tuesday at 11am and died three hours later at 2pm.The letter said the mob damaged the building and also ransacked instruments at the CCC besides “brutally assaulting” the doctor. The IMA unit said unless all the culprits involved in the attack are arrested by 7am on Wednesday, all doctors of Hojai would boycott all out-patient duty (OPD) services. It also asked the government to provide all hospitals and CCCs with security cover, CCTV cameras and round the clock electricity. “Instructions have been given to superintendent of police Hojai to arrest all persons involved in the assault,” GP Singh tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-doctor-assaulted-after-covid-19-patient-dies-cm-calls-it-barbaric-attack-101622568541422.html

01-06-2021||India||‘Entire judgment focusses on...’: Goa govt substantiates appeal against Tejpal’s acquittal||The Goa government in its appeal filed before the Bombay High Court at Goa has assailed the judgement of Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi calling it “perverse” and “influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies, graphic details of the past sexual history of the victim.” Filing an amended appeal against the judgement, the Goa Police have said that the judgement, which was passed two weeks back, “was shocking in its apparent legal bias against the prosecutrix” (survivor) and that the judgement was “unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy” and that “much of the impugned judgment has been consumed by sexual gossip and alleged sexual fantasies related to the prosecutrix which were legally prohibited.”The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal had raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21. The Goa government filed an appeal against the verdict in the Bombay High Court last Tuesday. The appeal is scheduled for hearing on Wednesday, June 2. “The trial court in its 527-page-judgment has been influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies, graphic details of the past sexual history of the victim, prohibited by law and has used the same for purposes of censuring her character and discrediting her evidence. The entire judgment focusses on indicting the complainant witness rather than trying to ascertain the culpable role of the Respondent Accused (Tarun Tejpal),” the appeal stated. The Goa Police also said that the trial court has completely discarded the testimony of the survivor despite “her statement given in court, gave a clear and cogent account of the incidents of sexual harassment, rape, sexual assault, outraging of modesty, use of criminal force, and wrongful restraint and confinement that she was subjected to at the hands of the respondent accused, the then Editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine.”“When it suggests that it is unsafe to rely on her testimony as she is well educated, a good writer, proficient in English and above all conversant with the rape law, and was a capable, intelligent, independent person, the trial court, unfortunately, deploys the prosecutrix’s strengths and accomplishments to dispute her testimony,” the prosecution argued. “It appears that the victim’s work in the field of gender and an article on compensation for rape survivors authored by the prosecutrix and such other accomplishments have, in the eyes of the trial court, impacted her credibility,” the state’s appeal read. The state has also contended that the judgement should be set aside and Tejpal should be convicted on the offences he was charged off since “the Court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted.” “The burden of expectation of “normative” behaviour is heavily and incorrectly placed by the trial court on the shoulders of the prosecutrix,” the state has argued, adding that the “trial court has drawn an adverse inference against the survivor for not looking sufficiently traumatised or appearing fearful after the two incidents and in the messages, she exchanged after the incidents.”“The discrepancies that the prosecutrix attributes to the shock and trauma that she endured at the hands of a person in a position of trust and authority, who had assaulted and violated her have been disregarded, and her reactions are incorrectly treated as implausible without any logical or lawful reason,” the prosecution has argued. “Not only do the above observations betray a complete lack of understanding of post-trauma behaviour of victims, they also demonstrate complete ignorance of the law as also of the directions and guidelines passed by the Supreme Court of India in such matters,” the state argued. The state also argued that the victim was subjected to a rigorous cross-examination extending to almost 700 pages, spread over eighteen dates of hearing but which was “nothing short of a brutal attack on her character and alleged past sexual history designed to shame and humiliate her.” “Not only should these questions have been disallowed while recording evidence, but the trial court has gone so far as to use these very questions and materials to discredit her, although they were neither relevant to the case, nor could they have been put to her under law,” the state has argued. Tejpal who was relieved at being acquitted thanked judge Kshama Joshi for his acquittal. “In November 2013, I was falsely accused of sexual assault by a colleague. Today, the Hon’ble trial court of Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi, in Goa, has honourably acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age, where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entire-judgment-focusses-on-goa-govt-substantiates-appeal-against-tejpal-s-acquittal-101622564460914.html

Why so much work for small children, Modi Sahab. What can be done?” she shrugs her shoulders as she ends her message.The ‘adorable’ complaint by the moved Lt Guv Manoj Sinha, responded to her video on Twitter, promising a review within 48 hours.Manoj Sinha was back with a policy 24 hours later, on Tuesday evening.Sinha said the school education department has decided to limit the duration of the daily online classes for all school students.The guidelines restrict the screen time of pre-primary classes to 30 minutes on a given day.Modi saab ko is baat par zaroor gaur farmana chahiye😂 pic.twitter.com/uFjvFGUisIFor classes 1 to 8 level, the online teaching can be undertaken for not more than two sessions of 30-45 minutes each while schools can have four sessions of 30-45 minutes each for students of classes 9 to 12.“Give 10-15 minutes break between two consecutive classes for students to freshen up, relax and re-energise themselves to focus on the next class,” the guidelines, issued by the school education department, said.Schools have also been told to avoid homework for primary students and plan “joyful learning experiences” that engage parents as well.“Our children need more time to play, interact with parents, the biggest learning experience a child can have,” Lt Governor Sinha said.The school education department has decided to limit daily online classes for a maximum one and half hours for class 1 to 8, spread across two sessions. For class 9 to 12 online synchronous learning will not be more than 3 hours. https://t.co/ihB3bkxUBaIncidentally, the Union education ministry did circulate guidelines in July 2020 that asked states to limit the duration of online classes. The new guidelines announced by Lt Governor Sinha are based on the same template.It is not clear why the J&K’s school education department officials did not implement the education ministry’s guidelines for nearly 10 months till Lt Guv Sinha took note of Mairoo Irfan’s SOS message to PM Modi.But she is happy. “There should be more time to play,” said the six-year-old.HT last week reported how unregulated online classes were affecting the health of schoolchildren in Kashmir. Private institutions have been conducting online classes for students as young as four. Government schools have been holding them mostly from Class 5 onwards.The sessions would extend up to 8 classes in a day, prompting experts to underscore that prolonged screen time of up to five hours was affecting both the physical and mental health of the children and leading to behavioural changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-caps-duration-of-online-classes-after-girl-s-why-so-much-work-video-101622564400332.html

We work with the Government of India and all State Governments. As a matter of fact, the vacuum due to the retreat of the political class has been deservedly filled by IMA," read the letter."Ramdev thought it fit to launch his tirade against the national Covid-19 treatment protocol andnational Covid-19 vaccination programme looking for an opportunity to market his commercialproducts. What he failed to realise is that in doing so he has irreparably damaged the efforts ofGovernment of India in containing the epidemic. Creating confusion in the minds of the peopleagainst the national Covid protocol and National vaccination programme is an anti-national act of heinous proportions. IMA has demanded to deem it as sedition and prosecute him under theDisaster Management Act," it said.Calling Ramdev's remarks a "criminal act", the IMA said, "Inaction from the government would seriously hurt the doctors who are fighting the pandemic. His supporters have attempted diversionary tactics of malicious attacks on IMA and its National President. Nothing will deviate IMA from its resolve to nail this anti-national.""The total number of Covid-19 patients in the country so far is 2.78 Crores and 2.54 Crores have recovered. Our case fatality rate remains 1.16 per cent. Even with the limitations of official statistics, it can be seen that Indian doctors, nurses and health care workers have fought tirelessly," the association said, reminding that 1,300 doctors have sacrificed their lives for the nation."Countless children and family members of doctors have been infected. To trivialise these martyrs and the warriors is a sacrilege," it said.Last week, the IMA had appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take appropriate action under sedition and other charges against Ramdev for allegedly "spearheading a misinformation campaign on COVID vaccination".The IMA had sent a legal notice to Ramdev over his alleged statements against allopathy and "defaming" scientific medicine.However, the Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust has denied allegations by the IMA that Ramdev has misled people by making "unlearned" statements against allopathy and defamed scientific medicine.On May 23, Ramdev had withdrawn his statements on allopathic medicine after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan who called his remarks "inappropriate".According to the Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust statement, Ramdev was reading out a WhatsApp forwarded message in the video that has gone viral on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1300-doctors-sacrificed-their-lives-ima-launches-fresh-tirade-against-ramdev-101622560452277.html

The nominated members are drawn from fields such as literature, science, sports, art, and social service.Swapan Dasgupta, who was first nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2016, resigned after he was named as the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from Bengal’s Tarakeswar assembly seat on March 14. The Congress promptly wrote to the Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, complaining that Dasgupta hadn’t resigned from the House before contesting election nor had he joined any party.A nominated MP has the option to join a political party within six months of taking oath. But Dasgupta hadn’t declared his affiliation with the BJP within the six months of being nominated in 2016.Dasgupta eventually announced his resignation on March 16, declaring that he intended to “commit myself totally to the fight for a better Bengal”. The BJP, which had hoped to capture power in the state, however, ended up with just 77 of the 292 assembly seats on which elections were held.Swapan Dasgupta also lost the Tarakeswar seat to the Trinamool Congress’ Ramendu Sinharay by a margin of 7,484 votes.On Sunday, the government had notified the nomination of noted lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani to the Rajya Sabha on Sunday. Jethmalani’s nomination will fill the vacancy that arose after the death of Raghunath Mohapatra who succumbed to Covid-19 earlier this month. His term will end in September 2024.His father Ram Jethmalani, also a renowned lawyer was also a Rajya Sabha member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swapan-dasgupta-quit-rajya-sabha-to-contest-bengal-polls-gets-his-seat-back-101622555638710.html

We handed over Prashant to his family members," Sajjanar said at a press conference.Prashant thanked the Telangana government and External Affairs Ministry for their efforts to bring him back.I did not expect that I would come back to India so soon. I owe a lot to the Telangana government and the Centre," he said.Replying to a query, he claimed he was beaten up by the Pakistani Police, but did not want to find fault with them as they were suspecting him initially.He said he was treated well in the Lahore prison by Jail authorities and inmates.Prashant said there is a land route to Switzerland via Pakistan which will take about 60 days.To another question, he claimed he was subjected to questioning for several days by Pakistani army personnel who suspected that he was an Indian spy before being produced in court.According to a press release by the Cyberabad Police, Prashant boarded a train to Bikaner and from there he went to the Indo-Pak border and jumped the fence there.The release said he wanted to go to Pakistan for "personal reasons".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-releases-hyderabad-techie-after-jail-term-for-crossing-border-illegally-101622554522461.html
01-06-2021||India||No use debating over allopathy, ayurveda: NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat||There is actually "no use" in debating over allopathy and ayurveda as both are different and useful medicine systems, renowned scientist and Niti Aayog Member VK Saraswat said on Tuesday even as he emphasised that more research needs to be done in ayurveda to ensure it is more acceptable to the society.Saraswat, who was associated in the development of an anti-Covid drug by DRDO, also made it clear that the drug does not have anything to do with Patanjali Ayurved, amid reports that the medicine is connected with the research done by Patanjali Ayurved.The Niti Aayog Member's remarks on allopathy and ayurveda comes against the backdrop of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) raising strong objections to yoga guru Ramdev's comments that questioned the efficacy of allopathic medicines in treating Covid infections. Ramdev also steers Patanjali Ayurved.In an interview to PTI, Saraswat said India has got traditional medicine systems for thousands of years and that ayurvedic medicine has been responsible for improving the immunity of people."I think ayurveda and allopathy, they are two streams of medicine and they survive together... one has a particular role and other has a different role," he said.Amid the ongoing debate in certain quarters over allopathy and ayurveda, he said, the debate "is actually of no use", adding that both the streams are useful."My opinion is that the ayurvedic system of medicine should research more and more to bring (itself) at par in understanding of the scientific methods to become more acceptable by the society, which has been done in the allopathy," he emphasised.Last month, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had called Ramdev's statement on allopathic medicines "extremely unfortunate" and had asked him to withdraw the remarks, saying it disrespects 'corona warriors' and can break the morale of healthcare workers. Later, Ramdev withdrew the remarks.When asked whether the anti-Covid drug 2-DG developed by the Defence and Research Development Organisation (DRDO) is connected with research done by Patanjali Ayurved, Saraswat replied in the negative."It (2-DG) has nothing to do with Patanjali. Patanjali does not know anything about it. It is not their work," he pointed out.Saraswat, a former chief of DRDO, said he was the scientific advisor when that drug was developed."When the drug was developed, it was basically for supporting the treatment of patients who suffer from radiation-induced cancer... for doing that cancer treatment we do radiation therapy," he explained.According to him, during a radiation process, not only the cancer cells die but also the healthy cells die, which results in collateral damage to the human body."So, we created this drug in such a manner because you know the cancer cells are hungry for energy, so they take energy from our body. Our body gives energy in the form of glucose. Instead of taking body sugar, we started injecting. This drug is like a glucose but actually it is not glucose, it does not have any energy," he said.Elaborating further, Saraswat said cancerous cells would absorb the drug and then become weak. Once they become weak, lower doses of radiation can be given to kill the cancerous cells and that will not be harmful for healthy cells, he added.According to Saraswat, the same theory is now being utilised for treating Covid infections.DRDO's 2-DG has been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) as an oral drug for emergency use as an adjunct therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-use-debating-over-allopathy-ayurveda-niti-aayog-member-v-k-saraswat-101622553568476.html
01-06-2021||India||At BRICS foreign ministers meet, focus on Covid-19 pandemic, access to vaccines||The BRICS grouping on Tuesday endorsed an India-South Africa proposal for patent waivers for Covid-19 vaccines and called for sharing of doses, transfer of technology and development of vaccine production capacities to turn the tide in the fight against the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, members of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping reaffirmed the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and the need to resolve problems through peaceful means.A virtual meeting of foreign ministers of BRICS states, which was chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, also resolved to combat all form of terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorist, terror financing networks and safe havens.Jaishankar and his counterparts from the four other countries – China’s Wang Yi, Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco França, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor – focused on the response to the Covid-19 crisis and equitable access to vaccines during their deliberations.India and South Africa have been pushing for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since last year, and all the BRICS members agreed to support this measure as part of efforts to ensure timely, affordable and equitable access to diagnostics, vaccines and essential health products and technologies and their components to combat the pandemic.Also read: WHO approves China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for global use“The ministers reaffirmed the need to use all relevant measures... including supporting ongoing consideration in WTO on a Covid-19 vaccine intellectual property rights waiver and the use of flexibilities of the TRIPS agreement and the Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health,” said a joint statement on reforming the multilateral system that was adopted at the meeting.The ministers reiterated the need for sharing vaccine doses, transfer of technology, development of local production capacities and supply chains for medical products, and promotion of price transparency, and sought “due restraint in the implementation of measures that could hinder the flow of vaccines, health products and essential inputs”. They also called for timely operationalisation of the BRICS vaccine research and development centre.This was the first time the BRICS’ foreign ministers agreed on a stand-alone joint statement on strengthening and reforming the multilateral system. They agreed that such reforms have to cover all key multilateral institutions, including the UN and its organs such as the Security Council and General Assembly, global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the multilateral trading system including WTO, and the global health system with the WHO at its core.The foreign ministers also agreed on six principles that should guide such reforms, including making instruments of global governance more inclusive and representative, changes based on inclusive consultations while respecting sovereign independence, making multilateral organisations more responsive and transparent, and strengthening countries and global organisations to better respond to emerging and non-traditional challenges such as terrorism, cybersecurity and fake news.Though there was no official word on whether the India-China standoff figured in the discussions, Jaishankar said in his opening remarks that BRICS strives for an inclusive and equitable multi-polar international system that respects the territorial integrity of all states.Such a multi-polar system is “based on international law and the UN Charter, that recognises the sovereign equality of all states, and respects their territorial integrity while displaying mutual respect for interests and concerns of all,” he said.Asked about the India-China differences at a press conference after the meeting, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said the BRICS members had reaffirmed the principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and the need to “resolve any problems with peaceful means”.Also read: Patent waiver will help in wider access to technologies to produce vaccines - SAPeople familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side was able to get BRICS members to agree to strong language on counter-terror cooperation, including the reference in a joint media statement to “cross-border movement of terrorists, terror financing networks and safe havens”.The BRICS members referred to the counter-terrorism strategy adopted at the grouping’s summit last year, and reiterated their commitment to finalise a “result-oriented action plan” by the Counter-Terrorism Working Group in 2021.The statement on reforming the multilateral system said the foreign ministers reaffirmed the sole authority of the UN Security Council for imposing sanctions and called for “further consolidation and strengthening of the working methods of UN Security Council sanctions committees to ensure their effectiveness, responsiveness and transparency”.On the issue of Afghanistan, the other BRICS states echoed India’s consistent stand and underline the need to preserve gains made over the past 20 years in the war-torn country. They stressed the need to protect the rights of all Afghan nationals, especially women, children and minorities, and called for an immediate ceasefire. They also stressed the “urgent necessity of the elimination of the threat of UNSC proscribed terrorist groups to lasting peace in Afghanistan”.Chinese foreign minister Wang avoided contentious issues in his opening remarks and said China and other BRICS members stand with India amid the second wave of Covid-19 infections. “BRICS cooperation now faces the profound and complex ramifications of the pandemic and changes unseen in a century,” he said.South Africa’s foreign minister Pandor said, “We have a global dilemma – millions of people in wealthier nations have been vaccinated while billions of people in poorer countries still wait and are still vulnerable to infection, disease and death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-brics-foreign-ministers-meet-focus-on-covid-19-pandemic-access-to-vaccines-101622554080380.html

However, according to the 10th schedule of the constitution, with disqualification of MPs, “A nominated member of a House shall be disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat after complying with the requirements of article 99 or, as the case may be, article 188.”I have resigned from the Rajya Sabha today to commit myself totally to the fight for a better Bengal. I hope to file my nomination as BJP candidate for the Tarakeshwar Assembly seat in the next few days.The two articles relate to oath-taking of the lawmakers.Dasgupta, who was nominated to the Upper House in April 2016, is yet to formally join the BJP.

ICMR chief Balram Bhargava, while speaking at a health ministry press briefing, also said that there is no shortage of vaccine."By mid-July or August, we will have enough doses to vaccinate 1 crore people per day. We are confident of vaccinating the whole population by December," said Bhargava.He also said that gradual lifting of lockdown-like curbs will not lead to a massive surge in Covid-19 cases. "However, we have to ensure that vaccination is prioritised. The vaccination rate must be up to 70%. Also, Covid-appropriate behaviour should be followed," said Bhargava.The ICMR chief's comments come in the wake of demands made by several health experts that vaccination needs to be scaled up in India. Several states too have complained about vaccine shortage, and a few of them even floated global tenders to directly get the supply.The health ministry had said on Sunday that nearly 120 million vaccine doses will be available for the ongoing nationwide Covid vaccination programme in June. "Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of the government of India for containment and management of the pandemic, along with test, track, treat and Covid-appropriate behaviour," the health ministry said in a statement.The vaccination drive began in January this year with two vaccines - AstraZeneca's Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. The Russian-made Sputnik V is the third vaccine to get approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use and is being used in a few private hospitals.Both SII and Bharat Biotech said on Sunday that they are looking at ramping up their production capacity to 110-120 million doses from the existing 75-80 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-chief-says-india-will-have-enough-covid-19-vaccines-by-july-to-inoculate-1-crore-people-a-day-101622551514492.html

Limiting vaccination against Covid-19 only to employees is not going to help the process,” the letter dated June 1, read. Air India lost five of its pilots to Covid-19 last month. The airline began vaccinating its pilots on May 15. “Pilots are being quarantined, testing positive, and succumbing to Covid at an alarming frequency. Even the immediate family members are suffering and succumbing to this deadly virus,” said a pilot.The pilots in the letter said that they fear infecting their family members on returning home after operating Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights. “With this backdrop, we need support from the company to keep performing our duties and keep our families safe,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-union-asks-air-india-to-include-dependents-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101622550117768.html

The equivalent price in the U.S. financial center is $0.79, according to Bloomberg calculations based on figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.Indian fuel prices have soared in the past year as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has repeatedly raised sales taxes to cushion worsening public finances. Levies now make up around 60% of the retail price and federal taxes on gasoline and diesel have surged nearly six-fold since 2013.The steep increase in taxes on the two fuels, which account for more than half of India’s oil consumption, comes as the Covid-19 pandemic pummels demand in the world’s third-biggest crude importer. Sales of the two fuels in May are about a third lower than pre-virus levels in 2019 as large parts of the nation remained under local lockdowns to battle the world’s worst coronavirus wave.Oil Demand Recovery in Virus-Ravaged India Tough to Predict“I pray for the prices to soften or the government to reduce the taxes,” said N. Vijayagopal, finance director at Bharat Petroleum Corp., one of India’s three-biggest fuel retailers.

01-06-2021||India||'Covishield to be administered in 2 shots, no change in schedule’, says govt||The Union health ministry said on Tuesday that no change has been made to Covishield dose schedule, and the vaccine will continue to be administered in two doses 12 weeks apart. A similar two-dose routine will also be applicable to India-made Covaxin.“There is absolutely no change in the schedule of Covishield doses; it will be two doses only. After the first Covishield dose is administered, the second dose will be given after 12 weeks. Covaxin also has two doses' schedule, second dose to be administered in 4-6 weeks,” Dr Vinod K Paul, Niti Ayog member (health) said at a press briefing.“News of Covishield being administered in one dose has been doing the rounds, this is absolutely not true. Please do not spread misinformation regarding this,” he added.Reports on a one-dose regimen surfaced on Monday after the chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), Dr NK Arora, told reporters that scientists will be looking into dosing intervals of vaccines to figure out if a single dose works better.“Dosing intervals will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better,” said Arora.Arora also told reporters that a feasibility study will also be conducted in the country to study the effects of mixing two different vaccines.“We will be looking at the feasibility of testing a two dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in a few weeks,” he added.The health ministry today confirmed that a study on mixing of different vaccines will indeed be conducted but it will strictly be an unresolved scientific question for now, and no vaccines will be mixed until robust data supports such an action.“It’s a scientific curiosity and science will settle it until then there will be no mixing of vaccines,” Dr Paul said at the press briefing on Tuesday.“There is research going on in other countries, this is a scientific topic. Until it's sorted out we will call it an unresolved scientific question,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-to-be-administered-in-2-shots-no-change-in-schedule-says-govt-101622548937395.html

01-06-2021||India||India's economy to grow at 9.3% in FY22, risks persist: Moody's||India's economy will rebound in the current financial year to mark a growth of 9.3 per cent but the second Covid-19 wave has increased risks to the country's outlook with potential longer-term credit implications, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday.The economy rebounded quickly from a steep contraction in 2020, it said. But risks to India's credit profile including a persistent slowdown in growth, weak government finances and rising financial sector risks have been exacerbated by the shock of coronavirus second wave."We expect a decline in economic activity in the April to June quarter followed by a rebound, resulting in real, inflation-adjusted GDP growth of 9.3 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 2022 (fiscal 2021) and 7.9 per cent in fiscal 2022," said Moody's.It said the reimposition of lockdown measures along with behavioural changes on fear of contagion will curb economic activity. However, the impact is not expected to be as severe as during the first wave.A small shortfall in budgeted revenue and a redirection of spending toward the response to the pandemic will result in a general government fiscal deficit of 11.8 per cent of GDP and a rise in the general government debt burden to 90.3 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2021.Debt-to-GDP will edge up to 92 per cent by fiscal 2023, largely driven by relatively slow economic growth.Moody's said India's financial sector is the main driver of potential event risk to the sovereign. Whether the feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector settles in a credit-supportive or credit-hindering mode will shape India's credit profile.So far, the second wave has increased financial risks to households and small businesses, which may hurt bank profitability.New loan forbearance and liquidity measures by the central bank, and government plans to set up an asset reconstruction company to take over stressed loans along with modest recapitalisation of public sector banks will mitigate, but not eliminate sector risks.Moody's said the impact from potential subsequent Covid waves remain a risk to forecasts. The government's ability to limit the spread of the virus and materially increase the rate of vaccinations will have a direct impact on the trajectory of both health and economic outcomes.India began the third phase of its vaccination campaign for those aged 18 to 44 on May 1, making vaccines available to the entire adult population. However, as of late May only around 15 per cent of the country's population had received at least one dose of the vaccine.A shortage of vaccines and logistical challenges reaching a large rural population (about two-thirds of the population) have complicated the vaccine rollout, said Moody's.The international community has recently contributed to India's efforts with increased medical and vaccine supplies to help address shortfalls. Moody's expects the pace of vaccinations to pick up this summer, with substantial progress by the end of 2021.Moody's said longer-term risks to India's economy will increase if the second wave extended beyond June and the pace of vaccinations was slower than it expects."This could contribute to more scarring if it caused a permanent loss of jobs and business closures, particularly in more productive sectors of the economy outside of agriculture in and around urban centers, resulting in a fundamentally weaker growth dynamic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-economy-to-grow-at-9-3-in-fy22-risks-persist-moodys-101622547744186.html

If they do get Covid, the infection has not taken serious shape in children and the need to hospitalise is very less,” Dr VK Paul, member (health) of NITI Aayog, said in a press briefing.“But the virus may change its behaviour in the paediatric population and there may be changes in epidemiological dynamics. The impact of Covid-19 may increase in children…The data has shown that a low number of children are being admitted to hospitals. We are are pushing preparedness by the day,” Paul added.Also read | ‘Third wave of Covid might not impact children, however...’: AIIMS director"I am happy to report to you that we are working very systematically, comprehensively to address the problem of paediatric Covid disease for now as well as in the future. We will strengthen our facilities as required and do an audit of what is required and what might be required in a worst-case scenario," he also said.Last month, Paul said children are not immune to the infection, but the impact is minimal. He also said that children are not immune from this infection and they can infect others but children do not generally suffer from severe infection.Experts have apprehended that this possible third wave may impact children even as the ongoing second wave of the pandemic is gradually coming under control. There has been a steady fall in the number of daily Covid-19 cases and a dip in the positivity rate of the coronavirus disease. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked state and district officials to collect data on the infection transmission and severity among youth and children.Also read | Trials of Covid-19 vaccine on children to begin soon in India: SitharamanPeople above the age of 45 were considered to be the most vulnerable to the infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Many young people contracted the coronavirus disease in the ongoing second wave. However, the health ministry has said citing medical data that there has not been any significant shift in age group and people aged between 45 and 60 years are still the most vulnerable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-very-systematically-comprehensively-to-address-covid-in-kids-govt-101622547908715.html
01-06-2021||India||‘Tantamount to refusing lawful directions’: Centre to ex-Bengal chief secretary||The Centre has cited former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay’s absence from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting on Cyclone Yaas last week and issued a show-cause notice to him, saying it was “tantamount to refusing to comply with the directions of the Central government and is thus violative of Section 51(b) of the DM [Disaster Management] Act.” The section provides for up to two-year imprisonment in case the refusal to comply with orders results in loss of life or imminent danger thereof.The Union home ministry issued the notice hours after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday attacked Modi over the transfer of Bandyopadhyay, who was ordered to report to Delhi amid a face-off between the state and the Central government. Banerjee appointed Bandyopadhyay as her chief adviser for three years while refusing to release the bureaucrat in defiance of the Centre’s direction. She said she permitted Bandopadhyay to retire on his last working day on his request and named HK Dwivedi as his successor. Banerjee called Bandopadhyay a bold officer and accused the Centre of victimising him and practising vindictive politics while calling Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah heartless.Also Watch | ‘Those who are scared..’: Mamata Banerjee quotes Sholay dialogue; slams PM ModiLate on Monday, the Centre issued the show-cause notice to Bandopadhyay and an official in Delhi said that “suitable action is being contemplated by the department against the official for defying the [transfer order of] DoPT [department of personnel and training]”.The notice has asked Bandyopadhyay to explain within three days in writing “why action should not be initiated against him” for “acting in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with the lawful directions of the Central government”. “By this act of abstaining himself from the review meeting taken by the Prime Minister, who is the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in the aftermath of the cyclone Yaas as part of his visit to the affected areas in the state of West Bengal, Shri Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief secretary… has acted in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with the directions of the central government and is thus violative of section 51(b) of the DM Act,” said the notice, a copy which HT has seen.As per the section, the punishment for obstruction under it covers those who “refuse to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the Central Government or the State Government or the National Executive Committee or the State Executive Committee or the District Authority.” It says in case of conviction, the obstruction will be “punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both”. If such obstruction or refusal to comply with directions “results in loss of lives or imminent danger thereof, it shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years”.The notice said Modi and his entourage waited for nearly 15 minutes for the officers of the state government to arrive for the meeting. “In view of the absence, the chief secretary was called by an official as to whether they wanted to participate in the meeting or not. Thereafter, the CS [chief secretary] arrived along with the chief minister [Banerjee] and left immediately.”The fresh face-off between Banerjee and the Centre began last Friday when she skipped the meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Modi. The Centre hours later ordered Bandopadhyay to report to DoPT by 10am Monday.On Saturday, Banerjee refused to release him and urged the Centre to reconsider its order. She wrote a five-page letter to Modi two days later, questioning the legality of the transfer order and questioned if it was linked to Friday’s meeting. Banerjee maintained she took Modi’s permission before leaving the meeting after objecting to the presence of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of Opposition, who defeated her after defecting to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the March-April assembly elections. Later in the day, Banerjee said the Centre again asked Bandopadhyay to report to Delhi and insisted the officer cannot join a new office without the state’s permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tantamount-to-refusing-lawful-directions-centre-to-ex-bengal-chief-secretary-101622548379975.html
01-06-2021||India||Chhattisgarh police sees conspiracy behind continuing protests against CRPF camp||Fifteen days after three men were killed in an alleged exchange of fire between security personnel and suspected Maoists at the CRPF camp in Silger village, protests against the camp continue with villagers erecting a structure of rocks in the shape of a memorial pillar to honour the dead. The Chhattisgarh police has alleged Maoists’ hand behind the protest.In the meantime Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday formed a committee of public representatives, headed by Bastar’s MP Deepak Baij, to find facts about May 17 Silger firing and the subsequent protests. The committee also includes tribal leader Lakheshwar Baghel and it will report to the chief minister’s office after talking to the local people. Others on the committee include Sant Ram Devti Karma, Shishupal Sori, Anup Nag, Vikram Mandavi, Rahman Baijam and Chandan Kashyap.The villagers, however, threaten to stay put until the CRPF camp at Silger village is removed, however, police allege the protest is backed by Maoists and legal action against the 17 “outsiders” at the protest site is under consideration for their alleged role in fuelling the unrest.“Villagers in the area are being pressured by Maoists and their sympathisers to continue the protest against the security camp in Silger. ...Sukma and Bijapur district administration have issued numerous appeals... to end the protest...,” IG Bastar P Sunderaj said on Tuesday.Three people were killed on May 17 when security personnel opened fire on thousands of violent protestors including suspected Maoists on the fifth day of protests against the setting up of a CRPF camp in Bastar’s Silger village- a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh. Villagers said they feared the presence of CRPF personnel in the camp would lead to harassment of innocent tribals.The villagers also claimed that the firing was unprovoked but the police said they retaliated to firing by armed Maoists, who had infiltrated the protesting crowd, and planned to set the CRPF camp on fire.Later, a magisterial enquiry was also ordered into the firing but it has not finalised its report yet.A few days back, the Communist Party of India (Maoists) Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee issued a statement in support of the protest against the CRPF camp and called for a strike on June 5. On May 29, the villagers claimed that a pregnant woman, Poonem Somli, 25, who was injured in the stampede during the firing on May 17, also died.The Bastar IG on Tuesday said that police have seized photos, video, documents, mobile call detail records indicating 17 persons, including 6 women, were instigating the villagers to violence on the behest of Maoists.“The main Maoist cadres operating in the area are Irpa Jagdish, Manila, Shankar, Deva and Vinod. We are gathering more evidence against the entire conspiracy behind the incident and will take appropriate legal action against those who are directly or indirectly supporting the banned CPI Maoist formations,” the IG added.Human rights activists in Bastar have asked for removal of the camp in support of the protestors’ demands.“What is needed is to break this stalemate democratically. It can be done if the government suspends functioning of this camp and... any new camps in the area during the Covid crisis. The Maoists too should... cease military action and concentrate on getting the population under their influence vaccinated. Let Corona times be peaceful times,” said Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist.Bhatia in her fact-finding report, which was released on May 27, claimed there was no evidence to support police claim that an armed group of 3,000 agitators, including Maoist cadres, took over the peaceful protests on May 17 and intended to burn down the CRPF camp, leaving the forces with no choice but to open fire.The security forces maintain that the Maoists were opposed to the CRPF camp, set up for construction of a key road, as it would lessen their influence in the area. Chhattisgarh government too issued a press release last week to say 28 camps of security forces had been set up in the Maoist-affected areas of Bastar in the last two years to support developmental works.“Since the progress of Bastar is being looked at as a hurdle by the Maoists, they are regressively opposing these camps. These camps are often ambushed. The Maoists even attempt to create misunderstanding among the native villagers and trick them to go against the security forces,” the release said.The government also claimed that the surge in the Maoist activity in Bastar was also due to lack of communication and dialogue between villagers and the district administration, which was being addressed by measures including these camps.Ravindra Chaubey, government spokesperson and a cabinet minister said it was pretty clear who was opposed to the CRPF camp and was behind the protest. “People need roads in that area and hence camps are established. For the development of people, roads are important and if needed more camps will be established,” Chaubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-sees-conspiracy-behind-continuing-protests-against-crpf-camp-101622548378515.html
01-06-2021||India||In fresh guidelines for district-wise unlocking, health ministry lists 3 main criteria||The Union health ministry on Tuesday laid down new rules for taking a district out of lockdown-like curbs imposed due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Many state government imposed strict curbs to check the spread of the infection when second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak.Now, as the number of daily cases have come down, there have been announcements from some chief ministers about removing a few restrictions and allowing limited activities.According to new guidelines announced by the Union health ministry, unlocking would depend on less then 5% positivity rate in the district being considered for opening up. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate should remain below 5% for at least two weeks before an outbreak can be considered to be under control.The ministry guidelines further say that 70% of the vulnerable population - those above the age of 60 and 45 and above with comorbidities - must have received vaccination doses. The rules also call for community ownership of Covid-appropriate behaviour.India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh announced relaxation in Covid-19 curbs on Sunday. After chairing a review meeting, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that districts where less than 600 cases of the coronavirus disease are reported, can see shops opening for longer time.On Monday and Tuesday, the list of such districts were expanded to include nine more zones. The revised order came into effect from June 1.Similarly, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar announced on Twitter on Monday that some extra concessions will be made in the 'corona curfew' for business activities.As per the revised guidelines, which would come into effect from June 2, shops dealing in essential items like grocery, vegetables, dairy products, meat and fish, will be allowed to do business from 6am to 2pm.Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan too have announced relaxations from June 2. The unlock process began in national capital Delhi from May 31, with easing of restrictions on industrial units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-fresh-guidelines-for-district-wise-unlocking-govt-list-3-main-criteria-101622546781628.html

Though the interaction remained "inconclusive," Nishank said after the meeting that an "informed" and "collaborative" decision will be taken by June 1.

01-06-2021||India||Andhra CM says he hasn’t threatened or influenced any witnesses in CBI case against him||Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday told a special court for Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cases in Hyderabad that he had not threatened or influenced any witness directly or indirectly in the alleged disproportionate assets being probed by the CBI.“All the allegations made by the petitioner are baseless and do not warrant any consideration by the court,” he said in a 98-page counter-affidavit filed in the CBI court.The affidavit was filed by the chief minister in reply to a petition filed by rebel YSR Congress MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju on April 29, seeking cancellation of the bail granted to the former in 2013.In the affidavit, CM Reddy asserted that he never violated the conditions imposed by the court nor did he, in any manner, threaten or influence any witness directly or indirectly.The CBI also filed a separate counter affidavit saying that it was leaving it to the court to decide on whether to continue or revoke the bail granted to CM Jagan. The court posted the case to June 14 for further hearing.The chief minister said the petition seeking his bail cancellation was purportedly filed by Raju in the capacity of a third party. “It was misconceived in law and not maintainable, as Raju was trying to bring in personal political issues and personal vendetta into criminal justice administration,” he said.He pointed out that the CBI, a central government agency, was investigating his case and Raju, being a third party, had no locus standi in seeking the cancellation of bail. He did not show any overwhelming circumstances to review the procedure of granting bail, he argued.“The Supreme Court has stated in several cases that any criminal process is between the state and the accused and no third party can intervene in such process,” he reminded.Jagan also pointed out that Raju had filed a false affidavit before the court stating that he had no questionable antecedents of whatsoever in nature. But the fact was that Raju was accused of two crimes registered by the CBI concerning fraudulent dealings with the banks and siphoning of over ₹900 crore.He pointed out that his party had already made an appeal to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking disqualification of Raju from the Lok Sabha membership for various misdeeds and acts of misconduct.“Raju’s petition clearly shows he is seeking to use criminal justice machinery for personal abusive purposes,” he said and requested the court to dismiss the petition in the interest of justice.Raju told reporters in Delhi that the counter filed by Jagan in the CBI court lacked any substance. “The allegations levelled by him against me are all baseless. I am confident that the court will go by the merit of the arguments,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-says-he-hasn-t-threatened-or-influenced-any-witnesses-in-cbi-case-against-him-101622545733642.html

01-06-2021||India||Pandemic pushes transgender community on the brink of poverty||The recent death of a 26-year-old transgender woman in Ranchi, Jharkhand, underlines the heavy toll that the pandemic has taken on transgender communities across the country, which faced with a lack of steady income and family support, are among the hardest hit vulnerable populations. Aaliyah was found dead, allegedly by suicide, in her one-room rented apartment on May 4.Teja Vishnu, president of Liberty Rebellion Organization in Visakhapatnam, which works for the rights of sexual minorities in India said Covid-related lockdowns have caused financial and mental trauma to the community.“Due to lockdowns, most of these people, who would otherwise be seen on trains, traffic signals, wedding parties, have been restricted to homes. While those who are living on their own are struggling to manage their rents and food, the ones staying with families have been under severe mental stress. They are constantly being bullied. When they stepped out during the day, they had a sense of community and would meet people like them but lockdowns have alienated them. Being stuck at home with people who judge them, they feel abandoned. This has led to suicidal tendencies among most of them,” Vishnu said.Hailing from West Bengal, Aaliyah was disowned by her family and moved to Jharkhand in 2010. “She managed for 10 years. She would get around three hundred rupees a day by begging in trains, but after trains were suspended last year, she starved for days,” Aaliyah’s friend Amarjeet, who is also a member of the community, said.Also Read | India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19Once the rail service was suspended, Aaliyah begged at traffic signals, but a complete lockdown meant she couldn’t even step out of her room, Amarjeet said. “All her savings were exhausted. She had to sell off some jewellery she had bought a few years back to pay the rent and buy herself food. As if this wasn’t difficult enough for her, her mother called her up from Bengal and sought her help as her brothers had been rendered jobless.”“She called me up on April 28, saying there was no ration left and she had no money... I have been struggling to feed my own family, all I could offer was emotional support. On May 4, I got a call from her neighbour that she had died by suicide,” Amarjeet said.The financial constraints are being felt across the board, but the more vulnerable communities are the worst hit.Vaishnavi, a 28-year-old transperson from Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh worked in the private sector but was laid off during the first Covid wave last year, forcing her to return home from Bengaluru. “Though both my brothers would still taunt me for the way I talked, I was used to it since childhood so it didn’t affect me much. But things deteriorated once my father died of Covid in March this year,” she said.Since her father died without leaving a will, her brothers started pressuring her to move cities, Vaishnavi said. “They wanted me to go away so that they could get dad’s property transferred in their own name. When I protested, they threw me out of the house.”Vaishnavi approached the police which did not register her complaint but tried to broker peace between her and her brothers. “They let me in again. But they still harass me. I have been to the police thrice but every time they just offer a compromise which doesn’t even last for a day,” she said.“My [fear is that my] brothers will kill me for the property, and I will be counted as another suicide by a transgender person,” she added.She said she has nowhere to go and she could afford to stay on her own when she had a job. “At a time when companies are laying off more people, who would offer me a job,” she said.Hyderabad-based transgender rights activist Rachna Mudraboyina said that in absence of family and social support, a large number of transpersons have been living isolated from society. “People hesitate to even give us accommodation and now even if they do, they charge us double the normal rate. It is because of who we are. Since many of our people have been sharing rooms, how do you isolate someone who contracts Covid?” she said.Mudraboyina offered the instance of a recent case when a transperson’s condition deteriorated after contracting Covid. “We took him to the hospital, but he could not make it. We had collected ₹10,000 for his treatment. His family cremated him only after we gave them that money,” she said.Ashwini, another transgender person from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, recounts how she had no money to get home which is two hundred kilometres from Asansol, West Bengal.Also Read | Grief, suffering, financial distress—how the second wave devastated households“I had no money to buy my ticket so I sat on a train to go back to my home. Once the train started moving, two railway police constables asked me for my ticket. The train was largely empty, and I told them that I did not have enough money to purchase the ticket. They started abusing me,” Ashwini said. She alleges that they told her she could travel for free in exchange for sex.While the Centre announced a ₹1,500 one-time subsistence support for members of the community on May 23, it mandated that the beneficiary’s identifying documents should indicate that they are a transgender person.“They have long been abandoned by their families. Most of them don’t even have Aadhar cards or any other document. Those who do, have been identified as males or females. They are not in touch with their families or someone in their states who can help them to get it changed. The conditions set by government for Rs1,500 will make most of them ineligible for the support,” Vishnu pointed out. They further said that the amount should be increased, and made a monthly aid, at least till the crisis lasts.Vicky, a Mumbai-based transperson said that for members of the community who are HIV+ regular medication is costly. She said the government should provide free medicines to all transgender people at their door step. “While the government is giving some medicines free of cost and a few NGOs also do that, a transperson suffering from HIV or diabetes is scared to go to hospital for medicines as hospitals are hubs of infections and they are already vulnerable,” Vicky said.She said that getting medical help is also a problem for the community as “we are seen through a different lens by doctors as well as patients. While many of us are gasping for breath, other patients and their attendants judge us,” she said. There should be separate quarantine centres for them and hospitals should also have dedicated rooms for them, she said.She added that there should be a documentation drive where members of her community can go and get their documents updated so that they can avail of the government schemes.Aruna from Vizag, another transgender person, said his family got him married to a woman. “While my spouse has been very cooperative, it is difficult to survive...we have a child now. I cannot even think about gender reassignment surgery when I don’t have enough to feed my baby,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-pushes-transgender-community-to-brink-of-poverty-101622543153876.html
01-06-2021||India||Grief, suffering, financial distress—how the second wave devastated households||Anupam Sharma (48) hasn’t had the time to process the grief of losing her sister Alpana Sharma and brother-in-law Kamal Kumar to Covid-19. Her primary worry, at the moment, is how she would find the resources to repay their relatives for loans accrued during the process of treatment of her loved ones. While Anupam Sharma is working with a private university, her sister’s family lost all sources of income during the pandemic.“The total expenses are in the range of ₹7-8 lakh. My sister’s family lived in rented accommodation and had rented a shop to run an apparel store, which mostly stayed shut during the lockdown. Whatever little savings they had were exhausted. They do not have any assets that can be used to repay the loan. We are struggling and don’t know how we will support my nephew’s education,” she said.Her nephew, Ekansh (18), was aiming to become a physiotherapist after his graduation. However, with the death of his parents within a span of two weeks last month, the teenager is planning to drop out of college.“How can I continue my education when we are struggling to pay the loans? We had to borrow money from various relatives and acquaintances for the treatment of my parents, especially my mother who had undergone a kidney transplant and developed complications after contracting Covid-19. We had to mortgage my mother and aunt’s jewellery to foot the hospital bill,” he said.Also Read | Sustaining and scaling up the response to Covid is key to saving livesThe story of Anupam and Ekansh is likely to resonate with many families, who have been ravaged by the second wave of the pandemic and have lost all their savings in trying to save their loved ones.Amid the second wave of the pandemic in the country — the fourth in Delhi — between the end of April and middle of May, patients and their families struggled with shortages — of beds, oxygen support, medicines. And at each step, costs escalated, with implications for household savings and indebtedness.Savings exhausted, families in financial trouble Dildar Singh, a 38-year-old businessman from Delhi who recently lost his uncle to Covid-19, and his family are now in dire financial straits. He fears that the private hospital, where his uncle was admitted, may take legal action if his family fails to clear the outstanding dues of ₹22 lakh.“My uncle was into social work and did not earn a lot. He was dependent on his brothers and had medical insurance of around ₹7.5 lakh. We thought that his health insurance would cover his medical treatment but the hospital charged ₹22 lakh. When we couldn’t pay the amount, the hospital refused to release the body,” he said.“Eventually, the hospital made me sign an undertaking while releasing the body on May 15, which states we would have to pay the amount within two weeks. We are now worried if there will be any legal action in the matter,” said Singh.According to a State Bank of India research report published on May 17, health expenditure could rise by 11% in the family consumption budget amid the pandemic. “We believe health expenditure will rise significantly because of the pandemic…Based on current trends, if 30% of the infected people get hospitalised and amongst them, 30% opt for private hospital and taking a conservative ₹1.5 lakh as the cost of entire treatment (including medicines, hospitalisation charges, PPE kit, etc) total expenditure of hospitalisation comes around ₹35,000 crore because of increased consumption of health services,” the report said.The report also pointed out the loss of income during the pandemic will affect health expenditure. This was reiterated by several families HT spoke to who said that the lockdown had already depleted the savings of the families. The burden of medical bills is just making matters worse.Minal Janai (20) is a third-year engineering student from Nagpur. Her father, a private cab driver who had already witnessed huge financial losses amid the pandemic, suffered from an infection in his lungs due to Covid-19. She has been running pillar to post for the past month to arrange funds for the treatment of her Covid-19-infected family.“We managed my mother and grandfather’s treatment by taking loans from relatives. But my father’s condition deteriorated at home. Since we did not get any beds in the government hospitals, we had to admit him to a private hospital. He is the sole breadwinner of our family. We have somehow arranged to pay ₹80,000 but still need ₹1,80,000 to pay the remaining amount to the hospital,” said Janai, who has also taken an educational loan.Several families lost their loved ones to Covid-19 even after spending their entire savings on hospital bills. Kumar Mangalam, a resident of Nashik, said his father Chitragupta Sinha, 58, who worked as a supporting actor in some movies, was suffering from Covid-19 pneumonia. “My family of five tested positive for Covid-19 early in May. After my father’s condition deteriorated, we admitted him to a private hospital after failing to get a bed in a government hospital. His condition started worsening after he got pneumonia and had to be put on a ventilator. The hospital was charging ₹90,000 to ₹1 lakh a day.”The family paid over ₹10 lakh to the hospital. “We could hardly raise ₹35,000 through online fundraisers. My father succumbed to the infection on May 20,” said Mangalam, who works in a private company in Ahmedabad.The government response Amid the unprecedented surge in cases, social media platforms were flooded with desperate pleas for help to find vacant hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, and medicines such as remdesivir. While there are many citizens who have stepped up to help, some exploited the situation. People ended up paying amounts as high as ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh for oxygen concentrators, and ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 for a vial of Remdesivir.This forced several states across the country to take several measures to put caps on health services. For instance, in Maharashtra, according to the government guidelines, it is mandatory for the private Covid-19 hospitals to bill Covid-19 patients as per the government’s fixed rates. In Uttar Pradesh, government officials said they too had issued guidelines capping prices of various health services and medicines related to Covid-19 – such as Covid-19 beds (different prices for ventilator and non-ventilator beds), tests, scans, ambulance, medicines, etc.The Delhi government, over the past month, has streamlined the availability and costs of a number of essential medical items ranging from oxygen to medicines. On May 25, the Delhi government capped the charge of transportation of oxygen cylinders, while mandating that such cylinders would have to be sold only at MRP. Similarly, the government also fixed the rates for hearse services provided for deceased Covid-19 patients. The treatment cost in private hospitals was capped in June last year itself, government officials said.Delhi Police also launched a crackdown against those involved in black marketing of Covid-19 resources. So far, Delhi police have arrested 366 people on charges of black marketing and cheating people by charging inflated prices and registered 600 cases in this regard.The systemic deficiencies Experts, meanwhile, say strict measures should be taken to implement these orders. Malini Aisola, who is associated with the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare and works on public health advocacy, said that proper grievance redressal mechanisms have to be put into place and checks have to be introduced for implementation. One of these ways could be regular audits of Covid-19 bills, she said.“For instance, in Delhi’s case, the current order does not specify which authority the patients can approach with their complaints, the manner in which they can file, the process that will be followed by relevant authorities to investigate the complaints, and the timeframe within which the complaints have to be addressed. Emphasis should be on swift redressal of grievances to the extent possible and the government may appoint empowered government officials to help patients to resolve issues in real-time in respect of overcharging and non-compliance with the orders, and the consequences of it,” she said.Rama V Baru, a professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that despite scientists predicting a second wave, the Centre did not coordinate with the state governments. “Basically there was no planning. There was no effort to rein in the private sector in terms of price capping and ensuring that standard treatment protocols were given and followed. Indiscriminate and irrational use of CT scans, drugs, plasma therapy added to the fear and expenditure.” she said.Sonali Vaid, a public health professional in Delhi, said there have been several instances when people ended up paying “catastrophic health expenditure” pushing families into poverty.“In normal times, people who can’t afford private hospitals can go to public health care services. But during a crisis, people do not have any choice. When the system is saturated, people will have to go wherever they get the beds. In such a situation, when people cannot exercise choice between whether they go to a public or a private facility, there should be some financial protection,” she said.As the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is expected, Baru said that “revamping of vaccination” should be done on priority. “We need centralised procurement and distribution of vaccines with fixed prices. This will prevent the severity of illness and deaths...We have to learn from the tsunami of the second wave. The public sector facilities that have been created must not be closed down. Standard treatment guidelines must be put in place and price capping of all commodities that are required for treatment,” she added.Vaid said that there is a need for “universal health coverage” to address the issue. “None should face financial hardships to access good quality healthcare — whether it’s the private or the public sector. We need to push for a better quality public health care system so that not only the poor but even middle and upper-class people can comfortably walk into government hospitals and get the care they need,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grief-suffering-financial-distress-how-the-second-wave-devastated-households-101622542854505.html

"Ideally, 2DG should be prescribed as early as possible by doctors for moderate to severe COVID patients for a maximum duration of up to 10 days," DRDO said.Patients of uncontrolled diabetes, severe cardiac problem, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe hepatic and renal impairment have not been studied yet with 2-DG, and hence caution should be exercised, DRDO said. It added that 2-DG should not be given to pregnant and lactating women and patients below 18 years.Also read | DRDO's anti-Covid drug priced at ₹990/ sachet; Centre, states to get discounts"Patients and attendants are advised to request the hospital to contact Dr Reddy's lab Hyderabad for medicine supply at email: 2DG@drreddys.com," the organisation said in a tweet.The 2DG medicine can be given to Covid-19 patients under the care and prescription of doctors. Directions for usage of this drug for Covid-19 patients as per DCGI approval are attached here for reference. For all queries regarding #2DG, please write to 2DG@drreddys.com pic.twitter.com/x19ayBoToGThe oral drug 2-DG, developed in collaboration with Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on May 8 as an adjunct therapy – one that supplements regular treatment – for Covid-19. On May 18, defence minister Rajnath Singh launched DRDO’s 2-DG, calling it “a new ray of hope in these challenging times” even as experts called for more scientific data.Also read | DRDO lab develops Covid-19 antibody detection-based kit DipcovanThe 2-DG drug comes in powder form in the sachet and has to be dissolved in water. The drug works by accumulating in virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. According to the Union home minister, the Covid-19 drug reportedly reduces a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by upto 40 per cent.2-DG has been used as a possible cancer therapy for decades as research has shown that it hampers cell growth by blocking cellular glucose supply, leading to its use as a tumour therapeutics. The hypothesis in its use in treating Covid-19 is that it could impair replication of Sars-Cov-2 by a similar mechanism of action. It has still not been approved for regular cancer therapy.Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) has said that DRDO’s anti-Covid-19 drug will be sold at  ₹990 per sachet that it will provide the medicine to Centre and state government at a discounted price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-issues-directions-for-use-of-2-dg-its-drug-for-covid-19-patients-101622540560596.html

Many state governments, however, have extended the Covid-19 restrictions with certain relaxations.The latest to be added in the list of states extending lockdowns is Chhattisgarh. It has extended the restrictions till further notice while offering some relaxations in districts where Covid-19 test positivity rate (TPR) is less than 5%.Covid-19 lockdown was eased in these places:Madhya Pradesh: In Madhya Pradesh, some relaxation to start the economic and business activities has been given. However, the 'corona curfew' has been extended in all 52 districts till June 15.Chandigarh: Even as the Union territory has extended Covid-19 curbs till June 9, it has eased certain restrictions in the region as the situation pertaining to coronavirus infection spread seems to be coming under control.Jammu and Kashmir: The Covid-19 curfew here will now be limited to night hours and weekends only.Uttar Pradesh: The chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, RK Tiwari announced a relaxation of lockdown in the state from June 1. However, 20 districts, including Lucknow, will not benefit from this.Covid-19 lockdown was extended in these states/UTs:Delhi (Till 5am on June 7)Maharashtra (Till June 15)Haryana (Till 5am on June 7)Chhattisgarh (Till further notice)Gujarat (Night curfew in 36 cities till June 4)Kerala (Till June 9)Tamil Nadu (Till June 7)Andhra Pradesh (Till June 10)Telangana (Till June 10)West Bengal (Till June 15)Odisha (Till 5am on June 17)Bihar (Till June 8)Rajasthan (Till June 8)Punjab (Till June 10)Uttarakhand (Till June 9)Goa (Till June 7)Puducherry (Till June 7)Himachal Pradesh (Till June 7)Karnataka (Till June 7)Nagaland (Till June 11)Arunachal Pradesh (Till June 7 in seven districts)Manipur (Till June 11 in seven districts)Mizoram (Till June 7 in Aizawl Municipal Corporation area)Tripura (Till June 5)Meghalaya (Till June 7)Sikkim (Till June 7)Tripura (Till June 5)As on Tuesday, India's total Covid-19 infection tally was at 28,175,044, according to the Union health ministry website.

01-06-2021||India||La Niña phase ends, neutral conditions likely to support good rains in India||The 2020-2021 La Niña event has ended and neutral conditions (neither El Niño nor La Niña) are now likely to prevail over the tropical Pacific in the next few months, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday.In India, this would mean conditions are favourable for a normal monsoon and normal temperatures. “We generally associate neutral ENSO conditions with a normal monsoon in India. Most ENSO neutral years have brought us normal monsoon in past years,” explained M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Earlier on Tuesday, IMD in its second stage long range monsoon forecast said the country is likely to be normal at 101% of long period average.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. Also Read | Monsoon likely to be normal across the country: IMDAir temperatures globally are expected to be above average between June and August, especially in the northern hemisphere, WMO said in its statement. There is a 78% chance of neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific until July, decreasing to 55% by August-October, and with more uncertainty for the rest of the calendar year, according to WMO’s El Niño/La Niña Update.“La Niña has a temporary global cooling effect, which is typically strongest in the second year of the event. This means that 2021 has got off to a relatively cool start – by recent standards. This should not lull us into a false sense of security that there is a pause in climate change,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.“Carbon dioxide concentrations remain at record high levels and so will continue to drive global warming. According to new predictions issued by WMO, there is a 90% likelihood of at least one year between 2021-2025 becoming the warmest on record. This would dislodge 2016 – a strong El Niño year - from the top ranking,” added Taalas.The end of La Niña and widespread above average sea-surface temperatures because of global warming mean that air temperatures over land are forecast to be warmer than average from June to August 2021 over almost the whole northern hemisphere, in particular over the central western part of North America, the far northern part of Asia, part of central Asia, and far eastern Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and the northern Caribbean. Exception to recording above normal temperatures is likely in north-western Europe, south Asia, and the northern part of South America, extending into the southern Caribbean, according to the Global Seasonal Climate Update. This also means India may record moderate temperatures during the ENSO neutral phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/la-nin-a-phase-ends-neutral-conditions-likely-to-support-good-rains-in-india-101622540033506.html

01-06-2021||India||It is not just WhatsApp. Digital media rules face multiple legal challenges||The Central government’s social media and intermediary guidelines, which came into effect on May 25, were challenged by the messaging platform WhatsApp last week over privacy concerns with regard to mandatory traceability requirements that the company says represents a “dangerous invasion of users privacy”.But that isn’t the first time the highly contested rules have been taken to court.The new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification have been challenged in six other instances ever since they were notified on February 25 by the Union government.While two petitions have been moved in Kerala high court (HC) against the guidelines, three others are in front of the Delhi HC, aside from WhatsApp’s latest challenge, contesting part II and III of the guidelines. The last petition has been filed in front of the Karnataka HC, by a Kannada news portal against the rules as they refer to digital news media platforms.Also Read | Twitter will have to comply with new IT rules: HCThe guidelines also cover over the top platforms (OTT) such as Netflix, Amazon and Hotstar, which will have to implement a rigorous three-tier self-regulatory mechanism, with the apex body being headed by an official from the information and broadcasting ministry.Twitter is at loggerheads with the central government over compliance with the new social media guidelines. It is yet to share details of its compliance officer with the ministry. Twitter last Thursday raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines, prompting a strong response from the government which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.WhatsApp, although it has shared details of its compliance officer, sued the Union electronics and technology ministry over the new rules in Delhi HC last Wednesday.As the impasse between the government and some of the social media companies continues, HT reviewed all the other petitions which have been filed and the concerns raised.LiveLaw Media Private Limited and others vs Union of India and others With the ambit of the government’s takedown powers extended to cover news media, LiveLaw, an online legal reporting website, with the help of digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation on March 9 moved the Kerala HC, stating that the new rules impose an “unconstitutional three-tier complaints and adjudication structure” that is arbitrary and violated the rule of law and the separation of powers.“Part III of the impugned Rules impermissibly extends the scope of the IT Act to publishers of online news, current affairs, and online curated content, and is thus ultra vires the parent statute, which does not contemplate the regulation of Digital News Media,” the petition states. “In substance, Part III imposes an unconstitutional three-tiered complaints-and- adjudication structure upon publishers, which makes the executive both the complainant and the judge on vital free speech questions involving blocking and take down of online material. This is both arbitrary and violates the rule of law and separation of powers, especially since there is no provision for the aggrieved publishers to appeal against the decision of the Inter-Departmental Committee consisting only of members of the executive, constituted under Rule.”The writ petition further added that the regulation of news media is beyond the scope of section 69(A) or section 79 of the IT Act, and the regulatory mechanism constitutes an “unreasonable restriction to free speech”.“The Intermediaries Rules 2021 violate Article 19(1)(a) and they cannot be justified as reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) (i) Part II unreasonably restricts the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the petition argued. It sought that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 be declared illegal, as it is unjust, unfair, manifestly arbitrary, for colourable exercise of power and also contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution.On March 10, the Kerala HC issued a notice to the Centre, directing it to not take any “coercive actions against the Petitioner for non-compliance of Part III of the Rules”. It also ordered a limited stay on the implementation of the guidelines. The matter has since been adjourned.Foundation for Independent Journalism and others vs Union of India and anotherAnother petition against the rules was moved by the Foundation for Independent Journalism on March 6 in the Delhi HC. The Foundation challenged the new rules stating that they represented “overreach by way of subordinate legislation” and imposition of government oversight with the stipulation of “vague conditions”.“The present Petition challenges the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Rules, 2021” or “Impugned Rules”) as being ultra vires the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“parent Act”), in as much as they set up a classification of ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ (“digital news portals”) as part of ‘digital media’, and seek to regulate these news portals under Part III of the Rules (“Impugned Part”) by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’, which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’ etc. - matters nowhere within the contemplation of the parent Act,” the plea states.“The Petitioners bring out wholly digital news and current affairs publications and are therefore directly affected by this overreach by way of subordinate legislation. The Petitioners’ digital news portals publish news and views, as distinct from curated content. The present Petition challenges the IT Rules, 2021 only in so far as they affect digital news portals, and is not with reference to ‘publishers of online curated content’, i.e., OTT media platforms or any other entities sought to be regulated by the Impugned Rules,” it adds.The petitioners sought that the rules be declared void and inoperative in so far as they apply to publishers of news and current affairs content.The HC directed the Centre to file a counter-affidavit in the case.Quint Digital Media Limited and another vs Union of India and anotherThe third organisation to move the court against the new rules was online news media website, The Quint, which on March 16, filed a petition in the Delhi HC saying that the rules were unconstitutional and went beyond the ambit of the IT Act.“Although the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act have been incorporated, the rationale of self-regulation, that is, that the State should be kept out, and that such supervision be merely recommendatory, has been flouted by the Rules,” states the petition. “Other democratic countries like the UK and Australia class online news with print news, to be self-regulated, free of State control.”The petition sought that part III of the Act that governs the rules be struck down as it vests “draconian powers” with the state.“Creating a differential classification by way of subordinate legislation, when not contemplated by the parent IT Act is an overreach by itself and this has been done to specifically target digital news portals, by subjecting them to an unprecedented regulatory burden and State interference, which no other form of news publication is subject to,” the petitions states. “This overreach is aggravated by a virtual legislation by reference, inasmuch as the Rules incorporate the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act, the Programme Code under the Cable TV Act, and vest draconian powers and control in the State.”The matter is pending before the court.Sanjay Kumar Singh vs Union of India and othersAdvocate Sanjay Kumar Singh has also challenged the new rules for being far too disproportionate and against the doctrine of parliamentary democracy as they were not vetted by the legislative body and introduced as a subordinate legislation.“It is hard to imagine that mere tweets on Twitter or posts on other social media platform can pose any worthwhile threat to matters of integrity, security or sovereignty of India. The rules as they have been framed are far too disproportionate to any threat capable of materialising to security, integrity or sovereignty of India from tweets on Twitter or posts on other social media platforms,” states the petition.The petition further added that the rules seem to be “far too hastily and casually drafted which is untenable especially when it deals with a matter of such paramount importance as freedom of speech and expression to a democracy”.The matter is pending before the Delhi HC.Truth Pro Foundation of India vs Union of India and othersThe Foundation, a non-profit company that runs Pratidhvani — an independent Kannada news portal, has moved the Karnataka HC against the contentious rules stating that they introduce new concepts and regulations and legislate on the conduct of entities beyond the purview of the parent Act.“The present Petition challenges the… [IT Rules, 2021] as being ultra vires the new Information Technology Act, 2000… in as much as they set up a classification of ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ (“digital news portals”) as part of ‘digital media’, and seek to regulate these news portals under Part III of the Rules… by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’, which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’, etc. – matter nowhere within the contemplation of the parent Act,” the petition states.It has sought a stay on the implementation of the guidelines in the “interest of justice and equity”.Praveen Arimbrathodiyil vs Union of India WP(C) 9647/2021An open-source programmer Praveen Arimbrathodiyil moved the Kerala HC against the guidelines on April 10, with legal assistance from Software Freedom Law Centre, India. The petition challenges the guidelines on the grounds that they “place unreasonable restrictions on users in expressing themselves online, thus impacting their right to free speech and expression and fundamental right to privacy”.“The Writ Petition argues that the IT Rules, 2021 are vague, exceed the bounds of delegated legislation, place unreasonable restrictions on the exercise of #freespeech & expression, and violate the right to carry out an occupation, trade or business,” SFLC posted on Twitter. “The Petition also stresses upon the impact of the Intermediary Rules, 2021 upon FOSS entities. The Intermediary rules, 2021 fail to draw an intelligible differentia between not-for-profit FOSS communities and for profit proprietary companies.”The petition further argues that the rules prescribe technology-based solutions such as automated tools which would “bring in inherent societal biases and prejudices leading to more problems than it intends to solve”.The matter is pending before the Kerala HC.The government’s responseThe government has defended the new policy regime.Union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said, on May 27, that the new social media and intermediary guidelines were designed to empower citizens and prevent the “abuse and misuse” social media.“The new Rules require the social media companies to set up an India based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and nodal officer so that millions of users of social media who have a grievance get a forum for its redressal,” Prasad posted on Koo, the app which has come up as the Indian alternative to Twitter.The ministry further stated that WhatsApp’s challenge to the rules were a “clear act of defiance”, and Twitter’s refusal to comply was a way of “dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy”. The government has repeatedly asserted that the rules provide a “light touch” mechanism to regulate the virtual space, with a focus on self regulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-not-just-whatsapp-digital-media-rules-face-multiple-legal-challenges-101622539613451.html
01-06-2021||India||Verghese Kurien: Know all about the man and the movement on World Milk Day||World Milk Day has been observed on the first day of June every year since 2001 by countries around the globe. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a United Nations body, commemorates this day to celebrate the contribution of dairy farmers and to recognise the importance of milk as a global food. The theme of this year is 'sustainability in the dairy sector with messages around the environment, nutrition, and socio-economic'.Any conversation around milk cannot ignore the contribution of Verghese Kurien, aptly named 'the milkman of India', and the 'Father of the White Revolution'. Every year on World Milk Day, Indians remember Kurien for his contribution.Who was Verghese Kurien and what did he do?In the late 1940s, after Independence, India was largely a milk deficient country where people survived on imports from abroad. That is before a man named Verghese Kurien arrived at the country’s only experimental creamery in Gujarat's Anand. Kurien had studied abroad on a government scholarship and had been deputed to the Anand plant as a dairy officer for five years. Indians were heavily reliant on imported milk powders from abroad as a popular belief during that time was that buffalo milk was unsuitable for producing any dairy products, be it skimmed milk, condensed milk, or cheese. The dairy industry was extremely euro-centric and Europe, unlike India, had a sufficient supply of cow milk. Indian dairy farmers were reliant on buffalo milk.Kurien wrote in his memoirs that the supposed impossibility of converting buffalo milk into powder was propagated by the west, which wanted other nations, like India, to continue to import its milk powder. However, Kurien with the help of his friend HM Dalaya, a dairy engineer, was able to turn buffalo milk into powder and condensed milk, and later to cheese, helping India compete against brands like Nestle and Glaxo. Through converting buffalo milk into powder Kurien was also able to solve the issue of milk wastage during flush seasons.Cutting the middlemanKurien’s stint at Anand also ushered in the elimination of the middleman as local dairy farmers were able to sell directly to consumers through the formation of dairy co-operatives. The first dairy cooperatives in Anand were formed in the early 1940s, and one of their leaders asked Kurien to help them expand which led to the formation of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, popularly known as Amul, whose mascot the Amul Girl, has been delighting and educating Indians on socio-economic and political events of the country.National Dairy Development BoardIn 1965, the government created the National Dairy Development Board to expand Anand’s cooperative model across the country. Kurien was the board’s founding chairperson. This came to be known as ‘Operation Flood’ and ‘White Revolution’ for it turned India from a milk deficient country to a sufficient one and on July 18, Amul’s turnover surpassed Rs. 52,000 crore.Kurien passed away on September 9, 2012, at the age of 90. He was born a Christian but remained a life-long atheist, and was cremated as per his wishes, according to his daughter Nirmala Kurien. The brand created by the man and his movement endured, and Amul girl continues to serve a taste of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verghese-kurien-know-all-about-the-man-and-the-movement-on-world-milk-day-101622538471943.html
01-06-2021||India||Student body helps poor conduct last rites of kin with eco-friendly material||Rama Devi (name changed), 53, a daily wage labourer hit hard by the pandemic, was left with no money to even cremate her 56-year-old husband when he died of Covid-19 this month. She was forced to sit with his body on a road in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior for hours until she somehow got in touch with Ramesh Khushwaha, a member of Project Arth, which has been helping people who cannot afford cremations, using the cell phone of a stranger. Khushwaha rushed to the location and had the body sent to the nearest cremation ground for last rites.Project Arth is an initiative launched by Enactus IIT Delhi, the student chapter of Enactus, an international organisation of student, academics, and business leaders, in New Delhi, Gwalior and Rajkot. It seeks to reduce deforestation by replacing wood used in cremations with material made of cow dung, wood dust, and crop stubble.The surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths triggered a shortage of wood needed for cremations.Also Read | India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19Project Arth said it sponsored over 200 cremations of the poor and unclaimed bodies. “Outside Delhi, we helped the poor and needy directly and in Delhi, we collaborated with crematoriums. We provided the cow dung logs to the six crematoriums in New Delhi free of cost,” said Ayush Sultania, the head of Project Arth.In Delhi, Project Arth has collaborated with Seemapuri, Green Park, Basant Gaon, Shahpur Jat, Haiderpur, and Chirag Dilli crematoriums.Jitender Singh Shunty, the founder of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal (SBSSD) that has been helping with cremations, said they used the material provided by Project Arth for the last rites in May. “They have given us three tonnes of cow dung logs free of cost which we use regularly. It reduces pollution and saves trees. It is a great initiative.”Sultania said crematoriums in Delhi were cremating about 250 bodies daily at one point and each body requires about 300kg of wood. “Delhi gets its wood from Uttar Pradesh and as a result, Uttar Pradesh’s forest cover is decreasing. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative fuel which is not only renewable but also minimises pollution,” said Sultania. “Cow dung logs not only minimise deforestation but also reduce carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emission by 20%,” added Sultania, citing the research conducted by Project Arth.Sultania said they have conducted the last rites of many abandoned bodies of the elderly, who died of Covid, and street dwellers. “Within a month we aim to increase the number of machines manufacturing cow dung logs, develop better infrastructure at gaushalas and set up storage facilities. We are planning to provide 1,000 sponsored dignified cremations in Delhi,” said Sultania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/student-body-helps-poor-conduct-last-rites-of-kin-with-eco-friendly-material-101622538713233.html

The Centre last week recalled him hours after Banerjee skipped a scheduled meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Modi.Also Read | Mamata uses Sholay dialogue to attack Centre, urge other CMs to uniteIn a second letter to Bandopadhyay, DoPT cited the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, to recall the officer to the Centre. It asked the state government to relieve the officer with immediate effect with “directions to report to the DoPT by 10am on June 1”. HT has seen the letter dated May 31.According to the rules, an officer on the rolls of a state may be deputed to the Centre or another state or a Public Sector Undertaking with the concurrence of the concerned state. “In case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government,” say the rules.On May 31, Banerjee wrote to Modi over the “unilateral order” to release Bandopadhyay on the day of his superannuation. “The unilateral order comes without any prior consultation with the government of West Bengal, without any volition/option of the officer, without meeting any of the pre-conditions of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 and other applicable laws under reference. The unilateral order/directive is legally untenable, historically unprecedented and wholly unconstitutional,” she wrote.“The government of Bengal cannot release, and is not releasing, its Chief Secretary at this critical hour, on the basis of our understanding that the earlier order of extension, issued after lawful consultation in accordance with applicable laws, remains operational and valid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dopt-issues-show-cause-notice-to-former-bengal-cs-101622538173476.html

In a statement, the company said at this stage, no definitive terms have been finalised and hence it cannot comment further.The statement came amid reports that Cipla was seeking fast-track approvals to bring Moderna’s single-dose Covid-19 booster vaccine into India expeditiously, and that it has requested the government for indemnification and exemptions from price capping, bridging trials and basic customs duty. It did not name the vaccine it planned to import.Also Read | US disease experts warn of more damage if Covid origin not foundNews agency Press Trust of India on Monday reported that Cipla is close to committing over $ one billion as advance to the US major for the import of close to 50 million doses.A government official confirmed the development while refusing to share more details of the planned deal. “The matter is being examined, and nothing has been decided as yet. The import as part of the deal, which if at all comes through, will happen only next year as their supply book is already packed for this year,” the official said, requesting anonymity.VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, last week said the government was in talks with Pfizer after the company indicated that it had vaccine doses available. The government experts were examining the company’s request for providing indemnity against serious adverse effects following immunisation.

The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah made the remark while hearing a consumer dispute case, which was wrapped up by the court in March but a fresh application was filed in the same matter.As soon as the case came up for hearing, justice Chandrachud observed that the final order had already been issued in terms of what the petitioner wanted, but he chose to come back with a trivial issue. “You are here now only because you want to vet some documents before you deposit the rest of the money for the house you have been allotted. What is this? This is how the Supreme Court is being made dysfunctional,” he said.Also Read | SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policyJustice Chandrachud added that the judges in the top court have not been able to spend enough time on serious matters because of the deluge of unimportant matters.“Yesterday, I had to finalise an order in the suo motu (on its own motion) matter on Covid-19 that I could not do because I had to read up the files for today’s hearings. And 90% of the cases were frivolous,” he rued.“We as an institution must not spend our time dealing with frivolous matters. This wastes the time of the court and suggests that we have a lot of time. Serious matters must be given time,” said the judge.As on May 1, the top court had as many as 67,898 pending cases, out of which more than 49,000 cases are fresh ones that were still to be considered for admission.

The government had, in April last week, diverted all the liquid oxygen meant for non-medical purposes and manufacturing industry for medical use as the number of Covid cases was rising and several states reported a shortage of oxygen to treat critically-ill coronavirus disease patients. The only sectors exempted at that time were defence, ampoule- and vial-making industry, and pharmaceuticals. Also Read | HC slams drug department’s clean chit to GambhirThe MHA has now exempted more industries for use of liquid oxygen to include continuous process industries/ plants such as furnaces, refineries, steel, aluminium, copper processing plants, etc; infrastructure projects and plants; Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); exporters of manufacturing sector requiring oxygen for production, and food processing units. In its order, the ministry said that “the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) may allow usage of liquid oxygen to the above-mentioned industries/ projects/ units on a temporary basis subject to ensuring an adequate supply of liquid medical oxygen to hospitals and other medical purposes as per demands of states/ Union Territories as well as adequate supply to industries/sectors such as ampoules and vials, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing of oxygen cylinders and PSA plants, neutral glass tubing and defence forces.” The industries had approached the DPIIT in this regard.

01-06-2021||India||12 big cats killed in accidents triggered by dumping of leftover food: Report||A Madhya Pradesh forest department report has blamed leftover food dumped from pantry cars of trains for triggering accidents that have resulted in deaths of over 100 animals, including five tigers and seven leopards, at Ratapani Tiger Reserve station in Sehore district over the last five years. The 20-km Budhni-Barkheda railway track passes through the sanctuary.Pradeep Tripathi, the sanctuary’s field director, said the food attracted monkeys and other herbivores to the railway track and they, in turn, drove the big cats there. He added the food was dumped at around eight spots, where the track is very narrow and passes between mountains, and the animals ended up getting trapped and crushed under trains. “This is one of the major reasons behind the death of animals,” said Tripathi, who was among the officers, who prepared the report.Tripathi said some of the big cats were hit by trains around Gadariya stream, where they would go to have water, near the railway track. “...we are resolving this issue...” Tripathi said the other animals killed near the track include 90 monkeys, deer, and other herbivores over the last five years. He said this year a leopard and a sub-adult tiger died on the track.Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Alok Kumar said they have written to the railways many times to stop the dumping of leftover food and food packets on the track, but nothing has been done about it. “We sought appointment of guards to check the dumping of food, especially at night so that action could be taken against the pantry car employees. The railways appointed a guard who worked for just two to three days,” he said. “We have suggested mitigation measures to railways to resolve this issue.”Bhopal divisional railway manager Uday Borwankar said they have rules for dumping leftover foods from pantry cars and their employees have to follow the rules. “ ...big cats have been hit by trains, but it is happening due to the design of the track.” He added they are making a bridge for animals, which will be the first of its kind. “Through the bridge, we will connect the mountains and animals will not need to come down to cross the track. [We are] working on this project. We are also putting fencing to stop animals from passing through vulnerable accident points.’Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said that there are proper guidelines for railway tracks passing from a forest area, but both the railways and forest department have failed to follow them. “Blaming leftover food for deaths of animals is a non-serious observation of the forest department,” said Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-forest-dept-blames-food-dumping-by-trains-for-deaths-of-12-big-cats-101622530732895.html

Assembly elections are due to be held in the BJP-ruled Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur; and Punjab (Congress) next year.A functionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the meeting a “routine affair” as the top leadership, which includes the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, meets at least once a month. The meeting in person, the functionary said, had been postponed because of the pandemic.Also Read | For PM Modi, the seven-year itchA second functionary said apart from discussing preparations the Sangh’s outfits will require to make for the relief works, the RSS leadership is also expected to reflect on issues such as post-poll violence in West Bengal and the fallout of the pandemic on the economy and employment.“The meeting will largely take stock of what is expected from the Sangh in terms of seva [relief works]. However, since the issue of targeted violence in West Bengal is of concern that is also likely to be on the agenda. There is a likelihood of discussing and conveying to the relevant authorities [government] what expectations there are vis-à-vis economic revival and scaling up the scope of social welfare schemes,” said the second functionary, requesting anonymity.The Sangh distances itself from electoral politics, but through coordination meetings with the government conveys to it the sentiments on the ground. There is speculation that the Sangh is particularly concerned about the developments in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Former RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi and his successor Dattatreya Hosable have had a string of meetings with the state leaders.“Joshi... was in UP [Uttar Pradesh] to attend a Disha Pujan, and he met the local functionaries there. Dattaji too was stationed in Lucknow before his elevation to the post of general secretary, so he is also aware of the dynamics of the place and meetings were apolitical. The focus was largely on the current situation that is grim and what needs to be done to mitigate the problems,” said a third person, who did not want to be named.RSS has expressed concern over the Covid crisis but has largely thrown its weight behind the government. On Many 15, Bhagwat said the government and the people misread the situation after the first Covid-19 wave and resulted in the lowering of the guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3day-rss-meet-this-week-to-discuss-road-map-for-possible-covid-19-third-wave-101622528212753.html

Rahul Gandhi also asked the government what it is doing to address the shortage of drugs used to treat patients of black fungus. Gandhi posed these questions on his Twitter account."Central Government should clarify about the Black fungus epidemic - 1. What is being done for Amphotericin B drug shortage? 2. What is the procedure for getting this medicine to the patient? 3. Instead of giving treatment, why is the public getting hassled by formalities by the government?" The Wayanad lawmaker asked in a tweet.Black fungus महामारी के बारे में केंद्र सरकार स्पष्ट करे-1. Amphotericin B दवाई की कमी के लिए क्या किया जा रहा है?2. मरीज़ को ये दवा दिलाने की क्या प्रक्रिया है?3. इलाज देने की बजाय मोदी सरकार जनता को औपचारिकताओं में क्यों फँसा रही है?Affecting patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the deadly second wave of the pandemic, the black fungus infection has sent alarm bells ringing in states across the country.

The matter got complicated further after Mamata asked the top bureaucrat to stay put and shot letters to the Centre, following which Alapan, who attained superannuation age in May and had received a three-month extension, was given a go-ahead to retire by the Bengal government.The ongoing episode has raised certain questions on the rules surrounding the transfer of a senior official.What happens when an officer doesn't report to the DoPT?The officer concerned might be issued a showcause notice by the personnel ministry. A decision is taken on the basis of his response, and the matter regarding the official’s pension is decided only after the issues have been resolved.There are provisions as per the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969 applicable to IAS officers for penalties that can be imposed in case the Centre decides to pursue the matter. The penalties can range from censure, withholding of promotion, withholding increments among others. A major repercussion might even be compulsory retirement and removal from service of the officer.Controversy surrounding the latest orderThere have been cases in the past where the willingness of the officer and/or the state government is sought, which makes this order unusual, especially because neither party was keen on the transfer. Further, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) granted the extension to the officer. The manner of its reversal, that too within a week, has created a flutter.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee refused to relieve the officer and wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to rescind the May 28 order, which is yet to be cancelled. Meanwhile, Mamata announced that Bandyopadhyay has retired on Monday and appointed him as an advisor for three years, even as he was again asked to report to DoPT on Tuesday.What experts sayFormer IAS officer EAS Sarma told news agency PTI, “The IAS (Cadre) Rules no doubt empower the Centre to recall IAS officers from the state but such a recall should be based on justifiable grounds and for upholding the public interest. Even while taking such a decision, the Centre is required to hold prior consultation with the state and, in the event of disagreement, the Centre should cite the extraordinary circumstances that justify such a recall."Even otherwise, the relationship between the Centre and the States should be one of cooperation, not confrontation, he added.What the rule statesRule 6 (1) of IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 mentions that all officers of IAS are allocated cadre which are state or group of states and Union territories. "A cadre officer may, with the concurrence of the state governments and the Centre, be deputed for service under the central government or another state government or under a company, association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the central government or by another state government," Rule 6 (1) says."Provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government," it says.However, officials said that Rule 6(1) is vague and that there exists a grey area in it as it doesn't make consultation with the state government mandatory and leave it open to interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relook-at-centre-bengal-government-row-over-chief-secretary-s-transfer-101622523549206.html

The protest was called by the Federation Of Resident Doctors’ Associations – an umbrella organisation for various associations – that has over 20,000 members across government hospitals in Delhi itself. The doctors will continue their routine work wearing a black ribbon to register their protest and services will not be hampered at any of the hospitals. “We would like to say that the protest is not against ayurveda, but against Baba Ramdev and his statements about allopathic doctors,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the resident doctors’ association of Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung hospital. Also Read | Delhi reports 29 dengue cases due to rains in MayThe Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the IMA-Junior Doctor’s Network has also decided to join the protest. Letters announcing the protest were issued last Monday night by several resident doctors’ association, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, which had held a protest against Ramdev a few days ago as well. Others to have issued letters include Sanjay Gandhi hospital, ESI hospital, Maulana Azad Medical College, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, AIIMS-Rishikesh, IMA Rajasthan, Maharashtra State Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), and Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors (KARD). The controversy started after two videos of Ramdev went viral where he is seen calling allopathy a “stupid science” as lakhs died despite getting allopathic treatment for Covid-19. He also said that 10,000 allopathic doctors had died despite being vaccinated. The IMA clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said. The IMA filed a police complaint, sent a ₹1,000 crore defamation notice, and a letter to the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The health minister rapped Ramdev for his comments in a letter, following which the yoga guru had issued an apology. However, he followed it up with a set of 25 questions about allopathy, asking why it not have cure for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart conditions. Later, he also claimed that he did not need a vaccine against Covid-19 as he had dual protection of yoga and ayurveda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resident-doctors-begin-black-ribbon-protest-against-ramdev-for-comments-on-allopathy-101622523652515.html

States/UTs have been advised that they should publish vaccination slots based on the availability of vaccines. The Union Government has also instructed all states/UTs to give preference to beneficiaries with online appointments than to on-site registrations,” said Union health ministry in a statement on Monday.Also Read | India records 127,510 new Covid-19 cases, lowest in nearly two monthsCoWIN platform facilitates registration (in both online and on-site modes), scheduling of appointments, vaccination and certification of beneficiary during Covid-19 vaccination process.It was brought to the notice of the authorities that in some cases, the DIOs were publishing a session but were cancelling them or sending the beneficiaries back if vaccines were in short supply, causing inconvenience to those who had already booked their appointments.To address this problem, CoWIN has provided the feature for rescheduling of vaccination sessions so that the DIO does not have to cancel them. Provision has also been made so that pre-booked appointments also get rescheduled when a session is rescheduled. In such cases, the beneficiary will not have to take a fresh appointment.They will also receive an SMS informing them about rescheduling of their session.

The 1.5 acre of land identified for IAS officers association is located in two different but contiguous plots allotted to the school several decades ago as homestead land in revenue records.Odisha Abhibhabak Mahasangh, a leading parents’ body and the alumni association of Unit 6 Boys High School has written to CM Naveen Patnaik, alleging the allotment of the school land to a private body like the IAS officers’ association was not just arbitrary, but smacked of high-handedness.“... The school land is reserved for a playground. Such attempts to convert school land for a transit house for a private body like [the] IAS Officers Association is not just illegal, but defeats the purpose of the Mo school Abhiyan started by the government,” said Basudev Bhatt of Odisha Abhibhavak Mahasangha.Girija Shankar Das, an alumni of the school alleged the bid to take away school’s plot has been afoot since January this year when Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) erected a wall on the land.“We were given to understand that the Capital Hospital would have some facility there. So we filed a case against the BDA in the court... in January this year and obtained a stay order. However, we were dismayed after learning that the land is being eyed for an IAS officer’s transit house,” said Das.Das said in a recent meeting, the school’s alumni association had collected over ₹25 lakh for constructing a volleyball court, badminton court and a basketball court in the school playground under Mo School Abhiyan, started by the state government.Among the school’s alumni are former IPS officer and the current chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission Satyajit Mohanty, principal of SCB Medical College Datteswar Hota, senior BJD leader Sanjay Dasburma and leading realtor Tapan Mohanty.“While on the one hand the state government is pushing for improvement of school infrastructure, on the other, it is going ahead with such a plan to allocate land out of a school. It is very unfortunate that the state government is doing this to a school that is also included in the smart school programme,” Das said.An IAS officer said the transit house was totally unnecessary as the existing Special Circuit House and the State Guest House were sufficient to house any bureaucrat who was transferred to Bhubaneswar. “Instead of setting examples in the time of the pandemic, it’s despicable that we are taking land from a school for building a transit house. The association is a private body and can easily buy private land from its own money. Why should the state government allocate land to it that actually belongs to a school,” the officer asked, refusing to be named.GA department secretary Sanjeev Chopra did not respond to the allegations. When asked for a comment, secretary of Odisha IAS Officers Association, Vishal Dev, said: “The land is not yet allotted. So, where is the question of using 1.5 acres of land?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-move-to-allot-school-land-in-bhubaneswar-to-ias-officers-association-101622521192534.html

But ever since then, the single-day spike has been showing a declining trend, leading to projections that suggest the second wave of the coronavirus is subsiding.

Although there are 1,895,520 currently active cases in the country, the number has been declining steadily on par with India's ebbing second wave of the coronavirus.The health ministry said on Monday said that the decrease in the nationwide Covid-19 tally is directly linked to a sharp fall in cases seen in regions like Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat. To break the chain of transmission and gain control over the disease spread, states like Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Chhattisgarh have extended their respective coronavirus-induced lockdowns/curfews, even though there will be some relaxation in curbs.Also Read: Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: ReportOn the global front, the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday announced a new nomenclature for the Covid-19 variants that were previously — and somewhat uncomfortably — known either by their technical letter-number codes or by the countries in which they first appeared.WHO said it will now refer to the most worrisome coronavirus disease variants — known as “variants of concern” — by letters in the Greek alphabet.

He later raised 25 questions on the efficacy of modern medicine. He also questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines against the coronavirus disease while claiming that the fatalities caused by Covid-19 showed that allopathy was not 100% effective.Also Read | 'Nothing against Ramdev but': IMA chief on withdrawing complaint against yoga guruForda said that unless Ramdev issues an unconditional open public apology, action against him under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, will be taken, according to news agency ANI.The Doctors Association Jammu (DAJ) expressed solidarity with Forda and said it will also join the protest. In an appeal to Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha the DAJ said necessary action should be taken against Ramdev for his "irresponsible and despicable public statements".The India Medical Association (IMA), too, strongly objected to Ramdev's statement and demanded that Union health minister Harsh Vardhan initiate action against him. The IMA urged the minister to either accept Ramdev's accusations and "dissolve the modern medicine facility" or book him under the Epidemic Diseases Act.Also Read: Ramdev again questions Covid-19 vaccines, says he’s protected by yoga & Ayurveda“It is stated that the accused being a businessman, in order to take advantage of the present situation and his large public following, is willfully and deliberately advancing dishonest representations… about allopathy and modern medicine… and to swindle them into parting with their monies by taking Swami Ramdev’s unapproved and dubious drugs,” the IMA said in a 14-page complaint sent to the Centre.On Monday, a day before the Black Day, Ramdev claimed that his statements were misunderstood. The Yoga guru said he respected allopathic doctors and only disapproved of the big pharmaceutical companies.“I respect allopathy and allopathic doctors; their contribution is immense to the medical field and society. Our drive is not against them but those who sell medicines at exorbitant prices and treat patients as revenue-earning customers. We are against those who unnecessarily recommend medical tests, operations and costly drugs while the patient doesn’t require them at all,” said Ramdev.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-association-to-observe-black-day-to-protest-ramdev-s-remarks-today-101622509133120.html
01-06-2021||India||IMD to issue second stage monsoon forecast today||A detailed monsoon forecast with zone wise rainfall probability will be issued by India Meteorological Department (IMD) today.Apart from giving monsoon forecasts for the four geographical regions, IMD will also update its monsoon forecast for the season, covering June, July, August and September. It will issue a forecast for June separately.The monsoon for this year is likely to bring the normal amount of rainfall at 98% of the long period average (LPA), IMD had said on April 16.Monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3, IMD said on Monday, adding that monsoon presently was passing across Sri Lanka and had been there for two days. As per the latest meteorological indications, the southwesterly winds could strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in an increase in rainfall activity over Kerala.Also Read | Will never manipulate data to justify forecasts: IMD on monsoon forecast lapse“It has been raining over Kerala but we cannot announce monsoon onset until all parameters are met. They are likely to be met in the next couple of days. We are monitoring continuously,” M Mohapatra, director general, IMD said.“Monsoon is now over Sri Lanka. The very next point will be Kerala. Rains had reduced over Kerala in the past two days. Westerly winds are picking up now,” added DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research services at IMD Pune.A cyclonic circulation over eastcentral Arabian Sea off Karnataka coast is likely to meander over the region during the next four days. Southwesterly winds are also likely to strengthen during the next 2-3 days. Under the influence of these and other favourable meteorological conditions; scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or thunderstorm activity is likely over Karnataka and Kerala and Mahe and isolated to scattered rainfall or thunderstorm over the remaining parts of south peninsular India during the next 4-5 days.Moderate to extremely heavy rain was recorded over many parts of east and northeast India, including east Garo Hills (32cm); Bhalukpong (13 cm); Lakhimpur (11cm); Jamshedpur (17cm); Pollur, Tikrikilla, Dhemaji, and Kolar (9cm); Barpeta (8cm); Uthiramerur, Dharamsthla, Vellore, Matheran, Shanti Niketan, Itanagar, Cherrapunji, Kokrajhar, and Nongstoin (7cm) each. Extremely heavy rainfall (over 20cm) was recorded at isolated places over Assam and Meghalaya; heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh and heavy rainfall over Gangetic West Bengal, north Konkan, coastal and south interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal.The monsoon season, which begins on June 1, is crucial for summer crops and brings about 70% of India’s annual rainfall. It is critical to the country’s agriculture, which is one of the mainstays of its economy. Monsoon spurs farm produce and improves rural spending. It is the lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which has no irrigation. It impacts inflation, jobs, and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and help inject demand into the economy.Nearly half of India’s population depends on a farm-based livelihood. The rains also replenish 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-to-issue-second-stage-monsoon-forecast-today-101622516392119.html

Jaishankar on May 27 under the aegis of US-India Business Council and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum in Washington, even as they acknowledged the magnitude of India’s second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, most of their questions and concerns focused on the role of India in global economic recovery.Free from partisan views and knowledgeable about the actual ground situation, they looked beyond raw numbers and assessed the economic outlook after the second wave. Most agreed with the minister’s view that since lockdowns were local and intermittent and as supply chains were intact, its impact would be far less than last year.They took keen interest in the government’s efforts to vaccinate as many people as possible so as to get the economy back on track, according to diplomats who asked not to be named.Prominent among those who attended the meeting were: Ariel Mactavish, president, Respiratory Interventions Operating Unit, Medtronic Inc.; Ken Gilmartin, executive vice-president, Jacobs Engineering Group; Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO, IBM; Raj Subramaniam, president and COO, FedEx; Julie Sweet, CEO, Accenture; and Seifi Ghasemi, chairman and CEO, Air Products.Also read: US business honchos express confidence in IndiaThe US CEOs spoke about similar American experiences last year. Many noted the logistics effort made by the Indian government, especially on oxygen supply. They highlighted that India had a key role as a global vaccine hub in restoring global economic confidence. Apart from its resident population, its large number of expatriates and services staff, including merchant shipping and airline crew were globally relevant. Many US firms also had large India-based staff whose health were central to their operations. The CEOs also believed that as the vaccine drive accelerated, connectivity and interaction between the two business communities will be fully restored.Till Sunday evening, India had fully vaccinated 44.4 million people and partly vaccinated 123.1 million—which means almost 18% of the eligible population of 940 million has been vaccinated. On Monday, the government told the Supreme Court that the country would vaccinate everyone in the age group by the end of December, something that will require a sharp acceleration to around 7.75 million doses administered a day for the rest of the year.Interestingly, many CEOs brought positive perspectives from their own company feedback on economic recovery. Experts have pointed out that while the onset of the second wave coincided with the economy’s return to normalcy, the fact that most states have ensured manufacturing and other business activities continued through localized curbs may mean a lower impact.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on May 5 said the dent to aggregate demand on account of the second wave was moderate and disruptions in manufacturing were minimal compared to the first wave due to localized curbs. And most international and domestic forecasters expect the economy to still grow in excess of 10% in 2021-22.In fact, this was taken as such a given that the focus shifted to India hosting more supply chains to de-risk the global economy. In particular, the minister was quizzed in detail about PLI (performance-linked incentive) schemes to expand manufacturing. Many participants spoke about their plans to invest more in the coming year. There was strong interest in electronic manufacturing, digital, and health sectors.The mood in Washington political circles too was supportive, the diplomats added, with the Joe Biden administration assuring India of full support in medical equipment even as they sought to address New Delhi’s concerns over Indo-Pacific with the QUAD grouping now being placed on priority. As for China, it has been widely noted that the May 19 meeting between the foreign ministers of the US and Russia has resulted in a US-Russia summit on June 16 in Geneva, while the March 19 US-China meeting between foreign ministers and NSAs ended in a slanging match. India is a natural beneficiary of better ties between the US and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/topusexecutives-agree-on-covid-19-2nd-wave-s-limited-impact-101622514665673.html
01-06-2021||India||Experts divided over park for lion, cheetah relocation||Cyclone Tauktae’s impact on Gujarat’s Gir national park, the country’s only home for lions in the wild, triggered a debate whether Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno Palpur wildlife reserve should take in some of the affected animals or go ahead with the planned relocation of cheetahs from Africa, conservation experts said on Monday.Most wildlife experts say Kuno should get lions from Gir as the habitat was originally developed for relocation of the big cats so that they could get a second home outside Gujarat, more so after the devastating Tauktae felled about 2.5 million trees in Gir. Though the Gujarat forest department said no lion died because of the cyclone, wildlife experts said Tauktae was a warning to governments that India needs a second home for the big cats.“You can relocate people to safer places before a cyclone comes. Not wildlife. You need a second home for them to ensure that the Asiatic lion species is not wiped out from the wild,” said a scientist from the Wildlife Institute of India, wishing not to be identified.The idea of finding a second home for lions was mooted in the early 1990s and the Madhya Pradesh government started developing Kuno as a second home for Asiatic lions. The Gujarat government refused to share lions with Madhya Pradesh, saying they were the pride of Gujarat.Environmental activists filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Gujarat government to provide lions to Kuno. The Gujarat government refused to give lions to Madhya Pradesh arguing that they were safe in Gir and the state would create a second home for them, if needed, within Gujarat.Lions did not get a second home even eight years after the Gujarat government told the Supreme Court this, despite almost 40% of the lion population in Gujarat living outside notified wildlife areas and being vulnerable to diseases from livestock. According to wildlife experts, 1,400sq km of Gir National Park has carrying capacity of about 250 or so lions and the park attained that level more than two decades ago.“It (the overpopulated Gir) has twofold implications,” said wildlife biologist Meena Venkatraman, who has worked in Gir for more than two decades. “First, for the animal himself, and second, for the people living around them.” The signs of these implications are visible.In September 2018, 27 lions in Gir died because of canine distemper virus (CDV) while 37 others had to be quarantined.Gujarat forest department data shows that lion deaths because of conflict with people are on the rise. As per information provided to the state assembly, 159 lions died in 2020 as compared to 154 in 2019 in and around Gir and about one-third of them were probably because of conflict with humans.Lions in a Hyderabad zoo contracting Covid-19 and Cyclone Tauktae revived the debate whether the animals need a new home. Wildlife biologist and conservation scientist Ravi Chellam said the possibility of the lion population getting wiped out because of a natural disaster is high though that of the cats in the wild contracting the virus from humans is “close to zero”.Also read: Experts fear biodiversity loss in Andaman, Nicobar IslandsIn the present circumstances, Kuno appears to be viable for translocation of lions as it was developed for them but it may not be readily available. A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee has decided to import cheetahs from South Africa in the green habitat, bordering Rajasthan’s Ranthambore tiger reserve. The central government earlier this month informed the Madhya Pradesh forest department that it could import eight cheetahs by November this year.“Since the beginning Kuno was developed to receive Asiatic lions and was never seen from cheetah perspective,” said Faiyaz Khudsar, a wildlife biologist.Those in favour of introduction of cheetahs such as MK Ranjitsinh said the project would help India in protecting some of its lost grasslands and create new wildlife habitats. Cheetahs were last spotted in India in the 1950s and Ranjitsinh first tried for their relocation from Iran in the 1970s. He was able to convince environment minister Jairam Ramesh in 2010 to get cheetahs and an expert committee headed by him was formed. The Supreme Court, however, imposed a stay on the project after wildlife conservationists approached the court.“...Conservation of cheetahs can help in conserving grasslands and protecting grassland species like the Great Indian Bustard that are now less than 200 in India. Kuno may not be perfect but it is a good option,” Ranjitsinh had said in 2020.Madhya Pradesh’ principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Alok Kumar, said, “We are leaving no stone unturned to develop Kuno as one of the best habitats for cheetahs. We have started construction of boundary wall and cutting thorny bushes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-divided-over-park-for-lion-cheetah-relocation-101622514215016.html

HC asks govts to pick whom to save first||Amid an acute shortage of Amphotericin-B, the only last-line drug used to treat mucormycosis, the Delhi high court on Monday asked the Centre and state government to put before it a policy on who should be given priority for the medicine to be saved — an elderly person or a young one.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said authorities will have to take the “cruel decision” of excluding certain age groups or classes till supplies of the drug are short.“We follow the practice of ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam’ which means the world is one family, but if there are two patients in a family who need the medicine and you have one dose, you have to chose one member... It is not an easy decision to take but this is a bullet you have to take,” the bench said, adding that the choice cannot be left to doctors.Citing an example, the bench said that if there are two patients who need the drug — one who is 80-years-old and another who is 35 — and there is only one dose of medicine, one will have to be excluded.Also read: At least 59 die of black fungus as fatalities outpace recoveries“If we have to make that cruel choice, we have to make it. We are faced with that situation. We will have to cross this bridge. Will you give it to the 80-year-old or to the 35-year-old who has two children to support?“Every life is important but we are trying to find a way forward. Every life is important, we are not for a moment saying someone’s life is not important or less important. But you have to take a decision. Every single life is important,” the bench said.The court asked the Union and Delhi governments to return on Tuesday with instructions on the matter, and said the decision can be taken only by the political leadership, in consultation with medical experts.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said they were following the Centre’s formula to allocate vials of the scarce antifungal, and said it will only change its system after the Centre does so.The central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said that for non-Central government-run hospitals, states have to take the decision and even states will know the patient load.To this, the bench said, “You have to prioritise.. You will have to make that list. You are making allocation from central pool.”Spokespersons from the Delhi government and the Centre did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruel-decision-old-or-young-hc-asks-govts-to-pick-whom-to-save-first-101622512914462.html
01-06-2021||India||Twitter will have to comply with new IT rules: HC||The Delhi high court on Monday said that Twitter will have to comply with the Central government’s new rules for social media intermediaries since these have not been stayed by any court of law.“They (Twitter) have to follow it (rules), if it has not been stayed,” justice Rekha Palli said while issuing notice on a plea in which an advocate Amit Acharya said that the micro-blogging platform Twitter has not complied with the new information technology rules.The court gave three weeks to Twitter to respond to the plea which contended that the company has not followed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules 2021, enforceable from May 25.On Monday, senior advocate Sajjan Poovaya, for Twitter told the court that it has appointed a Grievance Redressal Officer, as required by the rules, on May 28, a stand which was disputed by Central government standing counsel Ripudaman Bhardwaj.Also read: Child rights body alleges Pocso breach on Twitter, lodges FIRThe Centre has said that only WhatsApp and Facebook have complied with the guideline of appointing three separate officers for the grievance redressal. The rules also seek to make social media companies more accountable and responsive to requests seeking the removal of posts.The court asked the counsel for Twitter to file the information on an affidavit and posted the matter for hearing on July 6.Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official spokesperson of the microblogging site said “As we have stated earlier, Twitter strives to comply with applicable law in India. We continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency, a commitment to empowering every voice on the service, and protecting freedom of expression and privacy under the Indian law.”The Centre and Twitter have been at odds over the latter’s decision to label a tweet by a Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson as manipulated media.Last week, police visited the office of Twitter after its India head did not respond to a notice related to an investigation into this. The labelling was on a tweet showing parts of a campaign playbook (toolkit) allegedly created by the opposition Congress party to bad-mouth the government. The Congress claimed the document was forged, following which Twitter labelled the tweet manipulated media.Also last week, Twitter sought three more months to comply with the new rules.The court was hearing the plea filed by advocate Acharya who stated that the Information Technology Rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre have three months to all social media companies, including Twitter, to comply with them.The petitioner contended that the three-month period ended on May 25, but till date no resident grievance officer has been appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform.In the plea, he claimed he came to know about the alleged non-compliance when he tried to lodge a complaint against some tweets.The petition has sought a direction to Twitter to appoint a resident grievance officer without further delay. It has also sought a direction to the Centre to ensure that the IT rules are followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-will-have-to-comply-with-new-it-rules-hc-101622510070915.html
01-06-2021||India||Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: Report||Over 10 million Indians have lost their jobs because of the second wave of Covid-19, and around 97 per cent of households' incomes have declined since the beginning of the pandemic last year, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) chief executive Mahesh Vyas said on Monday.The unemployment rate measured by the think-tank is expected to come at 12 per cent at the end of May as against 8 per cent in April, Vyas told PTI, adding this signifies that about 10 million or 1 crore Indians have lost jobs in this period.Stating that the main reason for the job losses is "mainly the second wave" of Covid-19 infections, Vyas said, "As the economy opens up, part of the problem will be solved but not entirely."He explained that people who lose jobs find it hard to get employment, specifying that while the informal sector jobs come back quickly, the formal sector and better quality job opportunities take up to a year to come back.Unemployment rate had touched a record high of 23.5 per cent in May 2020 because of the national lockdown. Many experts opine that the second wave of infections has peaked and states will slowly start to ease the economic activity-impacting restrictions in a calibrated fashion.Vyas further said an unemployment rate of 3-4 per cent should be considered as "normal" for the Indian economy, hinting that the unemployment number will have to decline for longer before the situation improves.He said CMIE has completed a nation-wide survey of 1.75 lakh households in April which throws up worrying trends on income generation during the last one year -- which has witnessed two waves of the pandemic.Only 3 per cent of those polled said they have witnessed an increase in incomes, while 55 per cent said their incomes have declined, he said.An additional 42 per cent of the people said their incomes remained the same as that in the year-ago period."If we adjust for inflation, we find that 97 per cent of the households in the country have witnessed a decline in incomes during the pandemic," he pointed out.The labour participation rate, or the percentage of the working age population which is in the market, has come down to 40 per cent as of now from the pre-pandemic levels of 42.5 per cent, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-left-1-crore-indians-jobless-97-households-incomes-dipped-report-101622507233717.html

01-06-2021||India||Covid-19 variants get new names: B.1.617.2 is now Delta||The Sars-Cov-2 variant first found in the UK will now be known as Alpha and the one sampled in India as Delta, according to a new nomenclature released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday in an attempt to remove regional associations that experts have warned could lead to stigmatisation.The naming convention follows the Greek alphabet and the labelling is based on when these variants were designated as being of concern or under investigation.“They will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion of VOI/VOC,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead, WHO, in a tweet on Monday.Till now, these have most commonly been known by what is called the Pango lineage code: the one linked to the UK is called B.1.1.7 and the one linked to India is known as B.1.617.2. In common use, however, they have also been sometimes referred to the UK variant or the Indian variant, a practice that experts and officials have discouraged.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn a statement on May 12, the Union health ministry pointed out that the World Health Organization did not refer to the variant first found in the country as “Indian”, a day after WHO labelled it as a variant of concern. Later, on May 26, the Union government asked social media companies to scrub the words “Indian variant” from their services. In an advisory issued in 2015, the WHO cautioned against naming new infectious diseases in a manner that leads to negative effects on nations, economies and people.“In recent years, several new human infectious diseases have emerged. The use of names such as ‘swine flu’ and ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ has had unintended negative impacts... This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected. We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods,” the then assistant director-general for health security at WHO said.The variants B.1.351 (first sequenced in South Africa) and P.1 (first detected in Brazil) will be known as Beta and Gamma.At present, these four are the only variants of concern – the mutations seen in them appear to make the coronavirus more infective or more resistant to immunity triggered by a past infection or a vaccine. B.1.617.2, or the Delta variant, has shown signs of being more infective as well as more resistant.It is seen to have, at least partly, led to India’s devastating second wave of cases that began in the spring, and has now raised alarm in the UK, there government scientists see the early stages of a third wave of infections building in the country. Ravi Gupta of the University of Cambridge, who is a member of the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said although new cases were “relatively low” the B.1.617 variant had fuelled “exponential growth”, BBC reported.According to data on the global repository GISAID, the B.1.1.7 has spread the most around the world, found in over 700,000 samples sequenced across 137 countries since December. But B.1.617.2 is believed to now be spreading the quickest, spreading to over 50 countries in at least 9,320 samples over the past two months. Six more variants, at present under investigation, are also likely to be labelled under the new nomenclature. The first of these VUIs is the one found initially in US, California and has been known as B.1.427/B.1.429. This will be known as Epsilon. The latest of the VUIs included in the new naming conventions is the B.1.617.1 variant, which will be known as Kappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-variants-get-new-names-b-1-617-2-is-now-delta-101622504583609.html
01-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Indian economy expanded by 1.6% in the three months ended March 31, the fastest in a year, to end 2020-21 with an overall decline of 7.3%. This compares well with the 8% contraction of the year projected by the National Statistics Office.Much of the damage the economy suffered in 2020-21 was wrought in the first two quarters of the financial year. In Q1, the three months between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the economy contracted by 24.4%, the direct impact of a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown between March 25 and May 31. The federal government imposed this to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease, and strengthen health care and medical infrastructure to cope with the surge that, even then, was evident would follow. Even after May 31, restrictions on movement and activities were eased in phases, and returned to pre-pandemic levels only in the last quarter of the financial year (January-March).Also read: GDP shrinks 7.3% in FY21; Q4 growth 1.6%In Q2, July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, the economy contracted by 7.4%, the result of continuing restrictions. In Q3, October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, GDP growth crossed over into positive territory and the economy expanded by 0.5%. Both the second and the third quarters saw pent-up buying – most people bought nothing but basics in the first quarter – and also benefited from the annual festive season (the period between September and December that sees sales of most consumer products increasing), although last year’s wasn’t as strong as such seasons usually are. The economy was expected to contract in the fourth quarter of the year, with the end of the festive season and the burning out of pent-up demand, but government spending and construction activity seem to have helped it grow in the fourth quarter too. Both the quarterly and the annual numbers bode well, although low private consumption numbers in the former are cause for concern, and there are two interesting things about the latest GDP number (the one for the three months ended March 31).One, it marks a turning point of sorts because the current quarter, as well as the three that follow, will see a beneficial base effect. Celebrations that can be expected to follow these numbers over the course of the year would do well to bear this in mind. For instance, the index of eight core industries for April was 126.7, which marks a 56% year-on-year jump over the previous year. But it was 149.2 in March, which means the index has actually declined 15.1% (which leads to...)Also read: SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policy...Two, given that the second wave emerged in mid-February, and likely peaked in early May, resulting in lockdowns through the second half of April, all of May, and, which may continue, at least in some parts of India, through the first half of June, the first quarter of the current financial year, 2021-22, is definitely not playing out to script. The Reserve Bank of India expects GDP growth to clock in at 10.5% for the entire year, which translates into 26.2% growth in the first quarter, 8.3% in the second, 5.4% in the third, and 6.2% in the fourth. It is now clear that the economy will definitely not grow by 26.2% in the first quarter (all high-frequency indicators point to this). It is also becoming clear that the effects of the bruising second wave of the pandemic, which is just beginning to ebb, will linger, perhaps well into the second quarter. And finally, even if vaccinations were to be accelerated to the 7.75 million shots a day that vaccinating everyone over the age of 18 years between now and December 31 entails – the government repeated this commitment in the Supreme Court on Monday – normal business will not resume before the beginning of the third quarter (October), and even that is an optimistic estimate.Interestingly, most economists, while cutting their estimates for 2021-22, still expect the Indian economy to expand at a low double-digit rate. The median of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News came in at 10%, just marginally down from the 10.5% before the second wave. The economists argue that this is because of two reasons: one, the lockdowns this year were state-level ones that ensured manufacturing activities were not overly affected; two, the cost of the second wave is more human than economic.I disagree, and am not convinced the economy will expand by 10% without some serious intervention by the State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101622502994093.html

The NSO put this number at 8% in its last release in February.The latest GDP numbers and provisional fiscal numbers suggest that the 2021-22 Budget presented on February 1 was conservative in its projections of the 2020-21 economic performance. Both the level of nominal GDP and Gross Tax Revenue are higher than what was projected in the Budget. The gross fiscal deficit of the government in 2020-21, as per the provisional estimates released by the Controller General of Accounts, is ₹18.21 lakh crore compared to the ₹18.48 lakh crore according to the revised estimates given in this year’s Budget. Which means it is 9.3% of GDP, not the expected 9.5%.Also read: US President looks to rebuild, expand legal immigrationThis relative improvement in 2020-21 GDP estimates is due to a better performance in the last quarter (January-March) of 2020-21 which saw GDP growth increase to 1.6%. GDP contracted by 24.4% and 7.4% in the first and second quarters of 2020-21, and grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.A fiscal push on capital spending and some green shoots in private spending seem to have played an important role in the faster than expected recovery in the quarter ending March 2021. To be sure, NSO has underlined the possibility of “implications on subsequent revision of these (GDP) estimates” as “the statutory timelines for filing the requisite financial returns of fourth quarter have been extended” due to the eruption of the second Covid-19 infections.That’s the good news.The bad news is that the second wave of Covid-19 infections might have led to a backsliding of the recovery seen in the March quarter. The index of eight core sector industries in the month of April 2021 fell to 126.7, the lowest since the 127.7 value of November 2020. This number was 149.2 in March. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI), which was 99.3 in the week ending February 21, fell to 60 by the week ending May 23. Large parts of the country are still under partial lockdown. Experts believe that the second wave of Covid-19 infections might have derailed the economic recovery seen in the quarter ending March and that the GDP numbers do not yet reflect the pain in the informal sector. A Bloomberg poll of economists has projected the median GDP growth for 2021-22 at 10%. RBI, in its Annual Report released on May 28, projected a GDP growth of 10.5% for the current fiscal year.An analysis of the Gross Value Added (GVA) data by sectors for the quarter ending March shows that construction (14.5%) and manufacturing (6.9%) saw the biggest sequential improvement in growth. The labour-intensive service sectors of trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services remained in contraction zone (2.3%) despite a significant improvement in mobility levels in the quarter. Agriculture grew at 3.1%, a moderation compared to the 4.5% growth seen in the quarter ending December 2020. Private final consumption expenditure came out of the contraction zone for the first time in 2020-21 in the quarter ending March 2021 with a growth of 2.7%. Government final consumption expenditure jumped by massive 28.3%. Gross Fixed Capital Formation, which measures investment , grew by 10.9%.“The better-than-expected growth print partly owes it to healthy corporate results in March quarter of FY21. We admit the situation is still in a flux, and it is too nascent to gauge the true impact of the second wave on macro variables. We believe that the impact is unlikely to be of the same magnitude as last year,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services. But the numbers may have been overtaken by the second wave.Also read: US business honchos express confidence in India“The March quarter numbers have been rendered irrelevant because of the disruption due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections, as far as economic momentum is concerned. With most states extending lockdowns into June, the first quarter of 2020-21 will be disappointing”, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Also, NSO itself has flagged the possibility of revision on the last quarter’s numbers because extension of statutory filing deadlines could have introduced a favourable bias in the corporate sector performance statistics.” Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian admitted that momentum of economic recovery has been affected by the second wave and “continued monetary and fiscal policy support” are needed to boost growth.“Overall economic impact of the second wave is not likely to be very large” but “localised or statewide restrictions adopted to combat its spread, present some downside risk to growth” in the first quarter of 2021-22, he added. The wave has peaked, he pointed out, and “the pace of decline is as fast as the rise”. He, however, stressed on the need to enhance pace of vaccination coverage and strict observation of Covid-appropriate behaviour.Still, the impact could make itself felt in the overall GDP growth number for the year.“The combination of Covid’s second wave and the revised base effect may imply a lower GDP growth for the Indian economy for 2021-22, which may be in the range of 9-9.5%.” Indeed, as Alok Sheel, RBI chair professor in macroeconomics at Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations (ICRIER) said, “the consensus number for this is now down to below 10% on account of the severity of the second wave of Covid 19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gdp-shrinks-7-3-in-fy21-q4-growth-16-101622502034709.html
01-06-2021||India||SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policy||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the central government to “smell the coffee” and modify its policy that requires states to pay more for Covid-19 vaccines, besides ensuring that the marginalised and rural population are not left out of the vaccination drive due to India’s digital divide.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, said the entire eligible population of the country would be vaccinated by the year-end.Resuming its hearing of the suo motu (on its own motion) case on handling of the second Covid-19 wave, the top court was emphatic that the Union government’s policy lacked a “vision” and it did not take into account several crucial aspects to tackle issues at present and in future.Also read| Close to committing $1 billion to Moderna for Covid-19 booster shot: CiplaThe bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, remarked that “policy makers must have their ears to the ground” as it flagged several areas of concern, asking why states had to pay more than the Centre for the vaccine, and how the Centre planned to ensure people in rural areas could get the vaccine when registration on the CoWIN digital platform was mandatory. Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that the Centre expected to vaccinate the entire population of the country by the end of this year, as he also sought to justify the dual pricing of vaccines. About mandatory registration on CoWin, the SG said it was done in view of limited health infrastructure and to avoid overcrowding at centres.But the bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, remained unimpressed with the submissions and regretted that the Centre did not seem to have paid heed to suggestions mooted by the court in its April 30 order on vaccine pricing and rural health care.“You smell the coffee and see what’s happening across the country and change your policies. It cannot be a day-to-day ad hoc response to as and when problems occur. Absent guidelines and absent policy, you will have ad hoc decisions. There has to be a clear-cut policy of decision making and a vision for the present and for the future, which is perhaps lacking today. We will like your policy to be amended,” it said. Asking the government to show a “little bit of flexibility”, the court said that it was not enough for the Centre to claim only it knew what was best for the people and that they must also remember that “our arms are strong enough to come down” if there was continued resistance to consider changes. “...Ability to recognise that we have gone wrong is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. Our idea is to initiate a dialogue so that we can strengthen the arms of the nation,” said the bench, giving the government two weeks to come back with a detailed response. It emphasised that the Union government ought to negotiate globally and procure vaccines for the entire country “in a national crisis” rather than leaving states in the lurch.“What is the rationale behind this dual pricing policy? Centre procures at a certain price but does not want to tell the manufacturers at what price they should give it to states. If the Centre can justify its lower pricing due to block supply, why cannot it procure the vaccines for the states under the same rationale? Ultimately, you have to ensure everyone gets vaccinated at the same price for all sections,” it said.The bench added that the criterion of those aged above 45 years being the vulnerable class for Covid-19 has witnessed a change with many less than 45 losing their lives due to the virus in the second wave. “Can there be a justification for the Centre to now say that we will only take care of those who are above 45? We are aware that we don’t have time to enter the realm of policy making but your policy has to be logical and reasonable,” said the bench, asking the SG to get unequivocal instructions on the next date if the Centre was ready to act like a national body for procurement of vaccines.It further asked Mehta if it was realistically possible for all those in rural areas and the marginalised to register themselves on the CoWIN platform.Also read: 3 men bury Covid positive father’s body in field, probe ordered“What about the digital divide? You can keep saying Digital India, Digital India. Digital India is alright but can a poor migrant worker from Jharkhand or from Rajasthan get himself registered on CoWIN? Is that possible? How are you answering the digital divide? How are you going to ensure migrant workers can get themselves registered and get vaccinated?” it asked. While the SG said that walk-in registrations have begun in some circumstances, the bench pointed out there is no policy on record regarding this or to show how and why the Union government decided to usher in differential pricing of vaccines for the 18-45 age group.“You cannot say if you don’t register on CoWIN, we will not vaccinate you. Ground reality is that 70% of vaccination is only in urban areas. Vaccines are not reaching the rural areas. If there is a policy document, we want to see what is the policy in black and white. We don’t want to go by the affidavit to say it is evolving; it is dynamic, etc. We want to see what’s the rationale,” it told the SG. It added that no policy was carved in stone and that the government’s new policy had to meet the test of reasonableness and equality, apart from ensuring right to life that included right to public health.“You have to have a policy which is clear-cut, deal with all the issues and provide guidance to states and other institutions in terms of not only present but also in terms of the future. We will also request you to produce the policy document along with the file noting on it. So that we know what prompted you to change the previous policy. The only issue that we are seeing today is that of vaccination policy. The dialogue will continue. If you change the policy, well,” it said. The bench said it will issue an order on the proceedings but it was not released Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-questions-govt-on-its-covid-19-vaccination-policy-101622502614428.html

The apex child rights body has also filed an FIR, charging the social media giant for allegedly giving false information and violating the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.“There are many groups of paedophiles on Twitter as well as other content relating to child sexual abuse. There are also links to the dark web. NCPCR investigated and found that over 30 inappropriate websites could be accessed through Twitter,” said chairperson Priyank Kanoongo in a video statement.“We have written to the Centre requesting that children not be given access to Twitter until the platform is safe for them,” he added.HT reached out to the ministry for a reaction but didn’t get a response. Twitter, too, declined to comment on the matter.The US social media giant has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over compliance with the new social media guidelines. It is yet to share details of its compliance officer with the ministry.Last Thursday, Twitter raised concerns about “intimidation tactics by the police” and the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines. This has prompted a strong response from the Centre, which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.The exchange represents a snowballing controversy over new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-rights-body-alleges-pocso-breach-on-twitter-lodges-fir-101622500961490.html

01-06-2021||India||Firestorm over Mehul Choksi spills over to Dominica, PM Skerrit is new target||Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit on Monday came under a sharp attack from the Caribbean nation’s main opposition party over businessman Mehul Choksi, accusing the prime minister of being “part of a plot against the rule of law” to send the fugitive diamantaire to India.Lennox Linton, leader of the opposition in Dominica’s House of Assembly, also demanded a “full investigation” into the circumstances under which Choksi was brought to Dominica and into what he described as the “obvious collaboration between Dominica, Antigua and India” and the officials who instructed or influenced the police to facilitate the inhumane transfer of Mehul Choksi to Dominica.Indian-born Choksi mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, whose citizenship he holds, last Sunday, but was detained by Dominican police on Tuesday night on charges of illegally entering the island. The two islands are roughly 100 nautical miles apart.PM Skerrit is the second leader in the region to be targeted by the opposition over the tussle over Mehul Choksi. Antigua PM Gaston Browne has been severely criticised by the opposition who allege his government played a role in Choksi’s disappearance from the country. He has, on several occasions, suggested that Dominica shouldn’t send Choksi back to Antigua but deport him to India.Monday’s statement by Dominica’s lead opposition party accused PM Skerrit of playing along with Antigua PM.“We demand urgent remedial action to remove the stain from this unfortunate incident on the image of Dominica and restore our country’s reputation as a responsible member of the family of nations, diligently carrying out the rule of law responsibilities of international development,” Lennox Linton said.Choksi’s legal team has claimed that he was abducted from Antigua and taken to Dominica by Indian and Antiguan officials. On Monday, his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal suggested that Choksi may have been honey-trapped by a woman he had known for six months. Choksi had gone to her house when he was abducted and taken on a yacht to Dominica.The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition on Choksi’s fate. The court will hear the matter on Wednesday when India is set to seek his deportation directly to New Delhi.UWP leader Linton’s statement on Monday demanded an immediate end to what it called “no law, no constitution” governance conduct that disgraces Dominica as a rogue element in the family of nations and endangers the rule of law foundation for the advancement of civility in the global community.“The presence of Indian born Antigua and Barbuda citizen Mehul Choksi in Dominica following allegations that he was kidnapped in Antigua, beaten, ferried to Dominica, and taken into the country against his will highlights once again the extent to which departments of government are involved in organized crime under the influence and/or direction of the regime of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit,” he said.Asserting that Choksi’s citizenship issue is already pending in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda, Linton said: “State actors under the leadership of the Prime Minister of Dominica appear to be part of plot against the rule of law protection guaranteed to citizens that is effectively undermining the judiciary in the jurisdiction of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court for the benefit of a foreign power.”The removal of Choksi from Antigua and Barbuda, (where according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne, he enjoys the constitutional privileges of citizenship) to Dominica, was intended to facilitate his transfer to India without having to wait on the outcome of the ongoing extradition proceedings scheduled for hearing in November 2021. To that extent, Dominica has been conscripted to unlawfully violate the constitutional rights of an Antiguan citizen for crass political purposes, the opposition leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dominicas-oppn-also-targets-its-pm-alleges-connivance-with-india-and-antigua-101622491322603.html

Such language (especially the part “... until further orders...” ) was never used in appointment of previous CBI directors, including Rishi Kumar Shukla and Alok Verma .The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) declined comment on the matter.“Neither in the SC directive nor the CVC act, it is mentioned that the two-year tenure can be altered. The SC judgment in Vineet Narain & Others vs Union of India was to insulate the CBI Director from any executive interference but this kind of language shows some ulterior motive,” Narain said. “This is contemptuous of the apex court’s decision and Hon’ble Chief Justice of India (N V Ramana) should take cognizance of the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/language-used-in-order-naming-jaiswal-as-cbi-chief-violates-sc-directive-activist-101622489869777.html

In the current scenario, a fresh sero survey can help the government decide when to ease restrictions on movement. “Quick rounds of sero surveys can be conducted to know the antibody prevalence that will help in opening up accordingly. I suspect that the positivity rate, which has gone down, is largely due to natural infection,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Experts also say that the fourth survey will be different from the other three surveys as apart from a sudden, massive surge, a section of the population has also been vaccinated in the past four months. “What we look for in a sero survey is the presence of antibodies against the virus, and at this stage the antibodies seen could be because of not only infection but also vaccination,” Dr Panda said.He also pointed out that among the infected are those who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and some who got seriously sick. “It will be a mixed kind that we will get this time, while earlier there was infection/disease transmission dynamics,” Panda said.Also read| Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: ReportBlood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are also important in determining whether the disease has entered the community transmission stage or not.ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai has been the nodal agency for all past surveys and will most likely supervise the fourth one as well.The earlier sero surveys suggested that a significant size of the population was still susceptible to catching the viral infection, and India was far from achieving herd immunity. The first one was designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more from 21 states, where the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population.the second and third rounds, all other parameters were the same except for the age bracket — samples were taken from people aged 10 and above.The third sero survey, conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021, found 21.4% of those aged 10 and above infected with the virus.In the second round, nearly one in 15 (6.6%) people above the age of 10 was found to be exposed to the virus till August 2020.The first survey conducted in May last year had found the infection rate to be 0.73% nationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-plans-4th-nationwide-sero-survey-101622489809721.html

They had approached the court against the employer availing an exemption from the state government from the ongoing lockdown without complying with Covid-19 protocols, particularly social distancing.According to the workmen, the distancing norms cannot be maintained in the production procedure adopted by this employer, particularly in the assembly line, the court said in its orders on Monday.The workers did not turn up to work on Monday in protest. The employer, however, maintained that all precautionary steps are followed and was open to any surprise inspection.The court requested state advocate general R Shunmugasundaram to arrange for a senior official from the Directorate of Industrial Safety to visit the Sriperumbudur factory of Renault-Nissan by 10 am on June 1.“It is hoped that after the day off today, the workmen will resume their duties tomorrow, so that the inspection may be made and representatives of the workmen may interact with the concerned government official, along with the representatives of the management, to check the relevant parameters and arrive at some form of a solution,” the court said in its order. The official could also mediate between the management and the workers if required, the court said.The workers have suggested that social distancing norms can be followed between two cars in an assembly line by allowing three or four workmen to work on the vehicle at a time, instead of six or eight. They also suggested that a study that the management is undertaking to ensure that distancing norms are maintained at all times, should be completed expeditiously and corrective measures must be adopted, the court said.The court adjourned the case to June 4 hoping to hear an amicable solution and directed the employer to submit the number of workmen infected by Covid-19, how many are in the hospital and the ones getting treated at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-orders-inspection-of-renault-nissan-unit-over-covid-19-norms-compliance-101622489090277.html

With the death of 478 people -- 220 in private hospitals and 258 in government-run ones --the tally rose to 24,232. The total number of people testing positive till date increased to 20,96,516 and the number of active cases, including isolation, as on today remains at 3,01,781. The number of patients discharged today after treatment stands at 31,223, and the total recoveries rose to 17,70,503. Chennai accounted for 2,596 new cases, 3,990 recoveries and 91 fatalities. The metro's overall tally is 5,04,502 cases, with the active cases/those under treatment remaining at 33,922. The total recoveries in the city stood at 4,63,489 while the fatalities were 7,091.

Deeply concerned over the non-replenishment of vaccine doses by the Centre, State Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma Subramanian claimed that the present stock would be used up inthe next two days. Tamil Nadu has only 5 lakh vaccines left, which will be enough for inoculation in the next two days, Subramanian told reporters today. The State was expected to receive 25 lakh vaccines from the Centre for vaccinating the 18-plus age group but got only 13 lakh doses, he said. Certain districts like Thanjavur and Tiruvarur have no vaccines, he said after inspecting the largest Covid care centre established at the Chennai Trade Centre with 864 beds. About 504 beds were added to the 360-bedded facility, with oxygen lines. In addition to 13 lakh doses, the State had earlier obtained 83 lakh doses from the Centre. So far about 87 lakh people have been vaccinated till Sunday and there was a wastage during the vaccination drive in the first coronavirus wave, he said. The Union government was informed about the current situation and that fresh stocks were expected, the Minister, who earlier inaugurated a Yoga and Naturopathy Covid care centre here, said. As on Monday, about 89,32,852 people were given both the Covishield and Covaxin shots, a release from the health department said. They include 12,85,159 in the 18 to 44 years age group and 32,23,935 people in the 45-60 age group besides 8,29,288 healthcare workers, 10,40,680 frontline workers and 25,53,790 senior citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-reports-27-936-new-covid-19-cases-active-caseload-remains-above-300000mark-101622486469056.html
01-06-2021||India||Vijayan writes to 11 states, seeks support on jabs||HT Correspondent  Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday wrote to all his non-BJP counterparts asking them to come together and put up a joint effort to get vaccines from the union government. The letter has been sent to 11 chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Punjab.. “It is important that vaccine should be provided free of cost considering it as a public good, the access to which shall be denied to none due to lack of financial wherewithal,” his letter said. He said if the burden on vaccines is left entirely on states their fiscal situation will be affected. His letter assumes much significance in the light of the Supreme Court’s latest observation that there should be only one price for Covid-19 vaccines across the nation. Earlier, the Centre had proposed a three-tier price structure for vaccines. “It is learnt that the union government has taken a stand that the states should resort to their own measures to procure vaccines. The supply of the vaccines is scarce as compared to the demand for the same,” he said asking all his counterparts to jointly pursue the need of the hour. He said vaccine manufacturers were unwilling to enter into an agreement with states for procurement and that herd immunity will be effective only if a substantial chunk of the population is vaccinated. Vijayan also pointed out that the state had placed order for 10 million vaccines last month but it received only 8, 84,000 doses. After assuming power for the second time as chief minister he had sent at least four letters to PM Narendra Modi seeking more vaccines and oxygen. “When the nation is passing through the second surge, it is unfortunate the Centre is absolving itself of its bounder duty to provide adequate supply of vaccine. The impact of the second surge has been unprecedented, putting all of us in a state of alarm. Experts have warned about a third wave also. This necessitates our heightened preparation and vigil to meet that eventuality too,” he reminded his counterparts. Earlier, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh had written to the Prime Minister Modi requesting him to ensure that the Centre procures vaccines for all age groups and distribute it to the states. “We can pay the Centre for vaccination of 18-45 age group. But, instead of each state buying vaccines, the Centre should buy vaccines centrally and give to all states,” Gehlot had said in a letter to PM last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-writes-to-11-states-seeks-support-on-jabs-101622487889659.html
01-06-2021||India||Vaccine stock left for just two days, waiting for allocation: TN govt||Tamil Nadu has vaccine stock remaining only for two more days, health officials told the media on Monday. The vaccination drive will be on hold unless the Centre either supplies 0.174 million doses pending in the May allocation or when the first consignment for June’s allocation arrives on the sixth. “We have directed officials in Chennai and other districts to complete administering of whatever vaccines are left. We will have to stop when there is zero stock, and we can only restart when we get the next supply,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. As of Monday morning, after wastage, Tamil Nadu had around 0.493 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in hand. Out of this, 0.269 million doses are for the 18-45 age group, and 0.224 million doses are for those above 45 years. The state has informed the Centre of the shortage. “The Union government has allocated 2.043 million doses for May, and we have received 1.868 million doses,” Radhakrishnan said. “As of Monday, we are yet to receive a balance of 0.174 million doses from the allotment for May. We are not sure when it will reach Tamil Nadu, whether tomorrow or the day after. They (the Centre) have said that they will inform us in a couple of days. If we receive this soon, we will be able to continue vaccinating.”For June, the Union government on Monday informed the state that 4.258 million doses will be allocated. “The only catch in this is that the first consignment in this allotment will reach Tamil Nadu only by June 6. The next supply will reach by June 9,” Radhakrishnan said, adding that due to supply issues across the country, they can only make allotments step-by-step despite doubling the allocation for Tamil Nadu. Three lakh doses are expected to arrive on June 6.Tamil Nadu has received 9.618 million doses of vaccines to date, which were used to vaccinate 8.770 million people across age groups until May 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-stock-left-for-just-two-days-waiting-for-allocationtngovt-101622487715888.html

Since no transport was available, Kumari bought a bicycle and pedalled with her incapacitated father on the carrier seat, from Gurugram to their village Sirhulli -- a distance they covered in 12 days.In January this year, Kumari was selected as the brand ambassador for an anti-drug abuse programme in Bihar. She also received the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar for her courage, and had a virtual interaction with Prime minister Narendra Modi on January 25.Kumari’s feat drew worldwide admiration, including a tweet from Ivanka Trump, daughter of then US president Donald Trump.She also signed a film titled, Aatmanirbhar, in which she will play herself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cycle-girl-jyoti-s-father-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-101622487715342.html
01-06-2021||India||‘No possibility’: AIADMK on Sasikala’s comeback, warns her of ‘retribution’||Chennai: A day after V K Sasikala’s audio clips leaked, signalling her intention of a political comeback, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) co-convener KP Munusamy suggested that Sasikala should keep away from the party for the sake of late J Jayalalithaa. “If Amma’s soul has to be in peace, it is better she (Sasikala) keeps quiet and keeps away,” Munusamy told reporters in Veppanahalli town. He also warned her of “retribution” if she chose to fight for regaining control of the party she headed briefly as interim general secretary after Jayalalithaa’s demise in December 2016.“There is no circumstance under which she can enter the party. There is no possibility... Every single AIADMK cadre is clear about it,” he added.After the AIADMK lost power to DMK in the assembly polls in the election results announced on May 3, Sasikala’s two audio clips speaking to party men went viral on Sunday. She is telling some party cadre that she will soon return to “set everything right”. The cadre responding to her suggested that a group within the AIADMK is still waiting for her.Munusamy claimed that some forces were trying to cause “confusion” in the AIADMK ranks by using Sasikala in the “forefront”, at a time when AIADMK was performing its function as the main opposition party in the Tamil Nadu assembly.“Not a single AIADMK cadre will fall for this confusion. Their intention will not come true. I also listened to the audio clips. No cadre has spoken to her. She is the one who is calling them,” Munusamy said. During her phone conversations, Sasikala is also heard saying that she will not watch the party they built with difficulties go to waste while referring to the rift between the party’s dual leadership —co-coordinator Edappadi Palaniswami and coordinator O Panneerselvam. Almost a month after elections are over in Tamil Nadu, the relationship between Palaniswami and Panneerselvam is bordering hostility. The decision to choose a leader of the opposition (LoP), which eventually went to Palaniswami unanimously as he was the chief minister candidate, renewed the friction between the duo. Panneerselvam signed a document declaring Palaniswami as the LoP and left the party headquarters on May 11. Hours later, Palaniswami drove to meet Panneerselvam at his official Chennai residence to drape a shawl over him and give him a bouquet, and photos were released. Since then, silence ensued in the party, which has not held a meeting due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and both leaders have been working individually. Palaniswami is his native in Salem district since the lockdown was imposed. “He is expected to come to Chennai only after lockdown norms ease, and he is overseeing Covid-19 work here,” said an associate in Palaniswami’s team. Panneerselvam reached Chennai on Monday after spending two weeks in his hometown in the Theni district where he has been since the death of his brother O Balamurugan on May 14. In the last few days, he too has been attending review meetings in the district. “Now that he is back we need to discuss the situation,” said a senior AIADMK leader not wishing to be named.The cold feud between the two leaders became more obvious after Palaniswami and Panneerselvam began issuing statements independently. While Palaniswami’s statements and letters are released by the party headquarters officially in his capacity as LoP, Panneerselvam’s statements come through informal channels such as Twitter and his office. Panneerselvam has been tweeting statements to chief minister M K Stalin to take action on several matters related to Covid-19 work and if it is addressed, he thanks them.On Monday Palaniswami’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for more drugs to treat mucormycosis was released by the AIADMK. “I don’t understand why they are issuing letters separately. Whatever may be the problems, what they are doing is wrong,” said a party functionary on condition of anonymity. “Only senior leaders can advise them on this.”However, party-related matters are released with the signatures of both leaders. Two joint statements on AIADMK’s letterhead have been issued recently – first to expel former labour minister Nilofer Kafeel from the party and another warning cadre against indulging in anti-party activities.Experts say that Palaniswami and Panneerselvam have to act together to keep the confidence of the party. “There are too many questions hanging in this situation,” says political commentator Durai Karunanidhi. “Munusamy’s comments aren’t enough. The leadership should hold a meeting or issue a joint statement on the lines of offering clarity to party men.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-possibility-aiadmk-on-sasikala-s-comeback-warns-her-of-retribution-101622487649570.html
01-06-2021||India||US President looks to rebuild, expand legal immigration||US President Joe Biden plans to rebuild and expand legal immigration by cutting processing time, costs and security hoops, clearing backlogs, and fixing the H-1B visa programme that allows US companies to hire foreign employees, which have been overwhelmingly from India, the New York Times has reported, citing a blueprint.This effort will run parallel to the White House-backed ambitious immigration reform legislation before the US congress, and the blueprint, titled “DHS Plan to Restore Trust in Our Legal Immigration System” — DHS is the Department of homeland Security, which oversees immigration, is only at a draft stage and will go through several versions before finalisation.Biden ran for the White House on the promise of “building a fair and humane immigration system” and undoing some of President Donald Trump’s “cruel” policies reflected in his obsession of a wall along the border with Mexico. Since taking office, Biden has undone some of his predecessor’s policies such as the Muslim immigration curbs.The central element, as the New York Times reported, of the new plan is to address backlogs in the immigration system, which had been building over the years and were only exacerbated by President Trump’ restrictive policies.It wasn’t clear from the report what specific backlogs will be targeted but the one that impacts applicants from India the most is the one for Green Cards. The US granted one million Green Cards in 2019, and that has been the general turnover annually. But because of a per-country limit of 7%, the queue of Indian applicants has kept growing over the year, with one conservative-leaning think tank estimating it to be more than 150 years.More than 300,000 applicants are currently in line, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services; but Immigration Voice, an advocacy group, says the number is as high as 1.5 million.The news report was not clear about plans for the H-1B visas — largest beneficiaries are Indian, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 granted annually — but the programme came in for harsh scrutiny and treatment from the Trump administration, which loaded it with restrictive measures, most of whom are either lapsed or rescinded.The blueprint will fast-track immigration applications by expanding virtual interviews and electronic filing, as well as limiting the requests for evidence from applicants, according to the New York Times. Domestic violence will because grounds for seeking asylum.Immigration opportunities will be expanded for LGBTQ refugees fleeing countries where they are persecuted or where same-sex marriage is not recognised.The blueprint proposes a revamp of a programme that allows undocumented immigrants to seek citizenship if they help law enforcement, and also allow protection to those who cooperate with police even before they make it to the official waiting list for immigrant visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-prez-looks-to-rebuild-expand-legal-immigration-101622487590701.html

Similar studies have been carried out in other countries but independent experts said the one-dose approach, particularly for Covishield, should be made with caution since current evidence suggests it may not provide adequate protection.“We will be looking at the feasibility of testing two dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in few weeks. Dosing interval will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better, said Dr NK Arora, chairman, Covid-19 working group, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), Delhi.Arora said the exercise could be expanded to other vaccines like Covaxin or Zydus Cadilla’s ZyCov-D, which is in the trials phase at present. “The idea is to study and find the most appropriate dosing interval that provides maximum protection with the number of variants circulating around,” Arora said, adding that a single dose could be worked out too, “but that’s definitely not the only focus”.“Different type of beneficiary mix is currently available for us to examine in the form of what is called is the real-world data,” he added.Vaccine experts have welcomed the news but have reservations about testing a single-dose Covishield regimen. “For mixed doses testing, it is a good move. But for the single dose testing, it should not be tried outside a very careful evaluation where people can be closely monitored, and sequencing can be done quickly. I am encouraged by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine but wary of the B1.617.2 virus variant,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Also read| 'Kappa' and 'Delta': WHO gives names to Covid-19 variants found in IndiaRecently, about 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharth Nagar district were accidentally given Covaxin shots as second dose after being given Covishield jabs. Experts have been following up with them, and so far, there seem to be no safety concerns.In the UK, an analysis of infections among people infected with the Delta variant, which was first found in India, showed a sharp drop in vaccine efficacy. The reduction was particularly stark among groups that had only one shot of Oxford-AstraZeneca (the same as Covishield) or Pfizer dose.A single dose of either vaccine, this data suggested, led to a mere 30% protection, down from 60% efficacy after two doses of AstraZeneca and 80% efficacy after two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.Dr Arora said that the county will have 200-300 million vaccines per month in the coming weeks as vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production. “By the end of July, we will have 200 million doses per month, and from August, we should get overall 250-300 million doses per month that would give us the capacity to inoculate close to 10 million people a day,” he said.The Union health ministry has said that efforts are on to increase the production capacity of Covaxin to 60-70 million vaccines in July-August. By September, the country expects to produce nearly 100 million doses a day of Covaxin.Production of Covishield that comprises almost 90% of the jabs given under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme so far is also being ramped up.Serum Institute of India’s chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, had said earlier that the monthly output will be raised to 100-120 million Covishield vaccines by July-August.SII locally manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield. Covaxin, on the other hand, is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-panel-to-study-mixing-doses-covishield-single-shot-101622487530874.html

The first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed this order in response to petitioners in the case--workers of Renault. They had approached the court against the employer availing an exemption from the state government from the ongoing lockdown without complying with Covid-19 protocols particularly social distancing. According to the workmen, the distancing norms cannot be maintained in the production procedure adopted by this employer, particularly in the assembly line, the court said in its orders on Monday.The workers had not turned up to work on Monday in protest. The employer, however, maintained that all precautionary steps are followed and are open to any surprise inspection. The court requested the state advocate general R Shunmugasundaram to arrange for a senior official from the Directorate of Industrial Safety to visit the Sriperumbudur factory of Renault-Nissan by 10 am on June 1. “It is hoped that after the day off today, the workmen will resume their duties tomorrow, so that the inspection may be made and representatives of the workmen may interact with the concerned government official, along with the representatives of the Management, to check the relevant parameters and arrive at some form of solution,” the court said in its orders. The official could also mediate between the management and the workers if required, the court said.The workers have suggested that social distancing norms can be followed between two cars in an assembly line by allowing three or four workmen to work on the vehicle at a time, instead of six or eight. They also suggested that a study that the management is undertaking to ensure that distancing norms are maintained at all times, should be completed expeditiously and corrective measures adopted, the court said. The court adjourned the case to June 4 hoping to hear an amicable solution and directed the employer to submit the number of workmen infected and how many are in the hospital and at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/find-out-if-covid-norms-followed-at-renault-unit-hc-tells-official-101622487529652.html
01-06-2021||India||Maharashtra extends EWS quota to Marathas||Maharashtra on Monday allowed Marathas to avail reservation under the Economically Weak Section (EWS) category to accommodate around 6,000 people from the community in government service, roughly three weeks after the Supreme Court scrapped a separate quota for the influential group.The government said Marathas with annual family income of less than ₹8 lakh could avail the EWS quota, set up in 2019. The resolution also clarified that the EWS quota benefits will be applied with retrospective effect.The quota will be applicable from the period of interim stay (on Maratha reservation) on September 9 last year to the final Supreme Court verdict on May 5, the government order said.At present, a 10% EWS quota in jobs and education is given to sections of society not covered by any reservation. As Marathas no longer have quota, the government issued a fresh order making the community eligible.Also read| Battle for Maratha reservation to be fought in Delhi: Shiv SenaIn its May 5 order, the top court had said that admissions and appointments made under the 2018 Maratha quota law till September 9, 2020 (when the Supreme Court stayed the operation of the law), won't be disturbed but the candidates will not be able to avail any further benefit. But this didn’t help around 6,000 young men and women who completed various stages of government recruitment before September 9 but were not given appointment letters, said a state official on condition of anonymity.“The SC order does not give protection to the employees not recruited before September 9 last year. Though state government had taken the decision of accommodating community in EWS on September 22 but the order was issued only on December 23 because of the resistance of the community. There are people recruited during this period. With the help of this order, we can now consider accommodating such youth in EWS quota. Some of the candidates from EWS quota may get thrown out of the reservation, but we are considering to accommodate them by creating extra posts,” said the official.The law was passed in 2018 after months of violent agitation by Marathas, which makes up 32%of the state. The 2018 law was based on a state backward commission report and the window of “extraordinary situations” cited in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. It provided 16% reservation in jobs and educational institutions to Marathas, taking the quantum of caste-based quota in the state to 68%.In 2019, the Bombay high court reduced the quota to 12% in admissions and 13% in jobs, prompting students and others to move the Supreme Court.On May 5, the SC scrapped the quota and called it unconstitutional. A five-judge bench lamented that the state government opted to give reservation to a class that was “socially dominant”, “politically dominant” and “in the mainstream of national life,” and thus, there was no justification to breach the 50% ceiling for a class that also had adequate representation in public employment.After the verdict, the state appointed a high-level committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the court order. On Monday, the panel was given seven more days submit its report. “Besides the legal recourse to find out the way out to get the reservation back, the committee is also expected to recommend alternative to safeguards the jobs of youth who could not be recruited in due time. The decision over it will be taken in days after the submission of the report,” the official quoted above said.Maratha leaders said they were unhappy with the decision. “We would not get even 4% share of the EWS quota as many other community from open category already have been getting these benefits,” said Rajendra Kondhare, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-extends-ews-quota-to-marathas-101622487530290.html

01-06-2021||India||Kerala assembly passes resolution against Lakshadweep administrator||The Kerala legislative assembly on Monday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the controversial policies of Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel and demanded their withdrawal as well as Patel’s recall.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan tabled the resolution, and said the UT has become the latest laboratory of Sangh Parivar outfits. All democratic forces should oppose this, he said.The resolution said that the people of Lakshadweep are in a tight spot. “Their culture and tradition are under threat following dictatorial measures being taken by the administrator ignoring local protests. Even their food habits and livelihood are under threat,” the resolution read.The original resolution had no direct attack against the Centre, but it was later incorporated after the Opposition sought amendments. “The administrator is taking many measures to alienate them. In the name of development their livelihood was threatened. Even coconut trees are painted with saffron colour in the name of beautification,” the resolution said.Lakshadweep has been on the boil for the last two weeks after UT administrator Patel, the former home minister of Gujarat and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, brought in a new set of rules that include a proposed cow slaughter ban, a preventive detention law and sweeping changes in land development regulations.“Steps are being taken to eliminate beef which is an important part of the staple food... The administrator is taking the lead in gradually destroying the life and culture of the people of Lakshadweep,” the resolution read.The BJP shot back. “We condemn the resolution. Earlier the assembly had passed a resolution to free cleric Abdul Nassar Madani, accused in a bomb blast case. Later he was re-arrested and now he’s languishing in a jail in Karnataka,” said party’s Kerala president K Surendran.The BJP has said that people with vested interests have been spreading misinformation. It said that the administration was trying to develop the islands as a major tourism hub like the Maldives and had the full support of the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-row-kerala-resolution-hits-out-at-new-rules-administrator-101622487409600.html
01-06-2021||India||Bed allocation scam: ‘No common link’ says Bengaluru police, accused worked solo||Close to a month into the investigation into the controversial bed allocation scam in Bengaluru, the city police have arrested 14 persons including a doctor so far. While it was alleged that the scam was carried out by an organized syndicate, the investigation has revealed most of the arrested people were operating on their own.Out of these 14 arrested, 11 were made by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) and three by the central division police. The arrested were made under three different FIRs, two of which are handled by the CCB and one by the central division.The arrested suspects include a doctor, war room call attenders, a politician’s aide, private hospital staff and a contractor employed by the government. While the modus operandi of the arrested people has been the same, police have not been able to find a common link between all the arrests. In each arrest, either one person or a group of three, who had access to the bed booking system tried to sell beds.The common modus operandi was to call up the Covid-19 patients with BU number to find out if they are asymptomatic and in-home isolation. The beds are then booked against that particular BU number. This blocked bed automatically got unblocked if the patient does not turn up at the hospital within 12 hours. This bed is now manually re-allocated to the patients referred by the agents. Police say in the case, they had figured the loophole on their own.The first arrest in the case related to Covid war rooms in the Bengaluru was made on May 4. According to the CCB, the arrested suspects during the initial phase of the probe – Dr Rehan and Shashi Kumar – were working in the bed allotment section of the south war room and Bommanahalli war room respectively.During the initial investigation, the name of one Dr Suresh was on the suspect list of the police, however, he is currently not part of the 11 people under CCB custody.The next set of arrests were also made on May 4 but in the second FIR. The arrests were made by Jayanagar police, and the case was handed over to the CCB. The arrested persons were identified as Netravati, a social worker, and Rohith Kumar, her nephew. According to CCB, they were caught charging ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 for each bed.It was in connection with this case, on May 25, the CCB arrested Babu, who is alleged to be the aide of BJP MLA Satish Reddy. A senior CCB officer said that during the interrogation of Netravathi and Rohit, they got leads on Babu. The probe showed that using his links with doctors and telephone operators in the Bengaluru South war room, he got bed blocked and sold them to the aunt-nephew duo for a price.“Babu gained access to the war room claiming to be Reddy’s close aide. Since he was seen with the MLA at the centre before, it helped him” the officer said.Even though his name was available to cops as soon as the duo was arrested, but since he was Covid-19 positive, he could not be arrested, said the officer.Meanwhile, all other arrests were made in the first FIR. On May 9, CCB arrested Shashidhar, a contract employee with Arogya Mitra, which comes under the health department. “He was one of the many liaison officers deployed at various hospitals to oversee the allocation of bed. Using his influence in the hospital, he reserved some beds. He used the help of private hospital employees Uma Rani and Venkoba Rao for this. “Rao and Rani were working as staff members at Sparsh Hospital (RR Nagar) and Punya Hospital (Basaveshwar Nagar),” said the officer.Days after this arrest, on May 26, CCB arrested a marketing executive of Sapthagiri Hospital identified as Anthony after he took money for providing a bed in private hospitals. He has no associates as per the investigation.A day later, CCB arrested Varun S, a call attender at the south war room and his associate Yashwant Kumar. “Varun on a call promised a bed in a private hospital to those calling the BBMP helpline for bed. He could provide them Yashwant’s number and ask them to contact him for a bed,” the officer added.While the CCB probe was underway, based on a tip-off, the Central Division of Bengaluru City Police had earlier arrested three people, who were offering a bed for a price. MN Anuchet (DCP, Central) said that the arrested allegedly extorted ₹1.2 lakh from a person for an ICU bed. The complainant, whose father was admitted to Ramaiah Hospital, transferred ₹50,000 via Google Pay and handed another ₹70,000 in cash. Police identified those arrested as Venkata Subba Rao, Manjunath and Punith.Sandeep Patil, the head of CCB said that their teams have been arresting those people based on the information that is available to them. “So far, there is nothing connecting all those who have been arrested so far, except for the modus operandi. We can’t say at this point in time that all of them were operating for the kingpin, rather these are individual cases. We are continuing our probe,” Patil said.The CCB officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that they have not found any links or instances of the people for the different cases interacting with each other. “They are from different parts of the city. I think as the bed demand increases, those who knew how to rig the system tried to make some quick money is what we have learnt so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bed-allocation-scam-no-common-link-b-luru-police-rule-out-organised-crime-say-accused-worked-solo-101622487410204.html
