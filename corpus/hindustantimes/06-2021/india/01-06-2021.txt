A student of the Ramakrishna Mission in Narendrapur, Bandopadhyay later excelled in Presidency College and Calcutta University, where he studied political science. He briefly worked as a journalist before passing Civil Service examination in 1987.“Alapan was always very studious and became the topper from our school in 1976. He regularly took part in debates and extemporary speech sessions. He was loved by all,” said Sunil Pattanayak, who taught Bandopadhyay at Ramakrishna Mission.Also read: Bengal CS resigns, to serve as CM’s adviser as Centre-state row growsAs a bureaucrat, Bandopadhyay made himself indispensable. During the Left Front regime, he was known to be close to Buddhadeb Bhattacharya when the latter served as information and cultural affairs minister and chief minister.After Mamata Banerjee came to power, the bureaucrat became part of the CM’s core team. “He is an honest and brave officer,” Banerjee said on Monday.“He always followed rules to the last line and gave his instructions in detail,” said a junior bureaucrat who did not wish to be named.Before becoming chief secretary in October 2020, Bandopadhay served in a number of important positions. He served as DM of Howrah, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas. Later, he was made commissioner of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. He subsequently served in the departments of transport, information, and home as principal secretary.He was also state election commissioner for a brief period in 2015. Bandyopadhyay is married to Sonali Chakrabarty, an academic and vice-chancellor of Calcutta University. His younger brother, Anjan Bandyopadhyay, was a popular television anchor who recently died of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/part-of-didi-s-core-team-man-at-centre-of-faceoff-101622486629549.html
01-06-2021||India||Bengal CS resigns, to serve as CM’s adviser as Centre-state row grows||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee appointed chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay as her chief adviser after allowing him to retire on Monday, ratcheting up a confrontation with the Centre by refusing to release the bureaucrat, and attacking PM Narendra Modi over his transfer.Banerjee announced that she permitted Bandopadhyay to retire on his last working day after he expressed the desire, and added that he will serve as her chief adviser for three years. She also named the state’s new chief secretary, HK Dwivedi, and home secretary, BP Gopalika.“A bold officer cannot be victimised like this. The Centre did vindictive politics,” a visibly agitated Banerjee said. “I have never seen such a heartless Prime Minister and home minister,” she added.Late on Monday, the Centre issued a show-cause notice to Bandopadhyay, indicating that the bitter face-off was not over. An official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity that “suitable action is being contemplated by the department against the official for defying the DoPT (department of personnel and training) order”.The controversy began last Friday after Banerjee skipped a scheduled meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Modi. Hours later, the Centre ordered Bandopadhyay, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Services officer, to report to DoPT by 10am Monday.Also read: Vista project essential, says HC, junks plea to halt workOn Saturday, Banerjee refused to release him and urged the Centre to reconsider. On Monday, she wrote a five-page letter to Modi, questioning the legality of the transfer order, asking if it was linked to Friday’s meeting, saying she took permission from Modi before leaving the meeting, and objecting to the presence of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of Opposition who defeated her in Nandigram. Bandopadhyay, too, didn’t go to Delhi.Later in the day, Banerjee said the Centre again asked Bandopadhyay to report to North Block on Tuesday, but added that an officer cannot join a new office without the state’s permission.“I wrote the letter to the Prime Minister but the reply came to him (Bandopadhyay) and not me. The Centre did not even mention why it needs him. You (Centre) have added insult to injury. I see only political vendetta. Why? Is it because you do not like Mamata Banerjee? Is it because you lost the elections? Don’t you think you should respect the people’s mandate?” Banerjee asked, referring to recently held assembly polls in which her party routed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Bandopadhyay was scheduled to retire on Monday but was granted a three-month extension by the Centre on May 24 after the state made the request on May 10. The CM’s statement indicated that the state had decided to not grant the extension.“This is a blunder by the Central government. They want to bulldoze the state government. This is a political conspiracy. What message does the Modi government want to give to the country?” Banerjee said. “I could have easily asked him (Bandopadhyay) to continue for three months since the Centre gave permission. But he told me that he wants to retire.”“Do you want to scare the bureaucracy?... I am asking all opposition CMs to stay together...” she said.the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, mention: “In case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government.”But in her letter, Banerjee alleged that the Centre’s order was issued without any prior consultation with the state government or meeting...”Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh criticised Banerjee “This is an administrative decision. Let people see politics in this if they want to. The ruling party treats IAS and IPS officers as its cadres. Banerjee cannot hide her failure in combating the pandemic...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cs-resigns-to-serve-as-cm-s-adviser-as-centre-state-row-grows-101622486509565.html
01-06-2021||India||Woman planted to trap and abduct Choksi, claims lawyer||The Mehul Choksi saga took a sensational turn on Monday with people familiar with the matter as well as the fugitive businessman’s lawyer claiming that a woman, who had become friendly with him over the past six months, played a part in his disappearance from Antigua and reappearance in Dominica.Photographs of the woman, identified as Barbara Jarabica, were released by Antiguan media, with details of her education and employment, but HT could not verify the existence of such a person. News of the woman first emerged on Saturday, when Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne claimed that Choksi fled the island for Dominica last Sunday along with his “girlfriend”.Choksi, wanted in India in a fraud and money laundering case, fled to Antigua in January 2018 and became its citizen. He has been engaged in a legal battle with the Caribbean nation which wants to revoke his citizenship. Choksi went missing from Antigua last Sunday and later appeared in Dominica, where he has no rights since he is not a citizen. His lawyers are trying to have him sent back to Antigua -- Browne has already said he wants Choksi to be extradited to India -- while India has made a claim for him in Dominica, on the grounds that its citizenship law requires the state to accept his renunciation of citizenship and this never happened.Choksi’s legal team has claimed he was abducted from Antigua and taken to Dominica by Indian and Antiguan officials. On Monday, his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal suggested that Choksi may have been honey trapped.Also read: Firestorm over Mehul Choksi spills over to Dominica, PM Skerrit is new target“I have been informed that there was some lady who was the part of the team deployed to trap and abduct Mehul Choksi. Initially, she was staying near the residence of Mr Choksi. She got friendly with the whole family during her evening walks . Later, she shifted the residence and invited Mr Choksi to her house for a short while. There were other members of the team waiting (at her house) deployed to pick Mr Choksi. They grabbed him, threw him in a yacht and took him to Dominica. As Mehul Choksi was not carrying his passport and that lady has vanished, this is sufficient to vindicate the stand that he was abducted,” he said in a statement.Meanwhile, the fugitive diamantaire has been shifted to a hospital in Roseau , but tested negative for Covid-19, reports in local media said. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, on Friday, ordered that Choksi will not be removed from the island till next hearing on Wednesday and that he should be provided medical aid.Browne also confirmed that India sent a private jet to ferry Choksi back to the country.One of the key opposition parties in Antigua, United Progressive Party (UPP) has claimed that Browne’s statement that Choksi would not be taken back in Antigua is against constitutional and legal values; in turn, Browne has alleged that UPP is funded by Choksi. Indian agencies have taken all the documentary evidence available against Choksi including charge sheets filed by Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate, witness statements and papers showing his complicity in defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) of ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi.Officials HT spoke to said they have a “strong case to put before Dominica’s authorities and the court that Choksi is one of the most wanted persons in India and siphoned off public money over the years to create assets in India and abroad”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-planted-to-trap-and-abduct-choksi-claims-lawyer-101622486389547.html
01-06-2021||India||It’s time we define what is and is not sedition: SC||Concerned over the misuse of India’s sedition law, the Supreme Court on Monday said that it will define the contours of the colonial era penal provision to indicate what does and does not constitute sedition.“Everything cannot be seditious. It is time we define what is sedition and what is not,” said a bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud as it restrained the Andhra Pradesh government from taking adverse action against two Telugu news channels booked under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“We are of the view that the ambit and parameters of the provisions of Sections 124A, 153A (promoting enmity between classes) and 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity) of the IPC would require interpretation, particularly in the context of the right of the electronic and print media to communicate news, information and the rights, even those that may be critical of the prevailing regime in any part of the nation,” said the court in its order.News channels TV5 and ABN Andhrajyothi have been named accused, along with rebel YSR Congress member of Parliament Raghurama Krishnam Raju, for aiding him in an alleged hate speech to promote disaffection against the government and commit seditious activities.The bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, went through the transcripts of the speech given by Raju, who was granted bail by a different bench of the Supreme Court on May 21.“Is this seditious? This (FIR) is nothing but muzzling the media,” remarked the bench, as senior counsel Shyam Divan, appearing for TV5, read out Raju’s speech, while pointing out that the attempt was to silence a part of the local media which criticised the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government in the state for handling of the pandemic. He added that there were several other channels and news portals that telecast this speech, but only a select few were named in the first information report (FIR) by invoking section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.Representing ABN Andhrajyothi, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said that it was high time the apex court lay down the contours of section 124A since several states were invariably slapping sedition cases against the media and other individuals.At this, justice Chandrachud recounted a comment made by him a few minutes ago, when the bench was hearing the suo motu (on its own) case on supply of essential medicines and vaccines during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.Referring to images on a TV channel of two persons throwing a Covid-positive body into a river in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur, justice Chandrachud had sarcastically said: “I don’t know whether a complaint has been filed against the news channel or not under the sedition charge for publishing and broadcasting these photographs.”The judge added that he made this comment earlier as an aside since he had in mind this matter in which news channels were made co-accused in the sedition case. The bench then issued notices to the state government, seeking replies within four weeks while making it clear that there shall be no coercive action against the employees or staff of the news channels in connection with the case.Also read: Child rights body alleges Pocso breach on Twitter, lodges FIROn April 30, another bench of the top court agreed to examine constitutional validity of the penal law on sedition in India, while seeking assistance of attorney general KK Venugopal in the wake of the significance of the matter and issues of constitutional interpretation involved.That bench issued notices to the Centre and states while hearing a petition filed jointly by journalists Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla, challenging the validity of Section 124 A, which penalises sedition as punishable with either imprisonment ranging from three years to a lifetime, a fine, or both. This case will be heard next in July.History of the lawIndia’s sedition law has an interesting past -- it was introduced by the British in 1870, and almost dropped from the Constitution in 1948 after discussions of the Constituent Assembly. The word “sedition” disappeared from the Constitution on November 26, 1949 and Article 19 (1)(a) gave absolute freedom of speech and expression. However, Section 124A continued to stay in IPC.In 1951, Jawaharlal Nehru brought in the first amendment of the Constitution to limit the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) and enacted Article 19(2) to empower the State to put curbs in the form of “reasonable restrictions” on right to free speech. In its judgment in the Kedar Nath case in 1962, a Constitution bench upheld the validity of the sedition law under IPC and also defined the scope of it. It held that Section 124A only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. This definition has been taken as precedent for all matters pertaining to section 124A ever since.According to the data from the National Crime Records Bureau, uploaded on its website, cases of sedition and under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act showed a rise in 2019, but only 3% of the sedition cases resulted in convictions. A total of 93 cases of sedition were reported in 2019, with 96 arrests and charge sheets filed in 76 cases, as against 70 cases, 56 arrests, and 27 charge sheets the previous year. The ministry of home affairs, in a written reply in February, informed the Rajya Sabha that out of the 96 people arrested for sedition in 2019, only two were convicted for the crime, while 29 were acquitted. Investigations and trials are ongoing in the case of the rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-time-we-define-what-is-and-is-not-sedition-sc-101622486269556.html
01-06-2021||India||Vista project essential, says HC, junks plea to halt work||The Delhi high court on Monday said the revamp of the city’s Central Vista was an “essential project of national importance” and dismissed, with a penalty of ₹1 lakh, a petition that sought to halt part of the redevelopment work during the pandemic.The Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment project is a part of the larger Central Vista project, which includes a new Parliament building, the refurbishment of North and South Blocks, and the construction of new Central government offices, including a common Central Secretariat, and central conference facilities, among others.“This work is part and parcel of Central Vista Project and of vital public importance. The construction of Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project cannot be seen in isolation. In fact, the whole Central Vista Project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project,” a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said.Calling the petition “motivated”, the court imposed a cost of ₹1 lakh on the petitioners -- Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker -- who sought to halt the ongoing redevelopment work on the Central Vista avenue, which includes both sides of Rajpath, on the grounds that the work could become a superspreader event. The petitioners contended that the project was not an essential activity and, therefore, could be put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic.While holding that the petitioners selectively chose only one project though several other agencies -- such as the CPWD, NBCC, DMRC, PWD, IICC and DDA -- were undertaking construction projects in Delhi, the bench said the legality of the project has already been upheld by the Supreme Court on January 5. It also said that “time is of the essence” and the work has to be completed by November 2021.“It is obvious that petitioners have selectively chosen only one project which is of national importance... and parcel of the larger project, namely, Central Vista Project, legality whereof has already been upheld by the Supreme Court in the judgment dated Jan 5th... We are of the view that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners,” the bench said in a 23-page judgment, adding that the petitioners have not been able to substantiate the allegations or the alleged breach or violation of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders.Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, had contended that exceptions were made for this project and permission was also sought for ferrying the workers during the peak of the pandemic’s second wave in April.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, argued that the plea was a “facade of PIL created to disguise something which they wanted to stop under one pretext or the other”.On Monday, the bench said that “since the workers who are working at the project are staying on site, there is no question of issuing directions to suspend the work of Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project”.“We completely disagree with the senior counsel appearing for the petitioners that the project is not an essential activity. The project in question is of vital importance and essential,” the court said.In orders issued on April 8 and April 19, DDMA allowed construction activities if the workers were residing on site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vista-project-of-essential-importance-says-delhi-hc-junks-plea-to-halt-work-101622485489526.html
