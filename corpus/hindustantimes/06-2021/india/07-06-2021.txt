In a major step towards making courtrooms accessible to more people, the e-Committee of the Supreme Court has finalised draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings of the high courts, trial courts and tribunals, finally taking forward the promise of a three-year-old judgment.The committee, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, has written a letter to chief justices of all 24 high courts in the country, seeking inputs and suggestions on the draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings by June 30.“The right of access to justice, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, encompasses the right to access live court proceedings. To imbue greater transparency, inclusivity and foster access to justice, the e-Committee has undertaken the project of live streaming of court proceedings on priority,” stated the letter.Live-streaming, added the letter, will enable access to live court proceedings, including on matters of public interest to citizens, journalists, civil society, academicians and law students on a real-time basis, something otherwise constrained by geographical, logistical or infrastructural issues.The e-Committee, which is working with the Department of Justice under the National Policy and Action Plan for implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian judiciary, has also invited suggestions and inputs from all stakeholders by June 30.The Supreme Court in 2018 held in a judgment (Swapnil Tripathi and Indira Jaisingh) that telecast of important cases to an audience outside the courtroom would usher in greater transparency and aid accountability, but little moved since. The finalisation of the draft rules is a leap towards letting lights and cameras inside the public institutions. Speaking to HT, justice Chandrachud said that the rules provide for a legal framework and a balanced regulatory structure for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings.“Going forward, infrastructural requirements such as cloud storage and adequate bandwidth will have to be met. The committee is working towards ensuring proper infrastructure so that high courts across the country have an efficient platform to stream the proceedings.”Justice Chandrachud added that the draft rules have been framed with a view to realise the vision of the 2018 judgment and to make certain the courts are open and accountable to the community. The draft rules place a presumption in favour of broadcasting of court proceedings except in a defined range of circumstances. Cases relating to matrimony, sexual offences, gender violence, recording of evidence and those that may provoke enmity among communities have been kept out of the ambit of live-streaming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-finalises-draft-rules-for-live-streaming-trials-101623089345635.html
07-06-2021||India||Carbon dioxide levels in the air hit a historic high despite Covid pandemic||Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have gone up to historic levels despite economies worldwide coming to a near halt in the last 15 months owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, The Washington Post reported on Monday.“Fossil fuel burning is really at the heart of this. If we don’t tackle fossil fuel burning, the problem is not going to go away,” Ralph Keeling, a geochemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was quoted in the report as saying.Keeling said the world will have to undertake emissions cuts that are “much larger and sustained” than anything that happened during the pandemic, according to the Post.The report cited conclusions drawn by scientists from Scripps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who said that levels of CO2 peaked in May 2021, reaching a monthly average of nearly 419 parts per million.It represents an increase from the May 2020 mean of 417 parts per million, the report says, and it also marked the highest level since measurements began 63 years ago at the NOAA observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Twice in 2021, daily levels exceeded 420 parts per million.Pieter Tans, a senior scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory, was quoted as saying that “it shows we are still fully on the wrong track”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carbon-dioxide-levels-in-the-air-hit-a-historic-high-despite-covid-pandemic-101623088912316.html
07-06-2021||India||‘Change must take place’: HC bans attempts to ‘cure’ gender identity||Chennai/New Delhi: The Madras high court on Monday banned any attempts to “cure” the gender identity or sexual orientation of people as part of a sweeping set of orders to sensitise state agencies and the central government and protect the rights of LGBTQIA+ communities. The order came on a petition by two women who approached the court to seek protection from their families opposing their relationship. The court took the opportunity to issue orders to police, prison, health, judicial and education authorities with justice N. Anand Venkatesh undergoing counselling to better acquaint himself with LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual) issues. “I strongly feel that the change must take place at a societal level and when it is complemented by a law there will be a remarkable change in the outlook of the society by recognising same-sex relationships,” said the judge in the 107-page order. The order came roughly three years after the Supreme Court decriminalised adult consensual same-sex relationships and seven years after it affirmed the rights of transgender people. Currently, the Delhi and Kerala high courts are hearing petitions to legalise same-sex marriage.The petitioners, aged 20 and 22, fled their parents’ homes in Madurai district after falling in love. Their parents filed missing persons’ complaints and two First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against the women, following which the police interrogated them at their place of residence. This prompted the women to move the court seeking protection from harassment by their parents and the police. In March, the court ordered police protection for them, and further asked that the women and their parents undergo counselling sessions under the guidance of Vidya Dinakaran, a Chennai-based psychotherapist. In the order, the judge mentioned that he too voluntarily sought an “out of the box exercise” involving psycho-educative sessions with Dinakaran and other members of the LGBTQIA+ community to break “preconceived notions” because this case gave the court an opportunity and responsibility to weigh in on inclusiveness, discrimination, morality and traditions. On May 1, justice Venkatesh had said he was “not fully woke” on same-sex relationships. Dinakaran found that while the petitioners were very clear about their decision, the parents felt “great amount of shame, fear, and social disdain upon them because of their daughter’s homosexual relationship,” Monday’s order stated.“I have no hesitation in accepting that I too belong to the majority of commoners who are yet to comprehend homosexuality completely. Ignorance is no justification for normalizing any form of discrimination,” he said.“The judgment is a turning point in our lives…we finally feel safe,” said the 22-year-old petitioner, who declined to be named over safety concerns. “The highlight of the judgement is the openness and transparency. It reinforces the fact that discriminatory practices of any nature can no longer hide under the cover of misunderstanding or ignorance. Given that destigmatisation has only begun, many queer people have started stepping out of their families in search of support and that is where the interim guidelines play an enormous role, addressing all the stakeholders in creating an inclusive and safe environment,” Dinakaran said.The court’s interim directions included asking police to close complaints without harassing trans persons, judicial authorities to provide free legal aid, health professionals to help the community and educational institutions to appoint queer counsellors and make easy procedures to change names and genders. It further asked state agencies including the state’s school education and law departments as well as central agencies such as the Department of Higher Education, University Grants Commission and Union ministries of health and family welfare and women and child development to report to it by August 31 on steps taken to sensitise society and institute measures, including gender-neutral restrooms, change in curricula, awareness campaigns and removing prejudices.The court also ordered mental health camps and awareness programmes to ensure police, judiciary, educational institutions, parents and health workers are sensitised. Banning conversion therapy – a discredited practice claiming to “cure” homosexual and transgender people -- the court ordered that anyone attempting such dubious practices could get their medical licence suspended. “I think we have turned a corner in the fight for equal rights. This judgment will be cited in the future to affirm the rights of the community,” said Manuraj S, lawyer for the two petitioners. “The criminal justice system is regularly deployed against queer couples who have to deal with deep rooted prejudice on an everyday basis. For the scores of individuals being investigated by the police at the behest of their families this is a major breakthrough,” said Mihir Samson, a Delhi-based advocate who has also represented queer couples facing familial violence.The court further asked the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment to publish a list of non governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with the community to ensure counselling, monetary support, legal assistance or coordination with law enforcement agencies about offences committed against any community member. “LGBTQIA+ persons, like cis persons, are entitled to their privacy and have a right to lead a dignified existence, which includes their choice of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender presentation, gender expression and choice of partner thereof,” the court said.The judge also spoke to community activists “to understand ground realities, emotions, social discrimination and exclusion faced by the community”.“As LGBTQIA+ persons, we are used to receiving absolute ignorance and a refusal to learn, especially by the pillars of democracy. It is hard to come across individuals as humble as justice Venkatesh, a gentleman willing to let go of every preconceived notion and wipe his slate clean. The verdict paves the way to secure the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons,” said doctor Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, who interacted with the judge. The order also referred to two landmark judgments by the Supreme Court that pertained to the rights of the LGBTQIA community. In 2014, the Nalsa versus Union of India judgment recognised the legality of self identified gender of transpersons. In 2018, a Constitution bench held in Navtej Johar versus Union of India that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality, did not apply to consenting adults.(with inputs by Dhamini Ratnam)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/change-must-take-place-hc-bans-attempts-to-cure-gender-identity-101623088776461.html
07-06-2021||India||Navy arsenal set to get boost with 3 US copters||The Indian Navy is ready to take a step towards modernising its ageing helicopter fleet as the United States is set to hand over three MH-60R helicopters to it in their country, where Indian crews are stationed for training on the new platform, by the year-end, people familiar with the developments said on Monday.Two of the multi-role helicopters (MRHs) will be delivered to the navy next month, with the third delivery planned around the year-end, said one of the officials cited above. The Indian crews, including around 15 officers, began their training at Pensacola in Florida on Monday.Last year, India ordered 24 Lockheed Martin-Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters from the US to strengthen the navy’s anti-submarine/anti-surface warfare and surveillance capabilities. The government-to-government contract for the helicopters is worth around ₹17,500 crore.The navy had first moved a case to buy multi-role helicopters, a critical operational necessity, more than 15 years ago.But the MRHs were ordered only last year as a replacement for the Sea King 42/42A fleet, which went out of service nearly two decades ago. The MRH is expected to be the mainstay of the navy’s anti-submarine/anti-ship warfare and airborne early-warning capabilities in the coming years.“The procurement is progressing well. The first batch of three choppers is likely to arrive in India in May-June 2022. The remaining 21 helicopters are likely to be delivered over the next three years (by 2024),” said a second official.Armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, MK 54 torpedoes and advanced precision weapons, the twin-engine helicopters can operate from frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers.Ship-borne multi-role helicopters have been an essential force multiplier for any navy since the 1960s, maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd) said. “I recall the great combat power the earlier helicopters like the Sea King 42 and Kamov variants brought to the fleet in the late 1980s. The induction of the new MRH is a qualitative relief, but quantitative gaps also need addressing,” he said.The navy is also pursuing a plan to build 111 naval utility helicopters (NUH) in India under the strategic partnership (SP) model to replace its outdated fleet of French-designed Chetak choppers. The defence acquisition council (DAC), India’s apex procurement body, cleared the ₹21,738-crore NUH project under the SP model in August 2018, but there has been no forward movement during the last three years.The SP model envisages indigenous manufacturing of major defence platforms by an Indian strategic partner who will collaborate with a foreign original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to set up production facilities in the country.Last week, the defence ministry cleared a project, P-75I, worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines in the country under the SP model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet.The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign OEMs for P-75I are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-arsenal-set-to-get-boost-with-3-us-copters-101623088716497.html

Foreign countries would conclude vaccination drives while ours would wait for it to start,” he said“Be it polio, smallpox, or hepatitis-B, the citizens have waited for these vaccines for years,” he added.He further stated that during his first tenure the vaccination coverage across the country was only around 60%, a fact that worried the then newly formed government since by that estimate it would have taken the nation 40 years to vaccinate all eligible citizens.“When we were given an opportunity to serve in 2014 the vaccination coverage across India was only around 60%, a very worrying fact. The pace at which vaccination was being carried out it would have taken the country almost 40 years to achieve 100% vaccination,” he said.“To solve this issue, we launched Mission Indradhanush, to vaccinate on war footing. Anyone who needed a vaccine would be vaccinated. We worked in mission mode and within 5-6 years vaccination coverage went from 60 to 90, we increased the speed and the extent of vaccination,” he added, claiming Mission Indradhanush was launched to include the poor and their children in their purview, something which has never been done before.Also Read: Centre to shoulder remaining 25% of vaccine work done by states, says PM Modi“To save kids from lethal diseases we made them part of the drive, we were worried about the poor, the children and the children of the poor who had never been vaccinated,” he added.The Prime Minister also assured citizens of increasing vaccination supply in the coming months“Vaccine supply will be increasing in the coming days. Seven companies in the country are producing different vaccines, 3 vaccine trials at an advanced stage,” he stated.Commenting on the ongoing vaccination drive PM Modi said that more than 23 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-addresses-nation-talks-of-bjp-govt-s-achievement-in-vaccinating-citizens-before-covid-hit-101623086553870.html

He was captured from Harinbhanga forest just opposite the Harikhali camp under Bashirhat range in Bengal and later released with the satellite collar on December 27, reports said.His long and arduous journey to Bangladesh involved several hurdles including some rivers wider than a kilometre. Braving all odds, the tiger moved across three islands in the span of four months, Yadav said, adding that he did not venture near human habitats.“After initial movements for a few days on the Indian side, it started venturing into the Talpatti island in Bangladesh Sunderbans and crossed rivers such as Choto, Harikhali, Boro Harikhali and even the Raimangal,” Yadav said. The tiger could originally have come from Bangladesh before foresters captured him for radio-collaring, Yadav added.The last recorded location of the tiger was at Talpatti island in Bangladesh on May 11, according to reports. Throwing light on the possible reasons why there was no update on the tiger after May 11, Yadav said the collar may have slipped off its neck."The gadget also had a mortality sensor, which gives signals in case of the tiger's death. But that didn't happen…. In all probability, the collar has slipped off its neck. In the Sundarbans, salinity in the water can also damage radio collars," he said.This was not the first time that a tiger from India has strolled to Bangladesh. In January 2017, a female tiger who was also radio-collared, travelled a 100km distance to reach the Bay of Bengal’s tip. Five other tigers were also radio-collared, out of which one travelled into Bangladesh’s Talpatti island, Dhaka Tribune reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walk-to-remember-tiger-covers-100km-in-4-months-to-reach-sundarbans-in-bangladesh-from-indian-forest-101623084098896.html

I want to know if India got this recognition after Modi Ji became PM,”“I request Modi Ji -- please work but it is right to go into the past on every topic and seek credit,” he added.Chowdhury’s question comes close on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, where he reversed the Centre’s current vaccination policy, and claimed that when he came to power in 2014, around 60% of the population was vaccinated, which was increased to almost 90% during his tenure.The Prime Minister also talked at length about Mission Indradhanush, his government’s flagship immunisation scheme, crediting it with increasing the reach and extent of the country’s immunisation drive. He also claimed that in the last 50-60 years India was entirely dependent on foreign vaccine imports.“To solve this issue (of 60% vaccination) we launched Mission Indradhanush, to vaccinate on war footing. Anyone who needed a vaccine would be vaccinated. We worked in mission mode and within 5-6 years vaccination coverage went from 60 to 90, we increased the speed and the extent of vaccination,” the Prime Minister said.Chowdhury further stated that the government took this decision due to “pressure from the judiciary” and after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi started a campaign demanding free vaccination for all, adding that it is better late than never.“The Government is already late and took this decision under pressure from the judiciary. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had started a campaign for free vaccines. However, it is better late than never,” he said.PM Modi announced a shift in Centre’s previous vaccine policy, in which states were made responsible for procuring 25% of the required vaccine doses from manufacturers.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked on Monday as the opposition party demanded universal free vaccination against Covid-19, after the prime minister announced that his government will provide free jabs to states for inoculation of all above the age of 18.The Congress also sought to credit the Supreme Court for the change in the Centre's vaccination policy and said the announcement came after the apex court reprimanded it and sought an affidavit on the inoculation drive.In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Centre has decided to buy 75 per cent of jabs from vaccine makers, including 25 per cent of the state quota, and give it for free to state governments, while private sector hospitals can continue to procure the remaining 25 per cent.After PM Modi's address, Gandhi tweeted, "One simple question - If vaccines are free for all, why should private hospitals charge for them." He used #FreeVaccineForAll hashtag with his tweet.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, "The prime minister is guilty of endangering the lives of Indians by repeatedly changing the (vaccination) policy and instead of accusing the states, he should be tendering an apology for endangering people's lives."Surjewala reiterated the demand for universal free vaccination and said the government should also transfer ₹6,000 into bank accounts of the poor to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.He alleged that the government has brought these changes in its vaccination policy after it was reprimanded by the Supreme Court.Some states had gone to the apex court against the Centre's vaccination policy alleging that it is not uniform.Surjewala said the Modi government has changed its vaccine policy thrice on January 16, May 1 and now today.Accusing the prime minister of endangering the lives of indians, he asked if he would take responsibility."Why burden the middle class and the salaried people with payments in private hospitals," he asked."Why not transfer ₹6000 in the accounts of every poor considering there have been two crore job losses in the second wave of coronavirus," he asked.Surjewala claimed that at the current vaccination rate with the average between January 16 and June 7 being only 15.46 lakh jabs per day, it will take 1,091 days, or till May 2024, to inoculate all."Then, how will you vaccinate 100 crore people by December 2021, as promised," he asked, alleging that only 4.61 crore have been fully vaccinated in last six months, which is 3.28 per cent of the population.The Congress has been demanding free vaccination for all and has urged the Centre to procure the jabs and provide them to states.The Congress on its official Twitter handle said, "Modi ji - stop with the tokenism, it will not heal the deep wounds you've inflicted on our nation. Instead - apologise and not give lectures".Congress leader and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said, "Thank PM Narendra Modi Ji for acceding to our request of central procurement and distribution of vaccine for all age-groups. I had written twice to Narendra Modi Ji on this issue and to (Health Minister) Harsh Vardhan Ji suggesting this as the only feasible solution to Covid Vaccine crisis."Another Congress Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot of Rajasthan, said PM Modi should inform which states had demanded that vaccines should be procured and provided for 18-44 years age group."To my knowledge, no state had made such a demand and it seems that the prime minister has been misinformed," he said on Twitter.Gehlot also said that many states, including Rajasthan, had moved the Supreme Court against the Centre's vaccination policy and the result of which is that the prime minister had to change it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-should-private-hospitals-charge-for-them-rahul-gandhi-asks-on-free-covid-19-vaccine-to-adults-101623081562552.html

The facility is available till August 31 this yearThese categories will also be allowed to take the second dose of Covishield before the mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of first dose. However, the second dose will only be given 28 days after taking the first dose. CoWin will soon provide the facility of administering the second dose in such cases.“With the receipt of several representations for allowing administration of dose of Covishield for such persons who have only taken first dose of Covishield and are seeking to undertake international travel for educational purposes or employment opportunities or for participation in India’s Contingent for Tokyo Olympic games, but whose planned travel dates fall prior to completion of the currently mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of first dose, the issue was discussed in Empowered Group 5 (EG-5) and appropriate recommendations have been received in this context,” the ministry said in a press release.States and Union territories (UTs) have been asked to designate a competent authority in each district for giving permission to administer the second dose of Covishield. The authority will check whether a period of 28 days has elapsed after the date of the first dose and will also check the genuineness of the purpose of travel.People travelling abroad for education will have to present documents related to admission offers or associated formal communications. Here, the competent authority of a state and UT will also check whether people are already studying in a foreign institute and have to go back to continue their education.Those going for work will have to present their interview calls for the job or offer letters for taking up the employment. On the other hand, athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending Tokyo Olympics will have to present documents related to the nomination to participate in the sporting event.“It is advised that vaccination may be availed in cases through passport which is one of the permissible ID documents as per the current guidelines so that the passport number is printed in the certificate.”If the passport was not used as an ID proof at the time of administering the first dose, the details of the other photo ID used for vaccination will be printed in the vaccine certificate and mentioning the passport number here is not to be insisted upon, the release further said adding the competent authority might issue another certificate which will link vaccination certificate with the passport number of the person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-need-to-travel-abroad-for-education-employment-centre-issues-sops-101623077572868.html

The induction of the new MRH is a qualitative relief, but quantitative gaps also need addressing,” he said.The navy is also pursuing a plan to build 111 naval utility helicopters (NUH) in India under the strategic partnership (SP) model to replace its outdated fleet of French-designed Chetak choppers. The defence acquisition council (DAC), India’s apex procurement body, cleared the ₹21,738-crore NUH project under the SP model in August 2018, but there has been no forward movement during the last three years.The SP model envisages indigenous manufacturing of major defence platforms by an Indian strategic partner who will collaborate with a foreign original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to set up production facilities in the country.Last week, the defence ministry cleared a project, P-75I, worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines in the country under the SP model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet.The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign OEMs for P-75I are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-deliver-two-mh-60r-choppers-to-indian-navy-in-july-101623080556242.html

07-06-2021||India||Railway employees demand ‘frontline worker’ status, priority vaccination||The Railways Employee Union launched a campaign on Monday to demand they be declared ‘frontline workers’, as they have been working throughout the pandemic, losing around 2,000 colleagues to the virus. To this end a social media campaign with the hashtag ‘Treat Railway Employees Frontline Worker’ was also started on Twitter."Responding to a clarion call given by the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF), railwaymen across the country demanded, through a Twitter Campaign, the status of 'Frontline Workers' for them, by tweeting to the prime minister, the railways and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare," All India Railwaymen's Federation (AIRF) said in a statement.AIRF, the largest union of railway employees, had written to Railway minister Piyush Goyal in early May, demanding that those succumbing to Covid in the line of duty should be compensated ₹50 lakh, at par with other frontline workers, as opposed to the ₹25 lakhs they are currently being paid, and priority vaccination."We also appreciate the prime minister when during 'Mann Ki Baat' he called railwaymen as corona warriors. AIRF, since the beginning has been demanding parity between different cadres who are working 24x7 during this corona period and scarifying their lives. However, It is quite unfortunate that while other categories of front line workers viz medical staff, security forces, sanitation staff etc. are being paid ₹50 lakh as compensation but Railwaymen are being paid ₹25 lakh only,” AIRF general secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra had written.While the government is extending all the benefits to the staff of other departments, treating them as 'Frontline Workers', Railwaymen are being given step-motherly treatment," Mishra said.Mishra told news agency PTI that “serious discontent” is brewing amongst railway employees on not being given the due recognition of a frontline worker despite serving the nation during its crisis period. Mishra had claimed earlier that around 65,000 employees have made a successful recovery from Covid-19 and rejoined service, adding that a letter of appreciation from the Prime Minister is commendable but what railway workers really want is being treated at par with other frontline workers. He also said that the ongoing campaign will be extended if their demands are not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-employees-demand-frontline-worker-status-priority-vaccination-101623075946579.html

However, they also did point out that the decision should have been taken much earlier to ensure less damage by the disease.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said that Modi has conceded to the state government’s requests of centralised procurement of vaccines. “Good that Centre has decided to take over vaccine procurement & distribution for the whole country for all age groups.

This is a victory of public sentiment.” Gehlot also congratulated all the MPs, MLAs and Congress workers in his state.Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh also expressed similar opinions saying that the prime minister has accepted the opposition’s demand for centralised procurement. “The Prime Minister inflicted a huge cost on the people of India before accepting the Opposition’s demand for centralised procurement and free vaccination for those in the age group of 18-44-year-old. Humility and reaching out will not hurt him,” he tweeted on Monday.The Prime Minister inflicted a huge cost on the people of India before accepting the Opposition’s demand for centralised procurement and free vaccination for 18-44 year olds.

However, the new guidelines mention the use of antipyretic and antitussive for symptomatic relief.Among the key guidelines which have been routinely stressed on include use of wearing masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene.Suggesting a moderate use of other drugs like Remedesivir and Tocilizumab, the guideline advises the former to be used only in select moderate/severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients on supplemental oxygen within 10 days of onset of disease.Tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant drug, was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and is mentioned in the guidelines on what conditions the drug should be used.What do the experts sayExperts have said Covid-19 patients on home care should not take Remdesivir medication and they should get admitted at a hospital if the oxygen level drops below 94."Remdesivir should never be taken at home. Positive attitude and regular exercise are a must for patients in home isolation, Dr Neeraj Nishchal of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had said.Informing about the use of Ivermectin and Paracetamol, Dr Manish from AIIMS said that their use depends on the immunity level and other patient-specific conditions so one should take medicines only as prescribed by the doctors.While informing about the medicines taken to fight Covid-19, he said, many patients insist on the use of Azithromycin, but the guidelines clearly discourage the use of these tablets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-drops-ivermectin-hcq-and-favipiravir-from-covid-19-treatment-list-101623058343019.html

07-06-2021||India||SC orders removal of slums from Aravalli forest land in Haryana’s Faridabad||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on Aravali forest area in Haryana’s Faridabad district, holding that there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land.The top court gave six weeks to the municipal corporation of Faridabad to complete the demolition and directed the secretary, forests department of Haryana government to file a compliance affidavit before the next date of hearing on July 27.As the municipal commission had complained of stone pelting by occupants during the demolition drive carried out in April this year, the bench directed police protection to the corporation officials visiting the site and Faridabad superintendent of police was held personally responsible for ensuring adequate logistical support for the corporation.Also Read | ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme: SC gives Centre more time to draw up modalitiesThe bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari held, “We expect that the corporation will take all essential measures to remove encroachments on the subject forest land without any exception, not later than six weeks from today and submit a compliance report in that behalf, under the signature of the chief executive officer of the corporation.”The dwellers of Khori Gaon in Faridabad had approached the Supreme Court for protection after the municipal corporation of faridabad began to demolish their houses in April this year. After nearly 300 houses were demolished, the occupants of the remaining 10,000 houses approached the top court seeking rehabilitation before their houses got demolished.The bench termed them “land grabbers” and refused to come to their aid. In the past, the top court had, on February 19, 2020, and then on April 5, 2021, directed the occupants to be cleared from forest land. On Monday, the bench reiterated, “We make it clear that the corporation shall proceed in the matter as observed in our orders dated February 19, 2020 and April 5, 2021.”As the past directions of the court were not complied with, the bench observed, “It seems like the corporation does not intend to evict (the occupants).” The corporation was represented by senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj who said that corporation officials required adequate protection as past experience showed how occupants had pelted stones at them.The bench observed, “We want a certificate from the authorities that the forest land is completely cleared of encroachment. This being forest land, there can be no concession or compromise. Either you (petitioners) vacate on your own or we will ask the municipal corporation to forcefully evict you.” The court demanded an undertaking from the petitioners to vacate the land.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, who represented the slum dwellers, argued that during a pandemic it would be difficult for such a large number of people to find alternate accommodation. He requested the court to first consider their claim for rehabilitation under the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran Rehabilitation Policy as Right to Housing is a fundamental right under Article 21 of Constitution. This scheme requires an inhabitant to be in occupation of government or government agency land as on April 1, 2003. Most of the petitioners have been living on the land in question since 2010.Gonsalves requested the court to consider tweaking the rehabilitation policy in order to accommodate the petitioners. The petition filed through advocate Satya Mitra said, “They (petitioners) have been residing on government land since 1980. Most of them, however, are unable to show any proofs of existence since then. Many of the residents today have proof of existence since 2010 onwards, when they were given ration cards and election cards and other forms of identity.”The bench said that once the certificates (of compliance) are submitted in six weeks, the court will consider passing further directions including due verification of certificates by an independent agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-removal-of-slums-from-aravalli-forest-land-in-haryana-s-faridabad-101623068974330.html

The move announced by PM Modi reverses the earlier policy of asking the states to compete for supplies for the 18-45 age group."From Monday, June 21, in every state of the country, for all citizens above the age of 18 years, the Government of India will provide free vaccines. The Government of India will procure 75% of the total vaccine production from vaccine manufacturers and give it free to the state governments," he added.In his address to the nation after April 20, PM Modi said the Centre will buy 75% of the total vaccine production from manufacturers and give it free of cost to the state governments and will also bear the responsibility of 25% of the work related to vaccination with the states.Also read: Centre to shoulder remaining 25% of vaccine work done by states, says PM Modi"This arrangement will be implemented in the coming two weeks. In these two weeks, the central and state governments will together make necessary preparations according to the new guidelines,” PM Modi said.Under the earlier policy, the Centre was providing free vaccines to the elderly and frontline workers, and left state governments and private hospitals to administer doses for a fee to people in the 18-45 age group.The decision to centralise vaccine procurement is expected to ease the burden on states scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. At least a dozen states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh rushed to float global tenders for procuring vaccines but could not achieve any confirmation from international vaccine manufacturers.India has administered 232 million doses since January 16 after launching the inoculation drive and close to 3.4% of its population is now fully immunized.It will take another 22 months to cover 75% of the population, according to Bloomberg Vaccination Tracker.India on Monday continued to see a decline in its daily infections, signalling the end of a deadly second wave after peaking on May 7 this year.

FPCE said less 10% of the ongoing projects have been completed since the law was enacted. “Not even 10% of the ongoing projects which were covered under the law have been completed even after five years of the law being implemented,” FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay said.The FPCE recently won a case against the West Bengal government which had notified its real estate law, the Housing Industry Regulatory Authority, in contravention of the Central Act. The Supreme Court had termed the West Bengal law unconstitutional.Also read: Sell properties on carpet area, not super area: H-Rera to developers“The government should also bring out a whitepaper on how many projects launched after the RERA came into existence have been completed within the given timeline. What is the average time of delay in the completion of such projects? Getting extension for completion of the project is not the birthright of builders,” Upadhyay said.Updadhya also raised questions about the authorities experimenting with new ideas, which are out of the legal framework of the law, instead of focus on bringing relief to homebuyers. He said, “It’s good progress so far as registration of 65,000 projects and disposal of 64,000 cases are concerned. But now there is a need to do more to bring relief to homebuyers, which is enshrined in the law,” Upadhyay said.He alleged that the government authorities get “out of box ideas” when it comes to providing relief or comfort to the builders.

"It has been decided that from June 21, all adults over the age of 18 will be vaccinated free," PM Modi said in a televised address.PM Modi said the Centre will buy 75 per cent of the total vaccine production from manufacturers, will also bear the responsibility of 25 per cent of the states' quota and give it free of cost to the state governments. "This arrangement will be implemented in the coming two weeks. In these two weeks, the central and state governments will together make necessary preparations according to the new guidelines,” PM Modi said.“State governments will not have to spend anything on the vaccine. Crores of people of the country have got free vaccine till now and now people of 18 years of age will also join it,” he added.The Prime Minister said private hospitals can continue to procure 25 per cent of vaccines but their charge would be capped at ₹150 per dose.Biggest pandemicPM Modi's address to the nation as cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are on the decline after a deadly surge in the last two months and several states have eased the strict restrictions.This is the biggest pandemic in the last hundred years and modern world had neither seen nor experienced such an pandemic, he said."Our country has fought together on many fronts during such a big global pandemic—from making ventilators to preparing a network of laboratories—to create a new medical infrastructure during the pandemic which has been the worst in the last century. The country fought on a war-footing,” PM said in his address.Also watch | PM Modi announces big vaccine policy change | Full speech on CovidPM Modi said India launched not one but two Made-in-India vaccines within a year as it bypassed every apprehension. The government, he said, supported the companies making the Covid-19 vaccine in every possible way. “Our country and scientists have shown that India is not behind big countries. Today when I am talking to you, more than 23 crore vaccine doses have been given in the country,” he added.Also read | There is a gender gap in India’s vaccination coverage“If you look at the history of the last 50-60 years, you will know that it used to take decades for India to get the vaccine from abroad. Vaccine work used to be completed abroad, even then the work of vaccination could not start in our country,” PM Modi said.“Compared to the demand for vaccines all over the world today, the countries producing it and the companies making the vaccine are very few. Imagine that if we did not have a vaccine made in India right now, what would have happened in a huge country like India today?” he asked.Declining casesThe PM's address comes on a day India recorded 100,636 new Covid-19 cases—the lowest in 61 days. The nationwide infection tally has risen to 28,909,975 and the death toll has gone up to 349,186.PM Modi’s last address to the nation was on April 20, when cases of the coronavirus disease were rising across the country. During that address, he said that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic had hit India "like a storm" and appealed to states to use lockdowns only as the "last resort"."In a situation like today, we have to save the country from a lockdown. If you all work together, create awareness then there is no need for containment, never mind a lockdown. I appeal to states that they should use the lockdown as the last resort. Our focus should be micro-containment zones. We will take care of economic health as well as the health of countrymen," the Prime Minister had said. “"Our effort is to save lives.

07-06-2021||India||Choksi’s complaint names mystery woman, 2 Indians as his abductors||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi has named the mystery woman, Barbara Jarabica, two Indians he identified as Narender Singh and Gurmit Singh, and “unknown persons” as his abductors in his complaint filed with the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda. Choksi has also claimed that once he was brought to Dominica, he was informed by his abductors a high ranking ‘Indian politician’ will interview him. Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said they have started investigation into Choksi’s abduction allegations even though he doesn’t believe that he was abducted, as reported by HT. In his five-page complaint, filed with the Commissioner of Police of Antigua on June 3, Choksi says he was on friendly terms with Barbara Jarabica for past one year, who initially resided opposite his residential complex at Jolly Harbour but later she shifted to Coco Bay Hotel. She was even friendly with Choksi’s staff and they used to meet regularly, often while going for walks in the evenings, Choksi says. Also Read | Mehul Choksi’s identity was known 3 days later: Dominica PoliceHT has seen the complaint. On Sunday, May 23 (the day he went missing from Antigua), Choksi’s complaint says, “Barbara asked him to deviate from the normal schedule of meeting and asked [me] to pick her up from her house, located on the road next to the marina. The businessman, wanted in India for bank fraud worth ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, adds that he reached Barbara’s residence around 5-5.15 pm where she invited him in and indicated that she had to finish her wine and told him that they will step out in a minute. The complaint says when he entered the house, 8-10 heavily muscled men appeared from all sides. “They claimed to be Antiguan police and that they know about me and have been watching me for a while,” Choksi says, adding that they wanted to take him to St John’s police station. The fugitive, currently being treated in Dominica in custody after being charged for ‘illegal entry’, has alleged he was mercilessly beaten with bare hands and tased; and that the abductors took away his Rolex watch, cell phone, and wallet having $1500. The complaint says Choksi was put on a wheelchair while he was almost in a comatose state due to the beating, a gag was put in his mouth and his face was covered. During the whole episode, he claims, Barbara didn’t even attempt to help him, which “clearly points to the fact she was an integral part of this entire scheme to kidnap me”. He was first placed in a small watercraft and then a larger boat, and when he resisted, he was threatened at knifepoint. Aboard the boat, there were two Indians and three persons of Caribbean descent. Choksi has said their appearances suggested the two Indians were highly trained mercenaries, hired specifically to abduct him. “One of the Indians said I was under observation for almost a year. They knew my intimate details about my household, such as I had a nun, where I would walk, my favorite restaurants, my daily schedule etc,” Choksi says. Another Indian, he adds, asked him detailed questions about his finances, offshore bank accounts and threatened that if the answers were not satisfactory, he and his family will face dire consequences in India. “I was also made to speak on the phone with a man who identified himself as Narender Singh. He said he was the chief agent of my case. He began to pressurize me to say I had cooperated with my captors and that I accompanied them of my own free volition which of course was not true,” Choksi’s complaint states. This person, Choksi alleges, also asked him to leave Barbara out of whole issue as it will lead to a public scandal. Choksi claims the boat reached Dominica 15-17 hours after his ordeal began, which was roughly 9:30-10 am Antigua time (May 24). “..I was told that I have been brought to this special location to give an interview to a high-ranking Indian politician. He also told me that my citizenship would be ‘fixed’ in Dominica and that I would soon be repatriated to India,” the complaint reads. Choksi has said he was received by a battery of police officers in Dominica, including chief of police, who informed him he was arrested on the basis of Interpol red notice. In Roseau police station, the complaint claims, Choksi was kept in a cell barely 20 square metres in size and was denied medical treatment or legal representation, saying “we don’t do that here with prisoners”. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said,“Truth and false both are five letter words and not even a single letter is common. My client Mr Choksi, by giving detailed narration of events, has stated his truth, now false, which was state-sponsored, will get exposed if investigated honestly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksis-complaint-names-mystery-woman-2-indians-as-his-abductors-101623065374643.html

Without naming Ramdev's Patanjali, IMA also sought the immediate curtailment of attempts by any person to fool the public and promote ‘magic remedies’ or ‘wonder drugs’ without the Union health ministry’s approval. The doctors' body has been in a squabble with Ramdev over his comments on modern medicine and has also threatened legal action against the yoga guru.As several states and Union territories (UTs) have suspended vaccination for the 18-44 years age group, the IMA requested PM Modi that the Centre should promote universal free vaccination without leaving the doses to the extent of 50% to states and private hospitals. “We believe that only when a strong leader like you leads this programme, the full benefit shall reach out to all people.”Also Read| Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address nation at 5pmThe IMA also said that doctors who have lost their lives while treating patients of the Covid-19 disease ought to be recognised as Covid-19 martyrs with due acknowledgement of their sacrifice and their families ought to be supported by the Centre.India has so far recorded 28,909,975 cases, 349,186 deaths and 27,159,180 recoveries due to the Covid-19 disease.

07-06-2021||India||'PM-CARES for Children' scheme: SC gives Centre more time to draw up modalities||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the central government more time to appraise the court regarding the modalities of the recently launched 'PM CARES for Children' scheme, launched for the welfare of children orphaned by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The national commission of protection of child rights (NCPCR) said that the governments in certain states and union territories are not cooperating and have not provided the latest data on the number of children who have lost their parents due to coronavirus.The scheme includes various measures such as including providing a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of ₹10 lakh when the beneficiary child turns 18 years old. The fixed deposits will be opened in the names of such children.On June 1, the top court had asked the central government to provide information on the 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme, launched on May 29 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and directed states to appoint nodal officers to appraise it on identification and welfare measures for such children.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the NCPCR, told the Supreme Court bench on Monday that it was facing difficulties with West Bengal and Delhi, who are not uploading the data of such children on ‘Bal Swaraj’. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, that they are in consultation with states and ministries to work out the modalities of the 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme. “We need some more time to appraise the court about the modalities of the scheme as the consultation is still going on. We have made district magistrates directly responsible for the children who have been abandoned or have been orphaned,” Bhati said.Responding to the NCPCR's claims, the Delhi government, represented by Advocate Chirag Shroff, said their data is provided solely by Child Welfare Committees (CWC), while in other states different departments provide data to the district magistrates from where it is uploaded. The Delhi government last week wrote to different departments like revenue and police and sought data from them, he said.To this, the Supreme Court bench responded by saying that Delhi should have a task force at the district level like other states and upload the information as soon as they get it without waiting for court orders to attend to the immediate needs of the children.The bench pulled up the West Bengal counsel and asked it how can the state government not understand the court's order stating that information regarding children, who have been orphaned after March 2020, is needed.“All states have understood the directive properly but how can only West Bengal not understand the order,” the bench said, adding that the state has to direct the authorities concerned to provide all the data about the children.In an earlier affidavit, the NCPCR had said that as per the data given by states so far, 9,346 children have either lost both or one of their parents to the deadly virus. As many as 1,742 children have lost both of their parents and 7,464 have lost one of the parents, the child rights body had said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmcares-for-children-scheme-sc-gives-centre-more-time-to-draw-up-modalities-101623058445744.html
07-06-2021||India||As states begin unlocking, returning migrants struggle to find work||Dinesh Rathore from Muzaffarpur in Bihar returned to Delhi nearly after two and a half months of staying in his native village during the lockdown in the national capital amid the rising Covid cases in April.“I am the sole bread earner of my family. There are younger brothers and parents back at home to feed. All my savings, from my daily wages of ₹300 wages, were over during this year’s lockdown,” says Rathore.As lockdown restrictions have started easing in many migrant worker receiving states such as Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, workers have begun returning in search of work.Also Watch |‘Jahan vote, wahan vaccination’: Kejriwal announces mega vaccination campaign“Our village has hundreds of people who come to Delhi for work. We heard that work here would resume by May-end so I returned with a brother of mine, hoping to find him work too. But there is really no work here. For 10 days, we have been approaching different factories to give us work. I am skilled at iron smithing and welding work as well, but they are not allowing strangers to enter the factories,” he says, adding that the siblings are left with very little ration.Another migrant labourer, Pavan Sahni, who belongs to Poornia in Bihar, returned to Neemrana in Rajasthan where he worked earlier, but he says not much has changed. With a wife and three kids to support, Sahni earlier sold ice-creams that a local factory gave him along with a refrigerated cart. He got paid ₹2 rupees per piece sold. “I used to earn over ₹400 a day but people are now wary of buying food from small-time vendors like me and the police also don’t allow us to station the cart in streets, leave alone major roads,” he says.“There is a place called Labour Chowk here where migrant workers assemble in the morning and people looking for labourers hire them for ₹300 a day. My friend and I got work only twice,” he saysSahni adds there has been a rush of labourers to the chowk as the news [of police allowing labourers to wait for work] spread. “I am jobless again. These ₹600 rupees are all that I have earned since I came back for work. I could not even earn enough to pay for the rent of the room where my family stays,” he says.Gulzar Ahmad from Jharkhand had also returned home from Goa as the state imposed a lockdown in April. Most of the labourers in his village worked in Goa as labourers and housekeeping staff in hotels but now, they are choosing to go to other states, not Goa.“Since the lockdown, not many tourists are going there and most of the hotels are closed. Some of my friends left for Hyderabad yesterday as someone assured them on the phone that he needed workers. They are not sure about it but it is better to search than stay idle or even go to Goa where everything is shut,” he said.He added that the weather in states such as Karnataka, Goa, and Kerala is also not conducive, post-Cyclone Yaas.“There has been a severe cyclone recently and that has impacted work availability as well,” he says.Gayatri Sahgal from Stranded worker action network (SWAN), a volunteer group working for migrant workers, says that the government has been negligent and has been giving false assurances of support to them.HT has already reported on the defunct government helplines which include contact numbers of 100 labour commissioners meant to help these workers with ration, non-payment of wages, basic financial assistance, protection from eviction by landlords and travel support for workers to get back home. Some of these commissioners tasked for this did not even know that their numbers were listed as helplines.Sahgal says unlock has not been planned well, adding that migrant workers trying to get back to work need some basic financial assistance to survive till they find work .She adds that while Delhi is lending ration of 4 kgs of wheat and 1 kg rice, migrant workers may not have support in places they wish to go for work. “The extension of ration to non-PDS card holders should be done on a war footing. While the government might claim stock assessment issues as migrant workers are not a static population in any one state, there are some well researched surveys of this patterned migration which could give them an average number of labourers in each state,” she says.“We have better models of reducing migrant distress, like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), available with us. Their extended implementation is needed, especially when the urban economy has suffered so much,” she says adding the government should also start projects in urban localities which could cater to the welfare of such workers. MGNREGA provides at least 100 days of daily wage employment every year to unemployed people for those adults who volunteer to do unskilled manual work, according to its official website.A labour ministry spokesperson admitted to HT that there have been complaints from workers who are unable to find work despite easing of lockdown curbs and that most factories are refusing to let them in, but the government was yet to chalk out any plan to address the issue.There also wasn’t a response from Central Labour Commissioner DPS Negi on how the government was planning to re-integrate these workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-curbs-eased-returning-migrants-continue-to-struggle-for-work-101623058233660.html

In its editorial published on Monday the Shiv Sena said Twitter has “become a burden” for the government which they want to “throw away”."Earlier, Twitter was the soul of political struggle or campaign for the BJP or the Modi government. Twitter has now become a burden for them and the Modi government has reached the extent of deciding whether to throw this burden away. Today, all the media in the country is under the complete control of the Modi government, except the mediums like Twitter." the editorial stated.Alleging the social media platform was being used for “mudslinging” and “character assassination” during the 2014 election campaign and that the ruling party was more active online than it was on the ground at that time."In the last few years, a campaign of mud hurling, character assassination is being run on social media. No political party other than BJP knew how to make full use of it. In 2014, the BJP had mastered this task. In the campaign of that time, the BJP army was more active in the cyber world and less on the ground.”"Under what rules did the objectionable words used for Rahul Gandhi on Twitter and Facebook? What are the adjectives used for a senior leader like Dr Manmohan Singh? From Uddhav Thackeray, who has spent life in politics and social service to politicians like Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar, Priyanka Gandhi, Mulayam Singh Yadav, etc, character assassination campaign was launched against opposition leaders," questioned Saamana.The editorial further states that the opposition has now learned how to effectively use Twitter and are taking on the BJP in states like West Bengal and Bihar creating panic within the ranks of the ruling party."As long as these attacks were going on in a one-sided manner, the BJP members were happy, but when the opposition launched attacks by deploying equally capable cyber forces, then there was panic in the BJP camp. In West Bengal polls, Trinamool Congress' Mohua Moitra and Derek O'Brien injured the BJP with the double-edged sword of Twitter. In the Bihar elections, Tejashwi Yadav exposed Modi and Nitish Kumar through Twitter," the editorial said.The editorial also talks about the government’s mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic which was amplified by social media platforms like Twitter, stating that the images of "dead bodies flowing in the Ganges, pyre burning continuously in Varanasi and Gujarat, ambulance queues outside the crematoriums reached the world and the working style of the BJP government was exposed".Twitter and the Centre have been at loggerheads over the new information technology rules. Twitter was sent “last notice” asking it to comply with the new IT rules, issued as a “gesture of goodwill” on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-once-the-soul-of-bjp-s-political-struggle-has-now-become-a-burden-shiv-sena-101623057737778.html

They had moved to court seeking protection from the family members of the girl. The order was passed by the bench on June 3.The court was informed that upon learning about the relationship between the girl and her partner, her parents wanted her to marry a person of their choice, following which the girl left her paternal home to live with her partner. They have decided to live together till the time they are legally allowed to solemnise their marriage, they submitted.Also read: Live-in couples entitled to protection, rules Punjab and Haryana HCOn denying protection to people who opt for live-in relationships with dire consequences, the court said, "It would be a travesty of justice in case protection is denied to persons who have opted to reside together without the sanctity of marriage and such persons have to face dire consequences at the hands of persons whom protection is sought.""In case, such a course is adopted and protection denied, the court would also be failing in their duty to provide its citizens a right to their life and liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to uphold to the Rule of Law," the court observed.Spotlighting the killings by families in the name of 'honour', the court said, "At this stage one cannot lose sight of honour killings which are prevalent in northern parts of India, particularly in parts of states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.""Honour killing is a result of people marrying without their family's acceptance, and sometimes for marrying outside their caste or religion. Once an individual, who is a major, has chosen his/her partner, it is not for any other person, be it a family member, to object and cause a hindrance to their peaceful existence. It is for the State at this juncture, to ensure their protection and their personal liberty," the bench said.Also read: Runaway couples seeking protection share their ordealThe court underlined that the petitioners have not asked the court for permission to marry or to approve their relationship.Observing that such a relationship does not amount to offence, the court said, "The concept of a live-in relationship may not be acceptable to all, but it cannot be said that such a relationship is an illegal one or that living together without the sanctity of marriage constitutes an offence."The court further added that once an individual, who is a major, has chosen his/her partner, it is not for any other person, be it a family member, to object and cause a hindrance to their peaceful existence. “It is for the State at this juncture, to ensure their protection and their personal liberty," the bench added.Notably, the Supreme Court has granted protection to a live-in couple in Tarn Taran, whose petition was dismissed by high court on May 11 observing that they in the garb of filing the petition are seeking seal of approval on their relationship, which is “morally and socially not acceptable” and no protection order in the petition can be passed.The apex court in its order on June 4 granted protection observing, “Needless to state that since it concerns life and liberty, the Superintendent of Police is required to act expeditiously in accordance with law, including the grant of any protection to the petitioners in view of the apprehensions/ threats, uninfluenced by the observations of the High Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-live-in-relationship-not-for-us-to-judge-couple-s-decision-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-101623042696651.html

07-06-2021||India||These drugs, test have been dropped for Covid-19 treatment. Details here||In revised guidelines for managing patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union ministry of health and family welfare has dropped all medicines, except those for fever and cold, for asymptomatic and mild cases. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) under the health ministry has stressed the importance of following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour—wearing of a mask and following physical distancing, hand hygiene and cough etiquettes— and said they must be followed by asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe patients.Drugs droppedDGHS in the revised guidelines, issued on May 27, has dropped all drugs including hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, multivitamins, etc prescribed by the doctors to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients. Doctors have also been asked not to prescribe unnecessary tests to Covid-19 patients such as CT scans.Also read | India's daily Covid cases and deaths drop to 100,636 and 2427; tally nears 29 mnIn mild cases, the guidelines said, patients should self-monitor for fever, breathlessness, oxygen saturation (SpO2) or worsening of any symptoms. It said people may take antipyretic and anti-tussive for symptomatic relief, and inhalation of budesonide at a dose of 800mcg twice daily for five days for a cough. “No other Covid-19 specific medication required. The patient may have to be investigated further if symptoms persist or deteriorate.”Also read | Covid-19 origins: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in newsNo medication is required for asymptomatic cases and those with comorbidities who need to continue taking their prescribed medicines, the guidelines said. DGHS has advised people experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus disease to follow a healthy, balanced diet and keep themselves hydrated. Guidelines for use of remdesivir1. Remdesivir is to be used only in select moderate or severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients on supplemental oxygen within 10 days of onset of disease. 2. It is not for mild Covid-19 patients who are at home or in Covid Care Centres. 3. It must be advised by senior faculty members or specialists directly involved in patient’s care. 4. If it has to be advised or ordered during odd hours, it should be done by the duty doctor after telephonic consultation with a senior faculty member/specialist/ unit in - charge.Guidelines for use of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill patients1. If the patient shows no signs of improvement in terms of oxygen requirement even after 24-48 hours of administration of steroids, tocilizumab can be prescribed.2. It can also be prescribed when the patient has significantly raised inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein≥75 mg/L) 3. However, it must be ensured that the patient is free of any bacterial/fungal/ tuberculous infection at the time of administration of Tocilizumab. Guidelines for use of steroids1. Steroids are harmful in asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid-19. 2. Steroids are indicated in only hospitalised, moderately severe and critically ill Covid-19 cases. 3. Self-medication of steroids must be avoided. 4. Monitoring of blood glucose is mandatory in all patients put on steroids as it may precipitate hyperglycaemia.Guidelines for use of anti-coagulants1. Prophylactic doses to be used in moderate cases of Covid-19 with un-fractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin.2. There should be no contraindication or high risk of bleeding. 3. Doses to be used in severe cases with un-fractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin.4. Therapeutic dose to be used only if there is evidence of thromboembolism or obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot that has become dislodged from another area in the circulation. 5. There should be no contraindication or high risk of bleeding.Guidelines on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan1. Nearly two-thirds of those with asymptomatic Covid-19 have abnormalities on HRCT chest imaging which are nonspecific. Most of them do not progress clinically. 2. HRCT imaging of the chest done in the first week of Covid-19 might often underestimate the extent of lung involvement, giving a false sense of security. 3. Correlation between extent of lung involvement by HRCT and hypoxia—when the body or a particular region is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level—is imperfect. 4. The guidelines said that often, young people with extensive lung involvement will not develop hypoxia but elderly individuals with minimal or less extensive lung involvement may develop hypoxia. 5. Radiation exposure due to repeated HRCT imaging may be associated with risk of cancer later in life.(Source: DGHS statement)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-drugs-test-have-been-dropped-for-covid-19-treatment-details-here-101623054672831.html
07-06-2021||India||Isro develops three types of ventilators to battle Covid-19||The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has developed three types of ventilators and has come forward to transfer the technology to industry for clinical usage as the country battles the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.A low-cost and portable critical care ventilator, 'Prana' ("Programmable Respiratory Assistance for the Needy Aid') is based on the automated compression of an Ambu (Artificial Manual Breathing Unit) bag.The system has a sophisticated control system that includes an airway pressure sensor, flow sensor, oxygen sensor, servo actuator as well as expiration and Peep (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) control valves, according to an interest exploration note posted on the website of Bengaluru- headquartered space agency.The clinicians can select the ventilation mode and set the required parameters through a touch screen panel and monitor various parameters like pressure, flow, tidal volume, and oxygen concentration on the same screen.The ventilator can deliver the required flow of oxygen-air mixture to the patient's lung at the desired rate set by the clinicians.It has a provision to attach an external battery for backup during power failure.Isro said Prana supports both invasive and non-invasive ventilation modes and is capable of giving mandatory breaths (controlled by ventilator) as well as spontaneous breaths (controlled by the patient).A robust algorithm for controlled and safe ventilation of the patient is implemented which raises alarm and opens safety valves to prevent barotrauma, asphyxia, and apnoea during the ventilation.An alarm is also raised in case of wrong or improper connection of the ventilation circuit or inadvertent disconnection of the hose or sensors.There are also provisions to attach bacterial viral filters at each interface to prevent cross-infection and the contamination of air.The ICU grade positive pressure mechanical ventilator titled 'VaU' (abbreviation of Ventilation assist Unit) can assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients under respiratory distress, Isro said.VaU is based on a centrifugal blower that draws in filtered ambient air, compresses it, and delivers it to the patient to achieve ventilation and can therefore operate without a compressed pneumatic source.Provision is also given in the ventilator to connect a high-pressure oxygen source, from which oxygen is metered automatically, to achieve the desired oxygen concentration (FiO2) in the inspiratory flow.The microcontroller-based control module in the ventilator acquires signals from an array of sensors and commands the electro-pneumatic components to effect closed-loop control.VaU also comes with an intuitive Human Machine Interface (HMI) System running on a medical-grade touch screen PC, which allows the operator to set and monitor various ventilation parameters in real-time.A power supply unit, which can operate with 230VAC or an internal battery pack, is used to power the electro-pneumatic components, controller, and the HMI system of the ventilator.VaU has been configured to operate in a variety of patient/ventilator-triggered invasive and non-invasive ventilation modes and has provisions to detect fault conditions and raise alarms through the HMI system to alert the operator.Gas-powered ventilator 'Space Ventilator Aided System for Trauma Assistance (SVASTA)', a basic model for non-invasive ventilation, is well-suited for emergency use for first-line treatment and as transit ventilators inside vehicles, according to Isro.The basic design is simple, and the components can be easily mass-produced for emergency use in pandemic-like situations.This ventilator, which runs on compressed air, is able to perform various ventilation conditions using manual mechanical settings.The system is capable of pressure control ventilation (PCV) in its basic mode of operation with the provision for setting different tidal volumes.The basic ventilator design can be re-engineered appropriately by the manufacturer to cater to various modes of ventilation with control systems, electronics, and associated software, it was stated.The prototype of the three ventilators developed at Thiruvananthapuram-based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), a major space research center of Isro, has undergone in-house test & evaluation and meets various specifications.The responsibility of obtaining mandatory certification from approving agencies of the government of India before clinical usage vests with the industry, the Isro note said.Isro said it intends to transfer the technology of these three ventilators to PSUs/ industries/ start-ups having a good track record in the manufacture of critical medical/ electronic equipment manufacturing.It invited Interested industries/ entrepreneurs to submit their expression of interest before June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-develops-three-types-of-ventilators-to-battle-covid19-101623053775130.html

An official said these are troops returning after election duties in four states and a Union Territory.Officials said around 300 companies of troops, especially the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), had left the Valley on election duties.So far, 70 of them have returned while others are on their way back.Also Read | Govt comfortable with non-political setup in J&K: Lone“It’s nothing unusual. Approximately 300 of Central Armed Police Forces had moved out of our security grid for the recent assembly elections . So far, only 70 companies have returned,” said a senior police officer who is privy to details and oversees the security grid in Kashmir.The unusual movement of troops, especially in north Kashmir, has led to speculation that the Centre may be planning a move similar to that of August 5, 2019, when Article 370 giving special status to J&K was nullified and the state divided into two Union Territories.Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said, “We want to believe even in rumours rumoured to be rumours. We love rumours, don’t we? Last few days have been all about rumours and conspiracies. They say don’t believe a rumour to b true until govt actually denies it,” he tweeted.National Conference leader Tanveer Sadiq, who was also the political advisor of former J&K chief secretary, also raised concerns about the rumours, wondering if mainstream leaders could again be arrested and lodged in MLA hostel. “While rumours are flying thick and fast -- should we be ready for second semester? MLA’s hostel 2.0?,” he tweeted.Senior BJP leader and former legislator Sofi Yousuf rubbished rumours that J&K will be further bifurcated. “Once things are normal, J&K will get back its statehood. These are rumours that J&K will see further division,” he said.Meanwhile, J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha is in Delhi, along with top senior officers, and has held several meetings in the past two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-troop-movement-in-j-k-as-capf-companies-return-from-poll-duty-101623054453385.html

This will be the first visit from the Indian side to Kuwait since Sheikh Nawaf became the oil-rich nation’s new ruler last September, following the death of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. Kuwaiti foreign minister Ahmed Nasser al-Mohammed al-Sabah had visited India in March. Jaishankar’s official visit is part of continuous efforts between officials of the two countries to “strengthen the already strong and solid bilateral relations and push them towards better levels”, a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Also Read | Adar Poonawalla thanks Biden, Jaishankar for US policy changeThe external affairs minister is expected to carry a letter from the Indian Prime Minister regarding bilateral relations and ways to enhance them, the person added. During foreign minister Ahmad Nasser’s visit to India in mid-March, the two sides announced the establishment of a joint commission, chaired by the foreign ministers. A number of joint working groups would be established under the joint commission to enhance cooperation in fields such as trade, investment, economic affairs, petrochemicals, defence and culture. The two foreign ministers have also exchanged a number of phone calls within a short period of time since a second wave of Coronavirus infections hit India, during which the Kuwaiti minister reiterated his country’s commitment to stand with India in these difficult times and to provide relief materials, especially oxygen, the person cited above said. Jaishankar has expressed India’s appreciation for the support extended by Kuwait by providing relief materials and medical oxygen through ships that is still continuing. Under an air and sea bridge arrangement, Indian Navy ships are carrying large oxygen tanks from Kuwait ports to Indian ports, and Indian Air Force aircraft then transport the empty tanks back to Kuwait for refilling. The joint commission created earlier this year was aimed at institutionalising bilateral ties in areas ranging from energy to defence and to forge a framework for future cooperation. It will act as an umbrella for all bilateral institutional engagements such as foreign office consultations and joint working groups. Apart from existing working groups on hydrocarbons, manpower and mobility, and healthcare, new groups would be created on trade and investment, defence and security, and maritime cooperation. India is among the largest trading partners of Kuwait, and bilateral trade was worth $10.86 billion during 2019-20. India’s imports, mainly oil, were worth $9.6 billion during this period. Kuwait was the 10th largest oil supplier to India during 2019-20 and met 3.8% of the country’s energy needs. Kuwait is also home to nearly 900,000 Indian expatriates. The Indian government had supplied 200,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Kuwait in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-visit-kuwait-on-june-9-carry-pm-s-message-101623053853225.html

While Capital Delhi began a second phase of unlock from a lockdown which has been in place since April 19, Maharashtra -- with the highest Covid-19 caseload -- began a "five-tier" unlock from lockdown-like restrictions. The state's capital, India's financial hub Mumbai, has been categorised under level three.When PM Modi last addressed the nation, on April 20, daily Covid-19 cases were nearing the 300,000-mark while more than 2,000 deaths were being recorded in a single-day. In the following days, the daily cases rose to more than 300,000 and subsequently 400,000 while single-day fatalities were close to or above 4,000.In recent days, however, the daily cases and deaths have both seen a steady dip; fresh infections, though, continue to be the above the 100,000-mark. On Monday morning, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) data showed an addition of 100,636 cases and 2427 related deaths. This was the lowest single-day rise in more than two months, or 61 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-nation-at-5pm-101623052534631.html

Of the 425 Covishield and 90 Covaxin recipients, 98.1% and 80.0% respectively, showed seropositivity. However, both seropositivity rate and median (IQR) rise in anti-spike antibody was significantly higher in Covishield vs. Covaxin recipient...”Also Read | Will Indian students in US be asked to get vaccines again? All you need to knowIn effect, while both vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses, although seropositivity rates and median anti-spike antibody titre was significantly higher in Covishield compared to Covaxin arm.Both the vaccines studied are currently being given under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme in India.According to the study, overall combined results of both vaccines showed 95% seropositivity to anti-spike antibody, 21-36 days after the second dose.Serum Institute of India (SII) is locally producing Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The primary aim of the researchers was to analyse antibody response (seropositivity rate and median [inter-quartile range, IQR] antibody titre) following each dose of both vaccines and its correlation to age, sex, blood group, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities.“While no difference was observed in relation to sex, BMI, blood group and any comorbidities; people over 60 years or age or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rates.”The research was led by Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh, consultant endocrinologist, GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute, KolKata, West Bengal.However, fewer post-vaccination infections, also known as breakthrough infection, were seen in health care workers who took Covaxin, corroborating the other possibility of the vaccine having better cell-mediated response.“Breakthrough infections (defined as SARS-CoV-2 infection >2 weeks after the second dose) were reported in 4.9% (24/492) of cases following both vaccines. Breakthrough infections were noted in 5.5% (22/399) cohorts in Covishield and 2.2% (2/93) of Covaxin recipients. Majority had mild (28/30) to moderate (2/30) Covid-19 infections and all recovered,” found the study.The phase II trial results of Covaxin published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases showed enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.According to a paper on immunology published in ScienceDirect, cell mediated immunity does not involve antibodies but rather incorporates the activation of macrophages (a type of white blood cell of the immune system that engulfs anything that doesn’t have, on its surface, proteins that are specific to healthy body cells) and natural killer cells enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-immune-response-from-covishield-and-covaxin-study-101623051633436.html

After the release, farmers who were staging a sit-in outside the Tohana police station in the Fatehabad district, withdrew. "We have decided to no longer gherao the Tohana police station. One more person is still in jail and a meeting is underway with the police administration to release him," Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said, according to news agency ANI.Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar were arrested on June 1 following their demonstration against JJP leader Devendra S Babli. During the protest, the farmers gheraoed Babli and shouted slogans against him and showed him black flags. Later, the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) filed a first information report (FIR) alleging that some of the protesters resorted to unruly behaviour and vandalised his car.After this, the farmers also demanded that Babli should be booked for allegedly using abusive language against the farmers and threatening them during the spat.On Saturday, the JJP leader released a video and apologised for his comments. “I forgive those involved in the June 1 incident and apologise for my comments at the time,” he said. Babli also said that he would withdraw the cases filed against Azad and Sisar.The farmers' protest against the three contentious central farm laws completed six months in May as thousands of agriculturists continue to sit at the Delhi borders demanding the Centre to repeal the legislation. Despite several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer leaders last year, the deadlock still remains.They are protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Meanwhile, Tikait is scheduled to meet West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on June 9 to discuss the agitation. Mamata Banerjee has been very vocal against the farm laws and gave her support to farmers' protest. Several TMC lawmakers also visited the Delhi borders where farmers have been protesting since November last year.During the recently-held Bengal assembly elections, Tikait visited the state and campaigned for Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-police-release-2-farmers-meeting-underway-for-third-protester-101623045976086.html
07-06-2021||India||Lakshadweep residents on hunger strike to protest ‘partisan’ regulations||Lakshadweep residents are on a 12-hour hunger strike on Monday to protest against three proposed rules governing tourism, cattle and panchayat elections, which they fear will destroy the unique culture and tradition of the island, home to around 70,000 residents.The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body floated to channelise mounting protests against the rules, said local residents will fast in their homes and all shops and establishments, except emergency services, will stay closed from 6am to 6pm during the first major protest in the archipelago in the Arabian Sea. The island administration, led by Praful Khoda Patel, has warned of strict action under the pandemic laws to deter crowding at public places. “This is the first time all islands are observing such a protest. Though we have been assured repeatedly that local sentiments will be heard and addressed, the administrator is going ahead with his partisan and retrograde decisions,” said UCK Thangal, one of the convenors of the forum.Residents of Lakhadweep, an archipelago in Arabian Sea comprising 37 tiny islands—including 11 inhabited by humans--- have been protesting against Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination. Residents allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category. They are also protesting against Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, which proposes to ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of the cattle, meant in island environments. Most of the Lakshadweep residents are Muslims and they feel the regulations target their food habits. The residents are also opposing the Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021, which proposes disqualification of candidates with more than two children in the gram panchayat elections.Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats and artists have described the draft regulations as “arbitrary” and insensitive towards the majority community of the islands. Last week, the Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator, and on Sunday, 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and urged him to protect the unique culture and tradition of the islands.A convenor of the Save Lakshadweep Forum, Thangal said 34 administrators have governed the UT since its formation in 1956 but a situation like this never arose. “Anger and fear have gripped the island like never before. Hope the Union government will realise the gravity of the situation and take corrective measures,” he said, adding the future course of protests will be decided after Monday. The letter to the PM written by the group of former bureaucrats alleges the draft regulations not only ignore the unique geography and community life of islands, but it also gives “arbitrary and draconian powers” to the administrator to acquire, alter, transfer and remove or relocate islanders from their property. They also pointed out that the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act) is quite unwarranted and uncalled for. “According to the National Crime Records Bureau the crime rate in the island is very low compared to the rest of India, it has generated fear that the real purpose of the regulation is to smother dissent or protests against the policies and actions of the administrator,” the letter said.They said the proposed regulations were presently with the Union home ministry for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-residents-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-partisan-regulations-101623042692802.html

These are forest areas, and we don’t have roads and proper ways of transport to reach the border area. But on Mizoram’s side, they have constructed roads to reach the border areas. There are some abandoned houses in Assam along the border and two of them were burnt by miscreants on Friday night,” police superintendent (SP) Ramandeep Kaur said.She added that while two cases have been registered and efforts were on to find the culprits, the border dispute issue needs to be solved by officials at a “higher level”.Last year too, several houses were burnt along the border, forcing around 50 families to move from Gutgutia-Gallacher; their abandoned houses were burnt on Friday night. Similarly, several houses were burnt, two government schools bombed and one person was killed in Cachar district’s Dholai constituency last year. Three districts of Assam’s Barak Valley, Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi, share a 164.6 kms border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. Despite several rounds of talks, the Assam-Mizoram border dispute is yet to be resolved.The border area in Hailakandi falls under Katlicherra assembly constituency represented by Suzam Uddin Laskar, who visited the site and appealed to chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma to resolve the matter immediately. Hailakandi deputy commissioner Rohan Kumar Jha and Ramandeep Kaur visited the area on Saturday and Sunday and assured the locals that their lives and properties will be protected. “We have also tried to talk to the officials in Mizoram administration. There was fear among the people in the past... We have deployed our team in border areas and there will be a strict vigil from now on,” DIG (deputy inspector general) Southern Assam Range, Debojyoti Mukherjee said. Last year the issue had escalated to result in a standoff with a group in Dholai blocking the national highway connecting the two states for 11 days, which was partially resolved after Centre’s intervention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-tension-along-assam-mizoram-border-after-2-huts-burnt-by-miscreants-101623036992526.html

The state, which added 618 deaths (including 385 from reconciliation of figures) to its tally on Sunday, contributes nearly 29% (28.87%) to the country’s Covid-19 fatality count. Maharashtra has seen 100,130 deaths due to Covid-19 so far.If Maharashtra were a country, it would have ranked 10th in the world, just after France (109,973 deaths) and before Colombia (91,422), in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to data collated by worldometer. The United States of America (612,209) tops the list of fatalities, followed by Brazil (472,629). India ranks third (346,784).Also Read | Delhi unlock: Markets, shops reopen on ‘odd-even’ basis after nearly 2 monthsIn India, the gap between the state with the most fatalities and the second-most affected state is of 68,800 deaths. Karnataka, as per the data of the ministry of health and family welfare, ranks second with 31,260 fatalities.The state breached the 10,000-mark in Covid-19 fatalities on July 11, 2020, and went on to add 10,000 deaths every month till it crossed the 40,000-mark on October 10. As the first wave receded, the deaths were fewer between October and January.It took 91 days to go from 40,000 to 50,000 deaths, which happened on January 9, 2021. Subsequently, it took 99 days to cross the 60,000-mark. In the past 50 days alone, the state had added nearly 40,000 deaths. On April 18, the state breached the 60,000-mark in Covid deaths. Since then, it has added 39,657 fatalities. Officials and experts attribute the high number of deaths to more Covid-19 cases and transparent reporting of data. They added that lack of treatment protocol, logistics issues have also contributed to some of the deaths in both the waves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-crosses-grim-mark-of-100-000-covid-19-deaths-101623035792737.html

The state's sex ratio is 840, against the national average of 899, the SDG showed.The best performer in this category was Chhattisgarh, where male-to-female ratio at birth stood at 958 - much above the national average - the Niti Aayog report further showed. Kerala is at the second place with a sex ratio of 957.States like Punjab and Haryana, which have seen low sex ratios, have improved their position. While Haryana recorded birth of 843 females per 1000 males, in Punjab the number has reached 890.Overall, Kerala was the top performer with a score of 75 in the Niti Aayog index, while Bihar was adjudged to be the worst-performing state with a score of 52.The country's overall SDG score improved by 6 points - from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2020-21.This positive stride towards achieving the targets is largely driven by exemplary country-wide performance in clean water and sanitation, and affordable and clean energy, the Niti Aayog said in a statement.The SDG index evaluates progress of states and UTs on social, economic and environmental parametres.First launched in December 2018, the index has become the primary tool for monitoring progress on the SDGs in the country and has simultaneously fostered competition among the states and union territories by ranking them on the global goals.The index, developed in collaboration with the United Nations in India, measures the progress at the national and sub-national level in the country's journey towards meeting the global goals and targets.In the first edition, it covered 13 goals, 39 targets and 62 indicators. In the second edition, the SDG index measured 17 goals, 54 targets and 100 indicators in the second. This year's edition (the third one) covered 17 goals, 70 targets and 115 indicators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-has-lowest-child-sex-ratio-in-the-country-niti-aayog-s-sdg-index-101623035143233.html

Protesting doctors also raised slogans demanding justice for junior doctors of MP and held placards of the AIIMS Delhi Resident Doctors' Association and the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FRDA)."We are enraged to learn about the atrocities and callousness of the government of Madhya Pradesh," said representatives of the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) in a statement.

These booths will start operating in all 75 districts of the state from Monday.The decision was taken after a review meeting chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday.The state government has directed the districts to initiate at least two women special booths for focused immunity-booster drives. While one booth will cater to women between the age of 18 and 44, the other one to those above the age of 45.The Uttar Pradesh government has given instructions to set up these camps are in district women hospitals or district joint hospital. If there is a need, such camps can be set up in tehsils as well, as per the government order.Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, crossed the milestone of administering 2 crore (2,02,34,598 to be exact) cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses. It has so far inoculated 30 lakh people in the age group of 18-44, which is the highest in the country for this category.The chief minister said at the review meeting that the vaccination drive must be expanded to counter the third wave of Covid-19, which many experts say is expected to strike in weeks to come.“Till now we have administered more than 2 crore doses of vaccine against the coronavirus. In view of the huge population of Uttar Pradesh, we have to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination. We must now work upon expanding the 'Mission June' target by three times in July,” Adityanath said.Under 'Mission June', Uttar Pradesh has set a target of administering one crore vaccine doses in one month. The chief minister has asked for it to be increased three times for July so that 10 crore people can be given Covid-19 vaccine in the next three months. And on order to do that, at least 10 lakh people need to be administered the doses every day.“A district-wise strategy should be prepared to meet the target of 10 lakh doses a day in July. There is no shortage of vaccine. With the courtesy of the central government, many new vaccines will be available soon," said CM Adityanath said on Sunday.He added that about one lakh additional vaccinators should be trained, including the nursing students, in order to achieve the target.Around 22.80 crore people have been given vaccine doses across India and Uttar Pradesh accounts for 8.9 per cent of the total doses. In the last 24 hours, 3.88 lakh people received vaccine shots in the state, according to government data.Uttar Pradesh's Covid-19 caseload surged to 16,98,389 on Sunday with 1,165 fresh infections while the death toll climbed to 21,252 as 101 more people succumbed to the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-uttar-pradesh-to-launch-special-pink-booths-for-women-101623023116102.html
07-06-2021||India||After 41 days, Odisha’s daily TPR dips below 10% but rising deaths trigger concern||For the first time in the last 41 days of the second wave of Covid-19 infections, Odisha’s daily test positivity rate dropped below 10 per cent raising hopes of quick decline in cases and an end to lockdown in the state.On Sunday, Odisha reported 7,002 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours from a test sample of 71,973 with a positivity rate of 9.72, the first time daily TPR dropped below 10% after going above it on April 26 when 6,073 people tested positive. However, the number of deaths remained high as 42 fatalities were reported over the last 24 hours. The number of daily fatalities has been over 40 for the last 5 days.Director of Health Services Bijay Mohapatra said the declining TPR and number of cases showed that Odisha was seeing a decline in transmission. “From 24 per cent 3 weeks ago to less than 10 is a good sign. If the fall continues to be like this the state government can slowly lift lockdown in a phased manner. Hopefully by the end of this month we would be in a comfortable position. Odisha government’s 3T formula- Tracking, Testing and Tracing to contain Covid-19 is succeeding,” said Mohapatra. Odisha on May 30 had extended its lockdown and complete weekend shutdown in the entire state to June 17.The decline in daily TPR notwithstanding, at least 19 of the 30 districts in the state continued to have weekly average TPR of over 10 per cent between May 30 and June 5 with Bhadrak leading the chart at 34 per cent followed by Dhenkanal at 31 per cent, Jajpur at 23.55, Khordha at 22.51, Balasore at 21.3 and Puri at 20.3. The state also has a TPR of over 13.53 per cent (last seven days average) as against the national average of 6.68 per cent.With 70,673 active cases, Odisha was at No 6 position among all the states and ahead of states like West Bengal (44,441), Chhattisgarh, (26,977), Rajasthan (21,550), Gujarat (22,110) and Uttar Pradesh (19,434).Noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra said despite the daily TPR going below 10, the state would take some more time before the situation can be termed to be in control.“The weekly TPR continues to be high in 15 districts and more number of RT-PCR tests needed in those places to check the transmission under control. The government delayed in ramping up the tests in rural areas and this is leading to high TPR and rising fatalities. The actual number of fatalities may be higher as many such cases are not being recorded by the government machinery,” he said.Mohapatra said the fatalities may be rising due to high number of unvaccinated people getting infected, many patients reporting to hospitals at a later stage and ICMR and AIIMS treatment protocol not being followed by most Covid-19 dedicated hospitals. Public health activist and state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, Gouranga Mohapatra also said Odisha is still not in a comfortable position. “The tests were ramped up over last fortnight and by that time the rural surge of Covid-19 had started. The rising fatalities that we are seeing right now is due to delayed detection of cases in rural areas where number of oxygen beds and ventilators may not be available. The deaths may also be rising due to addition of backlog cases over last few weeks. But the total number of deaths may be higher due to undercounting,” said Mohapatra.However, health officials said the deaths may be rising due to several Covid-19 patients turning critical. “Many patients whose condition had turned critical over the past few weeks may be succumbing to Covid-19 and that could be the reason of rising deaths,” said director of health Bijay Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-41-days-odisha-s-daily-tpr-dips-below-10-but-rising-deaths-trigger-concern-101623010831153.html

Traders resorted to various modes of protests to raise their demand of opening up of markets and trade establishments which have been closed since implementation of the curfew in the last week of April. State traders division (Chaudhary faction) offered milk to deity Ganga praying for wisdom for the state government for allowing shops of non-essential items also as Covid-19 cases have sharply dipped in the past few weeks. “We want opening up of markets as well as the Char Dham pilgrimage as trade business of Haridwar revolves heavily on Char Dham pilgrimage from April to November which is the Char Dham season. We also demand an economic package for affected traders as due to the earlier lockdown and now the curfew there has been a severe impact on us,” said state traders division president Sanjeev Chaudhary. Jan Vikas Kalyan Samiti president Kushal Pal Singh Saini demanded the opening up of markets on odd-even basis so that Covid-19 safety norms as well as the livelihood of traders can be ensured together. In Nainital district, traders held protests with black bands tied on their eyes. Some traders also burnt the effigy of the state government, demanding that they be allowed to open their shops. Angry traders also warned of non-cooperation if the state government doesn’t approve of their demands. Members of Devbhoomi Udyog Vyapar Mandal held protests at Patel Chowk market against the closure of markets by tying black bands on their eyes. Hukum Singh Kunwar, president of Devbhoomi Udyog Vyapar Mandal said, “Due to closure of markets for the last one month, traders are on the verge of starvation. We are unable to pay our loan instalments, taxes, electricity bill, and salary of workers and so on.” He said Covid-19 cases have sharply dipped in recent weeks but the government is continuing ahead with the curbs and restrictions, especially on traders. Govind Bagadwal, city president of Devbhoomi Vyapar Mandal said, “If the government is not concerned about the trader community who have been cooperating with the government since the Covid-19 outbreak then it’s high time we stand together and protest and they too have to work for safeguarding our interests. No assurance of any financial package has been given to us so far by the state government. They have left us on our own and is not allowing us to open our shops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-in-kumaon-garhwal-intensify-agitation-against-covid-19-induced-curfew-101623009511231.html

We will visit several areas in South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” news agency ANI quoted a member of the team as saying.The very severe cyclone Yaas made landfall in Odisha on May 26 and affected a large part of the state as well as West Bengal.“The team will hold meetings with officials of disaster management and finance department in Nabanna, the West Bengal state secretariat. The team will also visit Cyclone Yaas-affected areas in South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” people familiar with the development said.The West Bengal chief minister had said, as per initial assessment, the cyclone had led to damage of an estimated ₹20,000 crore to property and agriculture. She added that 18 lakh people were affected by the cyclone and around 2.21 lakh hectares of crops and 71,560 hectares of horticulture area suffered damage.On May 28, Modi had conducted an aerial survey of the cyclone-affected areas followed by a review meeting at Kalaikunda air force station.

07-06-2021||India||Nine states underutilised Covid-19 vaccine doses: Govt||At least nine states underutilised vaccine doses supplied to them between January and March, causing a slowing in the immunisation drive against the Covid-19 pandemic, according to central government data, with officials saying that demands by various states to widen and decentralise the inoculation programme may have been premature.India launched the world’s biggest vaccination drive against the infectious disease on January 16. In the first two phases of the drive up to March 31, healthcare and frontline workers were covered exclusively, followed by Indians older than 60 and those above 45 who suffer from co-morbidities.Data accessed by HT showed that Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra and Delhi majorly underutilised the doses provided to them.“These states, despite having adequate supplies of vaccines from the Centre in January, February and March, failed to commensurately use those supplies to effectively vaccinate a large enough proportion of their respective populations,” a top government official said on condition of anonymity.“In each of these states, the Centre supplied an increasing number of vaccines every month,” the official added.While the nationwide drive got off to a slow start amid vaccine hesitancy and lack of awareness, officials said some states failed to commensurately use the doses supplied by the Centre. In the first two phases, the vaccines were provided by the central government free of charge.While Rajasthan used 5.7 million of the 10.6 million doses supplied to it in the three months, Punjab used about 840,000 of the 2.9 million doses it received. Chhattisgarh used 1.9 million doses of the 4.3 million supplied to it and Telangana utilised only 1.3 million of the 4.1 million doses it was given. Andhra Pradesh administered 2.6 million doses of the 6.6 million shots it received and Jharkhand managed to utilised about 1.6 million of the 3.1 million doses it was provided. In Kerala, 3.4 million shots were administered, while the total number of doses provided by the Centre was 6.3 million.Maharashtra used only 6.2 million doses of the 14.3 million provided by the Centre till March 31, and Delhi administered 2.4 million of the 4.4 million doses it was granted.Data showed that while the pace of vaccinations in these states was abysmally low in the first two months of the vaccination drive, the coverage picked up in terms of the proportion of the total number of doses provided by the Centre in the third month.“A few states have contributed disproportionately to the slowdown in the nationwide vaccination drive,” the official quoted above said.Another official said that several states demanded that the vaccination drive be widened and decentralised to cover all adults very early in the programme, even though they were unable to utilise the doses provided by the central government. Now that the states are demanding that the process to purchase vaccine doses to ramp up supplies be centralised, the Centre is considering steps in this regard, the official added.The government’s data also showed that Delhi, Maharashtra, Punjab and Telangana have so far administered the first dose of vaccines to health care workers lower than the national average of 81%.Until June 5, India administered more than 230 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, second only to the US, which has administered about 300 million shots so far in the fight against the pandemic that began raging early last year||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-states-underutilised-covid-19-vaccine-doses-govt-101623008599901.html
07-06-2021||India||India logs lowest daily Covid-19 cases in 2 months: Data||With a little over 100,000 new infections across India on Sunday, daily cases in the country dropped to the lowest level seen in over two months, underlining the country’s turnaround after the brutal second wave of the viral outbreak.On Sunday, 101,237 new infections were reported across the country and 2,446 new deaths, taking the total number of confirmed infections in India to 28.9 million and deaths to 349,247, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. While the daily cases were the lowest since April 4, or in 62 days, the number of reported daily deaths in the country touched a low of a month-and-a-half (or since April 22).The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for four consecutive weeks across the country. The seven-day average of new infections in the country – which denotes a region’s Covid-19 curve – had touched a peak of 391,819 case a day on May 9, but has now dropped to 123,232 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 68% from the peak, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.“The second wave is stabilising or we can see is localised at the moment as from at least 500 districts reporting nearly 100 or more daily new cases in May, the number has come down to around 250 districts as on date. Most districts have shown substantial decrease in numbers since the peak was observed May 7, and hopefully the numbers will go down further in days to come,” said a senior health ministry official.In a recent press briefing on Covid-19, the Union health ministry informed that only five states constituted two-thirds of all new infections in the country now.“Among our new reported cases, 66% are effectively being reported from just five states, which is a sign to suggest we have managed to contain the disease transmission in a localised area,” said Lav Agarwal in the briefing.The health ministry on Sunday said that the country has recorded fewer than 200,000 daily new cases for 11 continuous days now. “This is a result of collaborative and sustained efforts by the Centre and states, Union territories following the “whole of Government” approach... The country’s active caseload has dipped below 15 lakh mark… The caseload is below 20 lakh for seven successive days,” the ministry statement said.The daily test positivity rate has also dropped significantly, a factor that experts attributed to a significant increase in daily testing.The average weekly test positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in the country has now dropped 18 percentage points from the peak and is continuing to go down rapidly, offering what is perhaps the clearest sign of the country’s brutal second wave coming under control.For the week ending May 9, more than a fifth of all samples (22.8%) tested in the country returned positive, compared to just 4.8% in the past week. This turnaround is even more evident in the single day positivity rate, which has dropped to 3.2% on Saturday (the lowest in 81 days), compared to 25.3% on April 25 – the highest ever recorded.Much of this turnaround in positivity rate appears to be the direct result of a massive increase in testing. On average, more than 3 million samples have been tested in India every day in the past week – the highest this number has ever touched in the 15 months of the outbreak in the country. In fact, the daily rate of testing (seven-day average) has increased in over a million a day in just the past two weeks.Experts also say the numbers are indicative of a downward trend. “The numbers are stabilising but one recommendation cannot suit all states. This has to be local,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.“Each state has to make decisions on unlocking based on the objective indicators locally. The lower test positivity will have to sustain at least for two weeks while the load on hospitals is considerably eased, especially the availability of beds with critical care. Based on some of the indicators, gradual unlocking should be done,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-lowest-daily-covid-19-cases-in-2-months-data-101623007719764.html
07-06-2021||India||12 private hospitals in Patna under scanner for fleecing Covid-19 patients||At least 12 private hospitals in Patna are under the scanner for charging patients more than the rate fixed by the state government for treatment of coronavirus while many others have been let off the hook because of the grey area in the health department’s order that is silent on investigations and drugs. The Patna district administration has lodged FIRs against four private health facilities in this connection so far. It has also facilitated refunding excess payment to as many as five patients, encouraging them to withdraw their complaints. The Patna district administration, which has been proactive in this regard, has received 31 complaints against private health clinics overcharging Covid-19 patients. Twelve among them have been examined and show-cause notices issued. The complaints have been filed either directly by patients or their relatives and friends, generally after they were discharged from health centres. “In as many as five cases, we succeeded in facilitating refund of excess amount to patients or their relatives. FIRs were registered against private health centres who did not cooperate with our investigations,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM), who constituted a special task force, comprising administrative officers, doctors, a drug inspector, a magistrate and police officers, for this purpose. The Patna district administration had empanelled a total 91 private health facilities for treatment of Covid-19 patients. They were, however, supposed to charge patients within the government approved treatment rate, capped at a maximum of ₹15,000 per day for non- National Accredited Board of Hospitals (NABH) hospitals in Patna and ₹18,000 per day for NABH hospitals. “We found that some empanelled hospitals were charging patients up to ₹50,000 per day. In some cases, they would charge patients ₹1,00,000 in the first couple of days and then release the patient or threaten to release them, taking the alibi that the government was not making oxygen available to them. We dealt sternly with all such hospitals and lodged FIRs against a few, sending a strong message across all private hospitals. Automatically, many others fell in line and began toeing the government order,” said Singh. “Inquiries into several other similar complaints are on and we will take them to their logical conclusion,” said Richie Pandey, Patna’s deputy development commissioner, also the senior nodal officer, treatment cell of Covid-19, constituted by the DM. The Hindustan Times has accessed a “provisional in-patient bill” of a well-known NABH-hospital in Patna that raised a bill of ₹2.44 lakh for 10-day hospitalisation between October 25 and November 4, 2020. Interestingly, the hospital has levied ₹38,000 as bed charges in Covid-19 “day care unit” (ward type), ₹42,495 for laboratory investigations, ₹29,000 as miscellaneous charges, ₹23,960 as ward procedure, ₹9,240 under hospital procedure and ₹5,200 as in-patient consultation charge. A whopping ₹94,070 has been raised against in-patient drug sale. A closer scrutiny of the bill revealed that the patient was prescribed costly investigations either daily or every second day. Some of the common investigations prescribed included liver function test, renal function test, complete blood count, D-Dimer (helps rule out the presence of a serious blood clot), ferritin (it helps understand how much iron the body stores), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test, which looks for signs of damage to the body’s tissues, interleukin-6 (to check for chronic inflammatory disorders), C-reactive protein test (to check the level of c-reactive protein, produced by liver, in blood), urine culture and sensitivity test, etc. The August 20, 2020 order of the health department, fixing treatment rates for Covid-19, however, did not specify tests and drugs. As such, the hospitals exploited this loophole to the fullest and charged patients, prescribing these tests at their whims and fancy. Patna district magistrate accepted having come across several such cases. “We came across many such cases where costly drugs and investigations were prescribed repeatedly to patients. We could not do much because the government order fixing treatment rates only mentions basic medicines and tests, without specifying them. We have flagged it to the health department,” said Singh. “Doctors should tickle their professional morality and not exploit patients in crisis,” he added. In Gaya, two complaints were lodged of patients being overcharged, said its district magistrate Abhishek Singh. In both the cases, the private facilities refunded the excess amount to patients as soon as the district administration proceeded against them. The district administration even de-empanelled one of the 17 facilities for treatment of Covid-19 in the district after it overcharged a patient for high resolution computed tomography of thorax (chest), the government-approved being ₹3,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-private-hospitals-in-patna-under-scanner-for-fleecing-covid-19-patients-101623007110982.html
07-06-2021||India||Phase II clinical trial of tapeworm drug begins||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), in collaboration with Laxai Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd, has initiated a Phase-II clinical trial of a repurposed anti-tapeworm drug for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union ministry of science and technology announced on Sunday.“CSIR in collaboration with Laxai Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., has initiated Phase-II clinical trial with anti-helminitic drug Niclosamide for treatment of Covid-19. The trial is a multi-centric, phase-II, randomized, open label clinical study to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of NIclosamide for the treatment of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,” the ministry’s statement read.Niclosamide has been extensively used in the past for the treatment of tapeworm infection among adults as well as children. The safety profile of this drug has been tested over time and has been found safe for human consumption, it added.The subject expert committee of the national drugs regulatory department, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, recommended the Phase II clinical trial using Niclosamide, which is generic, affordable drug, and easily available in India and therefore can be made available to Indian population.Dr Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to director general, CSIR, said in a screen to identify drugs that can inhibit syncytia formation, Niclosamide was identified as a promising repurposed drug by a research group from King’s College London, which collaborated in the project.“Based on successful clinical evidence generated during clinical trials in Indian studies, emergency use authorization may be sought so that more treatment options are available to COVID-19 patients,” said Dr Ram Upadhayaya, CEO, Laxai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-ii-clinical-trial-of-tapeworm-drug-begins-101623006728190.html
07-06-2021||India||After DMK, AIADMK also calls for NEET cancellation||Chennai: All India Anna Dravida Munnetre Kazhagam (AIADMK) coordinator O Panneerselvam on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to scrap the National Eligibility cum Entrance Exam (NEET) for admission to undergraduate medical colleges in the state. The letter comes a day after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led state government set up a committee headed by retired high court justice A K Rajan to study the impact of NEET on socially-backward students as part of the process to seek abolition of the national exam.In his letter, Panneerselvam recalled how late former chief minister and AIADMK supremo J Jayalaithaa had objected to the NEET exam since 2011 when it was first introduced. The move is interesting as the DMK holds the AIADMK responsible for allowing NEET to be conducted in the state after Jayalalithaa’s demise in 2016. The AIADMK, in return, has blamed the DMK as it was in coalition with the Congress during UPA-2 when the exam was introduced. In his letter to Modi, Panneerselvam listed six reasons why the NEET exam put students, especially those in rural areas, at a disadvantage. “Tamil Nadu had among the highest number of medical aspirants, especially poor and the marginalised, in the country when admission was based on class 12 marks. However, NEET made this entrance process difficult for marginalised communities,” he wrote. The former deputy chief minister requested Modi to take a ‘uniform policy decision to abolish’ NEET and common entrance exams for all professional courses ‘forever’.Abolishing NEET was one of the election promises of the DMK which formed the new government after securing 159 of 234 seats with its coalition partners in the assembly elections. Opposition parties have extended their support to the government and chief minister M K Stalin also wrote to Modi in this regard. On Saturday after cancelling the class 12 board exams, Stalin, in a separate letter to Modi, urged him to scrap all entrance exams, including NEET, in view of the pandemic. Stalin asked for the state to be allowed to fill all professional seats, including MBBS, on the basis of Class 12 marks as was the case before the NEET-scored based admission was introduced in Tamil Nadu in 2017. “I therefore urge you to cancel the conduct of all national level entrance examinations like NEET, as the same reasons adduced for cancelling the Class XII board examinations are equally applicable to entrance examinations as well,” his letter read. The Class 12 marks this year, he said, would be awarded by a committee headed by the School Education Department Principal Secretary. Such marks alone shall be the basis for admission to college courses, he said. As coaching for government school students did not yield desired results, the previous AIADMK regime in October 2020 introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for students who cleared NEET for the 2020-2021 academic year, a development considered as an achievement by former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. Tamil Nadu had also communicated its stance against NEET to the Centre during a meeting in May with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and all states to collate their opinions on conducting CBSE Class 12 exams, which were subsequently cancelled in view of the pandemic. Experts believe that while the state’s move to scrap the NEET exam may be correct, they should not make any amendments without giving students ample time to be prepared for the change. “NEET shouldn’t be scrapped this academic year because students have been preparing for it and there are repeaters,” education analyst and founder of Career Guidance J P Gandhi said, adding: “Any radical change should be brought in by giving students at least 12-15 months to prepare for the change.” He said that while education is in the concurrent list, states should be empowered to manage them while the Centre can offer outlines.The DMK believes that NEET is against social justice and equality. If its appointed committee finds that the exam has affected socially backward students, they may suggest alternative admission methods and possible legal remedies for implementing it. Educationists have supported the workings of this committee. “NEET has turned into a commercialisation of coaching classes which has turned into a multi-million industry,” Gandhi said. “Before NEET came in, Tamil Nadu students who joined MBBS with just Class 12 scores had outperformed in the NEET postgraduate exams they wrote, which shows that the argument that NEET produces better quality doctors is false.”Bengaluru-based Tara Krishnaswamy, founder of Political Shakti and a commentator on politics, said the learnings from Covid-19 pandemic should be applied to understand that each state has to further its own healthcare system and medical education. The pandemic has exacerbated the need for decentralising and scaling-up healthcare centres, PHCs with equipment, doctors and medical staff across hinterlands, villages, towns and small districts,” she said. “NEET cuts students’ access to the right to education. It doesn’t encourage medical professionals within a state and the likelihood of improving your own rural areas and towns becomes lower,” Krishnaswamy said. “It is unimaginable that a student from Punjab admitted to Madras Medical College works at a PHC in a village in Tamil Nadu and infeasible as well. But, what is likely to happen is that when a child is born and raised in a village and sees that they don’t have enough doctors and medical care, he/she wants to become a doctor and when you prioritise them, they will serve their people in these areas,” she added. The national-level exam has gone through several legal and political wrangles in Tamil Nadu. The exam also drove several students to take their lives either for failing or over fears of not being able to clear it. S Anitha, a 17-year-old dalit girl, died by suicide after she failed to clear the exam in 2017 despite topping her school examination in Ariyalur district with 98%. She had earlier visited Delhi, impleading herself in the state government’s petition against the exam in the Supreme Court. The plea was, however, rejected. Anitha’s death resulted in widespread agitations against the state and central governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-dmk-aiadmk-also-calls-for-neet-cancellation-101623006451565.html

People may take anti-pyretic and anti-tussive for symptomatic relief, and inhalational of budesonide (given via metered dose inhaler with space device) at a dose of 800 mcg twice a day for 5 days for cough, the guidelines said. “No other Covid-19 specific medication required. Patient may have to be investigated further if symptoms persist or deteriorate,” it recommended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dghsrevises-covid-treatment-guidelines-101623006212478.html

On its anniversary, we reduce this pain by uttering ‘Khalistan Zindabad’. It can never be forgotten. It will be part of our memory forever,” Singh said, amid echoes of slogans during his address from the highest temporal seat of Sikhs on the 37th anniversary of the military action at Golden Temple.Even during his address last year, Singh had stated that every Sikh wanted Khalistan and if the government offers them the formation of a separate nation, “they will accept it happily”.“The Indian Army attacked Akal Takht just like it battled against China and Pakistan during wars... the treatment given to Sikhs was more oppressive and brutal than one given... to the losing side in a battle,” he said.“The community has already recognised Operation Bluestar as another ‘ghallughara’ (holocaust),” he said.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur endorsed the jathedar’s views on slogans.SGPC to initiate damages suit talks with CentreMeanwhile, the SGPC is set to begin negotiations with the Union government for out-of-court settlement of ₹1,000-crore damages suit related to Operation Bluestar, immediately after the 37th anniversary of the military action at Golden Temple.The suit was filed by the SGPC, under its then president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, in the Delhi high court in March 1985. Thirty-six years on, it is still pending. On the court’s order, both sides — Centre and SGPC — are ready to resolve the dispute out of court since 2019, but no meeting has been held so far.“The matter, which came to a standstill due to the pandemic, was discussed in our last executive committee meeting held on June 2,” said Bhagwant Singh Sialka, an advocate and general secretary of the SGPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akal-takht-justifies-pro-khalistan-slogans-on-op-bluestar-anniversary-101623005780342.html
07-06-2021||India||Suvendu Adhikari’s ‘aide’ arrested in job scam case, MLA and brother booked for theft||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) found itself in a tight corner on Sunday when the Kolkata Police arrested an old associate of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal legislative assembly, in a job scam case and the leader and his youngest brother Soumendu Adhikari were booked in a case involving theft of relief material in East Midnapore district, the home turf of the Adhikari family. This is the first time since the BJP emerged as a formidable force in Bengal and took the Trinamool Congress (TMC) head on in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and the recent assembly polls that a prominent saffron camp leader has been booked in a criminal case. In both polls – the BJP wrested 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats but bagged only 77 of 294 assembly seats last month – it was the BJP that highlighted the alleged involvement of TMC leaders in chit fund scams and the Narada sting operation case during campaigns. The saffron camp became the target of the TMC on May 17 when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested three TMC legislators, including two cabinet ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and the former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee, who left the TMC last year, in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. TMC leaders accused the BJP of using the CBI to avenge its electoral defeat.In the job scam case, accused Rakhal Bera, a businessman based in East Midnapore, was held for allegedly taking ₹2 lakh from a man in 2018-19 by promising a job in the irrigation department that Suvendu Adhikari headed at that time. Police officials said some more people were cheated and they were on the lookout for Chanchal Nandy, another accused who reportedly claimed to be an irrigation department employee. Bera was remanded in police custody till June 12 by a Kolkata court. His lawyers told the media that he was a victim of “political vendetta” because of his proximity to Adhikari. “This is an attempt to malign the image of Suvendu Adhikari,” one of the lawyers said. Adhikari did not respond to queries from the media. After serving in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year and defeated her at Nandigram in East Mindapore district in the recent state polls. The BJP elected him as leader of the opposition in the state assembly. The TMC routed the opposition by winning 213 seats but Adhikari made news by defeating Banerjee by 1958 votes. His father Sishir Adhikari and the family’s second son, Dibyendu, are Lok Sabha MPs from East Midnapore. In the theft case, an FIR was filed against Suvendu and Soumendu Adhikari for allegedly stealing tarpaulin from the Kanthi municipality office. The case has been filed against the brothers on the basis of a complaint lodged by Ratnadip Manna, a member of the municipal administrative board. Soumendu Adhikari was head of the civic body till he resigned and joined the BJP last year. “We will fight the case in court. People will come to know the truth,” said Sishir Adhikari. “On 29 May 2021 at 12:30 pm as per direction of Suvendu Adhikari and his brother and former municipal chief Soumendu Adhikari of Kanthi municipality, government tripal (tarpaulin) whose estimated value is around lakhs of rupees, was taken away from the municipality office godown by forcefully and illegally opening locks,” read the complaint submitted by Manna at Kanthi Police Station on June 1. The complaint also said that the BJP leaders used central force personnel in the alleged theft. Reacting to the allegation that Adhikari was being targeted for political reasons, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “The arrest of our ministers by the CBI was a case of vendetta because they were held after the investigation was over and the agency was ready to file the charge sheet. In these cases, the complaints have just been registered. The arrest in the job scam case is part of the investigation.” Reacting to the arrest in the job scam case, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “I don’t know who is close to whom. If someone has committed a crime then he will be punished. However, the lodging of the case is an admission from the chief minister that corruption marked her government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-s-aide-arrested-in-job-scam-case-mla-and-brother-booked-for-theft-101623005670838.html

07-06-2021||India||Change in cities led to monkeys’ displacement||For the last year, I have been learning about the monkey-crisis in one village of the Akhnoor subdivision of Jammu. Last week, an old woman estimated half her mango crop was devoured by the Rhesus Macaques. This, a resident tells me, is a phenomenon no older than ten years. The villagers suspect that the forest department trapped the monkeys from another area, perhaps a city, releasing them here. But they also blame another phenomenon: a new roadway, frequented by pilgrims- a new food mecca for these monkeys, whose blessings these passing pilgrims seek. The villagers are stuck: they don’t want to deny the sacred monkeys food, but they are uneasy about these co-inhabitants who bite.This village isn’t a lone example. Monkeys are increasingly seen as a menace. This is sad as they are, in reality, internally displaced animals. As cities change, their traditional eating habitats are lost. Orchards, small farms, empty spaces or even forts-places they lived in, are disturbed, developed or destroyed. They are forced to move out in groups to clash with human beings. As pressure mounts to get rid of them, they are often captured and released elsewhere. If their groups are fractured, the lone stragglers turn aggressive.The solution is not to dump them elsewhere. A combination of meticulously undertaken and monitored sterilization processes, innovative awareness to end public feeding and ensuring natural food sources are key to a win-win. Over time, the population might reduce, but for now, there is no short-cut to bearing this expense.(The writer is Founder and Director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/change-in-cities-led-to-monkeys-displacement-101623005351340.html
07-06-2021||India||Monsoon has reached N-E early: IMD||Monsoon has come four to five days early to the whole of northeast India, most parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal, and Sikkim, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials on Sunday.New monsoon dates were issued by IMD last year based on onset data from 1961 to 2019, and withdrawal data from 1971 to 2019. Going by these, monsoon was expected to cover Sikkim and sub-Himalayan West Bengal around June 10.“But it has advanced to Sikkim and parts of Maharashtra four to five days in advance. The monsoon flow is strong and southwesterly winds have picked up on a large scale,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Monsoon is likely to pick up further as a monsoon ‘low’ or a low-pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal on June 11.“Under the influence of that monsoon low, we are expecting monsoon to be vigorous and cover most of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal — all of east India by June 13. We are now getting very early indications that monsoon will reach western parts of the country earlier than expected too,” added Jenamani.But it’s too early to say if monsoon will arrive in Delhi early, officials said. “For now, we can say that pre-monsoon rain and thunderstorms are likely to begin over Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh around June 12 and 13 because of the low-pressure area that will develop over the Bay of Bengal. It’s difficult to say immediately if monsoon will arrive earlier than expected. Normal date is around June 29,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.This year, between June 1 and 6, the country has got 44% excess rain, with Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab, etc, recording ‘large excess’ rain — 60% above normal.On Saturday and Sunday, Puddukkottai in Tamil Nadu recorded 19 cm rainfall, Tripura and Gangtok recorded 11 cm each, and Shirali in Karnataka and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh received 10 cm each.The weatherman also predicts fairly widespread rain in the northeastern states and adjoining parts of eastern India in the next four to five days. Isolated heavy rain is very likely over Arunachal Pradesh on June 6 and 8; over Assam, Meghalaya, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on June 8 and 9; over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on June 7; over Odisha on June 8 and 9; and over Gangetic West Bengal on June 10.Under the influence of the offshore trough (area of low pressure) at mean sea level from the north Maharashtra coast to the north Kerala coast, and a cyclonic circulation over Konkan and Goa, scattered to widespread rain accompanied by thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds was likely over parts of south Peninsular India and the west coast on Sunday and Monday.In its long-range forecast, IMD said monsoon rain, a key variable in the health of the rural economy, is likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rain. LPA is the average rainfall (88 cm) recorded from 1961 to 2010.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybeans, and cotton cultivation. Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the raging pandemic. India has over 150 million farmers and nearly half of Indians are dependent on a farm-based income. Agriculture is one of the mainstays of its economy.

In the wake of the second wave of Covid-19, the party will also train 100,000 health volunteers across the country to operate medical devices and perform other essential medical services.The decision was taken during a review meeting between BJP president JP Nadda and party general secretaries, where the different wings of the party were instructed to take stock of and promote the social welfare schemes launched by the Centre. For example, the Scheduled Tribe (ST) wing of the party was asked to focus on promoting the Centre’s Vandhan Yojana for tribals.“The party will ensure that there is awareness about the social welfare schemes and enhance its relief outreach,” said the functionary quoted above.“The party will also strengthen the organisation. In the coming days we will hold meetings at the booth and mandal level to strengthen the party’s presence on the ground,” said party general secretary Bhupinder Yadav.According to a person aware of the matter,after the meeting, Nadda and BJP’s general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and party general secretaries called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him of the party’s plans for the upcoming elections.The PM has advised the party workers to assess the performance in the previous elections and improve strategy to expand their support base to other communities as well, the person said.The states going to polls next year are Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Manipur, Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.Meanwhile, as part of its Covid relief campaign, Seva hi Sangathan, the party will also organise training sessions for volunteers about the use of medical devices such as concentrators and oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-asks-cadre-to-promote-govt-schemes-ahead-of-2022-elections-101623004232958.html
07-06-2021||India||Kids in 30k families directly hit by Covid-19: NCPCR to SC||Children in more than 30,000 families were abandoned, became orphans or lost at least one of their parents between April 2020 and last week, according to the latest data submitted to the Supreme Court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which is by far the most comprehensive estimate provided by states on the status of children affected by the pandemic.The figures were uploaded by the respective states and Union territories on the NCPCR website “Bal Swaraj”. The commission in an affidavit filed before the top court added a disclaimer stating that the reason for death of parent(s) could be any and not just Covid-19.“The Commission is presenting the number of children who have lost either their mother or father or both parents from April 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021, based upon the information uploaded on “Bal Swaraj” portal up to 5th June 2021,” the affidavit of the NCPCR filed through advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi on Sunday said.The reason of death was not uploaded by the states/UTs, leaving open the possibility of the death of parent(s) having occurred for reasons other than Covid-19.The latest data shows that among 30,071 children affected during the pandemic, 3,621 lost both parents, a significantly high number of 26,176 lost either parent while 274 were left abandoned. Of the affected children, there are 15,620 boys, 14,447 girls and four transgenders. The commission categorised the data into age-wise brackets. This showed that more than 11,800 children are in the age group of 8 to 13 years, requiring urgent care. About 10,247 are between 14 and 18 years of age.This is the second affidavit filed by the commission in response to a query put by the top court on the number of children affected due to the pandemic. The possibility of a significantly high number of orphans during the pandemic and an urgent need to cater to their care and protection was raised by amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the court in a suo motu petition on steps to contain the spread of Covid-19 in child care homes. The earlier affidavit filed by NCPCR on May 31 did not contain complete figures of affected children as many states faced technical challenges to upload data on the “Bal Swaraj” portal.The matter is fixed for hearing on Monday before a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose. Along with the affidavit by NCPCR, a note prepared by Agrawal focusing on 10 states with regard to an identification mechanism of children affected by Covid-19 and steps taken to provide them care under various central and state schemes. These 10 states are Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.Agrawal has made suggestions on protecting the property rights of orphans/children. His note stated, “A large number of children have lost their father, who was the earning member of the family. In some cases, there is absolutely no income, no insurance benefits and no property with the widow.”Agrawal suggested that when orphans or children in need of care and protection are produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), it could assess the financial capacity of the family or guardian and award an amount of ₹5,000 per child as financial assistance. Some states have already announced special financial schemes for such children, Agrawal added.According to data from NCPCR, most among the affected 30,000-odd children are at their homes with the single parent, guardian or family member, with only 819 in children homes (including observation homes and shelter homes), 41 in orphanages, and 62 with special adoption agencies.Among the states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number with 217 children orphaned and over 6,800 losing either parent. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan recorded high numbers of orphans at 706 and 671, respectively. The NCPCR affidavit has requested the court to direct states and UTs not to share names or information about children in the public domain or provide it to any person/entity/organisation, making these children susceptible to trafficking, abuse, illegal adoption, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kids-in-30k-families-directly-hit-by-covid-19-ncpcr-to-sc-101623004110302.html
07-06-2021||India||Kannada content struggles for space on OTT platforms||With the mushrooming of streaming platforms, movies and soap operas have become accessible in living rooms across the country, breaking region and language barriers. Among the south Indian industries, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu movies have made their presence felt across the country on various over-the-top (OTT) platforms over the last few years, with a steady increase in non-native audiences. But, even in this gold rush, Kannada contents are still struggling to find a space for themselves.While a handful of Kannada movies have managed to do reasonably well on streaming platforms, regional content creators from the industry overall have struggled to find a slot on OTT platforms. In 2020, a Kannada web-series – Honeymoon – had a similar fate when it was not accepted by any platform. Later, a Telugu OTT platform, impressed by the content, did decide to stream it, but only after dubbing it in Telugu.Pawan Kumar, director of the movie U-Turn, which was the first Kannada movie to get an OTT release, said that while some Kannada movies have managed to find a space in India’s OTT experiment, they were not a success story as big as Malayalam industry. “Over the years, because of various movies in our language coming out on OTT platforms, Kannada content did get some exposure, but it has not been able to create a buzz like contents from Malayalam and other south Indian industries. It was this buzz and word-of-mouth that helped our neighbouring industry become so popular on OTT services. People went looking for Malayalam movies because of the buzz,” said Kumar.Kannada movie director Hemanth Rao, who was also a co-writer for the Hindi movie Andhadhun, took examples of short films to put his point across. “If you compare the views a Kannada short film and a Telugu short film has received, you will see the audience for the Kannada short film is less. Even the most popular short films in Kannada will have around only one million views. OTT work is based on market response. This is a reason for the poor response for Kannada content on OTT,” said Rao.An executive working with one of the streaming platforms that plans to expand its southern content, agreed with the lack of response to Kannada content.“In the entire country, Bengaluru reports the highest subscriptions and views. At the same time, the business from the rest of Karnataka is not as big. If you look at Bengaluru, the demand is not for Kannada content, but audiences here watch everything from international movies to regional movies. It is often the quality of movies or the buzz around them that attracts them. Kannada content per se doesn’t have such demand. One of the reasons is the low subscriptions from rest the state,” he said.“It is not all bad news,” said writer and actor Danish Sait, who has made two Kannada movies for OTT platforms. “I’m talking from my personal experiences. While comparing the situation three years ago, Kannada movies made a big jump,” he said.Sait added that OTT services have given a platform for content creators like him, who could not bring masses to the theatres like the big stars, but were able to create engaging content. “OTT has given a lot of people like me the big platform. We are the people who have made careers because of the internet and that is one of the reasons we know that the content we create is best suited for OTT. Because of the streaming services, we have been able to take our movies to a national audience and their response gives us the confidence to make more content,” said Sait.However, several film critics said that compared to the other southern industries, Kannada is yet to find its niche and more importantly, the number of quality films made in the language is limited. “If you look at the Malayalam industry, post-2010 there was a paradigm shift in the movies that came out of there. The quality of the movies ensured that there was an audience for these movies across the country,” said a senior film journalist with an online platform, who didn’t want to be named.“At the same time, Kannada movies continue to produce the so-called ‘event movies’, where the movie revolves around a superstar, and it is a spectacle created for his fans. Such a movie will never get a national audience. Yes, there have been some movies, like Thithi, but we could count the number of such movies on fingers,” she added.A Kannada director, who didn’t want to be named, said that in the new era of Indian cinema, the industry is stuck in a catch-22 situation. “The money at present is in making mass, superstar-based movies. Only some of them, like KGF, have gained audiences outside of the state. If the Kannada industry needs to mark in this new OTT experiment, we need fresh and nuanced content appealing to the new internet generation,” he said.“For this, most filmmakers who have the potential to make path-breaking movies need producers. But producers are not certain about investing, since Kannada movies are not getting enough space in the streaming services. In this chicken and egg situation, we are losing out,” he added.In the past few years, several attempts have been made to make local streaming services in Kannada, but they have not been successful. “I wouldn’t take names, but there were several portals that started streaming services in Kannada. They even got some good content. But for running such a service, you need a constant flow of funds. For example, ‘Aha’ streaming service in Telugu is backed by some major business groups, who saw the potential in regional content. Here, the owners are trying struggling for funding. In the lockdown, we saw that tier-two cities consumed more online content and even paid for it. Kannada missed that opportunity,” said the executive cited before.The film critic concluded that if Kannada movies have to make an impact on the national audience and thus on the streaming platforms, there is a need to relook at the quality of the content the industry produces. “Streaming is as big as a threatre release now. To make a mark in streaming services, our content needs to grow beyond event films for superstars. Our industry is known for producers like Shankar Nag, who were way ahead of their times. It is time to bring back such mindsets to industry,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kannada-content-struggles-for-space-on-ott-platforms-101622919745299.html
