The case has been filed before the court of a chief judicial magistrate in Muzaffarpur.The complainant, Tamanna Hashmi, alleged a "conspiracy" in rising prices of petrol and diesel, while underlining that the price of crude oil is quite low. Hashmi further alleged that the prices of petrol have left the people of the country "terrorised" and "enraged".He has sought trial against Pradhan under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). These include Sections 420 (fraud), 295 and 295 (A) pertaining to deliberate malicious acts and 511 (attempt to commit an offence). The petition is expected to be taken up for hearing in due course.Tamanna Hashmi identifies himself as a social worker and is often in news for his numerous court complaints against politicians over various issues. On June 24, he filed a criminal complaint against yoga guru Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved MD Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they have “misled” and put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a medicine to treat Covid-19. A court has posted the matter for hearing on June 30.In 2019, Hashmi put up missing posters featuring Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav. He also promised a cash reward of ₹5100 for information about his whereabouts. The text on the post also stated that Yadav is missing since the 2019 Lok Sabha results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/case-filed-against-dharmendra-pradhan-in-bihar-court-over-fuel-price-hike-101624898542094.html

Nine people have been confirmed killed, officials have said.Vishal Patel, 42, his wife Bhavna Patel, 38, and their 1-year-old daughter Aishani Patel are believed to be among the missing, their niece Sarina Patel told CNN, adding that Bhavna Patel is four months pregnant.Sarina said she last spoke to her family on Father's Day."I had actually called them to tell them I had just booked a flight to come visit because they've been asking me to come to see their home and to meet their daughter. I haven't met her due to the pandemic," she said on Friday.They were home at the time the collapse took place, she said. "We have tried calling them countless times and there's just been no answers, text messages, nothing. They haven't contacted anybody," she said.Bhavna is a British and US citizen, the British media reported.Umma Kannayan, a family friend of the Patels, told the BBC that they were a "very loving" family who were closely involved in their religious community."Aishani was like the little baby of the temple," she said. "It feels like you've lost a part of yourself."She said she was waiting with the Patel family's relatives for news, but that "not much information has been shared" about the victims."I think all of us, the family included, and the folks that are very closely associated with them [at temple] would want to know the list of survivors currently present," she said. "Perhaps from there some hope either might be given or might be shattered, but some names out there would be very helpful for all."Meanwhile, the painstaking search for survivors is continuing as families waiting for news are increasingly fearing the worst. Some prayed for a miracle. Others have already begun to speak about their loved ones in the past tense.As of Sunday, at least nine have been confirmed dead and more than 150 people are still unaccounted for, authorities said, the USA Today reported.On 24 June, a building at the Champion Towers South Condo, around seven miles away from Miami beach, partially collapsed leaving at least five dead and 156 missing. Emergency officials are asking people to contact them if they have relatives unaccounted for.A state of emergency has been declared by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.The number of people unaccounted for is 159, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters Friday -- up from the figure of 99 that officials gave Thursday afternoon, CNN reported.Those 159 people "have been identified as possibly being on the site. So those are people that maybe live there, but we don't know whether they were there at the time," the mayor said at a news conference on Friday afternoon in Surfside.Numerous search and rescue personnel have been scouring the rubble, including from the surface, with search dogs, sonar and cameras.Structural engineers also have been shoring up other places -- such as areas near a parking garage underneath the rubble -- to allow crews to tunnel underneath with light machinery.The building's residents reflected South Florida's international and cultural mix, with affluent families from Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia and a tight-knit Jewish community.President Joe Biden on Friday approved an emergency declaration for the state, making federal aid available to Florida.The cause of the partial collapse of the building is not known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indianamerican-family-among-over-150-missing-after-building-collapse-in-us-101624896414702.html

On late Monday night, the global map which earlier appeared on the career section of Twitter website under the header ‘Tweep Life' was removed completely from the web page.The furore comes amid a bitter stand-off between the Indian government and Twitter over compliance with new IT rules.After the distorted map came under public scrutiny and triggered a heavy censuring from netizens, demands of strict action against the microblogging platform were raised.Also read: Govt looking into Twitter displaying wrong map of IndiaThis is not the first time that Twitter has misrepresented India's map.

28-06-2021||India||Karnataka opens Jog falls after two-month closure due to Covid-19 restrictions||The world famous Jog falls in Karnataka opened for public viewing from Monday, the state government announced. The site was shut for the visitors for the last two months due to strict Covid-19 restrictions.The visitors are allowed to visit the site in Sagar taluk of Shivamogga district from 10am to 5pm, the government order said. It, however, asked the visitors to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and warned of strict action against violators.The tourism department decided to open the Jog falls after heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Sharavathi river in Uttara Kannada and Shivamogga districts. The Sharavathi river falls at a place called Gerusoppa-Jog from a height of 253 meters, and gets segmented into four cascades namely Raja, Rani, Rocket, and Roarer. Due to heavy rainfall, all the four cascades are gushing forth aplenty, and offering a bewitching sight, the tourism department said.Directions and timings to visit the falls will also be displayed at the intersection of Honnavar-Sagar road on National Highway 66, tourism department officials said.The state tourism department of Shivamogga district has made adequate arrangements for complying with Covid-19 regulations. A special outpost has been created just outside the viewing area. There are sanitiser spray facilities, strict vigil to ensure wearing of masks and placards reminding the maintenance of social distancing.Following the decision to open the site, local shop owners have also sought permission to open the shops in the vicinity of the falls. Few of the eateries and souvenir shops have been allowed to open from Tuesday, the Sagar taluk officials stated. But all these shops will function in adherence to the standard operating protocols and the local Covid lockdown timings.The state tourism department sources said that they expect the footfalls to increase by the weekend. The tourism department officials informed that other heritage sites like Belur-Halebid, Aihole, Pattadakal, will be opened for the public later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-opens-jog-falls-after-two-month-closure-due-to-covid-19-restrictions-101624889336787.html
28-06-2021||India||10-month gap between AstraZeneca vaccine doses effective, 3rd booster shot ups immunity: Study||The human body's immune response to the AstraZeneca Plc Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be more effective if the gap between two doses is increased to about 10 months, a study by the University of Oxford published on Monday showed. Additionally, a third shot can push up the antibody levels, even more, said the study conducted on the vaccine now known as Vaxzevria.The study showed that an extended gap between the doses increased the level of protective antibodies. For the third shot, when given the first time after six months post the second dose, the booster was found to have induced a strong response and increased activity against coronavirus variants, the researchers found.Governments around the world are faced with severe vaccine shortages amid a race to fully vaccinate their population against the infectious disease which has killed at least 3,925,816 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to the AFP.At least 181,026,780 cases of coronavirus have been registered. The World Health Organization estimates that the pandemic's overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.In the last 24 hours, a total of 6,743 new deaths and 325,186 new cases were recorded worldwide.The countries with the highest new deaths were India with 979 new deaths, followed by Brazil with 739 and Colombia with 664.Some countries are also trying to tackle questions on booster shots in a bid to avoid overburdening the hospitals in the coming months of winter.The study by Oxford is likely to assist countries in their vaccine roll-out planning. Most nations have recommended a gap of 4 weeks to 12 weeks between AstraZeneca vaccines currently.Officials said this study will aid the world's response against the viral disease.“This is about preparedness,” Andrew Pollard, lead investigator on the Oxford vaccine trials, said at a press briefing Monday."This data show we can boost responses giving another dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and that’s really important. More research on the duration of immunity from two doses and protection against variants would help determine whether booster doses are really needed," Pollard said.What the study foundThe study found that antibodies induced after a single dose survived to some extent after one year. Still, after 180 days the levels were half those seen at the 28-day peak. A second dose increased antibody levels between four- and 18-fold by one month after the shot, however.Volunteers in the latest study were drawn from Oxford’s original early and late-stage trials for the vaccine last year. Thirty participants who only received a single dose in the trial were given a second one about 10 months after the first. An additional 90 participants from those studies received a third dose in March this year. All volunteers were between the ages of 18 and 55, reflecting the recruitment age at that stage of the trials last year.More than half a billion doses of the Astra-Oxford vaccine have already been sent to 168 countries, according to the researchers.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10month-gap-between-astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-effective-3rd-booster-shot-ups-immunity-study-101624883551348.html

Dr Paul also said the government is hoping that the decision will come soon, according to news agency PTI.Covaxin is one of the three vaccines which are currently being used in India for inoculation of people against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The vaccine is developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Russia's Sputnik V are the other two vaccines which have been administered to Indian citizens so far.The lack of endorsement from WHO has been hampering travel plans for individuals as many countries are only accepting vaccines approved by the public health body.On June 22, the vaccine manufacturer said that Covaxin has shown the efficacy of 77.8% in phase-3 of the medical trial on 25,800 subjects. The positive findings of the trial are likely to help the firm secure an EUL from the WHO.Earlier, Bharat Biotech also expressed confidence in getting the UN body's approval based on "its experience of getting its other vaccines prequalified by WHO." It also said that emergency approval is expected during July-September. The manufacturer has also claimed that around 90 per cent of the required documents have already been submitted to WHO and the remaining will be sent in July.In June, the company also held meeting pre-submission meeting with the WHO.In India, the vaccine received emergency approval in January this year. It was given "restricted use in an emergency situation in the public interest", which raised questions and was also seen as contributing to vaccine hesitancy that marked the early stages of India's vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopefully-soon-niti-aayog-s-vk-paul-on-who-emergency-approval-for-covaxin-101624886573040.html

The issue has multiple dimensions and we are trying to find an agreed way forward at the earliest, Paul said in a weekly press briefing.The Covid-19 task force chief said that the government is trying to expedite the progress in every possible way.This comes almost a week after US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said it is in the "final stages" of getting approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in India.Pfizer chief executive officer (CEO) Albert Bourla said he hopes the company will finalize an agreement with the Indian government soon."Pfizer now in final stages to get approval for Covid-19 vaccine in India. I hope very soon we will finalize an agreement with the government," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said at the 15th Annual BioPharma and Healthcare Summit.The vaccine was developed by Pfizer in partnership with the German firm BioNtech. It has a very high efficacy of over 90 per cent in preventing the infection.India is still at the stage where indemnity issues need to be sorted out with respect to approving the vaccines made by foreign companies.Paul also said the process of getting Bharat Biotech's Covaxin Emergency Use Listing (EUL) certificate from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is proceeding well.At present, India is using three Covid-19 vaccines, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, Covishield by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Russia's Sputnik V, for vaccinating people against the coronavirus disease.Drug major Dr Reddy's Laboratories on Monday announced the commercial launch of Covid-19 treatment drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), at a maximum retail price of ₹990 per sachet.The company will supply the drug to major government as well as private hospitals across India, Dr Reddy's said in a regulatory filing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-discussing-ways-to-approve-pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-govt-101624881811763.html
28-06-2021||India||Covid-19: To revive tourism, govt waives off visa fee for 5 lakh tourists||In a bid to revive tourism sector in India, the government will provide free visas to the first five lakh tourists visiting the country, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Monday. The scheme will come into effect once the international travel resumes, she said in a press conference in Delhi.It will remain applicable till March 31, 2022, or after distribution of the first 5 lakh visas, whichever is earlier, she also said, adding that an international tourist will be allowed to avail the benefits only once. The announcements were part of the financial package and new schemes presented by Sitharaman to boost various sectors ravaged by Covid-19.The government will also provide financial support to the more than 11,000 registered tourist guides, travel and tourism stakeholders to revive the tourism sector battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the scheme, a ₹10 lakh loan will be given to travel agencies, while registered tourist guides will be eligible for a loan of ₹1 lakh.The economic measures come as the tourism sector is severely hit by the Covid induced restrictions, especially local tourists guides who make most of the earnings from international visitors. They are a major source of income for them since the percentage of domestic tourists availing of their services is negligible.Last year, domestic tourism picked up slowly post the first lockdown, but after the onset of the second wave of Covid-19 and now the following outbreaks of Delta and Delta plus variants, the sector is still staring at a bleak future.In December last year, the news agency PTI reported that India’s hospitality and tourism sector suffered three-quarters of economic wipeout estimated to be up to ₹15 lakh crore.The impact of Covid-19 has been such that all other segments of tourism -- inbound, outbound, corporate, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), adventure and leisure -- will continue to underperform till the next two quarters, it also reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-to-revive-tourism-govt-waives-off-visa-fee-for-5-lakh-tourists-101624883369870.html
28-06-2021||India||JD(U) to contest UP assembly elections next year||Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) will be contesting the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Party general secretary KC Tyagi said on Monday that while their first choice would be to be accommodated in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), it will still go ahead with its plans even if that does not materialise.“Our first choice will be to contest as part of the NDA, and we hope it works out. We have had old presence in UP since the days of the erstwhile Samata Party, though we did not contest in 2017. We had MLAs in the UP and we also had ministers in the government. The objective is to revive the party beyond Bihar,” he said.In Delhi assembly elections, the JD(U) contested two seats as part of the NDA, but could not open its account. In Jharkhand, it contested 46 of the 81 seats on its own but again, didn’t win even one though.Also Read | Bihar Congress unit set to have new committees ahead of change of guardThe move is significant, as in the UP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unlikely to leave much space for smaller parties even as the Opposition is trying to cobble up a united front to stop it from retaining power. This could also be viewed as rumblings within the NDA, which the Opposition has often flagged, since the 2020 Bihar assembly elections reduced the JD(U) to the third position. It must be noted that the party’s stance vis-a-vis UP elections comes at a time chief minister Nitish Kumar is in New Delhi for eye surgery and there are speculations about the party’s belated induction in the Union cabinet.Earlier this year, the party had planned to contest panchayat polls in UP from some seats in eastern UP with dominance of Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) as a build-up for the assembly polls, but eventually did not do so, said Tyagi.Tyagi said the party was only trying to expand in other states where it has had good organisation in the past. Last year, it suffered at the hands of its ally in Arunachal Pradesh when six of its seven MLAs joined the BJP. In the past, the party has contested from several states, including Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Jharkhand, but saw limited success in Arunachal only.“It may not have won many seats, but it did make its presence felt in several states. The effort is to reach out to more states such as Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Rajasthan, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu and strengthen organisation,” said a senior leader.JD(U) leader and former party spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the decision to expand party base in a planned manner has been under consideration for a long time. “We did fight earlier in many states and performed reasonably well. Now, the party wants to strengthen its organisational base and fight. This is a good move, as there have been such demands from other state units,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-to-contest-up-assembly-elections-next-year-101624883533391.html

Also Read | 1 address used for 3,825 Covid tests at Kumbh: Officials“We submitted documents of Delphia laboratory of Bhiwani, Haryana, with Nalwa laboratory related with Kumbh testing, including one signed on April 11 ,2021, with tempo vehicle no UK07C7737.It is the firm’s letter to local administration, stating that they are authorised for conducting of Covid-19 antigen testing in Kumbh Mela and so the vehicle be allowed movement in Kumbh Mela. Delphia laboratory operating during the Mahakumbh further proves the sub-letting of testing contract by Nalwa which puts a question mark on the testing,” he said. The chief investigating officer of the probe committee, Saurabh Geharwar, said that documents submitted by Sharma were being examined. “We had sought information regarding Kumbh covid testing, so we are examining and considering such submissions,” he said. Max Corporate Services lawyer Apoorva Aggarwal said they had only signed a memorandum of understanding with Nalwa laboratory but if it allowed some another firm without their knowledge, that points at deception. Delphia Laboratory director Ashish Vashishta could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Delphia Laboratory had also provided free diagnostic facilities to the pilgrims visiting Kedarnath shrine in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumbh-fake-testing-social-activist-submits-papers-to-probe-committee-101624883173325.html

She finally filed a complaint in March this year when the accused continued to blackmail her, threatening to release photographs and video clips that he had shot.The police appeared hesitant to act on the complaint, said Johny, India’s first female athlete to cross the 14-metre barrier in the triple jump. She has represented the country at the Asian Games and the Olympics continues to hold the current Indian national record for triple jump for female athletes and was awarded Kerala’s highest sporting event, the GV Raja Awards for 2019.“When we approached Josephine, she promised us strong action. But later, for reasons best known to her, she started talking in favour of the accused,” she said, alleging that Josephine played a key role in averting his arrest.MC Josephine, a central committee member of Kerala’s ruling party CPI (M), did not respond to repeated requests for her version. Josephine ran into trouble last week after her “then you suffer” remark to a domestic violence survivor during a live television show.Johny said she was forced to call a press conference for her friend after they appeared to have run out of options. “My friend has married two years ago but he still harasses her and threatens to release her photographs. I was also threatened for taking up her cause,” she said. Her friend sat by her side at the briefing.“The accused is an influential man. Now the police are asking for evidence and blame us for not approaching them soon after the crime. We feel bad when he roams around freely and continues to threaten the victim,” she said.Asked about Johny’s complaints, a senior Thrissur police officer said they are still investigating the case. “We are collecting evidence,” said the officer, insisting that they were yet to tie what he described as “some loose ends in the woman’s statement”. He also pointed that it was difficult to collect evidence in such cases after a long gap between the alleged crime and the offence. At the briefing, Johny said the police should seize his phone that was used to record the crime and other devices. “They will get enough evidence once they seize his phone and track his call records,” said Mayookha Johny, reasoning that if he was threatening to release her photos and videos, he must have kept them in a device.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-ex-olympian-seeks-justice-for-rape-survivor-attacks-josephine-101624883054281.html

The government has said that Delta Plus is present in 12 countries. What makes this variant a worry is the fact that it spreads more rapidly than the previous known variants. Delta Plus also has the ability to fight some vaccines and therapies being offered in different countries, and shows greater affinity towards lung tissues.Most of the cases of Delta Plus variant have been found on three states - Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. The Maharashtra government has tightened restrictions with effect from Monday, allowing essential shops to remain open only till 4 pm on all days.The entire state has been put under 'level 3' restrictions, a state government notification said.Restaurants are allowed to operate dine-in facility with 50 per cent capacity till 4 pm on weekdays and takeaways and home deliveries after that, according to the order.Former ICMR chief Dr Raman Gangakhedkar said on Sunday that there is no need to panic due to the spread of the Delta Plus variant. He was speaking at a webinar on Covid-19, where another doctor said that ICMR data shows 70 per cent of people have developed immunity against coronavirus, and the country appears to be heading towards herd immunity.Delta Plus has already been declared a variant of concern by the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-very-localised-48-cases-found-till-now-says-govt-101624881866771.html

This comes after several meetings between the top Congress leaders and those from Punjab to resolve the ongoing feud between Sidhu and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Rahul Gandhi has stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis in the Punjab unit of the Congress and has been meeting several leaders from the state at his residence. Vijendra Singla, Rana Gurjit Singh, Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dhillon and MLA Lakhvir Singh were among those who met him on Friday.The leaders told the media after the meeting that decisions were made to strengthen the party ahead of the assembly elections due next year in Punjab. Senior party leaders fear that the bitter feud between the two tall Congress leaders in the state may hurt the party's fortunes in the elections.Gandhi earlier met Punjab pradesh Congress committee president Sunil Jakhar, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Harish Rawat.The Congress party has formed a three-member panel headed by Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve the crisis. The panel has already met Amarinder Singh who came to Delhi on a three-day visit. The Punjab chief minister, however, did not meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi.Sidhu quit the Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2019 over change in his portfolio. But he stepped up his attacks in the last few months. The bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 police firing case.His attacks have been public where Sidhu has called the chief minister a liar and accused him of not doing anything about issues like loan waiver.Punjab is crucial for Congress as it is one of the few states where the party is in power and the outcome will have an impact on its prospects outside the state.Assembly elections in Punjab are scheduled to take place next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-to-meet-rahul-and-priyanka-gandhi-amid-congress-infighting-101624880621965.html

Besides, the flagged website mentions its office to be in Chandigarh, a region where the Garib Kalyan initiative has never catered to.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgaar Abhiyaan in June last year with the aim of creating jobs for millions of migrant workers, who returned to their home districts or villages after the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the country on March 24.The programme, which has a monetary outlay of ₹50,000 crore, was launched in six states – Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, covering 116 districts. At the time, PM Modi said that the initiative will be a “focused campaign” and will run in “mission mode” for 125 days.The campaign was launched from Bihar’s Telihar village in Khagaria district, with the state also receiving the highest number of migrant workers – 3 million, after the lockdown was imposed. According to the latest data available on the official Garib Kalyan Rojgaar Abhiyaan’s website, ₹39,293 crore has been utilised of the total ₹50,000 crore budget, and more than 507 million jobs have been generated so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pib-flags-fake-website-of-garib-kalyan-abhiyaan-for-covid-hit-migrant-workers-101624879828073.html

It called for the publishing of the rationale document to bring transparency, and also to allow students to access the assessment criteria and raise grievances with the board well in time, ANI reported.The petition has been moved in an ongoing Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in which the court had issued notice to CBSE and the Centre. The PIL has sought direction for modification in policy for the tabulation of marks for Class 10 board exams based on the internal assessment conducted by the school.Meanwhile, union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal recently said on a live video chat that students who are dissatisfied with their Class 10 and12 results can appear for physical exams that would likely be conducted in August if the situation is favourable.The CBSE had cancelled Class 10 and 12 board exams in view of rising Covid-19 cases in the country.

Most of these drones are used by Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). On Sunday, two drones carried out attacks at the Air Force Station in Jammu, which the investigators have linked to LeT.HT Exclusive: Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicoptersOne such drone activity was thwarted by alert Indian security forces in Hiranagar sector of Jammu in June last year.The drone, which was shot down by the Border Security Force (BSF), fell into an open field. A forensic analysis of that drone was carried out by Delhi-based Drone Federation of India (DFI), which said that it was a locally assembled hexacopter. The components used are easily available in hobby shops, it added.The flight controller of the 24kg drone was CubeBlack, manufactured in Hong Kong. It also said that no pre-planned mission was set in the drone and it was controlled manually using the ground control system. It also said that the drone operator had disabled all modes of data extraction.The DFI further said that the estimated radius for takeoff was 10km beyond visual line of sight operation. The drone was in air for 35 minutes, said DFI, adding that the maximum possible range was 30 km. The DFI experts did not find any external hacking or custom firmware on the drone.The experts further said that based on the labelling of the components on the drone found in June last year, they observed that the drones are being created in batches.Top security officials have said that as many as 14 drone sorties have been made by Pakistani terror groups.Late on Sunday night, a fresh attempt to attack a military installation with the help of drones was foiled by the security forces. The personnel stationed at Ratnuchak-Kaluchak station fired at two unmanned aerial vehicles that flew away.The first drone was sighted around 11.45pm and the second one, at around 2.40am, said officials.

28-06-2021||India||Govt looking into Twitter displaying wrong map of India||The ministry of electronics and information is looking into the issue of Twitter displaying a wrong map of India, an official familiar with the matter said on Monday. The misrepresentation caused an uproar online amid the ongoing impasse between the government and the microblogging platform. The map, which shows Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country, is available on the company’s website under careers sections on the page titled Tweep Life. HT reached out to Twitter but did not receive a response immediately. This is the second time Twitter has misrepresented India’s map. In October last year, the Centre had served Twitter with a notice over the geotag for Leh showing it as a part of China. Writing to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the Centre on October 22 conveyed its “disappointment regarding the misrepresentation of the map of India”. It also asked Twitter to explain why action should not be taken against it and the micro-blogging site resolved the issue.Also Read | Twitter appoints American Jeremy Kessel as new grievance officer for IndiaIn December last year, the government warned Wikipedia for misrepresenting the country’s borders.Since it was a particular page, it issued Wikipedia an order to scrap it. “The secretary further adds that it violates the territorial integrity of the country, and it is well within the power of the ministry under section 69A to order it to be be taken down,” HT quoted one of the ministry officials as saying then.The current map fiasco comes at a time when the company is engaged in an escalating battle with the government over the new controversial social media and intermediary guidelines. The ministry has asserted that the social media firm has failed to comply with the guidelines, which can result in it losing the safe harbour protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act. Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by BJP leaders as manipulated media. Twitter’s grievance redressal officer Dharmendra Chatur also stepped down over the weekend, prompting the firm to hire a new official. Assistant professor of political science at the University of Albany, Christopher Clary, however, said that according to analysis, Twitter was also misrepresenting the map of the US. “By this analysis, I guess Twitter is also showing at least 10 American states as separate countries,” Clary tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looking-into-twitter-displaying-wrong-map-of-india-101624876452497.html
28-06-2021||India||High court pulls up Goa government for hounding ‘whistleblower’||The Bombay high court at Goa pulled up the state on Monday for hounding a government employee who blew whistle on state-run sewerage corporation, which was discharging untreated sewage into a low lying water body, with the help of official documents. The court said it was unfortunate that the government filed a case of theft of documents against the employee in 2012 displaying intent to shoot the messenger instead of acting on the message.“You should welcome such government servants. Instead of hounding the messenger you should take the message. [Why] go against this person. This is not the way. You should [instead] reward him. Are these some documents under the Official Secrets Act?” the high court asked the state government and added: “Instead of remedying the situation, you are going after the government servant.”A staff nurse at the Goa Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour, Uday Chari, exposed the sewerage corporation’s malpractice in 2012 using field water quality test reports that the government claims he obtained without authorisation.The reports proved that the public works department was releasing untreated sewage into the open water bodies and fields, leading to water contamination beyond permissible limits, resulting in stench and pollution of the creek in the outskirts of the capital city.The state slapped him with a case of theft of documents and it has been pending ever since. Chari in 2020 approached the high court seeking quashing of the FIR filed against him.“The very ingredients necessary for this case to be registered as a theft were not made out and further this was a case only to victimise me for taking up this issue,” Advocate Ryan Menezes, who represented Chari told the court.While hearing Chari’s plea, the HC asked if the state government was beyond criticism.“You are pursuing this from 2012 and 2021. Are you trying to say that if somebody goes against the government then you will file complaints against them? Do the government departments have no other work?” the bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalikar, said.The Goa government stuck to its stand and said a government servant was free to take up a public cause “but it had to be[done] through public channels.”“The offence is made out and there is no case for quashing,” advocate G Nagvenkar told the court.After hearing the government’s argument the HC said it was “inclined to quash the prosecution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-pulls-up-goa-government-for-hounding-whistleblower-101624875792830.html

28-06-2021||India||Arunachal child home refuses court order to send rape survivor to kin of accused||A childcare home in Arunachal Pradesh has politely refused to comply with a local court’s June 4 order to hand over a minor rape survivor to a relative of the accused, claiming it will further traumatise her. The childcare home has instead requested the court to appoint a neutral person as the guardian of the minor, whose rescue after years of sexual exploitation is mired in allegations of mishandling of the case.The 14-year-old Nepali citizen was trafficked to India many years ago and allegedly raped repeatedly by a government employee, at whose residence she worked as a domestic help. She somehow fled from his residence located in Roing of Lower Dibang Valley district in March this year, following which the accused was jailed and the matter reached the court. The court’s ruling on her custody has however left the childcare center protesting. “On June 4, a session court at Tezu in Lohit district asked us to hand over the child, who has been with us since March this year, to her local guardian, who is the sister-in-law of the accused. The child is already traumatized by her ordeal and handing her over to a relative of the accused, who is out on bail, could hurt her further,” said Desai Linggi, chairperson, Nani Maria Children Home (NMCH). Noting the non-compliance, the court issued a notice to NMCH on June 23 and asked them to appear in person on the next date of hearing in the case on June 29. Lingi pointed out that the accused was currently out on bail and there was a genuine need to appoint a “neutral” local guardian. “Since we were not shown any documents to verify the identity of the local guardian and also because she, [the local guardian named by the child’s father] was the sister-in-law of the accused, we have not complied with the order and instead asked the court to appoint another local guardian who isn’t related to the accused,” she added. Child rights experts have alleged mishandling of the sensitive case and pointed out that the accused was currently on bail and had contacted the daycare centre urging them to hand over the child to him so that she could be sent back to Nepal. Not just that, he was also playing host to the father of the survivor, who had arrived from Nepal after his daughter’s suffering came to light in March following her escape. The brother of the accused, his sister-in-law and the minor girl’s father have also been visiting the child at the childcare home. During her counselling sessions at NMCH, the child reportedly said that she doesn’t want to go with her father or the local guardian. NMCH officials also alleged that the minor survivor’s statement was recorded in the court of the local chief judicial magistrate in absence of her confidante as is required under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.Recent developments and alleged mishandling of the case has led the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (APSCPCR) to send a team from Itanagar to Roing to probe the entire matter. “We have learnt that the norms required to be followed while recording the statement of a child by a magistrate were not followed. This is wrong,” said Gurmi Ringu, chairperson of APSCPCR. The child was working at the house of the accused for a sum of ₹1,500 per month, which was supposedly being sent to her parents in Nepal, claimed NMCH officials.According to NMCH officials, the rape survivor managed to escape two years ago and sought shelter in a house few kilometres away but the family returned her to the accused. She again managed to escape in March this year and took shelter in another house.After she disclosed her ordeal to the family, the matter reached the district child welfare committee, which decided to place her in the childcare centre, and lodged a case against the accused. A medical examination then revealed that the child, between 12-15 years of age, had been raped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-child-home-refuses-court-order-to-send-rape-survivor-to-kin-of-accused-101624872792500.html

Under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, social media intermediaries have to appoint an official to address complaints from Indian subscribers.On May 31, Twitter brought Chatur as the grievance officer for India. Before this, he was a partner at a law firm that represented Twitter.Kessel's appointment is coming at a time when the micro-blogging company is engaged in a rift with the central government over the new IT rules, which came into effect on May 23. The government has slammed Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country’s new guidelines that mandate appointments of chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with over 500 million users.Recently, the US giant also lost its intermediary status in India making the company liable for any unlawful user-generated content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-jeremy-kessel-as-new-grievance-officer-for-india-101624871064778.html

Many steps are being taken by the Centre to bring investment and improve infrastructure here,” the Union minister said, according to ANI.Singh, who is on a three-day visit to Ladakh and is currently in Leh, earlier in the day, inaugurated 63 infra projects constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The defence minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon chair a meeting with the political leaders of Ladakh to discuss conducting polls in the Union territory. “PM Modi wants the political process to start in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh,” he said, pointing out that the Prime Minister has already spoken to the political parties of Jammu and Kashmir.On Sunday, the defence minister interacted with 300 veterans, including Ashok Chakra winner Naib Subedar (Honorary) Chhering Mutup (retd) and Maha Vir Chakra winner Colonel Sonam Wangchuk (retd) in Leh.Praising the veterans for their “unparalleled dedication” to ensure the safety and security of the country, Singh said PM Modi’s decision to introduce the ‘One Rank One Pension’ scheme was a testimony to the central government’s unwavering commitment towards the welfare and satisfaction of the veterans. “Our aim is to take care of you in the same way as you all have taken care of the country,” the minister added during the interaction.This development comes after the recent meeting in New Delhi between PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah with the political parties of Jammu and Kashmir – the first of its kind after the abrogation of Article 370. Several senior leaders including National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah, and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, among others, were present in the meeting that lasted for more than three hours.“We kept five demands in the meeting – grant statehood soon, conduct Assembly elections to restore democracy, rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits in J&K, all political detainees should be released and on domicile rules," Azad said after the meeting concluded.Notably, a person familiar with the happenings of the meeting and who asked to remain anonymous mentioned that at the meeting PM Modi said he wants to remove Dilli ki Doori (the distance from Delhi) and also Dil ki Doori (the distance from the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorism-one-of-the-main-reasons-behind-making-ladakh-a-ut-rajnath-singh-101624866759366.html

Here’s when 12-18-yr-olds can get jabbed||Zydus Cadila is expected to complete the trial of its Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, by the end of next month and children above 12 years can be vaccinated against the coronavirus in August, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) chief Dr NK Arora has said. "Trial will almost complete till July-end and in August, we will be able to vaccinate children aged between 12-18 years," Arora said, according to news agency ANI.Zydus Cadila’s Covid-19 vaccine will become the fourth one to get a nod for use against the viral infection in India, if approved by the Drugs Controller General of India. The company has so far not released any data from its trials. The company’s Covid-19 vaccine, once approved, will be the second indigenously developed one to receive clearance in the country and the first DNA vaccine in the world. It will be a three-dose vaccine and will have to be administered intradermally.AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria told ANI that the Zydus Cadila vaccine is a new platform that is being used and its “something that we should be proud of.” “A platform for which research isn't done in past in our country and now making this new type of vaccine, the data is still being collated and one is hoping that they will be able to submit the data to the DCGI for regulatory approval,” Dr Guleria said.Also read | India's vaccine-related decisions based on science, says NTAGI chairperson“So, one is hopeful and that will depend on the company that how quickly the company is able to collate the data and give it to the regulatory authority,” he added.Arora also said that the government has targeted administering 1 crore doses every day to achieve the target of immunising everyone in the country within a time bracket of six to eight months. He also dispelled vaccination-related rumours as vague and said that vaccines in India are 95 to 96 per cent safe.Also read | When can kids go back to school?: AIIMS director has an answer"It is important that people come forward proactively and take the vaccines, that's absolutely necessary.

28-06-2021||India||Current Covid-19 vaccines may be less effective against Beta variant, says study||A study of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, has indicated that current vaccines may be less effective against the Beta variant. Present on the surface of SARS-COV-2, spike proteins enable the virus to attach to and enter human cells, and all current vaccines are directed against them, it stated.The study, published in the journal Science on June 24, used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to compare the spike protein from the original virus found in China in 2019 with that of the Beta variant and the Alpha variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Cryo-Em is an imaging technique used to determine the biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution.The findings led by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital in the United States indicate that mutations in the Beta variant, also known as B.1.351, change the shape of the spike surface at certain locations. As a result, neutralising antibodies induced by current Covid-19 vaccines are less able to bind to the Beta virus, which may allow it to evade the immune system even when people are vaccinated."The mutations make antibodies stimulated by the current vaccine less effective. The Beta variant is somewhat resistant to the current vaccines, and we think a booster with the new genetic sequence can be beneficial for protecting against this variant," said Bing Chen, from the division of Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's.The researchers also found that mutations in the Beta variant make the spike less effective and thus this variant is less transmissible than the Alpha variant. However, testing indicated that antibodies obtained by existing vaccines can still neutralise this variant, according to the researchers.The research team is now analysing the structures of other variants of concern, including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/current-covid-19-vaccines-may-be-less-effective-against-beta-variant-says-study-101624863038382.html

28-06-2021||India||India successfully test-fires Agni P, a new missile in Agni series||India successfully carried out the test-firing of a new missile in the Agni series known as Agni P on Monday off the coast of Odisha, officials said. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully flight tested the new generation nuclear-capable ballistic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam island at 10:55am off the coast of Odisha. “Various telemetry and radar stations positioned along the eastern coast tracked and monitored the missile. The missile has followed textbook trajectory, meeting all mission objectives with a high level of accuracy,” DRDO said in a statement.Agni P is the first of the new class of Agni missile to be launched by DRDO. The ballistic missile weighs 50% less than Agni 3 and has new guidance and a new generation of propulsion. Since the missile is canisterised, it can be launched from rail and road and stored for a longer period and transported all across the country as per operational requirements.The missile, which has a range between 1000km to 2000km, can be used to target enemy armadas in the Indo-Pacific.Last Friday, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully test-fired an extended range version of indigenously-developed Pinaka rocket at Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur off the coast of Odisha.That day, 25 Enhanced Pinaka rockets, which can destroy targets at distances up to 45 kilometres, were test-fired in quick succession against targets at different ranges on Thursday and Friday.

Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said soldiers opened fire at the two drones but could not bring them down.“Searches were launched early this morning and we are also ascertaining whether they were being operated from a vehicle on the adjoining road,” he added.“On the midnight of 27-28 June, two separate drone activities were spotted over Ratnuchak-Kaluchak military areas by alert troops. Immediately, high alert was sounded and quick reaction teams engaged them with firing. Both the drones flew away,” he said.“A major threat was thwarted by the alertness and proactive approach of troops,” he said, adding the security forces are on high alert, the area has been cordoned off, and a search operation is in progress.Also Read | Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicoptersThe Kaluchak military station was attacked way back on May 14, 2002, by three armed terrorists from Pakistan.

28-06-2021||India||Covishield’s green pass approval by EMA to be discussed on G20 sidelines||The approval of Serum Institute of India (SII)’s Covishield vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to be taken up by the Indian side with the European Union on the margins of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy on June 29, said people familiar with developments. SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla also said on Monday that he has taken up the matter “at the highest level” to ensure Indians don’t face any travel restrictions. “I realise that a lot of Indians who have taken Covishield are facing issues with travel to the EU. I assure everyone, I have taken this up at the highest levels and hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries,” Poonawalla tweeted. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that SII would apply to EMA for certification. Also Read | Dr Reddy’s Laboratories announces commercial launch of anti-Covid drug 2DGExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar and his team are currently in Italy for a meeting of the foreign and development ministers of the G20, which includes 19 countries and the EU. The agenda for the meeting at Matera includes a swift international response to the Covid-19 pandemic and equitable worldwide access to diagnostics and vaccines. The people cited above said the issue of EMA approval is expected to figure in discussions between Indian and EU officials on the margins of the G20 meeting. Travellers vaccinated with Covishield, the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India, are currently ineligible for the EU Digital Covid certificate or “green pass” – an immunity document set to be in place by July 1 to ease travel within and to the 27-member bloc – as EMA has approved only four Covid-19 vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorisation. The position taken by EMA is perplexing because Covishield and Vaxzevria, the AstraZeneca vaccine approved by the European agency, are qualitatively similar in nature, the people said. The Indian side has also reached out to EU authorities and key members of the bloc for greater understanding about the green pass and other national health regulations. The understanding on the Indian side is that the green pass is currently applicable only for intra-EU travel, though there could be a wider rollout at a later stage, and it will initially be available only to citizens of the 27 member states and EU citizens based outside the bloc. The people cited above also said EMA approval was more about processes involving the manufacturer of a vaccine and less about government-to-government understandings. The government can help facilitate the process but it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to seek approval from EMA. “There is still some time, and a solution will likely come soon as the matter is being taken up at different levels,” another government official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. The EMA’s current list of approved vaccines includes Vaxzervria, the AstraZeneca shot produced in the UK and other sites around Europe, Comirnaty or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna shot and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly for the EU Digital Covid certificate on April 29 in response to demands from tourism-dependent countries such as Spain and Greece but questions remain about varying vaccination and testing rules in the 27 member states. Diplomats told Reuters in April that national differences on recognising negative antibody tests on top of PCR tests, technical difficulties in creating a single EU gateway, worries about discrimination against those who have not been vaccinated, and privacy issues meant that finding common ground across the EU might be tricky. The green pass, which was originally known as the “digital green certificate”, will contain information about vaccination, tests and recovery from Covid-19. Reports have said EU citizens will be able to obtain the green pass if they have any one of the three elements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishields-green-pass-approval-by-ema-to-be-discussed-on-g20-sidelines-101624861631690.html

According to police, Deb confessed to organising fake vaccination camps – one at north Kolkata’s City College and another in his office in south Kolkata’s Kasba, news agency ANI reported.“[Deb]…wrote letters to government agencies, [and he] would put receipt stamps on them to convince victims,” police told ANI, adding that Deb would himself pen down a response to the letters he wrote to the government agencies.Police further stated that the accused claimed to have written a mail to Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune for sending Covishield, and that the same is being verified. They said no other fake Covid-19 vaccination camps were organised in the city by Deb besides the ones in City College and Kasba, ANI reported.Meanwhile, a team of police officials conducted a raid at the residence of Debanjan Deb, and seized forged documents of different departments, and some stamps, ANI reported. Besides, three debit cards and bank passbooks were seized from the accused’s residence.Among the recovered stamps, some are of government departments such as Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, Public Works Department, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and West Bengal State Election Commission (WBSEC), ANI reported. Furthermore, as many as eight bank accounts, associated with Deb, have been detected till now and of these, one was in the name of his company WBFINCORP, through which he used to give salary to his staff, police told ANI.According to the ANI report, Deb’s staff and ex-staff are being examined by police. “Ten such persons have been summoned for examination or are being examined,” police said, adding that more people are being examined for “cross-examination.”This development comes after the Kolkata Police on Saturday held three more persons in connection with the fake vaccination racket. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has already been formed to investigate the matter that was busted after Bengali actress and ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mimi Chakraborty along with another TMC leader received fake Covid-19 shots at the camps in north and south Kolkata organised by Deb.Investigation has so far revealed that more than 800 people have received fake jabs, but police said the number could increase. Deb, who was masquerading as an IAS officer, was eventually arrested on Wednesday based on Chakraborty’s complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-fake-covid-19-jab-drive-accused-admitted-to-organising-two-camps-police-101624859751980.html

This comes after the DRDO earlier on June 1 said that the anti-Covid drug is approved for emergency use as an adjunct therapy to the standard of care in the treatment of coronavirus patients in hospital settings."Ideally, 2DG should be prescribed as early as possible by doctors for moderate to severe Covid patients for a maximum duration of up to 10 days," it said.The DRDO further said that uncontrolled diabetes, severe cardiac problem, ARDS, severe hepatic and renal impairment patients have not been studied yet with 2DG, and hence caution should be exercised."The 2DG should not be given to pregnant and lactating women and patients below 18 years," it added.The first batch of DRDO's anti-Covid-19 drug was released on May 17 by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) permitted the emergency use authorisation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), anti-viral drug as an adjunct therapy for moderate to severe coronavirus patients.The 2DG drug comes in powder form in the sachet, which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Its selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique. The drug reportedly reduces a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by up to 40 per cent, the Union health ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-laboratories-announces-commercial-launch-of-anti-covid-drug-2dg-101624858749823.html

28-06-2021||India||Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicopters||Prima facie investigations conducted by security agencies and Jammu and Kashmir Police has revealed the role of Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group in the drone strike at Jammu air base in early hours of Sunday. The drone attack is linked with the recovery of a 6 kilogram IED by Jammu police from an LeT operative leading to detention of at least three terror suspects by J&K Police.While the security agencies and state police are tightlipped about the drone attack, fact is that the Pakistan based terror group was targeting the air traffic control (ATC) tower with one drone and the other was aiming at either the parked IAF helicopter or the radar.“The two IEDs weighing around 5-6 kilograms with RDX as the main explosive charge were dropped at a distance of 50 yards from each other. One charge was some 40 yards from the ATC, while the other was around the same distance from the parked helicopter. The drop was made through a latitude-longitude device and that they missed the targets could be due to faulty execution or high wind factor,” said a senior security official.According to security agencies and state police, the two drones flew from across the border, which is mere 14.5 kilometers away from the Jammu airport, and returned back after the hit. The drone is suspected to be flying at a height of 1.2 kilometers and would have been powered by long range batteries. The drone strike has raised red-flag in the Jammu sector for as many as 14 drone sorties have been made by Pakistani terror groups, majority of them by LeT and two by Jaish-e-Mohammed. “Our estimate is that six sorties with weapon payloads were made in Samba sector, 3 to four in Hiranagar sector, 2 in Nowshera-Rajouri sector and another two in Arnia sector. We have found that the drones are assembled with different Chinese parts used of different makes for deniability. The dropped weapons were meant for Lashkar and Jaish operatives in the Valley with the specific design to disturb peace in Kashmir,” said a top security official.While the Indian security forces have been testing anti-drone jammer technology on the border with Pakistan, the problem faced is that the communications between Indian agencies itself gets jammed as a collateral damage. However, in the era of swarm drones, the Indian security forces are alive to the new threat posed by Pakistani terror groups and are expected to take counter-measures also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-let-behind-drone-attack-in-jammu-target-was-atc-and-parked-iaf-helicopters-101624857978136.html

She said she was under tremendous pressure to hush up the case and had been threatened with implication in trumped-up cases. In her complaint, she said that three months ago, Baburaj came to her house in the guise of discussing an election issue and raped her. She said he raped her several times after threatening her he would tell her husband if she didn’t comply.Also Read | Kerala women’s panel chief resigns after remark stirs rowShe said after Baburaj told DFYI leader Lijesh about this, he also started harassing her and later raped her. She said she thought of killing herself frequently. Later, she said, she mustered courage and told her husband. Both of them approached the police. A senior CPI(M) woman leader from the district , who did not want to be quoted, said the woman got enough courage to approach the police after many women leaders took up the issue. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party have criticised the police for delay in arresting the accused persons, and threatened to launch an agitation.“Police deliberately delayed their arrest due to political pressure. They acted only after protests mounted,” said Congress working president T Siddique.Vadakara deputy superintendent of police Moosa Vallikadan said the investigating team had recorded her detailed statement and there would be a fair probe. “An investigation is on. Her statements will be recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the IPC,” he said. A CPI(M) leader, who requested anonymity, said the law would take its course and refused to comment further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-of-party-worker-2-cpi-m-leaders-arrested-in-kerala-101624858872190.html

28-06-2021||India||Rajasthan CM urges PM Narendra Modi to increase supply of Covid vaccine||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say that the state needed to vaccinate 1.5 million beneficiaries daily if it were to vaccinate the 7 million people due for their second dose by the end of July on time. Gehlot said the Centre was currently on an average supplying 300,000-400,000 vaccines doses daily to the state, which will obstruct the state’s effort to prevent the 3rd wave of Covid-19.“...More than seven million people will be due for their second dose by the end of July, 2021. To ensure time-bound and expeditious vaccination, we have created a capacity to vaccinate over 1.5 million persons per day. Presently our daily vaccination is limited to the extent of supplies received from Central government. The daily average of vaccine doses received, since the start of vaccination drive for 18 years plus, has been 300,000 to 400,000 only,” Gehlot wrote.The Central government reversed the vaccination procurement policy after persistent complaints by states over its pricing and availability in the open market. From June 21 onwards, Centre is procuring and providing vaccine doses to states, based on their vaccination rate in the past and future needs. The Central government has told states that it will distribute 120 million doses including 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin to all states and Union Territories for the month of July.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has been sharing the estimated number of vaccine doses available in a particular month with states before the start of the month as part of its advance visibility plan so that states and UTs can prepare and schedule vaccinations accordingly.Gehlot’s letter states that the state has been recognised for demonstrating “exemplary” Covid management and is among the best performers in vaccination drive, having inoculated over 236 million people till date while achieving a negative (less than 0%) wastage.Negative wastage indicates optimum utilisation by using more than the minimum number of doses present in a vial of vaccine. Wastage of vaccine doses, which was initially very high for several states, was cited by experts as one of the reasons for states running out of doses before time.India has so far administered 371.8 million doses to 265.4 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 209 million people have received one dose, while 56.4 million people have been fully vaccinated till Sunday morning, according to government data. The Centre has, however, said it plans to scale up vaccinations to reach about 10 million doses in a single day by August. An average of over 6 million doses have been administered every day in the country between June 21 and June 27 after the new phase of the government’s vaccine drive came into effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-urges-pm-narendra-modi-to-increase-supply-of-covid-vaccine-101624856051690.html

More than 2,048,960 vaccine doses are in the pipeline and will be received by the states/UTs within the next three days.During his Mann Ki Baat radio address on Sunday, PM Modi also sought to address the issue of vaccine hesitancy by encouraging people to “believe in science” and scientists who developed the shots during the pandemic.Meanwhile, the chief of the country’s Covid-19 task force, Dr NK Arora, has said that the third wave of the pandemic could be delayed until December. “We have a window of 6-8 months to vaccinate everybody in the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statesuts-given-315-million-covid-vaccine-doses-till-now-101624855931789.html

28-06-2021||India||When can kids go back to school?: AIIMS director has an answer||AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has said vaccination is the way out of the coronavirus pandemic as he gave a timeline for the availability of jabs for children against Covid-19, which so far has not affected them in a big way. Guleria acknowledged that children have lost on learning out as schools have remained shuttered in the last one-and-half years because of the pandemic. “Schools have to be reopened and vaccination can play an important role in that,” the senior doctor was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The chief of India’s premier All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences said that making the Covid-19 vaccine available for children will be a milestone achievement and pave the way for the reopening of schools and resumption of outdoor activities for them.Guleria also said vaccines could be available for children in India around September when data from Phase two and three trials of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin on those in the age group of two to 18 years is expected. The Covid-19 vaccine could be given to children after the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DGCI’s) approval, Dr Guleria said. "If the Pfizer vaccine gets approval before that, then it can also be an option for children," Dr Guleria told PTI on Saturday.Also read | Possible 3rd wave of Covid unlikely to affect children, reveals WHO-AIIMS surveyThe news agency cited a senior government official as saying that Zydus Cadila is may also soon apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) for emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, which it claims can be given to both adults and children. "So, if the Zydus vaccine gets approval, it will be another option," Dr Guleria said.NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said earlier this month that along with Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadila's jab is also being tested on children. "Child cohort is not a small one. My rough guess is that if it is between 12 to 18 years, this itself is about 13 to 14 crore population for which we will need about 25-26 crore doses. We cannot have some people getting and others not getting. So we will have to take this into account when we strategize and make a decision based on how many doses of which vaccines are available,” Paul said.He further shared that not only Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadila's vaccine is also being tested on children."So when Zydus comes for licensure soon, maybe we have enough data to take a view on whether the vaccine can be given in children," Paul said.Only Pfizer’s vaccine is approved for use in children across the world.Also read | Children can get and spread Covid infection': Centre clarifies 3 points amid 3rd waveSeveral experts have said that children will be affected the most in a possible third wave of the pandemic. A State Bank of India (SBI) research document has also said that children could be the next vulnerable group in the third wave, which could be as severe as the second and last for an average duration of 98 days. In its five-page report, SBI said the impact of any possible third wave of the pandemic could be significantly minimised by rigorous vaccination and providing better health infrastructure.Also read | Need more data to begin Covid-19 vaccination for children at large: ICMR DG“So vaccination should be the key priority, especially for the children who could be the next vulnerable group.

The government has said that even though Covid-19 has not impacted children greatly so far but if the coronavirus’ behaviour changes or there are shifts in epidemiology dynamics they are likely to be affected.

The relaxations include re-opening places of worship and malls in four districts and resumption of public transport in 23 other districts.The Tamil Nadu government also allowed the re-opening of textile showrooms and jewellery shops in 23 districts of the state from Monday as part of the relaxation in lockdown norms. The additional relaxation was given following pleas and opinions from people and traders' bodies, an official release said, reports news agency PTI.The government has categorised 38 districts into three separate groups keeping in view the Covid-19 cases for the purpose of easing curbs.Since June 14, the Tamil Nadu government has allowed more relaxations for 27 districts and it includes re-opening of government-run retail liquor outlets and salons. Following a gradual decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases, the government has been relaxing curbs in a phased manner.Here's a look at the new Covid-19 guidelines:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-reopens-malls-gyms-and-religious-places-from-today-101624843447788.html
28-06-2021||India||Jammu airbase attack: Use of drones poses new security risk||Rahul Singhrahul.singh@hindustantimes.comNEW DELHI The attack on an Indian Air Force base in Jammu on Sunday — believed to be the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility — is a watershed in asymmetric warfare and underlines the need for the armed forces to build capabilities to deter, detect and neutralise such aerial threats, people familiar with the developments said.While the IAF has officially only confirmed that two low-intensity explosions took place in the technical area of Jammu air force station, senior officials and experts said that the attack appeared to have been carried out using drones and marked a new chapter in Pakistan’s proxy war against India in Jammu and Kashmir.It is a serious and dangerous development, and steps need to be taken to deal with the drone threat, said Air Vice Marshal Sunil Nanodkar (retired), a former assistant chief of air staff. “It appears to be a trial run by the adversary to gauge India’s capability to detect small targets that can fly across the border and target Indian installations.”It is no secret that Pakistan-backed terrorist groups and its Inter-Services Intelligence have been using drones to smuggle arms, ammunition and drugs across the border into J&K and Punjab, but never have drones been used before for attacking a military base.“We need to beef up our surveillance capabilities, especially to pick up radar signatures of small drones that are capable of causing significant damage. The military also needs to invest in anti-drone capability,” Nanodkar said.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed anti-drone technology to disable or shoot down hostile drones. The anti-drone system, which was deployed during 2020 Republic Day and Independence Day, has a range of two to three kilometres with radar capability to pick up the drone and then use frequencies to jam the unmanned aerial vehicle.The attack comes four months after the Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on February 25 that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control from the midnight of February 24.“The ceasefire is meaningless if the new tactic is to carry out such attacks. The adversary appears to be testing not just what damage these drones are capable of causing but also India’s response,” said a senior official, one of the people cited above.A top official said that the investigation into the Jammu attack was being conducted on highest priority. Defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to IAF vice chief Air Marshal HS Arora regarding the Jammu incident even as Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Vivek Chaudhari flew from Delhi to Jammu to take stock of the situation.In February, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane talked about the imaginative and offensive use of drones in Idlib and then in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. In Syria’s Idlib, Turkish forces had successfully used drones to carry out attacks against Syrian tanks, air defence systems and other assets. Also, Azerbaijan made extensive use of Kamikaze drones to target and inflict losses on Armenian forces in a conflict last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-airbase-attack-use-of-drones-poses-new-security-risk-101624844387551.html

According to officials, the attack is believed to be the first-ever use of drones to target an Indian military facility.Multiple teams, including a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), joined the probe and Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police Dilbag Singh said that the twin blasts were part of a “terror attack”.Here is what we know about the blasts so far:-- The first of the two blasts took place around 1.37am on Sunday. The second, which was lower in intensity, followed after a few minutes at 1.42am.-- The blasts were reported at the high-security technical area of the Jammu airport that is manned by the IAF in the Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.-- A bomb disposal squad and forensic experts rushed to the spot soon after the blasts were reported.-- The blasts put defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief air chief marshal RKS Bhadauria and vice air chief air marshal HS Arora among other top officials in action. All are reported to be monitoring the situation constantly.-- A high-level IAF team is also looking into the incident. “There was no damage to any equipment. An investigation is in progress along with civil agencies,” the IAF’s official Twitter handle said.-- The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the case, according to DG Dilbag Singh. “A drone with payload in both the blasts at Jammu airfield is suspected to have dropped the explosive material. The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.-- Two suspects were detained by the J&K police on Sunday for questioning. The “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area”, according to an official concerned.The blasts come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the top political parties of the Union territory and announced that that election would be held there once delimitation is carried out, two years after the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-iaf-station-blasts-drones-used-to-carry-out-terror-attacks-2-detained-101624838814674.html

He said the trial was almost complete and the government might be able to start administering this vaccine to children of 12-18 age group by end of July. “Trial for Zydus Cadila vaccine is almost complete. By July end or in August, we might be able to start administering this vaccine to children of 12-18 age group,” Arora said.Zydus Cadila is likely to soon apply for emergency use authorisation for its vaccine ZyCoV-D, which it claims can be given to both adults and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-wave-likely-to-be-delayed-may-hit-by-dec-govt-body-chief-101624841266259.html

28-06-2021||India||Jammu IAF station hit by 2 explosions||Security agencies were investigating the suspected use of drones by terrorists after two “low-intensity” explosions hit an Indian Air Force station in Jammu on Sunday, leaving two IAF personnel injured and prompting multiple teams to join the probe.The explosions hit the station a little after 1:30am on Sunday and caused minor damage to a building, with security experts and officials saying this could be the first time drones were used in an attack on a major installation in the country.Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police Dilbag Singh said that the twin blasts at the IAF’s technical airport was a “terror attack”. It was reported at the high-security technical area of the Jammu airport that is manned by the IAF in Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.“A drone with payload in both the blasts at Jammu airfield is suspected to have dropped the explosive material. The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.The first blast at the airport, which is used for VVIP movement and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1:37am, causing minor damage to the roof of a building, and the second one – said to be weaker in intensity – was reported at 1:42am in an open area, according to an IAF official.Singh said the police and other agencies were working with IAF officials to ascertain the specifics. A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also at the spot.The air force said the blasts were also being probed by a high-level IAF team. “There was no damage to any equipment. Investigation is in progress along with civil agencies,” the IAF’s official Twitter handle said.There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts indicated that drones have previously not been engaged by terrorists to carry out attacks.Following a series of back-channel contacts between Indian and Pakistani security officials, the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. The truce has largely held, helping to ease bilateral tensions, though recent reports have suggested the back-channel contacts have stalled.Pakistan has also issued several strong statements in recent weeks about what it claims were the Indian government’s plans to carry out more changes in Jammu and Kashmir. India has rejected these statements, noting that Kashmir is an integral part of the country and Pakistan’s comments amounted to interference in internal affairs.On Sunday, the J&K Police said they had detained two people for questioning over the blasts. An official, who asked not to be named, said the “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area”.Another official said that the first blast created a hole in the rooftop of the building, indicating the use of “adequate amount of explosives”.Soon after the second blast, a bomb disposal squad and forensic experts rushed to the site, the official said on condition of anonymity.The incident comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir that elections would be held there once delimitation is carried out, two years after the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked.Defence minister Rajnath Singh is currently in Leh to take stock of the security scenario. A senior official said in New Delhi that the defence minister was expected to review the security situation in Jammu. The defence minister’s office said he spoke to Vice Air Chief, Air Marshal HS Arora, over the airport incident.It was not immediately clear from where the drones took off and investigations were underway to track their flight path, an official told news agency PTI.Investigators scanned CCTV footage, including from cameras installed on the boundary walls of the airport. The aerial distance from the Jammu airport to the international border is about 14km, the official said.While officials were investigating the drone attack, a person, suspected to be linked to Lashker-e-Taiba, was arrested along with an improvised explosive device (IED) weighing around 6kg, the DGP said.“The suspect has been detained and is being interrogated. More suspects are likely to be picked up in this foiled IED blast attempt,” Singh said.The Jammu airport is a civil airport with the runway and the ATC (air traffic control) under the IAF.Jammu airport’s director Pravat Ranjan Beuria told PTI there was no disruption in flight operations due to the explosions. “Flights to and from Jammu airport are operating as per schedule,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-iaf-station-hit-by-2-explosions-101624835090782.html
28-06-2021||India||Number Theory: North-east, Delhi have biggest rain shortfall this year||In India, June 1 to September 30 is officially considered as the monsoon season. The actual amount of rainfall during this period varies from year to year. The first month of the monsoon this year has been exceptionally good – in total, monsoon rainfall until June 27 this year (up to 8.30am) is 173.15 mm.This is the 20th highest cumulative rainfall for this period since 1901, the earliest period for which data is available with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).To be sure, not all parts of India have received abundant rains. Delhi, which is perhaps having the worst phase of an extended summer season right now, is among one of them. But it is not the only rainfall deficit region. North-eastern states have the biggest rainfall deficit this monsoon season. Here are four charts which summarise the progress of the monsoon so far.Windfall gain in cumulative rainfall seems to be evaporatingBecause rains vary each year, the standard practice to measure yearly variation is to compare a year’s rainfall with what is called the Long Period Average (LPA). This is the rainfall over a region in a given interval averaged over a long time period – IMD currently uses data from 1961 to 2010 as LPA. The year’s monsoon began with a bang. Rainfall on June 1 was 83.7% more than the LPA and 18th highest in absolute terms since 1901. However, it lost momentum in the first week – on June 8, cumulative rainfall was 23.8% more than LPA. This mark-up increased to 46.8% by June 20 and was at 22.9% on June 27. As stated above, cumulative rainfall so far is the 20th highest since 1901.The headline rainfall number hides regional variationsNot all regions have received higher than usual rainfall though. An HT analysis of IMD’s gridded database – each grid is a box covering 0.25 degrees longitude and latitude on the map – brings this out clearly. Of the 613 districts in the 2011 census (Delhi’s districts merged as one, while 19 districts are too small or irregular in shape to be captured by a grid) for which this calculation is possible, 305 have received “excess” to “large excess” rainfall compared to the LPA. The remaining 308 districts have received “normal” to “large deficient” rain. Most districts with a large excess of rainfall so far are located in the gangetic plains or in central India. “Large excess” rainfall has been reported in 12 of 13 districts in Uttarakhand, 41 of 71 districts in Uttar Pradesh, 27 of 38 districts in Bihar, 10 of 24 districts in Jharkhand, 4 of 19 districts in West Bengal, and 23 of 50 districts in Madhya Pradesh.At the state level, Manipur has the biggest shortfall in cumulative rainfall, while Delhi is ranked second. Many other north-eastern states also have a deficit rainfall when compared to the LPA. To be sure, a higher percentage deficit with the LPA does not tell us anything about the actual rainfall in a region, because LPAs themselves vary drastically. For example, even with a 57% deficit from LPA, Manipur cumulative rainfall is 109.7 mm, much more than Delhi’s 23.32 mm which has a 53.1% deficit from LPA.Heavy rainfall days have not seen a big jump so farThe nature of rain matters as much as the quantity of rain in a monsoon season. Theoretically, cumulative rainfall will be the same whether it rains in short spells consistently, or very heavily over just a few days. Heavy rainfall also causes damage such as flashfloods and waterlogging. The IMD actually classifies rainfall as light intensity (or of 7.5mm or less in 24 hours in a grid), moderate intensity (7.5mm-35.5 mm in 24 hours in a grid) and heavy and extreme intensity (greater than 35.5mm in 24 hours in a grid). An HT analysis shows that in absolute terms, it is light and moderate rain, which has been exceptionally high this year – ranked 5th and 10th highest respectively since 1901. Heavy and extreme rainfall this monsoon so far is only 37th highest. In terms of the share of these intensities in total rainfall, the share of heavy and extreme rainfall is the 24th lowest. As is to be expected, there are regional variations here as well. The share of heavy and extreme rainfall this year is the 10th highest since 1901 in Uttarakhand, and 22nd highest in Bihar and 25th highest in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-delhi-have-biggest-rain-shortfall-this-year-101624834290173.html
28-06-2021||India||Covishield may not be eligible for ‘vaccine passport’ by the EU||Travellers vaccinated with Covishield, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine manufactured in India, may not be eligible for the European Union’s “Green Pass” – an immunity document that is meant to ease travel within and to the bloc, according to reports citing official rules.The European Union had earlier said that member states can issue the certificates regardless of the type of Covid-19 vaccine, but the technical specifications indicate that the pass will be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization”.At present, four vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that can be used by the EU member states to issue the certificates. These are Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca-Oxford), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson).Vaxzevria and Covishield are both the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines. While the India-made Covishield has not been recognised by the EMA yet, the Vaxzevria version of the Astrazeneca shot produced and manufactured in the UK or other sites around Europe is approved, the reports said.A majority of people in India have received Covishield, manufactured locally by Pune-based Serum Institute of India.It is, however, unclear how much of an impact these certificates will have on Indian travellers. The certificate is mainly meant for EU citizens but other countries can obtain the certificate too — if they can convince authorities in an EU country they’re entering that they qualify for one.Covishield is also at the core of the World Health Organization’s Covax programme meant to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.While these four vaccines have been approved by EMA, countries within the 27-member bloc can accept other vaccines as part of their own travel rules, the reports added.The EU has been working for months on the joint digital travel certificate for those vaccinated, freshly tested, or recently recovered from the virus. The free certificates, which will contain a QR code with advanced security features, will allow people to move between European countries without having to quarantine or undergo extra coronavirus tests.Several EU countries have already begun using the system, including Spain, Germany, Greece, and Poland. The rest are expected to start using it July 1.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-may-not-be-eligible-for-vaccine-passport-by-the-eu-101624822761510.html
28-06-2021||India||US, Kuwait deported nearly 4,000 Indians after Covid-19 pandemic broke||Thousands of Indians, mostly in the US and Kuwait, were deported to the country via special flights after completing their prison term during the past year, according to a report compiled by the external affairs ministry’s Covid Cell unit mentioning the flight operations during the Covid pandemic.The US and Kuwait alone sent back 4,000 deportees. Some Indians also returned by amnesty flights, said the report compiled by the external affairs ministry giving details about the Vande Bharat Mission, India’s largest repatriation exercise launched on 7 May last year to bring back citizens stranded abroad due to the pandemic.“These flights were mostly operated by Govt. of Kuwait to send to India those people who had turned illegal on expiry of their visa in that country. The Govt. of Kuwait paid for these amnesty flights and also indicated that the workers on return to India could re-apply for work visa at a later date,” the report said.“Another category of people who returned to India were deportees, a category of people who, upon completion of a prison sentence in their country, needed to be brought back to India by special flights at the expenses of the sending countries,” it added.HT has reviewed the ministry’s review report that documents the execution of VBM that was announced suddenly, the dilemma of the state governments, and the challenges encountered in the evacuation of citizens and the workarounds adopted.The states were preoccupied with inter-state movement of migrant workers and were faced with the dilemma of allowing stranded Indians return home while migrant workers at home were still held back and facing hardships,” it said, noting that the states feared “political backlash” for restraining movement of internal migrant workers while allowing VBM returnees.According to the aviation ministry the repatriation exercise, which has brought 2.06 million passengers to India so far, is currently in its 11th phase. But the most critical phase of the operation was completed by December 2020 when most Indians were brought back. The repatriation flights were later termed as international flights under bilateral “air bubble” arrangements with 24 countries. In addition, about 100 patients were also brought into the country by air ambulances for medical treatment.The report acknowledged that Indians in remote areas of Latin America and Caribbean countries, West Africa and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries could not be covered because of geographical distances and logistical hurdles due to internal lockdowns in these regions.“Also, VBM operations to specific locations in those regions were not found to be economically viable. Gathering stranded Indians to a hub, say, to either Panama City or Sao Paulo was explored but found not feasible. Plans to bring them to the US and put them on VBM flights did not materialise for the same reasons as well as due to visa issues… Ethiopian Airlines with an extensive network in African region was useful in bringing back stranded Indians in remote parts,” it said.The report underlined that the return of Indians by foreign carriers required approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The Covid Cell headed by the external affairs ministry, which was coordinating the repatriation of citizens, had to go to the civil aviation regulator for approvals on a case-by-case basis, notwithstanding DGCA’s reluctance to encourage these options that may inadvertently pose competition to VBM flights.“It required considerable persuasion with DGCA to get approvals on a case-by-case basis. In all, about 3,000 stranded Indians were evacuated from Peru, Columbia, Bolivia, Panama, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, etc. and from the Caribbean region – Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, St. Lucia etc.” the report added.The Centre also allowed chartered flights to fly passengers in coordination with state governments and DGCA without the external affairs ministry or its missions. “This simplified procedure greatly helped Indian associations to expeditiously bring back stranded Indians in large numbers,” the report said, stressing that such chartered flights brought back 1.2 million people by October 2020, overtaking the number of passengers brought in by the VBM flights.“Notwithstanding, VBM flights commenced operations on 7th May 2020, although a decision to begin VBM was sudden, State Governments, Missions and relevant Ministries/Departments adjusted to the demands rather well,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-kuwait-deported-nearly-4-000-indians-after-covid-19-pandemic-broke-101624821100113.html

I will set it all right.”The former AIADMK leader’s remarks came after Balu reportedly complained to her about the alleged rising caste and religious divisions in the AIADMK. The complaint was about accusations that former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was nurturing his Gounder community that is predominant in Tamil Nadu’s western region from where he hails, and of sidelining people belonging to other castes, including the Mukkalathurs to which Sasikala and former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam belong.Without naming Palaniswami or referring to his position, Sasikala said that before going to prison, she chose him as chief minister to recognise the goodwill of the people of the western region, which is popularly known as the Kongu region.“Kongu people are extremely affectionate towards our thalaivar (M G Ramachandran) and Amma (J Jayalalithaa). They are used to voting only for the AIADMK. I considered their affection and wanted to show recognition to them, so I handed over it (the post) to him. I did not have any other intention and at that time, I didn’t think anything.”She also insisted that the AIADMK has never functioned based on caste in the past.In 2017, both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam had buried their differences and ousted Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran from their party. The duo has since been running the party jointly as co-coordinator and coordinator, respectively. In 2018, Dhinakaran floated the AMMK along with rebel AIADMK MLAs and other supporters of Sasikala.AIADMK had recently expelled 16 party cadre for speaking to Sasikala, after passing a resolution stating that her phone conversations are ‘drama’.In a set of audio clips released a few days ago, Sasikala had said that the AIADMK and AMMK would have won the April 6 elections had they merged.While Palaniswami and Panneerselvam’s renewed cold war over power struggle worked to Sasikala’s advantage to reclaim the party, she hasn’t been able to draw in any of the prominent faces.Both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, who are now leader of opposition and deputy leader of opposition in the assembly, respectively, have paused their power tussle and put up a united front against Sasikala. However, amid Palaniswami’s growing clout, Panneerselvam with little support was seen as softening towards Sasikala.“We have decided not to do anything in a hurry,” an AIADMK leader who is in support of Panneerselvam and Sasikala joining hands, said on condition of anonymity. “We have to work towards the upcoming local body elections, so it is better not to create any confusion now among the cadre.”Political experts believe AIADMK’s further course of action depends on whether the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) decides to go ahead with graft charges against Palaniswami and Panneerselvam as promised in its election manifesto.While in the opposition, the MK Stalin-led DMK had submitted a laundry list of corruption charges against the AIADMK leadership and their top ministers and promised to follow through via the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption and by appointing a special court for prosecution.“Stalin has had a respectful relationship so far with both of them, so we will have to wait and watch if Stalin will file such serious charges against them,” political commentator Durai Karunanidhi said. “If he does and causes Palaniswami and Panneerselvam to fall, the top leadership who owe their positions to Sasikala may seek her leadership. It’s doubtful if the grassroots cadre will support that though.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-never-let-go-off-aiadmk-says-sasikala-in-new-audio-clips-101624822268345.html
28-06-2021||India||Covid fight key focus of Stalin’s tenure||Chennai: It has been a little over 50 days since chief minister MK Stalin began his innings with no fanfare amid a raging pandemic. His team hit the ground as soon as they took charge on May 7 to contain the second wave of Covid-19. Stalin decided to hold a restricted swearing-in ceremony. He wrote to his cadre even before elections to celebrate the DMK victory inside their homes and continues to write to party workers not to gather on roads to greet him every time he visits a district to review pandemic-control measures. Having put the seriousness of the pandemic over celebrations of returning to power after 10 years and prioritising it over every other issue for an entire month are early signs of Stalin’s way of leadership. It’s different from that of his late predecessors, including his father M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa. They were quick to outdo one another, rename schemes and projects soon after they returned to power. Stalin is choosing a different way forward, but he is also doing so by taking others along beyond his party lines. Stalin set up a committee of MLAs from all parties, which includes AIADMK’s former health minister C Vijayabhaskar, to advise the government on Covid-control measures, besides consulting experts. The committee takes decisions such as a lockdown, which has been ongoing since May 10.Stalin has shown no interest in renaming ‘Amma’ canteens, the flagship budget canteens introduced by Jayalalithaa that were replicated across the country. It was touted that the DMK would rename it an ‘Anna Canteens’ after party founder CN Annadurai. The petty expectations aren’t misplaced as a couple of days after election results were announced on May 3, a DMK party cadre had vandalised an Amma Canteen and removed Jayalalithaa’s portrait in Chennai, but Stalin instructed that it be cleaned up and expelled the cadre. “This is a clear message that the DMK will not tolerate nuisance and anti-social activities,” M Subramanian had said at that time who now holds health portfolio, the most important amid the pandemic. Ministers like him, who are handling significant ministries such as finance and education, appear frequently for press conferences, indicating democracy within the party. “The finance minister is speaking on temples, the Hindu endowments minister is handling Covid-19 (as additional in-charge, Chennai) and the industries minister is speaking on education. From the way the ministries are functioning, they are demonstrating real collective responsibility,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “I think the flip side of that, however, is fixing accountability becomes difficult because a minister could say it’s his personal opinion and it wasn’t an official statement.” Finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan with his wrestling critiques has in fact captured pan-India attention more than his leader. Stalin providing a free hand to his team also comes from his position and confidence as the undisputed leader of the DMK after his father’s death. Party seniors too haven’t questioned his decisions. Stalin is drawing on his father’s legacy such as taking an oath as ‘Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin’ instead of ‘MK Stalin’ as he was introduced by governor Banwarilal Purohit. His first five orders on his first day as chief minister included a relief package for more than two-crore ration card holders affected due to the pandemic and free bus ride for women. On Karunanidhi’s 98th birth anniversary on June 3, he made six announcements including extending the free bus ride to trans persons and people with disabilities, a 250-crore multispeciality hospital in Chennai as well as an award and sops for Tamil writers. But he intends to forge his own ways by keeping with the times. He has changed the nomenclature of ministries and departments. Adding climate change to the environment and forest department and renaming personnel and administrative reforms department as human resources management department are examples.In his initial days, Stalin’s government was occupied making distress calls to the union government to increase oxygen allocation and the demand for vaccines is still ongoing. Stalin has written several times to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19-related requirements but always keeps the communication cordial. The state also led in announcing capital subsidies and opening a tender for investors to locally produce oxygen, oxygen cylinders and vaccines. The second wave is now being contained with deaths still being a concerning factor but the state was able to prevent large-scale deaths for want of oxygen.Covid-19 continues to keep Stalin and his new government occupied. Karunanidhi had a similar challenge after Annadurai’s death in office, when he dealt with a smallpox outbreak after taking charge in February 1969. Records of the fifth session of the state’s legislative assembly from March that year show that the then Harijan welfare minister, Sathyavani Muthu, had stated in the assembly that the situation was deadly from the spread of smallpox in Coimbatore. But, beyond that, the challenges are vastly different. “Reservation was a huge issue during Karunanidhi’s time and the DMK took up a socialist model in developing public sector undertakings, introducing welfare schemes which Jayalalithaa continued in her ways,” says Narayanan. “There aren’t many social issues now. Creating employment will be a task for the new government.” He adds that some of Karunanidhi’s announcements are still in vogue. “That’s a main difference I see so far in their leadership as Karunanidhi had clear goals if not a vision,” says Narayanan. “Covid-19 has occupied Stalin so far and his government is firefighting. It appears that Stalin is yet to set his goals. What is clear is that he wants to build goodwill and be known as a non-controversial chief minister.”On that aspect, Stalin’s pick for bureaucrats and ministers is much talked about. “It’s a mixed bag,” says Jayaram Venkatesan, founder, Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption movement in Tamil Nadu. “The four secretaries to the chief minister and the chief secretary are people with high integrity which shows that there is an attempt to clean up the government. But, on the other side, it is concerning that he has given people facing cases and complaints ministership in departments from where there is potential for corruption, such as highways, public works, and municipal administration.” At least ten cases are pending with the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption against the previous AIADMK regime that are filed by Arappor Iyakkam.Beyond the boundaries of the state, Stalin’s role on the national platform is beginning to emerge. His father had been a partner with the union government as well as played an active role in rallying the opposition together. ‘Uravukku kai koduppom; urimaikku kural Koduppom’ was Karunanidhi’s adage meaning, “Let’s lend a hand for the relationship; raise our voice for our rights.” Stalin recalled this after his first meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on June 17. They had a ‘cordial meeting’, Stalin told one of close aides in Delhi having submitted a list of 25 demands to the union government.The meeting would set the stage for the relationship between Delhi and the southern state which is now increasingly vocal on federalism and state autonomy. Stalin has written to his counterparts in mostly non-BJP- ruled states to come together on two issues -- objecting the draft Indian Ports Bill, 2021 and calling for moratorium for small businesses. He urged them to come together like they had for the union government to revise its vaccine policy and procurement. For now, the state BJP is uncomfortable over an issue of nomenclature. Stalin and his government has been referring to the government of India as Ondriyam (union), a deviation from Madhiya (centre), keeping in line with the Constitution that India is a union of states. The BJP, which believes that fringe elements are being emboldened with this narrative, had last week sought to know in the assembly if the DMK has any ulterior motive. The chief minister replied that no one needs to fear, and he will continue addressing the BJP-led government in Delhi as ondriyam as it’s a ‘philosophy of federalism’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-fight-key-focus-of-stalin-s-tenure-101624821668264.html
28-06-2021||India||Tiger was killed in ‘unwarranted firing’ by forest guard: Official||The death of an adult male tiger last week on the fringes of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) in Assam due to firing by forest personnel was unwarranted, an inquiry into the incident by a forest official revealed.The carcass of the 10-year-old tiger with a bullet wound was found on June 18 at Japoripathar village close to Kohora range of the park. The forest department had initially said that the death was due to “accidental firing while trying to scare away the tiger from the public area.”However, on Sunday, a statement by KNPTR stated that an inquiry into the incident conducted by an assistant conservator of forest revealed that the firing was unwarranted and based on its finding, the forest personnel responsible for the death was suspended.A post-mortem of the carcass had revealed bullet injury through lungs and heart of the animal, the statement informed.A day before it was shot, the tiger had killed a cow “probably because of the fact that it had three worn out canines while one was missing”.Three carcasses of tigers have been recovered from KNPTR this year.Earlier this month, the carcass of a four-year-old male tiger was found at Sidha Kathani area of the park.According to forest officials, the carcass bore multiple injury marks and it was stated that the tiger died after sustaining grievous injuries during a fight with another male tiger.The carcass of a female tiger cub with puncture marks on neck and broken ribs was found in the park in February. Forest officials said the cub, aged around 4 months, might have been killed by a bigger tiger.As per the 2017 census, Kaziranga had a population of 111 tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-was-killed-in-unwarranted-firing-by-forest-guard-official-101624821548291.html
28-06-2021||India||More questions arise over land deal for Ram Temple||Descendants of the original owner of a key parcel of land in Ayodhya have decided to challenge its transfer to the Ram temple trust and say the 22-hectare plot, a part of the Ram temple complex, is tied up in two separate legal cases and a police complaint.Documents seen by HT and local officials say the 22,450 square metre land at Bag Bijaisi in Ayodhya – which is currently owned by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust – originally belonged to local resident Fakir Mohammad and his wife Bakhtar Bibi.Wahid Ahmed, one of Fakir’s descendants, said the ownership of the plot is currently disputed with several claimants in Fakir’s extended family. The Ayodhya additional commissioner’s court and the Ayodhya civil district court are hearing separate petitions on the plot’s ownership since 2017 and 2020, respectively, he added. HT has seen corresponding court documents.“We are left with no option but to challenge the registry to the trust in the high court. As the high court is not working at full capacity due to the pandemic, we will file the case once courts start functioning normally,” said Ahmed.The plot – which now comprises two adjacent tracts of 12,080 sqm and 10,370 sqm – is at the centre of an escalating political row over an allegation of corruption in the purchase of the land.Two weeks ago, two Opposition politicians alleged that on March 18 this year, Kusum Pathak sold the 12,080sqm plot for ₹2 crore to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Tewari, who then sold the land to the temple trust for ₹18.5 crore, 10 minutes later.The same day, the temple trust purchased the 10,370 sqm plot directly from Harish Pathak and Kusum Pathak for ₹8 crore.In response, the temple trust — a 15-member body overseeing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rejected the charges and said the land was bought at lower-than-market rates. Temple trust secretary Champat Rai said the land was officially registered only on March 18, adding that two transactions occurred on March 18: from Pathak to Ansari-Tewari, and Ansari-Tewari to the trust.But documents furnished by Ahmed and the Hazi Fakir Mohammad Waqf Khuda Rasool Trust, a 97-year-old body started according to Fakir’s will, showed that Pathak’s ownership over the plot was itself disputed – and tied up in two separate legal proceedings. HT has seen the Rasool trust’s documents claiming ownership.Moreover, Ahmed said the whole plot was registered as a waqf property under the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, which means that market sale of the land needs prior permission.In the 1900s, Fakir and Bakhtar, who were childless, decided to constitute a trust, which would control the 22 hectare plot. Upon their death, ownership of the land passed to the Rasool trust set up according to Fakir’s will in 1924 and it was registered with the Waqf board.Under the UP law, land registered to the Waqf board is deemed to be dedicated for religious and charitable purposes and such are usually non-transferable. In their will, the couple also mandated that the custodian (mutawalli) of the land will be a relative, who will be selected by family and could be removed in case of irregularities. HT checked the legal documents that set up the trust.This arrangement held for 70 years but problems started in 1994 when the then custodian, Mahmud Alam died.In 1996, Mohammad Aslam, another descendant of Fakir, was appointed custodian of the land. But Alam’s four sons — Mahfuz Alam, Javed Alam, Noor Alam and Firoz Alam — refused to accept him and got the property registered in their names in 1997.In 2009, Mohammad Aslam approached the tehsil (sadar) office and asked that the 1997 registry be cancelled. After scrutinising papers, the tehsildar cancelled the registry, according to documents seen by HT. The four brothers challenged this decision and got their names back in the property papers in 2016.Mohammad Aslam died in 2015 but his relative, Mohammad Naeem, challenged the restoration of the four brother’s names in the property papers. Naeem filed a petition in the court of the additional commissioner (Ayodhya) on March 29, 2016.The court issued a stay order on September 1, 2017. HT has seen a copy of this order.“This stay order still continues till date. Despite the stay order, the four brothers made registry of the property to Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak for ₹two crore on November 20, 2017,” said Ahmad.In January 2020, Ahmad and the Rasool trust challenged the transfer of the land to the Pathaks in the district court. “We pointed out that the property is a Waqf land and cannot be sold. Despite the stay order (from additional commissioner’s court) the property has been sold,” said Ahmad.In 2017, Ahmad also filed a complaint with the Waqf Board. “The Waqf board handed me a report on April 27, 2018, stating that the land at Bag Bijaisi is a Waqf property and cannot be sold,” said Ahmad. HT saw a copy of this letter.An FIR was also lodged at Ram Janmabhoomi police station against Mahfuz Alam, Javed Alam, Noor Alam and Firoz Alam on April 22, 2018. HT saw a copy of this FIR but the UP police refused to comment on any progress in the case.Sultan Ansari rejected Ahmed’s charges and termed the land purchase deal with the temple trust as legally bonafide.“The tehsil (sadar) had given a written order stating that the land at Bag Bijaisi is not a Waqf land. On this basis of this order the land deal was executed with the Ram Mandir Trust,” said Ansari. Tewari was not available for comment.The temple trust also refuted allegations of any irregularity in the land purchase deal. Mahant Dhinendra Das, chief of Nirmohi Akhara, who is member of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust said: “All papers of the land purchase deal made by the Ram Mandir Trust are in public domain. Anyone can see them. There is no irregularity.”“Anyone who carries out a shady land purchase deal never transfers the money through banks by the RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system directly into bank accounts of sellers,” said Dhinendra Das.The UP Waqf Board said it was verifying land records. “We have to check the land records first before making any public comment on the entire issue. It will take another couple of days for us to verify the land records with the board,” said Zufar Ahmed Farooqui, chairman of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-questions-arise-over-land-deal-for-ram-temple-101624821368246.html
28-06-2021||India||K'taka leadership row: BJP yet to act on dissensters||It’s been over a week since state party in-charge Arun Singh visited Karnataka, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to take any action against legislators and leaders who made statements against chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his government, people aware of the developments said. The delay--or refusal--to act against detractors has indicated the possibility that the statements are part of the national leadership’s plans to replace Yediyurappa, they add. If this is to be believed, then it could mean that simmering dissent is likely to crop up again and likely to plunge the state into another round of political crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic. R Ashok, senior BJP leader and minister for revenue had said on June 18 that strict action will be taken against all those who issued statements “within a few days”. Even though Singh had warned against those making statements and even made it clear that Yediyurappa would continue as chief minister, the group of detractors continued to insinuate the possibility of a change in leadership. “Singh’s visit to Karnataka had nothing to do with leadership change. All party general secretaries were visiting their respective states and so did Singh,” said one BJP legislator, who identifies with the group seeking Yediyurappa’s removal. “It is only a matter of timing and who (replaces Yediyurappa) is the question,” the legislator said, requesting not to be named. Though Yediyurappa and legislators who have stood behind the chief minister, have made it clear that there will be no change in leadership, the free hand to the detractors appears to reignite the growing factionalism within the party in the state. Despite being known--or at least projecting--to be a cadre-based party where leaders are expected to toe the party line, there are several factions at work within the BJP. There are those who side with Yediyurappa, some who want him out, legislators who are part of the old-guard and at least one of the turncoats who defected from the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) in 2019, people aware of the developments said. The party had issued a notice to Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur City and known critic of Yediyurappa in February, but he continues to make statements against the chief minister and his son, BY Vijayendra. Similarly, AH Vishwanath, one of the 17 legislators who defected to the BJP, has also openly called for Yediyurappa to be replaced. The likes of CP Yogeshwara, a minister in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, continues to travel to Delhi to convey his concerns to the national leadership. “I have told you earlier that I will not speak about politics in public and to ensure that it shouldn’t damage my party is why I have shared my pains between four walls. I have shared it with our top leaders from Delhi. I have written my exams, let us wait for results. You (media) also have patience and so shall I,” Yogeshwara said last week. Political analysts suspect that there are possibilities of talks going on despite the warnings from the national leadership on replacing Yediyurappa. “It appears as if nothing is settled,” A Narayana, a Bengaluru-based political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University told Hindustan Times. He added that contrary to popular belief, the BJP in Karnataka is a “combination of individual groups” and is not cohesive or coherent. The crisis in both national parties in Karnataka--BJP and Congress--adds to the already volatile political climate in the southern state. The Congress too continues to witness the battle between legislature party leader, Siddaramaiah and party president, DK Shivakumar, in a struggle to trump the other in the debate over the next chief ministerial face. The crisis in both parties has added to the uncertainty over questions of leadership with just two years left for the 2023 assembly elections. MB Patil, former minister and senior Congress leader on Sunday said that the party has not gone into any elections in Karnataka or other state by projecting any one leader or a chief ministerial candidate. He said that the party will go into the 2023 elections collectively and after it wins will take the opinion of MLAs and then the high command will decide. “Everyone has a wish to become chief minister and there is nothing wrong in it,” Patil said. “It does not work if people (leaders) call themselves chief ministers. People should want this . We can’t become chief minister if we give self certification,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-leadership-row-bjp-yet-to-act-on-dissensters-101624819568119.html
28-06-2021||India||Cop and wife shot dead by suspected terrorists in J&K; daughter injured||A police officer and his wife were killed and daughter injured after suspected terrorists opened fire at them in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district late on Sunday, police said.Police have identified the deceased officer as special police officer (SPO) Fayaz Ahmad. “He (Ahmad) lost his life in the attack, while his wife and daughter sustained injuries.

28-06-2021||India||Centre sets up portal to track management of Covid in rural areas||A new web portal that tracks how Covid-19 is being managed in rural areas of the country is the government’s latest tool to tackle the pandemic, said people involved with it.Named Covid dashboard, the portal helps policymakers and administrators to find out just how prepared rural India is in terms of manpower and infrastructure to meet the challenge posed by the pandemic.“India has more than 2.5 lakh gram panchayats. As more rural areas got affected by the second wave of the pandemic, these grassroots institutions have assumed immense significance with limited healthcare services available in the rural areas,” said a senior official involved with the dashboard on condition of anonymity.The dashboard, now available publicly, allows anyone to track the formation of village health and sanitation committees, enrolment of frontline workers and volunteers, or the creation of isolation centres in schools or panchayat buildings. This helps in identifying gaps and tracking the overall progress, said officials.As of now, activity on the dashboard isn’t much, but the government is hopeful that it would pick up pace once the village panchayats start uploading real-time data.The portal also shows the readiness of the panchayats in terms of home isolation kits, updating of community preparedness checklist, and the identification of high-risk individuals.“In the vaccination drive too, the panchayats now play a critical role. Dissemination of correct information, encouraging people to take vaccines, organising surveillance and campaigns are the key roles of the panchayat leaders,” said a second official.When the centralised vaccination programme was rolled out on June 21, 63.68% of the doses were administered in the rural areas, the government had said in a press release. This amounted to 56.09 lakh doses while the urban areas recorded the vaccination of 31.9 lakh people, the release said.V K Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, recently said that more than half of the total vaccinations carried out in the country in the last few weeks happened in the rural areas. He said that with the spread of information technology, educating people about vaccines became possible, which has given the government more confidence about being able to cover all of rural India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sets-up-portal-to-track-management-of-covid-in-rural-areas-101624818671668.html
28-06-2021||India||Believe in science, shed Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday encouraged people to overcome vaccine hesitancy and dispel rumours about India’s coronavirus inoculation drive, urging them to “believe in science” and scientists who toiled to develop the life-saving shots in the year of the pandemic.“Through the year, many senior scientists have worked and that is why we have to believe in science, believe in scientists. And (people) should explain to these propagators of falsehood that... it is not so, so many people have taken the vaccine, nothing untoward happens,” the PM said in the 78th edition of his Mann Ki Baat radio address.The PM cited his own example and that of his mother, who he said was nearly 100 years old, to say that both of them have taken the shots, appealing to people not to pay heed to any rumours about the safety of the vaccines against Covid-19.“I have myself been vaccinated with both doses... And my mother is close to a hundred years of age… she too has taken both doses. At times, some people develop fever but it’s very minor, just for a few hours… not getting vaccinated can prove dangerous,” Modi said.In his monthly address, he also lauded the progress of India’s vaccination drive and said the country has achieved many “extraordinary milestones” in the fight against the pandemic.“Just a few days ago, our country accomplished an unprecedented feat. On the 21st of June, the next phase of the vaccination campaign commenced… and that very day, the country registered a record of administering vaccines to over 86 lakh people, free of cost… that too on a single day! Such a huge number of free vaccinations by the Government of India,” he said.The Prime Minister made the statements at a time India has recorded its best week of vaccination figures since June 21, when the central government said it will take charge of supplying jabs free of cost instead of putting the procurement burden on state governments. Since then, the country has administered an average of over six million doses per day.However, this recent spike in vaccinations comes on the back of a month of slowdown, which saw fewer jabs administered daily and concerns raised by several state governments over the supply of shots.Experts, too, say that the pace of India’s immunisation drive still needs to pick up, because even at this rate (of six millions jabs per day), it would take India until February 2022 to vaccinate its entire adult population.Modi also cautioned against complacency and the notion that the pandemic has been defeated, underscoring the need to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour and getting the jab.“We have to save lives…If someone says corona is gone, do not be under this mistaken notion... This ailment is like a master of disguise. It keeps changing its looks… surfaces in myriad new forms and colours. And to protect ourselves from it, we have two ways. One is adhering to the protocol for corona – wearing a mask, frequently washing hands with soap, maintaining distancing… and the other way is …along with all this, getting vaccinated,” he said.The PM was apparently referring to the second wave of infections that debilitated the health care infrastructure of several states in the country, including national capital New Delhi, between March and May this year. Scientists say the lack of social distancing and adherence to Covid hygiene, and the spread of a more transmissible virus variant are likely to have contributed to the sudden surge in cases in the country.PM Modi on Sunday said that the country will mark the National Day of Doctors on July 1, and it “is our duty to thank them with an equal measure of affection and encourage them”.Separately, the Prime Minister spoke about the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and advised people not to “pressure” the athletes and the sportspersons who have all had their “own share of struggle and years of toil”.“They are going not only for themselves but for the country...

28-06-2021||India||States will get 120 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for July||The central government will distribute 120 million doses of coronavirus vaccines – 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin – to all states and Union Territories for the month of July, according to advance information shared with them, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.These 120 million doses will make up for total Covid-19 vaccines being made available across the country through July – 75% of these will be given to states and Union Territories after being acquired by the Centre, and the remaining 25% will be acquired by private hospitals, as per the country’s new vaccine policy.This development comes on the heels of India recording its best week of vaccinations – an average of over 6 million doses has been administered every day in the country between June 21 and June 27 after the new phase of the government’s vaccine drive came into effect.Also Read| Covishield may not be eligible for ‘vaccine passport’ by the EUExperts, however, warned that the pace of daily vaccination may see a drop from what has been seen in the country the past week as 120 million doses spread across July translates to about 4 million doses a day.In June, 106 million doses were administered across the country (an average of 3.9 million doses through the month) till Sunday morning. To be sure, nearly 42 million of these have been administered just this week.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has been sharing the estimated number of vaccine doses available in a particular month with states before the start of the month as part of its advance visibility plan so that states and UTs can prepare and schedule vaccinations accordingly. “Providing information on availability of vaccine doses in advance helps states and Union Territories plan their vaccination distribution, and in turn slot allocation, schedule in a more effective way,” a senior health ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The Centre has devised a methodology to compute vaccine doses that need to be allotted to states, which includes pro-rata population of 18 years and above age group; the Covid-19 disease burden based on the number of active cases in each region; and progress of the vaccination drive there.Also Read| Can vaccine composition be changed? Here's what ICMR chief saysTwo vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — are currently part of the government’s vaccination programme. While Serum Institute of India locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield, Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research co-developed Covaxin.Another Covid-19 vaccine, Russia-made Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya Institute, also received the national drugs regulator’s emergency use authorisation on April 13, and is now being administered at select private Covid-19 vaccination centres in the country under pilot mode.India has so far administered 371.8 million doses to 265.4 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 209 million people have received one dose, while 56.4 million people have been fully vaccinated till Sunday morning, according to government data.The government has, however, said it plans to scale up vaccinations.“We are preparing to administer close to 10 million doses in a single day by August. The programme will get an increased vaccine supply in coming months,” said Dr NK Arora, chairman of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines.However, an ambitious target of 10 million doses a day will depend almost entirely on supplies, as the country has shown it has the infrastructure and manpower to give close to that many doses a day (8.6 million doses were administered on June 21). To hit this target throughout August, the country would need more than 300 million doses in that month.Also Read| 'Making Covid-19 vaccines available for kids would be milestone achievement’While Covishield supplies have been ramped up by the Serum Institute of India to produce 100 million doses a month, scaling up monthly Covaxin supplies may take longer, even though the Centre announced in the past that Covaxin production could go up to 100 million doses per month by September, an official said, asking not to be named.“The current production capacity is 25 million doses per month and this is likely to be maintained till August-September this year, after which more supplies will happen,” one of the executives of Bharat Biotech told HT last week, on condition of anonymity, adding that it looked like by the end of this year, a target of 60-70 million doses was likely.On June 8, the Centre placed orders for 440 million doses – 250 million doses of Covishield and 190 million of Covaxin – to be procured from August onwards, in addition to an advance order of 300 million doses placed with Hyderabad-based Biological E’s vaccine and will be delivered by December. The Biological E vaccine is currently in Phase 3 trials.Experts stressed that based on current supply rates, covering the country’s entire eligible population may take longer than anticipated.“The way our vaccination programme is going, be it insufficient vaccine supplies or other logistical issues, it is going to take a lot of time before the entire target population is covered. Even 8 million a day is not enough if you really want to cover the target population fast enough. Therefore, what is more important is to implement other measures also to break the chain of transmission such as effective messaging regarding strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour; maintaining good hygiene, etc,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.Clinicians stressed the need to take the vaccine to attain protection against the viral disease.“There are different variants of the virus in circulation; therefore, people should hasten to get the shot as it will provide protection against the disease,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-get-120-million-vaccine-doses-for-july-101624818248020.html
