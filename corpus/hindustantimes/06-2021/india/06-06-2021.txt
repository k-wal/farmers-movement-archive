While the daily cases were the lowest since April 4, or in 62 days, the number of reported daily deaths in the country touched a low of a month-and-a-half (or since April 22).The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for four consecutive weeks across the country. The seven-day average of new infections in the country – which denotes a region’s Covid-19 curve – had touched a peak of 391,819 case a day on May 9, but has now dropped to 123,232 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 68% from the peak, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.“The second wave is stabilising or we can see is localised at the moment as from at least 500 districts reporting nearly 100 or more daily new cases in May, the number has come down to around 250 districts as on date. Most districts have shown substantial decrease in numbers since the peak was observed May 7, and hopefully the numbers will go down further in days to come,” a senior health ministry official aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity.In a recent press briefing on Covid-19, the Union health ministry informed that only five states constituted two-thirds of all new infections in the country now.“Among our new reported cases, 66% are effectively being reported from just five states and the remaining cases are being reported from 31 states, which is a sign to suggest we have managed to contain the disease transmission in a localised area,” said Lav Agarwal in the briefing. The health ministry, in a statement on Sunday, also said that the country has recorded fewer than 200,000 daily new cases for 11 continuous days now. “This is a result of collaborative and sustained efforts by the Centre and states, Union territories following the “whole of Government” approach. India has been witnessing a continuous fall in the active cases. The country’s active caseload has dipped below 15 lakh mark… The caseload is below 20 lakhs for seven successive days,” the ministry statement said.The daily test positivity rate has also dropped significantly, a factor that experts attributed to a significant increase in daily Covid-19 testing. The average weekly test positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in the country has now dropped 18 percentage points from the peak and is continuing to go down rapidly, offering what is perhaps the clearest sign of the country’s brutal second wave coming under control.For the week ending May 9, more than a fifth of all samples (22.8%) tested in the country returned positive, compared to just 4.8% in the past week. This turnaround is even more evident in the single day positivity rate, which has dropped to 3.2% on Saturday (the lowest in 81 days), compared to 25.3% on April 25 – the highest ever recorded.Much of this turnaround in positivity rate appears to be the direct result of a massive increase in testing. On average, more than 3 million samples have been tested in India every day in the past week – the highest this number has ever touched in the 15 months of the outbreak in the country. In fact, the daily rate of testing (seven-day average) has increased in over a million a day in just the past two weeks.Experts also say the numbers are indicative of a downward trend. “The numbers are stabilising but one recommendation cannot suit all states. This has to be local,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health. “Each state has to make decisions on unlocking based on the objective indicators locally. The lower test positivity will have to sustain at least for two weeks while the load on hospitals is considerably eased, especially the availability of beds with critical care. Based on some of the indicators, gradual unlocking should be done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-lowest-daily-cases-in-2-mths-data-101623004110955.html

06-06-2021||India||Nearly 30,000 children affected by pandemic, says NCPCR’s latest affidavit in Supreme Court||Children in more than 30,000 families were abandoned, became orphans or lost one of their parents between April 2020 and last week. The latest data submitted to the Supreme Court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is by far the most comprehensive estimate provided by states on the status of children affected during the Covid-19 pandemic.The figures were uploaded by the respective States and Union Territories on the NCPCR website “Bal Swaraj”. The Commission in an affidavit filed before the top court added a disclaimer stating that the reason for death of parent(s) could be any and not just Covid-19.The affidavit of the NCPCR filed through advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi on Sunday said, “The Commission is presenting the number of children who have lost either their mother or father or both parents from April 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021, based upon the information uploaded on “Bal Swaraj” portal up to 5th June 2021.” The reason of death was not uploaded by the States/UTs giving rise to a possibility of the death of parent(s) being for reasons other than Covid-19.The latest data shows that among 30,071 children affected during the pandemic, 3,621 lost both parents, a significantly high number of 26,176 lost either parent while 274 were left abandoned. Of the affected children, there are 15,620 boys, 14,447 girls and four transgenders. The Commission even categorized the data into age-wise brackets. This showed that more than 11,800 children are in the age group of 8 to 13 years and between 14-18 years, about 10,247.This is the second affidavit filed by the Commission in response to a query put by the top court on the number of children affected due to the pandemic. The possibility of significantly high number of orphans during the pandemic and an urgent need to cater to their care and protection was raised by amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the Court in a suo moto petition on steps to contain spread of Covid-19 in child care homes. The earlier affidavit filed by NCPCR on May 31 did not contain complete figures of children affected during Covid-19 as many states faced technical challenges to upload data on the “Bal Swaraj” portal.The matter is fixed for hearing on Monday before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose. Along with the affidavit of NCPCR, a note was prepared by Agrawal focusing on 10 states with regard to identification mechanism of children affected by Covid-19 and steps taken to provide them care under various Central and state schemes. These 10 states are Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.Agrawal has also made suggestions on protecting the property rights of orphans/children. His note stated, “A large number of children have lost their fathers, who were the earning member of the families. In some cases, there is absolutely no income, no insurance benefits and no property with the widow.” Agrawal suggested that when orphans or children in need of care and protection (CNCP) are produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), it could assess the financial capacity of family or guardian and award an amount of ₹5000 per child as financial assistance. Some states have already announced special financial schemes for such children, Agrawal added.As per data of NCPCR, most among the affected 30,000 odd children are either at their homes with the single parent, guardian or family member with only 819 in Children’s Home (including observation homes and shelter homes), 41 in orphanages, and 62 with special adoption agencies.Among the states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number with 217 children orphaned and over 6800 children losing either parent. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan recorded very high number of orphans at 706 and 671 respectively. The NCPCR affidavit has requested the Court to direct states and UTs not to share names or information about children in public domain or provide it to any person/ entity/ organization making these children susceptible to trafficking, abuse, illegal adoption etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-30-000-children-affected-by-pandemic-says-ncpcr-s-latest-affidavit-in-supreme-court-101623001350963.html
06-06-2021||India||In Delhi, only 2nd dose of Covaxin will be available for 18+ category now||Only the second dose of Covaxin will be available now in Delhi for the 18+ population as the Capital has run out of Covaxin stock for this age group and people who have got their first dose have to travel to Meerut, Chandigarh in search of the second dose. The Delhi government on Sunday directed all private hospitals and nursing homes to administer Covaxin only to those eligible for the second dose in respect of the 18-44 age group. This will go on until further orders. "DDMA hereby directs that all private hospitals and nursing homes functioning as COVID Vaccination Centres for Covaxin shall ensure that Covaxin shall be used for vaccination to only those people (of age group 18-44 years) who are eligible for receiving second dose of vaccination during the month of June, 2021 or till further orders," the order reads.The Delhi high court this week rapped the Delhi government and asked why it started vaccination centres with pomp and splendour when it is not being able to provide the second dose of Covaxin. The 2nd dose of Covaxin is to be taken within four weeks. Petitioners, residents of Delhi, moved the high court saying that people have to travel to nearby cities to get their second doses as the Capital has exhausted its stock of vaccines.The Delhi government told the court that Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of the vaccine, had promised five lakh doses of Covaxin in May, but only supplied 1.5 lakh doses. The matter will be heard on June 7.AAP leader and Delhi MLA Atishi on Sunday said it has been two weeks since Delhi ran out of its stock of both Covishield and Covaxin for the 18 to 44 age group. Fresh supply from the Centre will come on June 10."It is becoming a serious issue as a lot of people in the 18-44 group are nearing their date for the second dose. We are also hearing reports that people are travelling 100-200 km to Meerut, Bulandshahr to get their shots because there are no vaccines in Delhi," Atishi said.Delhi received a fresh stock of vaccines on Friday, which is for the 45 plus age group and it has now 21,850 Covaxin doses and 5,62,520 doses of Covishield for the 45+ category.

All you need to know||According to a New York Times report, colleges and universities in the United States want their students to be vaccinated against Covid-19 before the fall semester starts, but the authorities mentioning specific vaccines, approved by the World Health Organization. Sputnik V and Covaxin are yet to receive WHO approval.Here is what we know so far1. Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana have announced priority vaccination for students who are headed abroad. In Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Pune Municipal Corporation conducted such special drives for students and those who have foreign travel scheduled for work.2. Kerala raised two issues with the vaccination of foreign-bound travellers. One, whether they should be given Covaxin as it is not on WHO's emergency list yet; two, what to do if one has the travel date before 12 weeks. As Co-Win will not allow booking for the second slot before 12 weeks, the Kerala health department has asked districts to clear such cases.Maharashtra: Reduce gap between Covishield shots, urge students going abroad3. According to the New York Times report, Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs has said to an Indian student that she will be revaccinated once she reaches the campus.4. Though no country has made vaccination mandatory for entry, there are university-specific rules, reports said. These rules were designed primarily for domestic students but will affect students from India and Russia. The idea of a vaccine passport for travelling from one country to another is still at an incipient stage and India has recently expressed its objection to such a "discriminatory" idea.5. Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, is expecting to get WHO approval by September. The government is pursuing the application, it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-indian-students-in-us-be-asked-to-get-covid-vaccines-again-all-you-need-to-know-101622998083195.html

However, they were on the run as their families were opposed to their union and even threatened to kill them.Dealing with their appeals, Vacation Bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Ajay Rastogi noted that the matter concerned life and liberty of citizens. One couple wrote to the Senior Superintendent of Police, District Tarn Taran in Punjab for protection in April this year. Around the same time, the couple in the second petition requested the SSP, Jind in Haryana seeking similar protection.The bench read the representations made to the police in the two petitions and allowed the two couples to supplement their representations to the Superintendent of Police. It held, “Since it concerns life and liberty, the Superintendent of Police is required to act expeditiously in accordance with law, including the grant of any protection to the petitioners in view of the apprehensions/threats, uninfluenced by the observations of the High Court.”Dealing with the Punjab couple, the Punjab and Haryana HC on May 11 had said, “The Petitioners in the garb of filing the present petition are seeking seal of approval on their live-in-relationship, which is morally and socially not acceptable and no protection order in the Petition can be passed.”A day later, another bench of the HC while dealing with the petition of the Jind couple said, “In the considered view of this bench, if such protection as claimed is granted, the entire social fabric of the society would get disturbed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liveincouples-denied-protection-by-high-court-get-sc-cover-101622996550742.html
06-06-2021||India||Bengal governor Dhankhar has employed 3 relatives, kin of EDCs, says TMC’s Mahua Moitra||Unleashing the most scathing attack against West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra on Sunday alleged that the former has employed three of his own relatives and two relatives of a former aides-de-camp (EDC) and one relative of his present EDC as officers on special duty (OSD) at Raj Bhawan, Kolkata. She tweeted a list of six OSDs. Bringing charges of favouritism unheard of in recent history, Moitra, while reacting to Dhankhar’s tweets on alleged post-assembly poll violence in the state, said in back-to-back tweets that the situation in Bengal will improve if the governor leaves with his “extended family”. In Moitra’s tweet, the list claimed that Abbhudoy Singh Sekhawat, the governor’s OSD, is Dhankhar’s “brother-in-law’s son,” Akhil Chowdhury, the OSD coordination, has “close family relation with governor,” OSD administration Ruchi Dubey is “the wife of Major Gorang Diksit, ex-ADC to governor” and the Major’s “brother” Prasant Diksit is the OSD protocol. OSD IT (information technology) Koustav S Valikar is the “brother-in-law” of Dhankhar’s present ADC Srikant Janardan Rao, IPS, the tweet claimed. Kishan Dhankhar, the newly appointed OSD, is “a close relative of governor”, the list indicated. Dhankhar assumed charge on July 30, 2019. The acrimonious relationship between the governor and the TMC government has been in the news since September that year. Although TMC leaders have time and again accused Dhankhar of being “an agent” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and charged him with partisan behaviour, nobody made such serious allegations as Moitra did on Sunday. Moitra tweeted the list shortly after Dhankhar accused the administration of inaction in the post-poll scenario and asked the chief secretary to meet him on Monday to discuss political violence. “Extremely alarming law & order scenario @MamataOfficial. Security environment is seriously compromised. In such a grim situation called upon Chief Secretary to brief me on the law and order situation on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” Dhankhar wrote in one of his tweets. Addressing the governor as “Uncle Ji,” Moitra wrote, “Only way West Bengal’s grim situation will improve is if you move your sorry self back to Delhi and find another job. Some suggestions: 1. Advisor to Ajay Bisht Yogi CM on how best to ThokDo opposition. 2. Advisor to Home Minister on how best to hide during a pandemic.” Posting the list, Moitra wrote, “And Uncle Ji while you are at it take the extended family you have settled in at WB Raj Bhawan with you.” Raj Bhawan did not react to Moitra’s tweets till 8 pm. Talking to a news channel, Moitra said, “Don’t people have the democratic right to ask him these questions? He has brought his entire village and clan to Raj Bhawan. Government money is being spent to sustain them. I think it would be best if he leaves Bengal.” Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “This is hitting someone below the belt.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who defended Raj Bhawan on earlier occasions, said, “TMC is saying these because it has run out of issues. I do not know about these (appointments). We cannot say anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-dhankhar-has-employed-3-relatives-kin-of-edcs-says-tmc-s-mahua-moitra-101622995710529.html

The fruit has been priced between ₹500 and ₹1,000 per piece. Bookings have already been done for these mangoes," Shivraj Singh Jadhav, a mango cultivator from Katthiwada, told PTI.He said people who have booked 'Noorjahan' mangoes in advance include fruit lovers from Madhya Pradesh as well as neighbouring Gujarat."This time the weight of a Noorjahan mango is going to be between 2 kg to 3.5 kg," Jadhav added.Ishaq Mansoori, an expert in cultivating 'Noorjahan' mangoes in Katthiwada, said, "This time the crop of this variety has been good but the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the business".He said 'Noorjahan' trees could not flower properly due to unfavourable climatic conditions in 2020."In 2019, one mango of this variety weighed around 2.75 kg at an average and buyers paid as high as ₹1,200 apiece for it," he added.The 'Noorjahan' variety produces fruits towards the beginning of June. These trees start flowering in January- February.A 'Noorjahan' mango can grow up to a foot long and its kernels weigh between 150 to 200 grams, local cultivators claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noorjahan-mangoes-fetching-rate-up-to-rs-1-000-apiece-101622993496464.html

The Indian Council of Medical Research in its latest guideline for Covid-19 testing suggested that the provision of mandatory RT-PCR test for inter-state domestic travel can be completely removed. While the suggestion was to reduce the load on RT-PCR labs, which became overburdened with tests during April-May, which prolonged the waiting period, the minister told the news agency that it is under consideration of the ministry.But the decision will not be taken by the ministry alone. The opinion of health experts will be sought before taking any decision in this regard."A joint team from several ministries and stakeholders, including the health department, are in discussion to take a final decision on allowing travelling by air without an RT-PCR test for those who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine," the minister said.India has recently overtaken the US in terms of the number of people who have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. About 43 per cent of the 60 plus population has been covered with at least one dose and about 37 per cent of 45 plus population has recived one dose.However, even if a negative RT-PCR report does not remain mandatory for flying, destination states may still want this as a mandatory provision. "Health is a state subject, and to ask passengers for a negative RT-PCR report before they enter a state is solely the right of that particular state," Puri added.Domestic flight services saw several changes in the last few months as the second wave of the pandemic gripped the country. From June 1, the airlines have been asked to operate only 50 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights instead of 80 per cent. After being completely shit for two months in 2020, domestic flights resumed operations with about 33 per cent of their usual services. With the Covid-19 situation gradually improving, the cap was increased to 80 per cent by December 2020.From June 1, the fares of domestic flights have also gone up as the ministry raised the lower limit on fares by 13 to 16 per cent.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negative-rt-pcr-report-may-not-remain-mandatory-for-domestic-flying-says-minister-hardeep-singh-puri-101622991702929.html

For instance, its normal date to reach Agartala, Aizawl, Shillong and Imphal is June 1 and Gangtok in Sikkim is June 10.However, the progress is going to slow over the next two days, June 7 and 8, the IMD said.The activity is expected to pick up after that due to a cyclonic circulation that is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal. This will also help the monsoon cover Odisha, Jharkhand, parts of West Bengal and Bihar by June 15, it said.Monsoon is expected to be normal this season as well as in June, a month critical for sowing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-covers-the-entire-northeast-imd-101622992004029.html

They said recent developments in Lakshadweep were quite “disturbing” and in the name of tourism development on the lines of Maldives, local sentiments can’t be overlooked. The recent draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) and new rules introduced by the administrator have whipped up protests in the island and different parts of the mainland. Last week, the Kerala assembly had passed an unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. The signatories of the letter, 93 retired bureaucrats, said they were not affiliated with any political party but believe in neutrality and commitment to the Constitution and urged the PM to take native people into confidence before taking decisions. They said the draft regulation not only ignored the unique geography and community life of the islands it also give “arbitrary and draconian powers” to the administrator to acquire, alter, transfer and remove or relocate islanders from their property. They also pointed out that the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act) is quite unwarranted and uncalled for. “According to the National Crime Records Bureau the crime rate in the island is very low compared to the rest of India, it has generated fear that that the real purpose of the regulation is to smother dissent or protests against the policies and actions of the administrator,” the letter said. Local people should be consulted before any change is imposed and in the name of development popular feelings can’t be overlooked, it said. The Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, if passed into law, will ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of the cattle, meant in island environment where there are inherent limit to livestock development, the letter said adding that there is no such ban in Kerala or north-eastern states. “These drafts have been introduced without local consultation and are presently with the Ministry of Home Affairs for necessary approval,” said the letter written by former bureaucrats under the aegis of the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG). “Each of these measures smack of not of development but of alien and arbitrary policy making, in violation of the established practice that respect environment and society of Lakshadweep,” it said. Signatories of the letter include former National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon, ex Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, former Principal Secretary to the PM T K A Nair, former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and former head of Prasar Bharati Jawahar Sircar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-disturbing-developments-in-lakshadweep-former-bureaucrats-write-to-pm-modi-101622992470700.html

According to a press release issued by the ministry of science and technology, the clinical trial is a multi-centric, randomised, open-label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the drug for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients.The ministry pointed out that Niclosamide has been extensively used in the past for treating tapeworm in children and adults. The drug’s safety profile has been tested over time and has found to be safe for human consumption at different dose levels. News agency PTI reported on Thursday that Niclosamide was also used for treating patients during the SARS outbreak of 2003-04 and is currently a part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) list of essential medicines.Also Read| India’s first indigenous home-based rapid Covid test launched commerciallyDr Shekhar C Mande, the Director general (DG) of the CSIR expressed happiness over the subject expert committee’s (SEC’s) recommendations to conduct phase-II clinical trials using Niclosamide, which is generic, affordable and easily available in India, the release said.“In a screen to identify drugs that can inhibit syncytia formation, Niclosamide was identified as a promising repurposed drug by a research group from King’s College, London, who collaborated in this project. The syncytia or fused cells observed in the lungs of patients with Covid-19 probably results from the fusogenic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Niclosamide can inhibit syncytia formation,” Dr Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to the CSIR DG said.Dr Vishwakarma cited a collaborative research work between CSIR-IIIM andJammu and the National Center For Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru which showed that Niclosamide was a potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor blocking the viral entry through pH-dependent endocytic pathway.Dr Ram Upadhayaya, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Laxai, meanwhile, said considering the potential of Niclosamide, efforts had started in 2020 to undertake clinical trials of the anti-helminthic drug. The science ministry’s release also stated the clinical trial has been initiated at different sites and is expected to be completed within 8-12 weeks.Also Read| DRDO issues directions for use of 2-DG, its drug for Covid-19 patientsHowever, Niclosamide is not the only drug which the Centre is evaluating for treating the coronavirus disease.On May 17, India rolled out 2-DG, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in collaboration with Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL).

06-06-2021||India||Prioritise pregnant women for Covid-19 vaccination: Report||Amid rising deaths of pregnant women due to Covid-19, a report has made a strong case for their vaccination on a priority basis.For Covid not to further aggravate the already heavy burden of maternal and under five mortality, there is a strong case for inclusion of pregnant women as a high priority group for vaccination, a report prepared by a group of doctors led by Yamini Sarwal of Delhi-based Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital said. "We recommend including Covid-19 vaccination in the routine protocol for antenatal care in all countries, particularly India and Indonesia, in view of their high dual burden," it said.Currently, either pregnant women are not included for vaccination, or the policies are ambiguous with the decision being often left to the woman, the report said.Evidence is emerging of the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccination, which along with benefits of passing on the protection to the newborn, call for including pregnant women in the high priority group for vaccination, it said.Observing that pregnant women are known to be at significantly higher risk for severe coronavirus-related complications compared with non-pregnant women, it said, the issue of protecting such women is critical. Vaccination has emerged as a reliable protective measure against severe Covid-19 infection, the report noted.Of the top 20 Covid affected countries, nine allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two preferentially vaccinate them. In contrast, four of the 20 high under-five mortality countries allow vaccination of pregnant women, while none include them in the preferential group. India and Indonesia, with one fifth of world's population, fall in both the groups but do not include pregnant women for vaccination.Many organisations have represented the government for inclusion of pregnant women for inoculation.Last month, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has moved the Supreme Court against the January 14 advisory of the Union government excluding pregnant and lactating women from vaccination.Arguing for prioritisation, the report said pregnant women experience more severe Covid-19 disease than non-pregnant women. They are more likely to require hospitalization, admission to ICU, receive invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when compared with non-pregnant women, it said, adding, there is a 70 per cent increased risk of death among symptomatic pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant ones.  Women who get coronavirus infection while pregnant, experience a higher maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, it added. Observing that Covid vaccination in pregnancy has dual benefit, it said, both the mother and newborn get antibodies which have been demonstrated in cord blood and breast milk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prioritise-pregnant-women-for-covid-19-vaccination-report-101622981691857.html

"We should know what is the road ahead and how to restore the quota for the community in education and jobs," the member of Parliament said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led state government should do whatever in its capacity to ensure that the Maratha community gets justice, he also said.Earlier in the day, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the Maharashtra government is making "all possible efforts" to grant reservation to Marathas, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in May, without disturbing the existing quotas of other communities.Also read | Maratha reservation issue: King Shivaji’s descendant leaning towards Congress?"On this occasion, I would like to assure the people, especially those from the Maratha community, that the MVA government is making efforts to ensure that Marathas get reservation without disturbing quotas of other communities," Pawar told reporters in Pune on the sidelines of "Shiv Swarajya Din”.He said a delegation led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on the Maratha quota issue.Also read | Marathas now EWS; 6K youths to get govt jobsAjit Pawar's comments came two days after a committee, headed by retired high court judge justice Dilip Bhosale, recommended in its report that the Maharashtra government should file a review petition against the top court's decision.The Supreme Court on May 5 struck down the Maharashtra law granting quota to the Maratha community in education and government jobs, saying it was "unconstitutional”.

Akhil Chowdhury, who is the OSD coordination, has some close family relationship with the Governor. OSD administration Ruchi Dubey is the wife of Major Gorang Diksit, ex-ADC (aides-de-camp) to the Governor, while the Major's brother Prasant Diksit is the OSD (protocol). OSD IT Koustav S Valikar is the brother-in-law of Dhankhar's present ADC Srikant Janardan Rao, IPS. Kishan Dhankhar, a newly appointed OSD of the Governor, is also his close relative, the document said."We all have the democratic right to ask him questions. He keeps asking questions to the state government. I would rather request him to look into the mirror.

The overall SDG score of India is 61.9 out of 100.Elaborating state-wise preparedness, the report said Jharkhand and Bihar are the least prepared to meet the SDGs by 2030, which is the target year. While Jharkhand lags in five of the SDGs, Bihar lags in seven.It said the states/UTs with the best overall score which are on the path to achieving the SDGs are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, which provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.There are 17 SDGs which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.The 17 SDGs adopted by UN member states are SDG1- no poverty, SDG 2-zero hunger, SDG3-good health and well-being, SDG4- quality education, SDG 5- gender equality, SDG 6- clean water and sanitation, SDG 7- affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth, SDG 9- industry, innovation and infrastructure.SDG 10 – reduced inequalities, SDG 11- sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12- responsible consumption and production, SDG 13- climate action, SDG 14- life below water, SDG 15- life on land, SDG 16- peace, justice and strong institutions and lastly SDG 17- strengthening global partnerships for the goals.The report also said that India ranked 168 out of 180 countries in terms of Environmental Performance Index (EPI) which is calculated on various indicators, including environmental health, climate, air pollution, sanitation and drinking water, ecosystem services, biodiversity, etc.India's rank was 172 in the environmental health category, which is an indicator of how well countries are protecting their populations from environmental health risks.According to the EPI 2020 report by Yale University, India ranked 148, 21 positions behind Pakistan which was at 127th position in the category of biodiversity and habitat which assesses countries' actions toward retaining natural ecosystems and protecting the full range of biodiversity within their borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slips-two-spots-to-rank-117-on-17-sdgs-adopted-as-2030-agenda-report-101622969134638.html

The association asserted that 5G would prove to be a "game changer" and lead to "exponential increase in benefits" for the economy and society.The association - which represents large telcos like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea - argued that India already has strict norms in place and prescribed standards for electromagnetic radiation limit in telecom sector is far more stringent than global-accepted standards."Radiation permitted in India is one-tenth of what is accepted globally so already our systems have taken this into account...Any notion or concern about radiation and impact are misplaced. These are fallacious fears and this always happens whenever a new technology is introduced," S P Kochhar, director general, COAI told PTI.The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed actor Juhi Chawla's lawsuit challenging the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a fine of ₹20 lakh on her and co-petitioners by describing the plea as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity".Justice J R Midha said the plaintiffs -- Chawla and two others -- have abused and misused the process of law and wasted the court's time. The judge said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.COAI's Kochhar welcomed the court's decision and said "it puts to rest motivated rumour-mongering that was doing the rounds" and would set the pace for others to "desist from such misadventures".It may be recalled that last month, the industry association had slammed false information and rumours linking 5G technology with the spread of COVID-19 and had dismissed the unsubstantiated and unverified claims in this regard.The COAI had said it came across multiple messages on social media platforms mentioning 5G spectrum trials as the probable cause of rising cases of COVID-19. Kochhar said that since the public outreach by the industry and Department of Telecom, such messages "have gone down drastically".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5g-tech-is-safe-says-industry-body-after-juhi-chawla-s-lawsuit-101622977803881.html

06-06-2021||India||Rajasthan’s folk artists face ‘starvation-like’ crisis due to Covid restrictions||Kutla Khan, a folk musician from Rajasthan’s Barmer district, says he is nearly starving with his family due to loss of all avenues of income after cultural events and marriages dried up owing to restrictions to contain the coronavirus pandemic. While other unfortunate circumstances too contributed to his prolonged misery, circumstances precipitated by the coronavirus are primarily responsible for pushing him and other folk artists in the region to the brink, he adds.Till about two years ago, Kutla had no reasons to complain as he was busy performing in musical events across the country and even abroad, however, a fire in July 2019 not only destroyed his house but also left him with severe burn injuries, he recalls with pain.While his burnt face meant he received very limited invitations to musical events, the coronavirus pandemic snatched even the last straw keeping him and his family afloat as his remaining source of income in local weddings and festivals became minimalistic affairs. For the past one year, Khan says he has generated no income to support his wife and four kids.“My wife and kids are managing the family’s needs by doing menial jobs at people’s house or by begging. I have approached the authorities for assistance but my plea was ignored,” Kutla Khan says.Mehboob Khan, another folk musician, says some folk musicians were earlier helping struggling musicians like Kutla Khan but are no longer in a position to do so since they too were struggling to make the ends meet due to the freeze on musical events. He says he has approached the Barmer district collector seeking help, including ration kits, to sustain the families of the local folk artists.“The government should take some initiative for folk artist as they belong to the weaker section of the society, otherwise not only the artists but their art will also die,” Mehboob Khan says pensively.Folk artists from the Thar desert are globally known for their music and regularly represent India in cultural festivals abroad but have traditionally depended on patrons for their upkeep.Fakira Khan, an international folk artist, says, “We used to manage our needs from the income from cultural events, weddings and festivals. For generations we have entertained our patrons musically in return for cattle or cash. Earlier functions like marriages were not possible without our presence. But in Covid-era nobody is inviting us, leading to starvation-like conditions.”Barmer’s additional district collector Om Prakash Bishnoi told HT that the administration was offering all possible help.“With the help of some NGOs, we have distributed ration kits to the families of folk artists. Besides this, we are exploring other options to help them as per their requirements,” he said.Narendra Tansukhani, secretary of Marudhar Lok Kala Mandal-- an NGO working for the welfare of folk artists-- says local folk artists are like the soul of western Rajasthan and the government has a duty towards them.“Government must understand that the folk artists are the cultural heritage of western Rajasthan. Hence, the government should take some initiative to protect them otherwise we will not only lose them but will also lose our cultural identity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthans-folk-artists-face-starvation-like-situation-due-to-covid-restrictions-101622975910193.html

The developments are disturbing as they "constitute an onslaught on the very fabric of Lakshadweep society, economy and landscape as if the islands were just a piece of real estate for tourists and tourism investors from the outside world," the letter said. Understanding the discontent in Lakshadweep: An explainerFormer National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon, former Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar, ex-Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, former Adviser to prime minister T K A Nair and former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah are among the 93 signatories, news agency PTI reported."These drafts have been introduced without local consultation and are presently with the Ministry of Home Affairs, government of India for necessary approvals," said the letter, written by former civil servants under the aegis of Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG). A copy of the letter has been shared with home minister Amit Shah and environment, forest and climate change minister Prakash Javadekar.The Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation reflects a model of land and tourism development which includes resorts, hotels and beachfront on the "Maldives model" unmindful of the differences between the two island groups in size, population, number of islands and their spread, the letter said.The Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, if passed into law, will ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of cattle meat in an island environment where there are inherent limits to livestock development, the letter said, highlighting that no such ban is there in the North-East and in Kerala. The changes being proposed by the Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 for elections to gram panchayats that will disqualify candidates with more than two children from contesting seats for the gram panchayat too have been proposed without any local consultation or taking into account local sensitivities, it said.“Each of these measures smacks not of development but of alien and arbitrary policy making, in violation of established practices that respect the environment and society of Lakshadweep,” the letter said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-model-can-t-work-in-lakshadweep-ex-bureaucrats-write-to-pm-modi-on-disturbing-developments-101622973307219.html
06-06-2021||India||Jama Masjid’s Shahi Imam Bukhari writes to PM Modi over repair work||Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid, on Sunday, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to inspect the monument and carry out necessary repairs. He wrote to the PM two days after a minaret of the 17th-century mosque was damaged on Friday following strong winds and rain that struck the city during evening hours.“The structure of the internationally renowned Jama Masjid Delhi is in dire need of repairs….Many stones of the building are in a state of dilapidation and often keep falling off. Yesterday also, some stones fell down from the minaret but a major mishap was averted as the mosque is closed to the general worshippers due to the lockdown these days,” Bukhari said in his letter to PM Modi.Built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the mosque was constructed in 1656 and is not an ASI-protected monument.The responsibility of the mosque’s maintenance rests with the Delhi Waqf Board. A sudden thunderstorm and rain showers accompanied by strong winds travelling at 60 kms per hour lashed the city on Friday, following which, a slab of red sandstone from the minaret came crashing down and pierced the floor beneath, also damaging the mosque’s courtyard. Due to restrictions to contain the pandemic, the mosque is closed to visitors and no one was injured.As a special case, repairs at Jama Masjid have been carried out, from time to time, by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1956. “Due to the falling of these stones, the support of...other stones...has gone and they have become weakened and thus warrant immediate repairs to avoid any grave mishap. I shall be grateful if you instruct the Archaeological Survey of India to inspect the monument and commence the necessary repairs, and particularly to inspect the two minarets in order to ascertain their condition,” said Bukhari.Speaking to HT, Bukhari said conservation work of the minarets has not been undertaken in nearly 50 years. He said it was crucial for experts to inspect the mosque for repairs. “The other minaret was struck by lightning years ago. After that, repairs have not been undertaken. In order to avoid any accident, we want engineers to inspect the two minarets,” said Bukhari.While repair work is undertaken occasionally, on a needs basis, it was crucial for experts to inspect the complete mosque for defects, said Bukhari. “When the mosque was constructed, iron was used to join the different stone slabs. Iron weakens over time and the stones also get affected. While the stones appear fine on the outside, they have sustained damage on the inside. Experts from ASI should inspect the mosque,” he said.Author and historian Swapna Liddle said it was crucial to undertake a more nuanced and wider conservation approach over piecemeal efforts before the condition of the mosque deteriorates too much “Architecturally, the building is very important. The mosque is definitely a monument of national importance. Conservation architects should examine every inch of the mosque thoroughly to check for structural stability and other concerns. They should embark on a comprehensive restoration project before things deteriorate,” said Liddle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jama-masjid-s-shahi-imam-bukhari-writes-to-pm-modi-over-repair-work-101622975249929.html

"The day they will say they don't want me, I will resign and work day and night for the development of the state," Yediyurappa said in response to a question on attempts to replace him, according to news agency PTI. "I'm in no confusion. They (high command) have given me an opportunity, I'm trying beyond my strength to utilise the opportunity for good. Rest is left for the high command,” he said while speaking to reporters.The clamour for a leadership change in Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has grown louder with increasing instances of conflict within the BJP and the Yediyurappa-led government. The defeat in the Maski bypolls and wafer thin margin of victory in Belagavi Lok Sabha by-elections has also gone against the 78-year-old chief minister.Also read | Replacing BSY may change political discourse: ExpertsYediyurappa’s relationship with BJP’s central leadership has soured over the last few months. The chief minister has been forced to secure his chair, assuage dissent within his own government and party as well as lead the calamity-prone state out of the raging Covid-19 pandemic at the same time. Many have also said his handling of the pandemic in the state hasn’t been very good.At least two BJP leaders, including one minister, went to Delhi in May, purportedly to meet the top brass in connection with a possible change in leadership in the state. In response to their Delhi visit, Yediyurappa said his only priority was to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. “I only have Covid in front of me. To control it and people’s welfare is my only priority. If someone went to someplace, they have been sent back with an answer,” Yediyurappa said.Also read | Those who went to Delhi sent back with an answer, says K’taka CM YediyurappaOn Sunday, the Karnataka chief minister also responded to a question on "alternate leadership”. “I will not criticise anyone. I won't agree that there is no alternate person. There will always be alternate persons in the state and the country, so I won't agree that there are no alternate persons in Karnataka, but until the high command has confidence in me I will continue as the chief minister,” he said.However, many state BJP leaders have rallied behind Yediyurappa, and said there is no plan to replace the chief minster.Also read | Political tensions stare at Karnataka govt as Covid subsidesYediyurappa’s deputy CN Ashwathnarayan said on Sunday that here is no question of him stepping down. “No such discussions are happening.

"We do not have any such ideas to bring down Yediyurappa from the chief minster's post and we have unanimously selected him as the Chief Minister.

A day later, the order was withdrawn, stating that it was issued without any instructions or knowledge of the hospital administration or Delhi government.A member of the Delhi Action Committee of Malayali nurses said that the circular poses a threat to the linguistic freedom of the medical staff."It was really shocking for us. We feel that it is a threat to our linguistic freedom. We need an apology from the concerned person as they have humiliated the whole state," Fameer CK told news agency ANI.If the notice was issued without the knowledge of the hospital administration, then it should be treated as misconduct, Fameer said, adding that serious action should be taken against those responsible.Delhi government should take strict action against the nursing superintendent who had signed the circular, Fameer told ANI. The union will continue its agitation till an apology letter from the concerned department is issued, he said.The circular, now withdrawn, sparked a political furore over linguistic freedom as Opposition leaders condemned the move as 'unacceptable and crude'.Congress leader and MP from Wayanad, Kerala Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to post about stopping language discrimination. "Malayalam is as Indian as any other Indian language. Stop language discrimination!" he said in a tweet.Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, also tweeted stating, "It boggles the mind that in democratic India a government institution can tell its nurses not to speak in their mother tongue to others who understand them. This is unacceptable, crude, offensive and a violation of the basic human rights of Indian citizens. A reprimand is overdue!"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-humiliated-nurses-seek-apology-on-don-t-speak-in-malayalam-order-for-delhi-hospital-101622970270890.html
06-06-2021||India||91 universities adopt 'extra-curricular' NCC as elective course||The National Cadet Corps (NCC) won't remain an extra-curricular activity as at least 91 universities across the country have adopted it as General Elective Credit Course (GECC) under the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS). The move is a result of a letter from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to Vice-Chancellors of all universities on April 15.The highest number of universities offering NCC as GECC (42) are in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar combined, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (23). These include central university of Jammu, Islamia College of Science and Commerce in Srinagar and St Joseph College in Trichy. Apart from these, Maharaja Sayajirao Gayakwad University in Gujarats Vadodara, Amity University in Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior and Kalahandi University in Odisha are also among the institutions offering the NCC as GECC.The UGC's communication was in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which has proposed to remove the hard separation between extra-curricular, co-curricular and curricular activities in schools.According to the government, the provision of NEP 2020 will allow harnessing of the full potential of NCC's capacity in youth development and enlarging the student base taking up the training.The UGC and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had first issued a circular in 2013 for introduction of NCC as an elective subject on a voluntary basis. But out of 10,397 schools and 5,098 colleges, which had NCC then, a handful of institutions responded. Due to the limited response, the UGC again sent a circular in 2016, but it found few takers.The proposal was mooted by the Directorate General of NCC in New Delhi. The DG, NCC conducted a survey before suggesting effective implementation of the proposal to increase its scope. After the survey and consultation process with universities, the DG suggested encouraging educational institutes to take ownership of NCC training, permitting private universities and colleges to offer NCC and a paradigm shift in its positioning from extra-curricular to mainstream activity.The NCC syllabus for B and C certificates is designed as per the CBCS of NEP 2020 which grants twenty four credit points covering six semesters out of which a student can accrue four credits in the first two semesters and ten credits in the third and fourth semester and similarly ten credits in the fifth and sixth semester. In the first phase of implementation, NCC as an elective course/subject will be offered only in those colleges which already have NCC senior platoon or company, and to only those students who enroll as NCC cadets.NCC, the world’s largest voluntary uniformed youth organisation, was raised by Parliamentary Act No XXXI in 1948 with 20,000 cadets. It has grown in stature and size over the years and currently has a sanctioned strength of 15 lakh cadets who undergo basic military like training for two years in the junior wing and three years in the senior divisions.On August 15, 2020, Prime Minster Narendra Modi announced expansion of NCC to border and coastal areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/91-universities-adopt-extra-curricular-ncc-as-elective-course-101622966490033.html

He was rushed to the Udala sub-divisional hospital, where he was declared brought dead by doctor,” said officer-in-charge of Kaptipada police station, Sanjay Pradhan. The three accused were later arrested and charged with murder.The police officer said the three accused were well-built and quickly overpowered Pradhan and rained blows on him. “The constant thrashing led to internal bleeding in his head, chest and other internal organs as per the post-mortem report,” the police officer said.Pradhan’s father-in-law Prafulla Patra said the incident took place some metres away from his house. “Three youths on two motorcycles asked him to give way to cross. Though he (Ranjit) gave them space to pass through, they hurled abuses at him. Later, they dragged him out of his car and attacked him,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-leader-thrashed-to-death-in-a-road-rage-case-101622965589474.html

The entire project comprises a mosque, hospital, museum, research centre and community kitchen for the poor and will be dedicated to Faizabadi, who died in the 1857 revolt, the organisation said.Faizabadi was also known as the 'lighthouse of Independence' for keeping Awadh free of British dominance for over two years after the revolt laid the foundation for future fights for independence.IICF said that they dedicated the entire project to Faizabadi as "even 160 years after the first war of Independence, he is yet to get his due in the annals of Indian history".During the 1857 mutiny, Faizabadi fought along with royalties like Nana Sahib and Khan Bahadur Khan. A year after the mutiny, he was killed by the king of Powayan Raja Jagannath Singh.In a book, 'History of Indian Mutiny' , British officers George Bruce Malleson and Thomas Seaton repeatedly made mention of Faizabadi and spoke about his bravery and valour.The Ayodhya mosque and the hospital project is being built on the five-acre land given to the Muslims after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya Babri Masjid dispute case. The IICF trust constituted by Sunni Waqf Board had taken a decision not to name the mosque after Mughal emperor Babur.Earlier this year, the trust submitted the building plan of the mosque to the Ayodhya Development Authority for approval.

India has made it clear that disengagement and de-escalation between two armies in East Ladakh is a prerequisite for normalisation of bilateral relations, which were hit by PLA aggression in Pangong Tso and Gogra-Hot Springs area in May 2020. While there has been disengagement from Pangong Tso area from both north and south banks of the saltwater lake, the PLA has been dragging feet over disengagement in river Chang Chemmo-KongKa La area which lies between Galwan and Pangong Tso.“While the dates for the WMCC and 12th round are being awaited, the PLA is communicating that LAC disengagement in Pangong Tso has been completed as per objective of the leadership of two countries. They want the Gogra-Hot Springs disengagement to be resolved at a level of local commanders and not convene a special meeting,” said an official in know of the matter. This clearly indicates that the Chinese want to drag the disengagement around Kongka La into tedious conversations of local commanders rather than look at the big picture of bilateral relationship.Tagged on to the issue of PLA restoring status quo ante of April 2020 in Gogra-Hot Springs area is also about Indian Army’s patrolling rights in Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi, near Karakoram Pass. However, this issue will be taken up separately at the Brigadier level talks.Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping wants his Chinese Communist Party (CCP) colleagues to portray a picture of “open and confident, but also modest and humble” China, the PLA is in no mood to compromise on its strategic objectives vis-à-vis India on the LAC issue. Despite the Pangong Tso disengagement, both the armies are deployed in a division strength along the 1597 km LAC in East Ladakh with fighters and heavy armour ready in the hinterland. Deception continues to be a legitimate tool in Chinese strategic armoury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-wants-gogra-disengagement-sorted-at-local-level-not-through-military-talks-101622964014050.html

Though the meeting came amid speculation around cabinet reshuffle in Yogi Adityanath government, Singh described it as "courtesy call"."I think the chief minister will take a call on the issue," he added.Before visiting the Raj Bhavan, Singh met the state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh, once again triggering buzz over discussion on strategy ahead of the assembly elections next year. Singh and the BJP's national general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh had met state leaders for three days last month after which both the leaders backed Adityanath, describing him as the most hardworking and efficient chief minister.Speaking about his meeting with the governor, Singh told reporters, "I have known the UP governor since long and had not met her as something or other kept delaying my meeting. Finally, today I was able to meet her as courtesy demanded so especially since she is the governor of the same state of which I am the in-charge."When asked if discussions were held around cabinet reshuffle, as is being widely speculated, Singh said there are some fertile minds "who keep doing their own farming". He once again backed the chief minister, saying his government is very popular.Radha Mohan is now scheduled to meet UP assembly speaker Hriday Narain Dikshit.Meanwhile, Swatantra Dev said that seven vacancies in Yogi Adityanath government will be filled.This is another round of meetings that Singh is holding with the state leadership in the wake of the assembly elections. In May, he along with Santhosh held feedback sessions with state leaders to review the functioning of the government aming opposition allegations of mishandling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The party has decided to prepare a strategy for the elections based on feedback received from leaders in Uttar Pradesh and ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government.In the last meeting too, both the leaders had given thumbs up to the chief minister, saying his handling of the Covid-19 situation is "unparalleled".The Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are scheduled to take place in 2022. BJP had stormed back to power in the state in the 2017 Assembly polls. In the 403 member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, among the major parties, BJP has 309 legislators, SP 49, BSP 18, and Congress 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-radha-mohan-singh-meets-governor-amid-cabinet-expansion-speculation-101622963197166.html

Among other things, the release talked about the funds for the project and the environmental issues surrounding it.The Opposition criticised the Union government for spending ₹20,000 crore on the project during the Covid-19 crisis, to which the ministry said that the redevelopment plan was planned in 2019, which was before the pandemic struck. Moreover, ₹20,000 crore is a rough estimate of all the planned development or redevelopment works, the ministry added."Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost ₹862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost ₹477 crore have been awarded and works are underway.

Speaking to news agency ANI, Tikait said that the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) legislator Devendra S Babli has withdrawn his case against the arrested farmers, then "why they are not releasing them.""We have asked them (police) to either release those arrested or arrest us too," ANI quoted Tikait as saying. "Today we will talk again (with police). We will hold this dharna till our fellow farmers are released. Our demand is that if the police cannot release our comrades, then arrest us too," Tikait also said.Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar were arrested on June 1 following their demonstration against the JJP leader Devendra S Babli. During the protest, the farmers gheraoed Babli and shouted slogans against him and showed him black flags. Later, the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) filed a first information report (FIR) alleging that some of the protesters resorted to unruly behaviour and vandalised his car.Following this, farmers also demanded an FIR against Babli for allegedly using abusive language against the farmers and threatening them during the spat.On Saturday, the JJP leader released a video and apologised for his comments. “I forgive those involved in the June 1 incident and apologise for my comments at the time,” he said. Babli also said that he would withdraw the cases filed against Azad and Sisar.Till late on Saturday, discussions between farmer leaders and police officers were ongoing when all the farmers' leaders camped outside the Tohana Sadar police station. Following this, additional security has to be deployed as a controlling measure.Meanwhile, farmers from Punjab started gathering at Shambhu border and will move for Singhu border in their vehicles as the protests against three agricultural laws continue for over six months now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-demand-release-of-arrested-fellow-protesters-camp-outside-police-station-in-haryana-101622960407119.html

Maharashtra is close to the mark||Maharashtra, the state worst-affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in India, is close to crossing a grim milestone. The number of fatalities related to the disease are very close to the 1 lakh-mark in the state. Only seven countries, including India, have more than a lakh casualties.Though the daily number of Covid-19 cases have come down in Maharashtra and across India, it still has the highest caseload and deaths in the country. The country closest to Maharashtra's fatality count is France, where the coronavirus disease has killed 1.09 lakh people, according to Worldometers.Also Watch: Maharashtra's 5-step unlock planThe other countries in the list are Russia (123,436 deaths), Italy (126,472 deaths), the UK (127,836 deaths), India (346,784 fatalities), Brazil (472,629 fatalities) and the worst-hit United States (612,203 deaths).The Maharashtra government has announced five-phased unlock plan for the state. On Monday, the third level of the plan will come into force in which restaurants, shops selling non-essential items and public places are set to reopen.As per the state government's notification, municipal corporations and districts in Maharashtra with a positivity rate between 5 per cent and 10 per cent and occupancy of oxygen beds over 40 per cent are categorised under level 3. However, the local trains will remain available only for specific categories as per the state government order.The lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra were imposed in April this year when the second wave of the pandemic intensified.Maharashtra recorded 13,659 new Covid-19 cases, 300 deaths and 21,776 discharges on Saturday, according to the state's public health department bulletin. The cumulative caseload of the state mounted to 58,19,224 while the recoveries touched 55,28,834. A total of 99,512 persons have succumbed to Covid-19.The recovery rate in the state reached 95.01 per cent while the case fatality rate dropped to 1.71 per cent.India on Sunday reported 1,14,460 new fresh Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 60 days, according to the Union health ministry data.

06-06-2021||India||Centre busts myths around Central Vista, says 'claims mischievously exaggerated'||The Centre on Saturday released a document to bust the myths around the Central Vista project, which has been used by the opposition Congress party to attack the government.In a release, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs talked about the funds for the project, environmental issues surrounding it and other things. Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri had recently attacked the Congress, terming the opposition’s objections “bizarre.”On opposition's charge that ₹20,000 crore is being spent on the project this year during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry said that the redevelopment plan was envisaged in 2019, many months before the outbreak of the pandemic, and it is a generational infrastructure investment project, involving multiple projects spread over six years. It also said that ₹20,000 crore is gross rough estimate of all the planned development/redevelopment works."Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost ₹862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost ₹477 crore have been awarded and works are underway. Expenditure incurred on these 2 projects till March 2021 is ₹195 crore and budget provision for 2021-22 is ₹790 crore," the ministry said.It also rubbished the reports that ₹13,450 crore is being incurred on new house for Prime Minister. The estimate includes multiple projects, including 10 buildings, the ministry said, adding that the construction work for the Prime Minister's residence has not yet been tendered and no sanction has been accorded by the government. "The cost for the PM’s residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media," the ministry said.Further, the ministry rejected the charge of diverting funds from public healthcare and Covid-19 response to the Central Vista Project. The ministry said that in Union Budget 2020-21, there was a 137% increase from previous year’s budget estimate in allocation for public healthcare and well-being expenditure. " ₹35,000 crore of the annual allocation has been allocated as a one-time grant towards Covid-19 vaccination, significantly more than the cost of the Central Vista redevelopment project. Thus, the one-time amount for vaccination for FY 2021-22 is 175% more than the total budget for the Central Vista project, which is expected to be completed by 2026," the ministry said.Justifying the ongoing work at the project site, the central ministry said that stopping the work at this stage will entail creating liabilities for the government under the existing contracts and the workers’ interest. It also cited inflation as a key issue if the project is delayed.The Delhi high court on May 31 dismissed a plea against the ongoing construction activities of the Central Vista Redevelopment project and terming the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) as "illegal motive" to halt the construction work.Talking about the need for a new Parliament house, the housing ministry said that the present Parliament House, completed in 1927, was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy and it already highly stressed. "If the strength of the Parliament is increased after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026, it will be necessary to ensure that Parliament House has the facilities for a larger Parliament to function," the ministry's release said.The government further said that environmental sustainability is at the core of the Central Vista project, debunking the myth that it is contributing to environmental damage. "The projects will result in overall increase in green cover. Trees will be transplanted in Eco-Park being developed by NTPC at Badarpur after due permissions from competent authorities. Steps are being taken to minimise on-site air emissions, noise, wastewater discharge, soil erosion as well as construction waste," the ministry said.The ministry also promised that none of the heritage buildings - India Gate, Parliament, North & South Blocks, National Archives or any other - will be demolished. "While these heritage buildings retain their architectural majesty, they are under severe stress and in need of comprehensive upgradation. Therefore, the heritage buildings that fall under the scope of the Central Vista development/redevelopment project will be appropriately retrofitted, as per Heritage Conservation standards, and refurbished for their future use," it added, rejecting yet another charge.Rejecting the allegation that procedures were circumvented during the approval process of the Central Vista project, the ministry of housing said gave a detailed account of the key steps undertaken. It also said that all the processes have been followed in getting statutory approvals for the project. The ministry further said that the Central Vista project will create additional public and green spaces.The charges of lack of public disclosure, the project being a drain on resources and government continuing it during second wave of Covid-19 pandemic by invoking Essential Services Act were also rejected by the ministry.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-busts-myths-around-central-vista-says-claims-mischievously-exaggerated-101622955003309.html

06-06-2021||India||'Shivrajyabhisek' 2021: What it is, the significance and history||The Maharashtrian community in India is celebrating 'Shivrajyabhisek' on Sunday, a day when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as king of Maratha Swaraj in 1974. The event proved to be the watershed moment in Maratha history as it also marked the beginning of Hindavi Swarajya in India.It is also significant to know that on this day, Shivaji was given the title of 'Shakakarta' which means 'founder of an era' in English and 'Chhatrapati' (paramount sovereign). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith) during his coronation ceremony in Raigad, a district currently in the Konkan division.The day is celebrated widely in Maharashtra, especially in Raigad where locals organise a coronation ceremony for Shivaji at Raigad Fort. Many devotees of Shivaji from outside the district also come to Raigad to witness the grand celebrations. They wish each other a happy coronation day, and offer wreaths to the statue of Shivaji.However, as the state is battling the Covid-19 pandemic this year, celebrations are expected to be curtailed due to the social distancing norms.Sambhaji Chhatrapati, the 13th direct descendant of Shivaji and a Member of Parliament, on Saturday released a very rare photo of Shivaji-era coin 'Hoan' on social media commemorating to the day. "This year's Shivrajyabhishek Ceremony will be graced by the presence of a rare coin ‘Hoan’, that is part of the antiques of Shivaji Maharaj’s era," he wrote in a Facebook post."‘Hoan’ itself exemplified the sovereignty and prosperity of Swarajya established by Shivaji Maharaj. It is not merely a currency, but a symbol of our collective pride, a true national treasure. This antiquity found in the pious soil of Raigad will witness this historic occasion," he also said.Over the course of his life, Shivaji made history with some of the most significant battles of the Maratha empire. He is mostly known for expanding the Maratha empire and establishing a progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He is also revered as the hero of Hindus as he revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions during his rule as King.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivrajyabhisek-2021-what-it-is-the-significance-and-history-101622947510785.html
06-06-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee activating TMC’s next generation with eye on future: Veterans||Activating a younger and versatile leadership and eradicating centralism in the ranks of the 23-year-old Trinamool Congress (TMC) party was Mamata Banerjee’s intention behind the reshuffles and an array of do’s and don’ts she announced on Saturday, party veterans and experts have said. They also feel that the Bengal chief minister wants to play a larger role in national politics prior to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Asking her leaders to get their act together, Banerjee announced that after one month nobody will hold more than one post and said nepotism and corruption would no longer be tolerated, a move that seemed to address the allegations of corruption raised by the opposition in recent years. She even imposed a ban on use of beacons in cars used by ministers.The reshuffles she announced stunned many.Most of the young leaders, as well as older ones, Banerjee put in charge of important wings of her party are educated, have good oratory skills and last but not the least, speak Bengali, English and Hindi. The last attribute, experts and TMC veterans feel, is found lacking in most frontline leaders of other parties in Bengal.TMC leaders said election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the chief minister’s 33-year-old nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee after the party’s debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, advised the party to groom and project young and educated people. This was one of the reasons for the alienation of many old leaders who joined the BJP.“Our party has plans to extend its activities to some other states. What this will lead to remains to be seen,” TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy told HT on Saturday night.It was a significant statement in view of the assembly polls to be held next year in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat and Congress-ruled Punjab and also the 2024 general elections. Roy, however, refused to divulge more.For the record, TMC attempted to project Banerjee as the next prime minister prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but the alliance she tried to forge with regional forces was no match for the BJP.Explaining the rationale behind the one-man-one-post policy, Roy said, “Many parties follow this. It has been done so that one can devote full time to whatever he is doing.”The chief minister made her nephew the TMC’s national general secretary, a move some senior leaders in the TMC had anticipated. The post was earlier held by Subrata Bakshi, one of the chief minister’s oldest aides.Though it became somehow apparent after the TMC’s resounding victory in the assembly polls that Abhishek Banerjee might be rewarded, many feel that placing him next to his aunt in the hierarchy is part of a strategic move.The chief minister and Abhishek Banerjee became the prime targets in the campaign speeches of all BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah. They were referred to as pishi (aunt) and bhaipo (nephew) in almost all speeches and the chief minister was accused of establishing dynastic rule.“Abhishek worked for the party with dedication. He scored full marks. He deserves the new position,” said panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee who was senior to Mamata Banerjee in the Congress and later joined the TMC.“Abhishek drastically transformed himself in the last two years. He lost weight, honed his oratory skills and took the lead in campaigns and party programmes. Probably he was advised by Kishor but one cannot deny that he has earned his place,” said columnist and political analyst Suvashis Maitra.“Although I am surprised that no Muslim leader has been promoted despite the community’s contribution to the TMC’s electoral success, the organizational changes are significant. By projecting the next line of leadership, Banerjee has tried to counter the public perception that TMC is run by one person only. Also, she is looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. She may emerge as a key player in either the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) headed by Congress or a new alliance of regional forces against the BJP,” Maitra added.What people did not foresee was that the important post of president of the TMC’s youth wing, which Abhishek Banerjee vacated on Saturday, would be given to 28-year-old actress Saayoni Ghosh, who joined politics on the eve of the recent state polls, which she contested and lost. Known for her oratory skills, Ghosh became the TMC youth front’s first woman president ever since the party was formed by Banerjee in 1998 after she left the Congress where she, too, was president of the youth front.“I am grateful to the chief minister and to Abhishek Banerjee. This is a huge responsibility. I will not let them down,” said Ghosh who was trolled by the BJP supporters during the polls for an old social media post relating to a Hindu deity.“Ghosh’s appointment should enthuse not only the youth but women as well. She is very articulate and popular. There is a difference between grooming someone who is already into politics and introducing someone who comes from a different world. Ghosh, however, will need constant guidance as many old-timers will try to pull her down,” said political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay.Former Communist Party of India (Marxist) Rajya Sabha member Ritabrata Banerjee, 41, who was expelled by the party on disciplinary grounds in 2017 and joined the TMC in 2018, was made the state president of the TMC’s trade union wing. In the CPI(M), Banerjee, who was known to be close to former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was also the national general secretary of the Student’s Federation of India. In the TMC, he played a key role in strengthening the organization in some north Bengal districts where the BJP made deep inroads in 2019.Another newcomer to politics, popular Bengali film director Raj Chakraborty, 46, was made the head of the TMC’s cultural front. He won the Barrackpore assembly seat in North 24 Parganas district in the recent polls although the BJP did well in the district in the last general election.Projecting young leaders has been a salient part of the TMC’s internal strategy since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats and TMC’s tally went down from 34 to 22. The chief minister said on several occasions that she was putting in place the next generation of leaders. In the assembly polls, younger candidates were fielded from at least 100 of the 292 seats the TMC contested. Bengal has 294 assembly seats but the TMC left out two for its allies in the Darjeeling hills. The BJP bagged only 77 seats against its target to wrest more than 200.The chief minister, however, did not leave out all the seniors on Saturday.Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, 61, a doctor and three-time Lok Sabha member, was made president of the women’s front and Rajya Sabha member Dola Sen, 54, who was once a far-Left student union leader, was made national head of the trade union front. During the recent farmers’ movement in Punjab and Delhi, Sen welcomed peasant leader Rakesh Tikait when he visited Bengal.A third veteran leader, Purnendu Bose, 68, who served as minister of labour, agriculture and technical education between 2011 and 2021, has been given charge of the peasants’ front. Bose was not fielded in the recent polls but Banerjee said he would play a new role.During the polls, BJP alleged that Abhishek Banerjee is involved in the coal smuggling case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth hundreds of crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs mines.The CBI questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora, and his father Pawan Arora were also grilled. The TMC leaders alleged that the BJP is using the agency to keep the chief minister under pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-activating-tmc-s-next-generation-with-an-eye-on-future-say-veterans-101622947408925.html
06-06-2021||India||Flag row: Patel says Kejriwal corrected mistake, but never accepted he made one||Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Saturday said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal may have corrected the violation of the flag code but did not accept that he committed a mistake in the first place.“If a person commits an error by mistake, he accepts his mistake and then rectifies it. If Arvind Kejriwal ji had admitted his mistake and apologised, he would have shown his large heartedness. But his silence gives rise to doubts. You have not accepted your mistake but at least corrected it. Thank you,” Patel said in a tweet where he tagged the Prime Minister’s Office and BJP president JP Nadda.Patel on May 28 had accused Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of using the national flag as a ‘decorative’ item during his press conferences. He said the colours and how it was divided into three proportions was not in tune with provisions of the Indian Flag Code specified by the home ministry.“It appears that the national flag has been used for decoration. The white portion in the centre appears to have been reduced and the green portion added to it, which is not in tune with provisions of the Indian Flag Code specified by the Ministry of Home Affairs,” Prahlad Patel had claimed.“Being a resident of India and holding the post of the proud chief minister of a state, everyone expects you to maintain the honour and the dignity of the Tricolour, a symbol of national pride,” he further added. The letter was also sent to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Patel pointed out that such use of the national flags were disrespectful and asked the Delhi CM to look into section 2(ix) of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (which says that a flag cannot be used as decorative item on the stage of a speaker) and section 2.2(1) which states that the status of the flag should not be disrespectful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flag-row-patel-says-kejriwal-corrected-mistake-but-never-accepted-he-made-one-101622940484886.html

06-06-2021||India||Ethanol-petrol-blending 20% target date advanced to 2025: All you need to know||As India looks to cut carbon emissions and reduce oil imports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that the deadline for achieving 20% ethanol-blending with petrol was pushed to 2025 in the country. The government set a target of reaching 10% ethanol-blending in petrol by 2022 last year, and aimed to mix 20% of ethanol mixed with 90 per cent of diesel by 2030. Earlier this year, the latter target was brought forward to 2025. Currently, about 8.5% ethanol is mixed with petrol as against 1-1.5 per cent in 2014, PM Modi said, adding that higher ethanol blending over the years has led to ethanol procurement jumping from 38 crore litres to 320 crore litres. "It will go up further when 20% blending is achieved," he added while speaking on the occasion of World Environment Day on June 5.Also Read | India brings forward target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol: The impactEthanol is a bio-fuel obtained primarily from sugarcane, damaged food grains such as wheat and broken rice. It has a higher octane number than gasoline and hence, it improves the petrol octane number. Mixing it with petrol eases the pressure on India, which is the world's third-biggest oil importer, and also helps farmers as it provides them with an alternate source of income. It is also environment-friendly as agriculture waste is less polluting.However, petroleum dealers have to adhere to quality checks. If the mix of ethanol and petrol is as stipulated, it does not do any harm and does not separate from the petrol in tanks.Also Read: On World Environment Day, PM Modi says India is emerging as leader of climate justiceMeanwhile, India has been giving soft loans (loans made on terms favourable to the borrower) to sugar mills to increase ethanol production capacity by adding distillation infrastructure to the existing plants. To facilitate a smooth transition process further, the government earlier this week changed rules for companies to set up standalone ethanol production units."Ethanol manufacturing units were previously limited to only 4-5 sugarcane producing states but now food grain-based distilleries are being established to expand this to the whole country," PM Modi said, adding that India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with ideas like the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ethanolpetrolblending-20-target-date-advanced-to-2025-all-you-need-to-know-101622939404107.html
06-06-2021||India||Ethanol blend deadline advanced to 2025: Modi||India will advance by five years to 2025, its deadline for blending 20% ethanol in petrol (E20) , Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated on Saturday on the occasion of World Environment Day, even as he listed other measures such as the promotion of renewable energy the country has taken to fight the climate crisis. He also launched a pilot project in Pune for the production and distribution of ethanol across India.The promotion of E20 fuel is part of the country’s plans to cut its oil imports and reduce pollution (emissions). It is also a move that will benefit sugarcane growers. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in January that India would bring the deadline forward to 2025.Modi said India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with efforts such as the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure . He added that India has been included in the world’s top 10 countries in the Climate Change Performance Index.Modi said the country has taken both hard and soft approaches to fighting the climate crisis. On the hard approach, he noted India’s capacity for renewable energy has increased by more than 250% in the last six to seven years. “India is today among the top five countries of the world in terms of installed renewable energy capacity. Especially the capacity of solar energy has increased by about 15 times in the last six years.”He referred to the soft approach and listed India’s drive to phase out single-use plastics, clean beaches and its Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), which he launched to improve sanitation facilities in 2014.India plans to get rid of single-use plastics by 2022. It is estimated to be using about 14 million tonnes of plastic annually.Modi said until 2014, when he came to power, on average, only 1.5% of ethanol could be blended in India, which has now reached about 8.5%. The government aims to achieve 10% blending by 2022. In 2013-14, about 380 million litres of ethanol were purchased in the country. This has now grown to more than 3.2 billion litres.Modi said there has been an eightfold increase in ethanol procurement, which has benefitted the country’s sugarcane farmers. He added that most of the ethanol manufacturing units are concentrated in four to five states, where sugarcane cultivation is high but that food grain-based distilleries are now being established to expand the network to the whole country.The bulk of the additional ethanol production is expected to come from the processing of sugar cane. The switch to E20 fuel requires changes in the engine specifications of vehicles.The ethanol-blending programme is one of the seven key drivers identified by PM Modi for the country’s energy map -- gas-based economy; cleaner use of fossil fuels; greater reliance on biofuels; achieving renewables’ target of 450 GW by 2030; increasing contribution of electricity to decarbonise mobility; moving into emerging fuels such as hydrogen; and digital innovation across all energy systems.The drive is also important as India imports more than 80% of crude oil it processes and pays in dollars. India is the third largest oil consumer in the world after the US and China and its crude oil import bill was over $100 billion in 2018-19 and 2019-20. The import bill, however, fell to $62.7 billion in 2020-21, because the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic and consequent 68-day lockdown (since March 25, 2020) that devastated its economy, leading to a contraction in consumption of petroleum products. India consumed 194.63 million tonnes of petroleum products in FY-21 as compared with 214.12 million tonnes the previous year.In January, the Union government notified a modified scheme to incentivise ethanol production in the country, which allows sugar mills cheaper loans to make new investments in ethanol-blending factories.At the time, the government had said upcoming ethanol projects would be viable because oil-marketing companies would be assured buyers of ethanol for next 10 years under the scheme.To increase the production of fuel-grade ethanol, the government is planning to encourage distilleries to produce ethanol from maize and rice stocks available in state-held granaries run by the Food Corporation of India, an official said. Under the scheme, millers can divert excess sugar stocks for ethanol production.“Aside from achieving blending targets of ethanol with petrol and reduce import dependency on crude oil, a pick-up in blending will lead to higher incomes for millers. This can help clear arrears to cane farmers, which currently stands at about ₹15,000 crore,” said Anil Rana, a sugar industry consultant“The increased target for ethanol blending incentivises the use of water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and rice. A tiered incentive mechanism with preference for crops with lower water-intensity, such as millets, would help to address the increased demand for ethanol while limiting the impact on agricultural for production. Further, India produces over 275 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per year, which could be considered for ethanol production with co-benefits for air quality.” Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ethanol-blend-deadline-advanced-to-2025-modi-101622937441969.html
06-06-2021||India||Operation Bluestar's 37th anniversary today, tight security in Amritsar||Many Sikh organisations have planned programmes to celebrate 37th anniversary of Operation Bluestar on Sunday. the military operation was conducted by the army in 1984 to flush out militants hiding in the Golden Temple complex, on June 6.The Punjab government has tightened the security across the state, especially Amritsar, where Golden Temple is situated. The Amritsar commissionerate police have said they will deploy more than 6,000 cops to keep a vigil across the city.A flag march was conducted by the police from Hall Gate to Heritage Street that leads to the Golden Temple on Thursday.The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex Sikh religious body, said last week that it will display the bullet-ridden holy saroop of the Guru Granth sahib on Operation Bluestar's anniversary this year.The saroop, which was installed in the sanctum sanctorum at that time, was hit by a bullet during the army action in 1984.The decision was taken following a special meeting of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive committee.Addressing a press conference, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the Sikh community can never forget the events of 1984.Operation Bluestar was a military action ordered by then PM Indira Gandhi to flush out Sikh militants holed up in Harmandir Sahib Complex (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. The operation that was carried out between June 1 and June 8, 1984 claimed several lives and left the shrine damaged.Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards after Operation Bluestar, triggering a further wave of retaliation in which nearly 3,000 Sikhs were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-bluestar-s-37th-anniversary-today-tight-security-in-amritsar-101622936709706.html
06-06-2021||India||Twitter given ‘last notice’ to follow IT rules||Twitter will have to face “unintended consequences” including losing the legal protection from criminal liability that it currently enjoys if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content, according to a “last notice” issued as a “gesture of goodwill” by the central government to the social media firm.The warning from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) escalates an already worsening standoff between the government and the social media company, which has previously urged the Centre to give it more time to comply with the new IT rules and raised concerns over the “core elements” of the IT norms.Twitter’s “lack of commitment towards providing a safe experience to the people of India” and the refusal to comply with the new norms that came into effect on May 25 will lead to “unintended consequences” that include “losing exemption from liability” as a social media intermediary under Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000, MeitY said in the letter.The notice did not specify a deadline for compliance, but said it should be done “immediately”.It was issued on a day that another controversy erupted over the removal of verified badges, better known as the “blue ticks”, of vice-president Venkaiah Naidu and several Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders. Twitter said the verified status for Naidu was removed as the account was lying dormant for months, and that it was restored soon after. Badges for RSS leaders were also restored.Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, grants social media companies protection from criminal action for third-party content posted on the websites.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were notified in February and enforced fully on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Under criticism over the past few months, the government has maintained that the new IT rules make companies more accountable for the online content posted on their websites and protects users from abuse. The companies, several experts and opposition parties believe that the norms may have a bearing on the right to free speech and privacy.The people of India “deserve and demand” a fair mechanism to address their grievances and resolve their disputes, the ministry said, adding: “Leave alone proactively creating such a mechanism, Twitter Inc is in the inglorious bracket of refusing to do so even when mandated by law.”Twitter India declined to respond to requests for a comment on Saturday.MeitY also said on Saturday it wrote to Twitter on May 26 and May 28 for an update on compliance, but it was “dismayed” that the company’s responses “neither address the clarifications sought by this ministry nor indicate full compliance with the Rules”.Among other things, the company was yet to inform the ministry about its chief compliance officer, and its grievance officer and nodal contact person were not Twitter India employees as required by the rules, MeitY said. “The office address of Twitter Inc. as mentioned by you is of a law firm in India, which is also not as per the rules,” the notice addressed to Twitter’s deputy general counsel Jim Baker pointed out.Non-compliance will lead to “consequences” but as a “gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice”, the ministry added. According to government officials, Facebook, Whatsapp and Google have shared details of the officers appointed by them, but Twitter is yet to do so. Last week, Twitter urged the government to give it three months to comply with the new rules.The Delhi high court, which was hearing a plea, too asked Twitter on May 31 to follow the guidelines.The US-based company, which has over 17 million users in India, has had multiple run-ins with the Union government since February this year, when it did not fall in line on the Centre’s request to take down content against newly enacted agriculture laws and farm protests.Last month, Twitter also said in a statement it was worried about the safety of its staff in the country after a Delhi Police team visited its company offices for an investigation linked to the labelling of posts by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders against the Opposition Congress as “manipulated media”.The firm said it was concerned about “the potential threat to free speech” and the “core elements” of the new IT guidelines. The statement prompted a backlash from the Centre, which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate terms to the world’s largest democracy”.Shortly after the norms were enforced on May 25, Facebook-owned Whatsapp also challenged the rules in the Delhi high court and said that the mandate will force the messaging app to break end-to-end encryption. This mandatory requirement violates the fundamental right to free speech and is a “dangerous invasion of users privacy”, it argued in the suit||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-given-last-notice-to-follow-it-rules-101622929045953.html

Though its composite score improved from 58 to 61, it remained among the bottom five states along with Nagaland and Chhattisgarh. Performances of the states were assessed from 16 SDGs - zero poverty, no hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality and peace, justice and strong institutions.“The state of Odisha figures in the list of bottom five states of the SDG report of NITI Aayog. It is shameful and very unfortunate for us,” said Bhubaneswar MP and BJP leader Aparajita Sarangi. “I wonder that the state of Andhra Pradesh has 9.2 per cent people who are living under national below poverty line. Many families in Bhubaneswar parliamentary constituency are yet to get pucca houses under government scheme. At least 14.2% or 1 crore people are still living in kutcha houses in Odisha while in West Bengal the figure is only 6% and in Andhra Pradesh, it is 3.2%. “The central government has sanctioned lakhs of pucca houses to Odisha. Where are these?” she asked.The BJP leader said Odisha ranked sixth from the bottom in the list of 28 states in the category of Zero Hunger of the sustainable development goal. At least 29 per cent of children below 5 years are malnourished in the state, which was mentioned in the report, she said. Besides, 47.6 pc of pregnant women and 29.5 pc adolescents are anaemic.“The state’s rank in the Gender Equality is 11 from bottom. Criminal cases against 103.5 % women in the state have come to fore. As per the report, 103 women in 1 lakh are exploited in the state. The harassment cases against women continue to surge since 2015. The BJD government has failed to ensure safety and security of women,” she alleged.In the category of Economic Growth, Odisha ranked second from the bottom among 28 states. The state secured zero in ease of doing business despite undertaking various programmes like ‘make In Odisha’.Sarangi said in the ‘No Poverty’ category, Odisha’s population below poverty line (32.59 pc), households covered by health insurance (47.7 pc) and those living in kutcha houses (14.2 pc) showed no improvement. “Odisha is among the worst performers in the goal of providing decent work and economic growth. It also was adjudged a laggard in Decent Work and Economic Growth with only 11.92 bank branches and 15.72 ATMs per one lakh population.“Even employment provided against demand under MGNREGA saw a marginal drop,” she said.State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik said BJD may not face any immediate repercussions of their misgovernance, but the fact is the people of Odisha will continue to suffer. “Congratulations to the BJD govt. Odisha has now slumped to 21st position from 16th, in NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index,” he tweeted.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.However, BJD leader and Rajya Sabha MP Amar Patnaik alleged that there could be some discrepancies during preparation of the SDG ranking. “SDG report is not a political report. It should not be used to play dirty politics, but use it for fostering more development. It is unfortunate that the BJP is doing politics even not going through the report thoroughly. The data provided by the state has not been taken into account in the SDG report,” said the BJD MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-slam-naveen-patnaik-govt-over-odisha-s-poor-ranking-in-niti-aayog-report-101622920526075.html

Talking at the core committee meeting on Covid-19, the CM said about 50 lakh people would have to take the vaccine from this age group, and the state shall be getting 38 lakh doses in June-end. Everyone will be covered by the middle of July. “Efforts are on a war footing to contain the possible third wave in the state. We have started a detailed study on different mutations. We have to be more vigilant as there are reports that children may get infected during the third wave,” he said. All departments should work together to meet the threat of a possible third wave, he said. Meanwhile, the state reported 17,328 cases on Saturday when 205,000 samples got tested with a test positivity rate of 14.89 per cent.

06-06-2021||India||How a 1969 movie helped Kerala win rights over ‘KSRTC’ use||In a legal battle over the name, the Kerala government used an old Malayalam movie as one of the proofs. A long 7-year-old legal battle between Kerala and Karnataka over who gets to use the acronym KSRTC concluded, claimed the Kerala government. Kerala on Wednesday announced that the Trademarks Registry’s final verdict gave it the right to use the abbreviation KSRTC and Karnataka (which also calls its transport service KSRTC), which can no longer use it. While appreciating his officials, Kerala Transport Minister Antony Raju said that Kerala public transport system has left its mark on our cultural life, including in cinema and literature. “The history of KSRTC in Kerala is intertwined with the lives of the people. It’s not just a vehicle service. Glad the Trademark‌ Registry was able to figure it out and place an order. And congratulations to the officers who worked for this. said yesterday that this was an achievement for KSRTC,” he said. One of the reasons for him to use cinema in his message was that while making a case was to prove that the Transport Corporation existed in Kerala even before the Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, the state presented a 1969 movie ‘Kannur Deluxe’ starring Prem Nazir as evidence, said a Kerala transport department official. Kannur Deluxe, released in 1969 and starring Prem Nazir and Sheela, was mainly shot at the Ernakulam stand. Prem Nazir plays the role of the CID who came to investigate the murder on the KSRT bus. The film was shot on a Kannur deluxe bus from Kannur to Thiruvananthapuram as the story revolves around a bus. Even though Kerala claimed victory, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Managing Director Shivayogi Kalasad, said that Kerala’s claims are factually incorrect, and Karnataka has not received any notice of the same. He added that since there is no notice, there is no legal prohibition as such against the use of the trademark ‘KSRTC’. “These reports are factually incorrect, as we have not received any such notice or order from the Central Trade Mark Registry as claimed until today. No final orders have also been passed in the said appeals,” he said in the statement. The legal battle began in 2013 when Karnataka raised a claim over the rights to use the acronym. Once Karnataka had got the certificate to use the KSRTC trademark from the Controller General of Patent and Trademark the same year, it issued a notice to Kerala, asking its government to stop using the acronym. Kerala challenged this decision in 2015, which resulted in the latest legal victory for Kerala. In Kerala, the erstwhile Travancore State Transport Department was re-established as Kerala State Road Transport Corporation on April 1, 1965. And in Karnataka, the Mysore Government Road Transport Department (MGRTD), started in 1948, became Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation in 1973. However, according to Karnataka, Kerala’s claim is invalid since it obtained victory through the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB, which has been abolished. “IPAB was abolished by an Ordinance of the Central Government dated 4.04.2021 and all such pending applications will be transferred to the High Court for adjudication,” the Karnataka SRTC department said in a statement. “So as on date, KSRTC’s registration of the marks continue to be legally in force and the claim of Kerala SRTC in news reports that Karnataka state cannot use the trademarks is factually incorrect and legally untenable. As such, there is no legal prohibition against the use of the trademark ‘KSRTC’ by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation,” said Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who holds charge of transportation. Further referring to the potential notice from its Kerala counterpart, he said. “If and when such a notice is issued, a suitable reply would be issued. We are currently consulting our lawyers to take effective legal steps to protect our rights.” He also added that the state will explore all legal options available before giving up on the matter. Meanwhile, two days after threatening to issue a notice to Karnataka RTC “asking them not to use KSRTC anymore”, Kerala SRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar said there were not many issues between the two RTCs over the trademark. He said he had already spoken to Kalasad over the trademark. “Some other issues like domain names would be settled amicably through talks,” said Prabhakar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-1969-movie-helped-kerala-win-rights-over-ksrtc-use-101622919925528.html

During the two recent cyclones — Tauktae and Yaas — coastal areas bore the maximum brunt in the state. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has recently written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to declare coastal erosion as a natural disaster in order to help provide compensation to those affected from the national and state disaster response funds. Speaking at a webinar organised by premier marine body Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Saturday as part of the World Environment Day, experts called for restoration of coastal vegetation giving more emphasis on mangrove forests which, they said, would act as a bio-shield protecting lives of residents. The webinar highlighted that the entire Kerala coast recently witnessed ‘storm surge’ during two cyclones. Experts said such storm surges are likely to occur in the coast increasingly in coming years with rapid warming of waters in the Indian Ocean. Alarming winds triggered by cyclones help form storm surge in waters that results in high waves, sea erosion and flooding in the coastal hamlet, experts said, adding this was evidently seen recently especially in coastal areas like Chellanam in Kochi. Kerala’s coastal region could be protected from the wrath to a great extent through restoration of mangroves and other biodiversity in the region, said CMFRI director Dr A Gopalakrishnan. “Conservation of coastal biodiversity, which is in deterioration owing to many reasons including constructions, is the best long-term natural option for protecting the lives of coastal people from sea turbulence,” he said, adding that mangroves act as a model bio-shield. The webinar, which was attended by leading experts who work on mangroves, recommended that restoration of coastal vegetation along the Kerala coast should be planned in a social forestry concept with public participation. Feasibility studies are required for identifying potential areas for mangrove forestation, experts said. Dr N Vasudevan, managing director of Forest Development Corporation, Maharashtra; PP Pramod, chief conservator, Forest Eastern Circle and Custodian, Vested Forest, Kerala; Dr R Ramasubramanian, director of Coastal Systems Research Programme at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai; Dr P Kaladharan, principal scientist of CMFRI; Dr Grinson George, senior programme specialist at SAARC; Dr K Vinod, princiapal scientist of CMFRI and Dr Ratheesh Kumar R, scientist of CMFRI also spoke at the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mangroves-best-remedy-to-check-growing-sea-erosion-in-kerala-experts-101622919866807.html
06-06-2021||India||Independent candidate alleges BJP paid ₹2.5 lakh to pull out of Kerala polls, party rejects charge||Thiruvananthapuram: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala has landed in yet another controversy, with one of the independent candidates in Mancheswaram alleging that the party paid him ₹2.5 lakh and a smart phone for withdrawing his nomination from the 2021 assembly elections. K Sundara, an independent candidate from north Kerala, alleged this was done to favour BJP state president K Surendran, who was contesting from the seat. Speaking to reporters in Kasaragod on Saturday, Sundara said he was under tremendous pressure and sought ₹15 lakh from the BJP to withdraw his papers. He alleged that he was paid ₹2.5 lakh and received a smart phone, adding that he was also offered a wine parlour and a house in Karnataka once K Surendran emerged victorious. In Kerala, independent candidates bearing similarities with the main contender’s name are often promoted by opponents in a bid to confuse voters and dent the vote share. In 2016 assembly elections, Sundara got 467 votes while Surendran lost the seat by a slender margin of 89 votes. He said this time the BJP was cautious and many party leaders from Karnataka pressurised him to withdraw from the election. He added that after withdrawing his nomination, he campaigned openly for Surendran. However, the BJP state president lost the seat last month by a bigger margin of 745 votes to Muslim League’s AKM Ashraf in a triangular contest. “After the loss nobody contacted me. I did not get the promised amount,” said Sundara. While BJP Kasaragod district president K Sreekanth denied the allegations, Surendran was not available for his comments. “These are wild allegations. K Sundara withdrew his papers on his own,” said Sreekanth. Ashraf said he will take up the issue with the election commission. The latest allegation has surfaced at a time when the BJP is struggling with highway heist and subsequent police investigation. The highway incident unfolded on Thrisur-Ernakulam highway in Kodakara on April 3 when a man named S Shamseer, who was transporting cash, was waylaid by a group of people, who robbed the money after assaulting him. Four days later (on April 7), Shamseer filed a police complaint claiming ₹25 lakh, which was meant for a property transaction, was stolen from his vehicle. Police filed a case on April 7 following the compliant. There were many loose ends in the statement of Shamseer and police later found that seized money would run into crores (according to latest information it was about ₹3.5 crore). On sustained interrogation by the police, Shamseer reportedly took name of one Dharmajan, a local RSS leader, and alleging that the money collected from many sources was meant for election activities. After investigation, police have arrested 20 persons involved in the snatching incident, all history-sheeters. Police have recovered ₹1.25 crore so far. There are many criminal gangs that target hawala money and gold carriers, a police official said. There are allegations that the seized money came from Karnataka and was meant to influence voters. Many district leaders of the BJP were questioned in Thrissur and there is a strong speculation that K Surendran and party MP Suresh Gopi could be summoned by police. “The BJP had spent crores in Kerala, but people gave a befitting reply by closing its lone account in the state. It is time for the party to understand that Kerala is not a fertile land for it,” CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said, adding that more such incidents will surface soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-candidate-alleges-bjp-paid-2-5-lakh-to-pull-out-of-kerala-polls-party-rejects-charge-101622919805373.html

On Saturday, a two-day meeting between BJP national president JP Nadda, general secretaries and office bearers began, where a report on the work undertaken by the party was shared. Heads of various morchas also shared a report with the party president, a party functionary said.According to people aware of the developments, Nadda and general secretary organisation BL Santhosh also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi later in the day to apprise him about the meeting.

06-06-2021||India||A year after being passed, farm laws continue to face protests||The three new agricultural laws to push reforms in the farm sector completed a year of being promulgated on Saturday, first as ordinances, but achieving little so far as millions of farmers continue to oppose them.The feisty protests by farmers, especially from food-bowl states, such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have brought cultivators and farm policies back to the centre stage, which could impact political outcomes too, analysts said.The country has not seen such mobilisation among peasants since 1988, when Mahendra Singh Tikait, a farm union leader from western Uttar Pradesh, stormed Delhi and laid siege to Boat Club, a landmark near the nation’s Parliament, forcing the government of the day to agree to make concessions.On June 5, 2020, the Union government promulgated three ordinances, which were signed into laws by Parliament in September: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of commodities for future sales and set new rules for contract farming.The government has said the laws would bring competition and widen farmers’ market access. Besides, allowing firms to stock large quantities of food commodities will incentivise them to invest in supply and storage, which is scarce.Farmers say the laws will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining power at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices for cereals.Unregulated markets will ultimately lead to a collapse of crucial minimum support rices, farmers argue, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied this will ever happen.“The crux of the matter is that the laws are centred around large corporations, which have great bargaining power and which are against the interests of farmers and consumers. Why can’t markets be farmer-led?” asks Kavitha Kuruganthi, one of the farmers’ appointed negotiators with the government.The government has so far held 11 rounds of talks, which hit a dead end on January 22. The Supreme Court has put the laws on hold since.Economists point to growth-fuelling reforms in industry, currency markets and manufacturing, but such measures have bypassed the farm sector.“It is easier to do a stock market reform or financial reform because its scope is limited to a certain elite section of the population. But when it comes to hard reforms affecting masses, such as labour or agricultural reforms, these are areas where we will see big challenges,” said KK Kailash, who teaches political science in the University of Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-after-being-passed-farm-laws-continue-to-face-protests-101622919325278.html

They have empowered ordinary Indians, but our approach is very straight forward; namely, you (companies) will have to follow the constitution and laws of India.Q There are concerns that these guidelines will lead to censorship of voices that are critical of the government and about maintaining end-to-end encryption.A These guidelines do not deal with the use of social media. We permit criticism against the government and the Prime Minister, but the issue is the abuse and misuse of social media platforms. What should I say when a woman complains that her morphed image is being circulated on social media? Or a mother complains that her daughter’s ex-boyfriend is pushing out all intimate pictures. Should they be asked to go to America to file a complaint? Nowadays judges are trolled and defamed; fake news has become an everyday occurrence.These guidelines basically enjoin three things. Number one, appoint an India-based grievance redressal officer whose address and phone number are known to us and those grievances must be addressed in 15 days time. You have to give a monthly report that grievances have been addressed. Secondly, have a compliance officer to deal with the rules and regulations and third, for nodal contact with the government there must be a person. Are we asking for the moon? There are more than hundred crore users of social media in India it did not happen suddenly there was demand from civil society there were two Supreme Court judgments in 2018 and the Facebook case of 2019 where the Supreme Court spoke about how some messages can incite violence or be a threat to the sovereignty of the country; pedophiles use it in a big way.In such circumstances it is imperative that there is a properly framed regime to find out the person and institutional bodies who are the originators of such content.Q …But there is a concern that traceability would compromise privacy.A Let me a sure all the users of WhatsApp; ordinary users have nothing to fear. They will do as they are doing now. What we are seeking now is information about only those messages whose contents are already in the public domain --which incite a riot, mob lynching, impinge on the sovereignty and security of the country, show a woman in bad light or show child sexual abuse-- and are being circulated and re-circulated. They have to disclose who began the mischief and if it has come from across the border, who lapped it up in India. Can we deny that last year during the riot in Delhi many explosive messages came from across the border?This will be done only and only when other less intrusive methods have not worked. There is a reasonable classification that it is for the public good for the safety and security of India, and dignity of women and against child sexual abuse.Q Has the government addressed the concern of not having a digital fingerprint on all messages?A The problem of technology is answered by technology. Cambridge analytical obtained data from Facebook of five lakh Indians. In their recent privacy policy, they say we shall share data on WhatsApp with other business associates including Facebook, so where is privacy.Let us disabuse ourselves of this notion of privacy. We appreciate the judgement of Supreme Court on privacy. But in the same judgment, the court observed that a terrorist or a corrupt or a criminal do not have the right of privacy otherwise there will be no investigation.Second, what a person eats is a personal choice, but if you go to a restaurant the bill will be digital. They know what you ate. Where you travel is a personal choice but if you go by a plane, tickets will be digital, they will know you travelled on a particular date.Privacy in my considered view is something that relates to individual identity--your matrimonial information, your sexual preferences, your medical records and your health records and the privacy right of a minor and maybe if you’re not a public servant then your income. These are the privacy rights, and they must be safe guarded.Q There is a perception that if the intermediary tag is removed, it may even mean more censorship. Also, going by the requests for take-downs, the government appears less accommodating of criticism.A It is absolutely false. First in these guidelines the government is out, you (companies) have to appoint a grievance officer. The victim of abuse will relate to the social media company not the government. If a woman’s dignity is being robbed, she will ask WhatsApp who started it and if you (companies) do not (help) then the security establishment will help her. The larger narrative however is when you blocked the Twitter accounts of many who invaded the Capitol Hill violence in Washington including that of a former president that’s your call. How is it that when at the Red Fort, in the wake of the farmers’ agitation, content related to terrorist supporters and sword wielding people was pushed out… this is double standard. You show a part of Ladakh as a part of China and we have to labour for a fortnight to get it removed, why? When Singapore protested why is it called the Singaporean variant they removed it immediately, but here in India we have to labour for a week to remove the tags India variant and Modi variant. Earn good money, do good business, but you will have to learn to respect the laws of India. India will not compromise its digital sovereignty.Individual complaints come and go…Q Vice president’s Twitter account lost the verification badge as did many RSS leaders. Has the government taken this up?A: I understand they have already restored it but I will not go into that issue except to make this observation-- Twitter is welcome to do business in India but learn to respect to the constitutional authority.Q The G7 finance ministers have made an agreement to commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% corporation tax and measures to make tech giants pay their fair share on a country-by-country basis. What is India’s view on this?A: That is a larger issue, what is the outcome of that debate we will have to reflect on that. Our data protection laws also yet to be passed by parliament.Q Will an independent regulator such as the oversight board set up in the US by Facebook work in India?A: Many of these issues have been addressed in the data protection law. Here the larger regulator issue should not be confused with the rights of the users who are the victims of abuse. My question is very straight, if a person is being victimised on a fake or false narrative should that person go to America? Therefore, we have said have a robust machinery in India.Q If the safe harbour provision for the intermediary (that protects them from liability for the acts of third parties who use this infrastructure for their own purposes) is withdrawn what is the liable action that can be taken?A: I don’t want to make any value judgement… the guideline is clear if you don’t obey the guidelines then you lose safe harbour exemption under section 79 of the IT Act. If the intermediary fails to observe rules, they are liable for punishment under the prevailing law including the provisions of the Indian penal code.Q Twitter recently said it was concerned by recent events regarding its employees in the country and a potential threat to “freedom of expression” for citizens.A: India is too big a democracy governed by the Constitution (we have) our robust, independent institutions such as the Supreme Court, media et cetera and civilisational heritage of democracy and accommodation. Twitter, an America based private company earning profit should not lecture us on democracy or free speech. If they are so concerned, first establish your concern by giving a forum to your users in India against abuse. The police have already clarified that under the penal law it is a legal obligation of everyone individual or institution to help the police in an investigation. They had asked some of them to appear, they said go to America, they did not take the summons, so the police had gone to serve the summons that’s all. I wish to categorically say that be it Twitter or any social media employees need not have any fear.Q What is the status of the data protection bill?A: We are very keen to pursue the data protection law. The select committee headed by Meenakshi Lekhi has already submitted an interim report. In the next session of Parliament, Covid permitting, we will pursue it in right earnest. I am very keen that data protection law must be a fine blend of recognising the element of consent of the owner of the individual data and also India becoming a big centre of data cleaning, data processing. I am very happy a large number of data centres are opening in India including in the private sector. India generates billions of data because of our size and population.Q How is the government working to address the concerns about a digital divide that comes in the way of vaccination in rural areas or for the urban poor?A: Just see how many rural people are taking the vaccines. If there’s anything that needs to be done surely, we will support the health ministry. In making digital healthcare possible our ministry gives all the support.Q Was the government blindsided. Did it miss the red flags about the second wave?A: I will differ with you for the simple reason that the second wave was not only in India. It was in Japan, Australia, Germany and England and many Southeast Asian countries and parts of America. You should go to see the stress on health care in these places. We have to all work together. WTO data said between March 2020 and March 2021 about 1.25 crore Indians were infected, but in the last 49 days 1.30 crore were infected, see the enormity of the challenge and yet the way we have handled the crisis whether it was oxygen, or the hospital beds all issues are under control.The opposition first criticised the vaccine policy, at every stage they asked questions. The polio vaccine was being administered only to children, yet it took at least 15 years to make India polio-free. Here you have to vaccinate the whole population practically therefore, if we have a target of doing it by the year end, I think we are moving with great speed. The Prime Minister had warned all chief ministers to pull up their socks.Q There is a lot of confrontation between the centre and the states particularly West Bengal. The opposition complains their suggestions are met with barbs.A: Constructive suggestions are very welcome. West Bengal elections were held as per the constitutional requirement. It is a different place altogether, why is it (bickering with the centre) not happening with Kerala. Now you see how vaccines are being wasted in Rajasthan and there is a problem in Punjab. I’m saying let us make it a national issue and the state and Centre both have to work together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-compromise-its-digital-sovereignty-ravi-shankar-prasad-101622919207459.html

In Odisha, Covaxin is being given to only people in BMC area.Till Saturday morning, Bhubaneswar had 2440 doses of Covaxin meant for people in the 18-45 age group while 4.58 lakh doses were left for people in the 45+ group. With the BMC prioritising people who are due for second dose, it is vaccinating only a handful people who booked their jabs for their first shot.“We can divert the stock. We had earlier asked the Centre to give permission. However, as the Centre has not said no to our proposal, we plan to use the stock for the 18-45 age group. The doses can be adjusted once the state allocation is streamlined,” said the health secretary.Last month, the Maharashtra government had diverted over 3 lakh doses meant for 18-45 age group to 45+ age group for their second dose.The decision to divert the Covaxin shots meant for 45+ age group to 18-45 age group came after it was found that the number of people turning up for vaccination in the second group was higher than the first one. Though vaccination opened for 45+ age group from April 1, so far 3.4 lakh people in that group from BMC area have taken their first dose. In comparison, over 1.6 lakh people out of 5.17 lakh eligible in the age group of 18-45 have taken their first dose.Bharat Biotech has committed to supply 26,000 doses of Covaxin for the 18-44 age group by June 7, but it would be grossly inadequate to meet the requirement.The BMC has announced that students in the 18-45 age group who want to go abroad would be vaccinated. They can register themselves by dialling 1929 and a special vaccination drive will be launched for them.So far, Odisha has received around 9.71 lakh doses of both Covaxin and Covishield for a targeted population of 17.22 lakh of 18 years plus in 11 cities. This includes 2.27 lakhs doses of Covishield vaccine that it received on Saturday evening. The state plans to cover 5.88 lakh people in the 18-45 age group in 11 towns - Angul, Balangir, Balasore, Bhadrak, Boudh, Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Gajapati, Chhatrapur (Ganjam), Jagatsinghpur and Jajpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-divert-covaxin-doses-meant-for-45-to-18-44-age-group-in-bhubaneswar-101622919025941.html

The new e-filing portal will be located at www.incometax.gov.in and it will provide “a modern, seamless experience” to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement on Saturday.“New taxpayer friendly portal is integrated with immediate processing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to issue quick refunds to taxpayers,” it said.All interactions and uploads or pending actions will be displayed on a single dashboard for follow-up action by taxpayer, it added. CBDT said the portal will provide a “free of cost ITR preparation software” with interactive questions to help taxpayers to file for various ITRs, both online and offline. The facility will be gradually provided for the entire range of ITRs.“Taxpayers will be able to proactively update their profile to provide certain details of income including salary, house property, business/profession which will be used in pre-filling their ITR,” it said.Detailed enablement of pre-filling with salary income, interest, dividend and capital gains will be available after tax deducted at source (TDS) and Statement of Financial Transaction (SFT) details are uploaded, which is due on June 30, 2021.The new portal will also enable a new call centre for taxpayers’ assistance and promptly respond to taxpayer queries. It will also have detailed frequently asked questions (FAQs), user manuals, videos and chatbot.The portal will have functionalities for filing income-tax forms, add tax professionals, submit responses to notices in faceless scrutiny or appeals. “It is clarified that the new tax payment system will be launched on June 18th, 2021 after the advance tax instalment date to avoid any taxpayer inconvenience,” it said.Besides the portal, a mobile app will also be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal, to enable taxpayers to get familiar with the various features.“Familiarization with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers/stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition,” CBDT said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbdt-to-launch-revamped-and-easy-income-tax-payment-system-on-monday-101622918066030.html
06-06-2021||India||Private hospitals across country got 12mn doses in May: Centre||The Union health ministry on Saturday said that private hospitals across the country received 12 million doses of vaccines against Covid-19 in May, clarifying that this included hospitals in tier II and tier III cities, in a response to a news report that said 50% of the total doses allocated to the private sector went to nine private hospital chains.“A large number of private hospitals that have contract with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have been supplied with Covishield and Covaxin doses. These private hospitals are not limited to the bigger metros, but also from Tier II & III cities across states,” the release from the health ministry said, rejecting charges of vaccine inequity in India’s inoculation drive.The states with fewer private hospitals have been asked to list out the ones that have been performing better under the government’s Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme and other state insurance schemes keeping geographical spread in mind. The government is encouraging these hospitals to get into contract with the vaccine manufacturers. “This mechanism facilitates better access and reduces the operational stress on Government Vaccination facilities..,” the release said.The government has reserved 25% of the doses manufactured for the private hospitals under the new liberalised vaccination policy adopted May 1 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-hospitals-across-country-got-12mn-doses-in-may-centre-101622917885781.html
06-06-2021||India||‘5 states, UTs to get tap water by 2022, ahead of deadline’||The Union government has decided to fully implement its programme of providing tap water to every household in five northern states and union territories by end of the current financial year, instead of the earlier deadline of 2024 and has allocated of ₹8216.25 crore for 2021-22, according to an official statement.These states and federally-administered territories estimated to have complete coverage under the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission by end of FY22 are Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.The amount allocated for quickening the project in these five states is four times the allocation in the previous year. When completed, an estimated 50 million people will have access to a functional tap water connection in these five states.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Jal Jeevan programme on Independence Day, 2019. In this period, Goa, Telangana, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Puducherry have fully implemented the scheme. In all, households in 62 districts, 746 blocks and 91000 villages now have a functional tap water connection.India has 190 million rural households, according to Census 2011.At the start of the mission, slightly more than 30 million households had piped drinking water. Since the mission’s launch in August 2019, nearly 40 million new households have been addedIn Haryana, 91.32% rural homes now have tap water supply in 5,150 villages spread across eight districts. In Punjab, 77% rural households have access to tap water supply under the Jal Jeevan Mission.Lack of clean drinking water is a leading cause of child morbidity and estimated to cost 2% of potential gross domestic product (GDP), according to World Bank estimates.Many Indian regions are severely water-stressed, according to the state-run think-tank Niti Aayog’s Composite Water Management Index 2019.Nearly 820 million people in 12 major river basins of the country face “high to extreme” water stress. This has prompted the Centre to ramp up targets under the Mission, covering the entering country by 2024.“What is equally important is whether enough thought is going into making these facilities sustainable on a long-term basis,” said Anand Goswami, who formerly taught at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-states-uts-to-get-tap-water-by-2022-ahead-of-deadline-101622917825206.html
06-06-2021||India||New vaccine platform to monitor immunisation impact: Panel chief||The first analysis that will show the impact of immunisation against Covid-19 is expected in a few weeks, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) chief Dr NK Arora said on Saturday as efforts to harmonise the data are ramped up by the group to study the efficacy of all vaccines being administered across the country and chances of reinfection, including the fatality rate post-vaccination.The new vaccine platform that will collate three different data sets — Covid-19 test results, breakthrough infections as well as their severity, and vaccination numbers across the population — will be able to determine trends regarding chances of reinfection post-immunisation (after both the first and the second dose) and even the efficacy of different vaccines. This platform will be coordinated and managed by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research). The analysis done on the platform will also help determine the efficacy of a single shot of the vaccine.“The platform will monitor the impact of immunisation on the Covid pandemic,” Arora said. “It will help us assess what is the risk of getting a Covid infection post the first dose and the second dose and the severity of the infection. It will help assess not only the risk of being hospitalised, but also the fatality rate in such cases.”According to Arora, the need to assess and harmonise the three sets of data started taking concrete shape in early April. The platform, which is being developed along with the health ministry and ministry of electronics and information technology, will be accessible to the public.“The attempt is to put out regular bulletins on the platform. This will help everyone understand the impact of the pandemic in a transparent manner,” he said.The data will be sourced from ICMR and will include Covid reports, the CoWIN platform, vaccination numbers, and Aarogya Setu, which will provide location and other demographics such as age and gender. Data for over 300 million RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests will be collated with that of over 190 million users of Aarogya Setu and further contrasted with the 220 million vaccination doses administered across the country.“An analysis will be done for all vaccines being administered in the country,” Arora said. “This is huge data set and in time, will be able to provide meaningful interpretations and can also be implemented for other immunisation programmes.”The platform will further categorise the chances of reinfection after the first dose and second dose of the vaccine, that is, those who have been partially and fully immunised.“We are also looking at other determinants to help us understand the other demographic features, such as age, gender and type of vaccine given. We will be doing an analysis for all vaccines being administered in the country and assessing the risk of being hospitalised, severity of the disease and risk of death,” Arora said.The platform, said Arora, will set the stage for technological interventions in the field of medicine.“It will be like a dream come true,” he said. “Every health programme, maternity programmes, tuberculosis assessment and other immunisation programmes will be able to benefit from this. This will have a long-term impact on the use of technology and the benefits we can accrue from its use for our health system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-vaccine-platform-to-monitor-immunisation-impact-panel-chief-101622917705135.html
06-06-2021||India||GST revenue dips, still over ₹1L cr||Goods and Services Tax revenue in May remained above the ₹1 lakh crore mark despite many parts of the country being hit by a devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to lockdowns in key business centres including Maharashtra and Delhi from April.The GST revenue in May -- which reflects the actual business activities of the previous month -- fell by over 27% to ₹1,02,709 crore compared to the record collections of ₹ 1,41,384 crore in April (reflecting actual business transactions of March 2021). The GST collections remained above the benchmark of ₹1 lakh crore for the eighth consecutive month.“The revenues for the month of May 2021 are 65% higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year [ ₹62,151 crore],” the Union finance ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Indian economy was hit hard in the first quarter of the previous year because of a 68-day national lockdown since March 25, 2020. The severity of the lockdowns since April this year was lower, with most states allowing manufacturing activities to continue.The GST collection data for a month is normally released on the first day of the following month. As various deadlines were extended to provide relief to taxpayers from the second wave, they could file returns up to June 4, a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.“The May figure actually reflects business activities from April 1 to April 30. In usual circumstances, business entities have to file returns [GSTR 3B] of these transactions by May 20. Due to the second wave, businesses had been granted more time to file returns,” the official explained. GSTR-3B is a monthly summary statement of business transactions filed by a registered entity.Out of the ₹1,02,709 crore gross GST revenue collected in May this year, central GST (CGST) was ₹17,592 crore, state GST (SGST) was ₹22,653, integrated GST (IGST) was ₹53,199 crore, including ₹26,002 crore collected on the import of goods. The cess collection was ₹9,265 crore, including ₹868 crore collected on the import of goods, the finance ministry statement said.“During the month, revenues from import of goods was 56% higher and the revenues from domestic transaction (including import of services) are 69% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” it added.Businesses performed poorly last year because of a hard nationwide lockdown for over two months that led to a 24.4% contraction of the economy in the first quarter of 2020-21. The economy shrank by 7.3% in the second quarter, before expanding by 0.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 1.6% in the March quarter. Overall, the Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in 2020-21, according to the GDP statistics released by the National Statistical Office on May 31.MS Mani, senior director at consultancy firm Deloitte India, said: “Collections of 1 lakh crore pertaining to the transactions of April 21 could possibly indicate that the level of disruptions in the primary sales due to the lockdown was much lower than what was anticipated.”Most analysts have said the same while revising their growth forecasts for the year only marginally. A Bloomberg poll of 11 economists last week came up with a median growth estimate of 10% in the year, only marginally lower than the 10.5% the same economists projected before the second wave.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy and audit firm EY said, “Also, the dip in comparison to the collections in the previous months was expected as these GST collections are for the supplies made in April, when part of the country was in lockdown. It’s noteworthy that the ₹1.02 lakh crores GST collections for the month of May will further be increased as businesses having less than ₹5 crore turnover have until 1 week of July to file returns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-dips-still-over-1l-cr-despite-2nd-covid-wave-101622917525196.html
06-06-2021||India||India, China talks complete a year, issues not fully resolved||The Indian and Chinese armies began negotiations to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh exactly a year ago, but the two sides have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), people tracking the military talks said on Saturday.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020 to reduce tensions along the disputed border.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks, one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.“Disengagement is stuck at the other friction points. Talks have not made any headway in resolving the problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. Negotiations are on but there is no end in sight to the standoff. We will continue to engage the Chinese side to find a solution,” said a second official, asking not to be named.Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said his soldiers were on high alert as the PLA continued to base its troops and mechanised elements including tanks in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150 km to 200 km from the LAC.)Naravane said results should not be expected after every round of talks, citing the case of Pangong Tso, where disengagement took place after nine rounds.The corps commanders’ meetings have had mixed results as those talks were successful in negotiating the disengagement in the Pangong Tso area but there has been no further progress, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “It is important to understand that success in negotiations between military commanders has to be preceded by groundwork that is laid by political and diplomatic engagements. We saw this happening prior to the ninth round of military talks where both sides worked out the modalities for disengagement from Pangong Tso. A similar combined effort is required,” Hooda said.He added that the military commanders by themselves cannot take any decisions unless the principles of an agreement have been worked out at the political or diplomatic level.The Indian Army’s focus is on resolving outstanding problems with the PLA at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, but the disengagement process has hit a wall as a result of the PLA’s reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops and restore the status quo ante of April 2020, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff.“Disengagement is just the first phase of a broader, more comprehensive plan of establishing the status quo ante of April 2020. It will be followed by de-escalation and finally de-induction of forces. We continue to remain vigilant,” Naravane said on May 28.The two armies held the first round of military talks on June 6, 2020. However, the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15, 2020 created severe complications and dashed hopes of any significant breakthrough. The brutal clash that left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead created a huge trust deficit between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-talks-complete-a-year-issues-not-fully-resolved-101622917405138.html
06-06-2021||India||Verified badges from Bhagwat, V-P Twitter accounts removed, later restored||New Delhi: Twitter removed the blue verified badge from the accounts of top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders, including its chief Mohan Bhagwat, and vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu only to restore it later on Saturday evoking a sharp reaction from Sangh and BJP leaders.RSS’s joint general secretaries Krishna Gopal and Arun Kumar, former general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, , Suresh Soni (former joint general secretary), and Sampark Pramukh Aniruddha Deshpande were among other leaders whose Twitter accounts temporarily lost their verification badges. It was not immediately clear why the badges of the RSS leaders that certify that an account of public interest is authentic were removed.Twitter restored Naidu’s badge after an uproar and the company said it was removed as his account was inactive. “Account [of Naidu] inactive since July 2020. As per our verification policy, Twitter may remove the blue verified badge and verified status if the account becomes inactive. The badge has been restored,” a Twitter spokesperson said. Naidu’s account with 1.3 million followers was created in August 2013. He last tweeted on July 23, 2020. Several social media users pointed out several inactive accounts continue to have the blue tick. The official handle of the vice president of India continued to have the badge.An RSS functionary said the badges of the organisation’s leaders were removed sometime in March, but no explanation was offered. “If they claim it was done because the accounts were inactive, then they should have informed us. There has been no communication from their side,” said the functionary, who did not want to be named.RSS leaders do not use their Twitter handles, but they have handles that have been verified so as to avoid fake accounts. The Sangh’s handle continues to have the badge. Twitter has been at loggerheads with the government since February when the company was asked to block content related to criticism of farm laws and about the protests they triggered. New rules were introduced later that month to make social media companies accountable for requests for the removal of posts. They also mandate them to take measures such as appointments of grievance officers to deal with complaints. Twitter last week urged the government to give it three more months to comply with the rules. On Saturday, the government wrote to Twitter, giving it a last chance to comply. Facebook-owned WhatsApp last week moved court against the rules saying the government was exceeding its legal powers. It maintained the rules will force it to break its end-to-end message encryption.Twitter also last week said it was worried about the safety of its staff in India.
