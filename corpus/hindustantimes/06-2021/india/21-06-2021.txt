Replying to a question during a press conference after inducting former Inspector General of Punjab Police, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, into the party at Circuit House, Kejriwal said, “I totally agree with your curiosity and keenness on this issue… because Punjab is annoyed with the current leadership and looking for a new kind of leadership. In wake of this, discussions within the party are underway to choose the CM face. You will be informed when time will come, and you will be proud of the party choice”. He added, “However, it is certain that the AAP CM face for Punjab will be from Sikh community. Because we feel that Punjab is the only state across the world, which gets Sikh CM. I feel that this is a right of the Sikh community, and this right should be upheld.” However, former minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia said it was condemnable that Kejriwal was talking about giving a “Sikh face” in Punjab as its chief ministerial candidate but had not picked even a single Sikh face in Delhi despite forming the government thrice.Kejriwal also said he had lot of respect for dissident Congress bigwig Navjot Singh Sidhu. When asked if there was any possibility of Sidhu joining the AAP and if there had been any talks with the Congress leader, who has opened front against Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh with harsh attacks, Kejriwal said, “Sidhu Sahib is a senior Congress leader. I respect him very much. We should not indulge in loose talks about this kind of leader.” Speaking about his meeting with Sidhu, the Delhi CM said, “Whenever anything happens, you will be informed first.” Flanked by AAP’s Punjab unit president and MP Bhagwant Mann, state affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha, leader of the opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema and party MLAs from the state, Kejriwal welcomed the former IPS officer into the party fold. The former senior officer opted for voluntary retirement on April 11, two days after the report prepared by the special investigation team (SIT) led by him in the Kotkapura firing incident, in which Sikh protesters were injured in 2015, was quashed by the Punjab and Haryana high court. The court directed the state government to reconstitute a new SIT without Kunwar Vijay Pratap. “He has remained a dedicated cop of the common people, who struggled to get justice for the people of Punjab in the Bargari sacrilege case,” Kejriwal said, adding, “The entire Punjab is watching how the masterminds of the Bargari sacrilege and the Kotkapura firing case were roaming freely. When he was unable to do anything while being there in the system, he resigned. It is not an easy task.” The AAP national convener also announced that the culprits of the Bargari sacrilege case would be put behind bars if his party came to the power in the state. He added that the people of Punjab were fed up with the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal and wanted change. “The people of Punjab gave chances to all three parties, but nothing changed…,” he said while appealing to the people to give one chance to his party to usher in a change in the state. “If Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji could not get justice on the land of Punjab then what would be the condition of the common man,” said Kunwar Vijay Pratap, thanking the party leadership for inducting him into the party. Reacting on the former IPS officer’s induction into the AAP, Majithia said Kunwar Vijay Pratap’s entry into the AAP proved Kejriwal was “an integral part of the conspiracy” to malign the SAD in the cases of sacrilege. He said it was condemnable that a former “tainted” cop, who had “misused his position to conduct a biased and politically motivated probe” into the Kotkapura firing incident, was rewarded by AAP. “Custodial interrogation of the former police officer is also needed to expose the AAP-Congress conspiracy,” he added.Bhagwant Mann said, “People had hoped after Kunwar Vijay Pratap’s appointment as the head of SIT probing the Bargari sacrilege case, that the culprits would definitely be punished. But the system is corrupt, and the ruling party is working in collusion to save the real culprits.” Later in the day, Kejriwal also visited Golden Temple and Durgiana Temple. He was shown black flags by SAD workers when he was on the way from Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport to Circuit House. Kunwar Vijay Partap has served as the Amritsar city senior superintendent of police and was also the deputy inspector general (DIG), border range. He came to limelight as the investigator in the cases of Kotakapura firing incident and Behbal Kalan Police firing incident in 2015 when two Sikh protesters were killed. The protesters were seeking justice in the Bargari sacrilege case, which has turned into one of the biggest political issues in Punjab at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2022-punjab-polls-kejriwal-says-aap-s-cm-face-will-be-a-sikh-101624299516747.html

21-06-2021||India||In his first address, Guv says TN will oppose ‘infringement on state rights’||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s customary address at the first session of the 16th legislative assembly established that the new DMK-led government’s ‘ultimate goal’ is ‘greater autonomy of states’, to create ‘true federalism at the union level through constitutional means’, and one that is guided by Dravidian dogma.“Strong states are needed to create a strong union,” the Governor said. “This government will staunchly stand in defence of the rights of the states and constitutionally oppose any infringement of such rights. At the same time, we will maintain a cordial relationship with the Union Government as partners in the process of nation-building, in line with our policy of extending our hand in friendship, even as we speak up for our rights.”Throughout his speech, the Governor addressed the Government of India as the ‘Union’ and never as the ‘Centre’ - a nomenclature that follows the Constitutional guidelines was consciously brought in by the DMK reflecting its position on federalism.Purohit also emphasised the state’s vision of social justice by continuing and protecting the 69% reservation (given that the Supreme Court recently struck down the Maratha quota) and exemption from NEET. Based on the recommendation of the recently appointed Justice AK Rajan committee to study the adverse impact of NEET on socially and educationally backward students, the state would introduce legislation to ensure that the students of Tamil Nadu are not adversely affected and obtain the President’s consent.Purohit said that the Government is guided by the Dravidian movement which identifies social justice, gender equality, economic equity, opportunity-for-all through reservations, and progress through education and social reforms. He added that there cannot be social justice when there is high economic inequity and to correct that, the new government is focused on inclusive growth. “These values will drive every action, every legislation, every scheme, and every initiative of this Government,” he said.Chief minister MK Stalin-led government plans to revitalise the Lok Ayukta to deal with complaints against public authorities including elected representatives and government officials. “Providing clean administration is the highest priority,” Purohit said, looking up at the assembly members and urging them to clap. “Why are you all silent? Clean governance is the highest priority of the government,” he said before continuing his speech that the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) will expedite pending complaints.A Right to Services Act will be introduced to streamline the delivery of various public services by government agencies. Keeping in line with transparency and in the case of temples, the government will protect assets, lands and properties. A state-level advisory committee for all major Hindu temples will be constituted to enhance facilities for devotees, improve the maintenance of temples and advise on related issues.For Chennai, preparations for the third master plan for the city will be completed before the due date of 2026. During Stalin’s mayoral term of the Chennai corporation, he rolled out several schemes under ‘Singara Chennai’ meaning beautiful Chennai. “Singara Chennai 2.0 programme will be launched to provide modern world-class infrastructure and services in Greater Chennai Corporation,” Purohit said.Opposition leaders dubbed the Governor’s address as disappointing. “The DMK made 505 poll promises but none of the important promises was mentioned by the Governor in his address,” leader of opposition and former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami told reporters.“They haven’t given a clear plan for NEET to be exempted from Tamil Nadu,” said PMK founder S Ramadoss. The assembly will be on until June 24th and Stalin is expected to give his responses on that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-his-first-address-guv-says-tn-will-oppose-infringement-on-state-rights-101624297717233.html

Within 5 minutes, a nurse came and gave the vaccine again before I could tell her that I have been vaccinated,” said Sahu from his village over phone.“I was too shocked. The officials there told me that nothing would happen and if anything happens then I should go to the nearby health centre,” he said. He was given an oral rehydration solution to drink. Rajendra Behera, the official observer at the vaccination centre, said the gaffe happened as Sahu was present in the vaccination area even after receiving the shot instead of shifting to the observation room. It was by mistake that he was given the second dose, he said.Mayurbhanj chief district medical officer Rupabhanu Mishra, however, rebutted Sahu. “This can’t happen... In any case, we have ordered a probe,” he said.On Monday, the district administration sent a team to Sahu’s home to check if he had any adverse reaction to the vaccine. “Luckily, I have had no adverse reaction so far. But anything could have happened. Those vaccinating should have been more cautious,” he said.Last week, a 63-year-old woman in Bihar was administered two doses of two different Covid vaccines the same day. Sunila Devi from Patna was told to wait for some time after she got her shot at a vaccination centre in Punpun block town. She, however, assumed that everyone should take vaccines at both the counters and stood in another queue for vaccines. Soon, she was administered the Covishield vaccine by the health workers. The woman is said to be fine but is under observation.In April, Kamlesh Kumari in her 50s in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur Dehat district was given two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine at a government centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-probe-after-51-yr-old-says-he-was-given-vaccine-twice-101624297057189.html
21-06-2021||India||‘Dream team’ of international economists to advise Stalin for inclusive growth of TN||To advise chief minister M K Stalin, the Tamil Nadu government has constituted what is being dubbed as a ‘dream team’ with leading global economic experts comprising Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, former chief economic advisor to the Indian government Arvind Subramanian, development economist Jean Dreze and former union finance secretary S Narayan, as announced by Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday.The five-member team was brought together by state finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, who, before his political stint, was an investment banker in the US and Singapore.“The chief minister was keen that we must get the best minds in the world to help us. Our priority is that growth should be inclusive,” said Rajan.“Both Professor Rajan and Dr Subramanian are Tamilians. Professor Duflo has been working with Tamil Nadu through J-PAL,” he said, explaining their international experience and connections with the state. Duflo and her spouse Abhijit Banerjee, with whom she shares the Nobel prize, are co-founders of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) that researches on policies for poverty alleviation that are informed by scientific evidence. Narayan is also the author of ‘The Dravidian Years- Politics and Welfare in Tamil Nadu.’Governor Banwarilal Purohit made this announcement during his address at the first 16th legislative assembly meeting of the state on Monday. Named as the “Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister’, the team will help chart out a rapid and inclusive economic growth for Tamil Nadu.“Based on the recommendations of this Council, the government will revitalize the state’s economy and ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach all segments of society,” the Governor said.“In recent years, we have seen a slowdown in Tamil Nadu’s economic growth rate. This government will make all-out efforts to reverse this trend and usher in a period of rapid economic growth taking full advantage of the available limited window of the demographic dividend,” he added.The experts have worked in the areas such as poverty alleviation, development economics, gender inequity.Later in the day, a government order was issued that the additional chief secretary of the finance department, S Krishnan, will act as the convener of the council. The order said that the fiscal situation is precarious with fiscal deficits and a large overhang of debt but there is the public expectation for the government to deliver faster on economic growth, social justice and equity.“In this context, the government requires expert advice from the best economists available globally, who are familiar with Tamil Nadu, its economy, society and polity, as also the trends in the Indian and global economy,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dream-team-of-international-economists-to-advise-stalin-for-inclusive-growth-of-tn-101624296097216.html
21-06-2021||India||Soon, drones could be used to transport vaccines to remote areas||Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, could soon be used to transport Covid-19 vaccines to challenging remote places in the quickest possible time, said people privy to the developments.“The study on drones transporting the vaccines, conducted in association with the ICMR, has been done. The ICMR has been informed about the parameters finalised for this. Transportation of vaccines could begin if these parameters are followed,” said an IIT-K spokesperson.The IIT-K and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), which were asked to explore the feasibility of the option, have reportedly given a go-ahead to the plan after a detailed study, said the people cited above.As the next step, the ICMR will enter into an agreement with the drone operating companies, the tendering process for which has already begun, they said. The idea was first mooted by the ICMR.However, when it went to the ministry for civil aviation for approval, it was told to first conduct a feasibility study in association with the IIT-K.“Making the vaccines available to people living in such inhospitable parts is a challenge and the ministry wanted the ICMR and the IIT-K to conduct a joint study on how far sending the vaccine through drones was safe?” said people at The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) on condition of anonymity.Aerospace engineering Professor AK Ghosh and his team studied the plan and conducted many experiments before concluding that the plan could work.In the field trials, Prof Ghosh and his team analysed the impact of take-off, airborne and landing tie vibration on the vaccine.They also studied if vaccines will be affected as the drones were battery-operated and could impact the temperature.Based on these findings, the team set certain parameters, which, if followed, could make the transportation of vaccines to remote places possible.The drone to be used in vaccine transportation essentially should have a minimum flying range of 35 km and should be able to carry a load of four kilos.Also, the drone should be able to fly 100 meters above and take off vertically with that much load. The drones own weight should be in accordance with the standards set by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-drones-could-be-used-to-transport-vaccines-to-remote-areas-101624293097132.html
21-06-2021||India||Is India's second Covid-19 wave over? Not completely, say experts||Witnessing the decline of the deadly second wave of Covid-19, India has seen multiple green flags indicating the end of the crisis. The green flags include a sharp decline in cases with India reporting only 1/7th of the cases it reported during the peak last month, arrest in positivity rate and deaths, and lower active cases.India on Monday saw 53,256 fresh cases of Covid-19, the lowest in 88 days. For perspective, India had seen the highest count of daily infections on May 6 when it reported 414,188 Covid-19 cases in just 24 hours. In line with World Health Organisation's norms for reopening a region, the Covid-19 positivity rate should be less than 5% for 14 days in a row. India on Monday achieved that milestone as well.So does that mean India has turned a corner and can proceed with reopening? The experts are still not convinced enough to declare the end of the second wave in the country.While it is safe to say that the worst is over, according to the experts, the holistic picture should not discount the emerging new variants which have sparked fears globally and started third waves in countries like the UK. Additionally, some parts of India are still seeing a positivity rate over and above 5%.Pointing out that India's second wave fell as sharply as it rose, as predicted by many experts, Naga Suresh Veerapu from Shiv Nadar University warned of new variants like Delta which is responsible for driving India's second wave.“With the current positivity rate at less than 5 per cent, India’s Covid-19 second wave is on the wane as quickly as it rushed to its peak, but the end of it may yet be far away as more transmissible new variants such as Delta plus variant are emerging,” Veerapu, associate professor at the School of Natural Sciences (SoNS), Shiv Nadar University told PTI.Positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and over time it provides an idea of whether a region’s testing strategy is adequate to contain the virus.Cautioning with the unpredictable pattern of virus, he said, “The Delta variant that emerged in March spread across the different parts of India, then cases surged to the peak yielding a second wave. The second wave conjoined with the first when the latter was at 1 per cent positivity rate."The central government on Saturday joined experts and courts in warning states and Union territories not to become “complacent” about a decline in Covid-19 infections, urging them to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed and asking them to monitor signs of a potential spike in cases as they lift lockdown restrictions.In a letter to states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that while the opening up of businesses is “essential” for revival of economic activity, the local administrations must ensure that the whole “process is carefully calibrated”.India should not sideline the absolute number of cases which is still above 50,000 in the country, said public policy expert Chandrakant Lahariya, adding that several parts of the country still have a positivity rate over 5%. This reduces India's chances of opening up completely.“Therefore, before saying that the second wave is over, I would like to wait for the TPR to come down below 5 per cent everywhere and sustain for two weeks or longer,” he told PTI.India’s tally of Covid-19 cases is 2,99,35,221 (2.99 crore/29.9 million) while active cases have reduced to 7,02,887, according to the data by health ministry.The second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare system of the country, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with the surge in cases and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply. Infections have now slowed down and restrictions have been relaxed in most states.Agreeing that the drop in India’s cases has been quite dramatic, Menon noted, “From all we know, this is a genuine decline, both in urban and rural India.”For a country the size of India, enough attention needs to be paid at the local level,” Lahariya said.He explained that Covid-19 is not just any other respiratory illness and decision-making parameters cannot be simple.“We know that there are new variants which are more transmissible. We know that human behaviour determines the spread of this virus. Therefore, it is not very relevant if we declare whether the second wave is over or not,” the public policy expert explained.“Key is, are we prepared to respond to the rise in cases? That's where the attention has to be,” Lahariya told PTI.India’s second and worst wave so far of infections began in March and started to ease sometime in May. At its peak, India added an average of 3,91,819 daily cases for the week ending May 9.It also surpassed the US — the worst-hit nation in cumulative cases — in recording the most number of infections in a single day (305,062) when it recorded 315,909 cases on April 21. In fact, India recorded more than USA's highest single day tally every day from April 21 to May 15. The world’s worst outbreak at the time brought the national capital to its knees, as hospitals ran out of medical oxygen and life-saving drugs and bodies piled up in crematoria. The health care infrastructure in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Odisha, too, were stretched thin in those months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-india-s-second-covid-19-wave-over-not-completely-say-experts-101624280631210.html

21-06-2021||India||‘Optional exams in Aug, Sep only for main subjects’: CBSE tells SC||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will have a Committee to resolve grievances of students upset over the marks awarded under the tabulation scheme for Class 12 students and the option to write exams for interested candidates will tentatively be held within a month from August 15 depending on the conditions being conducive for holding an offline examination, as stated by the Board in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on Sunday.The affidavit, filed through advocate Rupesh Kumar, said, “Regarding the date before which the optional examination for the candidates who are not satisfied with their assessment with the policy, the examinations for such candidates shall be conducted any time between August 15 to September 15, subject to conducive situation.” Even the Private/ Patrachar/2nd chance compartment candidates would have to appear in the offline exams to be conducted during the same period, the Board informed.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari will take up the affidavit on Tuesday as some petitions that have challenged the tabulation scheme of CBSE and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) could not be listed on Monday.Last week, when the CBSE, CIISCE submitted their tabulation schemes to Court, it was found wanting on two fronts – lack of dispute resolution mechanism and clear dates for results and holding of optional exams.The CISCE informed the Supreme Court that it wishes to hold the optional exams before September 1 subject to conducive conditions. On the issue of settlement of grievances, the CISCE informed the Court about an inbuilt provision in its scheme allowing candidates to submit complaints to their respective schools that would then be forwarded to CISCE within a week.The CBSE also stated in its affidavit that all disputes regarding the computation of results will be referred to a committee formed by the Board. This has been made part of the tabulation scheme as well. In addition, the CBSE scheme provides that any candidate who wishes to appear in the optional offline examination will have the facility of registering online.As and when conditions are conducive, the Board will hold physical examination limited to the main subject papers. The marks obtained in this examination shall be treated as final.Last week, the CBSE came out with its scheme for tabulating marks of Class 12 students on a 30:30:40 formula that took the best of three subject marks of Class X boards (30 per cent), followed by annual results of Class 11 (30 per cent), and pre-boards or internal assessment conducted during Class 12 (40 per cent). The scheme was to apply to nearly 14.5 lakh students across the country.The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination’s (CISCE) scheme took into account the best performance of the student in Class 11 and 12 based on examinations conducted and practical/projects with less emphasis on Class 10 board results.An application moved by UP Parents Association was in favour of holding the examination and criticized the schemes formulated by the boards. In the case of CISCE, the bench was told that the marks to be obtained from schools have been deposited with CISCE but with regard to CBSE, there was scope for manipulation.As per CBSE scheme, a result committee of every school will tabulate marks based on the tabulation scheme and submit results to CBSE. The committee will comprise the principal, two senior-most faculty teaching Class 12 and two senior-most teachers from neighbouring schools.The CBSE scheme even provided for rationalization standards by which the results submitted by a school have to be moderated in terms of the school’s best performance in the past three years. Any student securing more than the highest marks attained by students of the same school will be awarded two marks more than the best performing score of the school in the past three years.The Court also listed for Tuesday an application filed by three private/compartment candidates who have demanded an assessment scheme similar to regular students. The CBSE has been firm that examinations for such candidates shall be conducted in such a manner so that they fall within the assessment policy for the academic year 2019-2020 evolved by it last year.The candidates, hailing from Odisha, Tripura and Delhi claimed to have the support of 1149 Class 10 and 12 compartment/private candidates across the country.Another petition challenging Class 12 state board examinations will also be heard by the same bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari.Last week, a petition filed by a group of parents claimed that 18 states had cancelled exams except for Assam, Karnataka, Tripura and Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh informed the Court that it will conduct the state board examinations for Class 12 while the remaining three states conveyed their decision to cancel the examinations. Even the Kerala government has been asked to respond to its decision to hold offline examinations for Class 11, considered crucial for admission to undergraduate courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/optional-exams-in-aug-sep-only-for-main-subjects-cbse-tells-sc-101624284696865.html

As a result, the state government was asked to relieve the IAS officer with immediate effect and he was directed to report to North Block by May 31.West Bengal chief minister, however, requested the Prime Minister to withdraw the order to recall Bandyopadhyay. Later, she informed that the bureaucrat has retired from the service and will not join in Delhi and has been appointed as her chief advisor.Bandyopadhyay decided to retire on May 31 rather than avail the three-month extension granted to him by the state government.The entire controversy erupted after the chief minister arrived 30 minutes late for the meeting held by the Prime Minister at Kalaikunda in Paschim Medinipur district to take stock of the post-cyclonic situation. After arriving late for the meeting, the chief minister and the then chief secretary left for the 'pre-scheduled' meeting at Digha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-centre-initiates-disciplinary-proceedings-against-alapan-bandyopadhyay-101624280825558.html

The Lakha red granite of the state will be used in the construction of the iconic Central Vista project. The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the vice president, as well as new office buildings to accommodate ministry offices. Named after Lakha village, the red granite is found on the border of Jaisalmer and Barmer districts will be utilized in the construction of flooring, walkways, and pillars in the Central Vista . The sourcing has been going on for the past two months and thus far 55,000 cubic meters of stone have been sold. Lakha red granite is coveted for its unique red shade. It has a smooth texture and waves of multi-coloured microparticles on the red make this stone very eye-catching. Bhagwan Singh Bhati, an engineer with the state’s mining department in Jaisalmer said that Lakha red granite is famous for its colour. It is also exported to many other countries, he added. A major supplier of this stone, Kamal Singh Kohra, said that so far he has supplied around 600 trucks of stone which will be used in the construction of one lakh feet area. “Before transporting, the raw stone is processed here,” he said.

However, all the traditional religious rituals shall be performed at the Holy Cave Shrine as per past practice,” he posted on his Twitter handle.“It’s important to save people’s lives. So, it is not advisable to hold and conduct this year’s pilgrimage in the larger public interest,” he added.The 56-day yatra to the 3,880-metre-high cave shrine of Lord Shiva in the upper reaches of South Kashmir Himalayas, was scheduled to start from the twin routes of Pahalgam and Baltal on June 28 and culminate on August 22.Last week, Sinha attended a meeting called by Union home minister Amit Shah to take stock of the security situation in J&K, besides development initiatives.

21-06-2021||India||Pakistan PM Imran Khan again seeks US intervention on Kashmir||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has again sought the intervention of the US to settle the Kashmir issue with India, a move that is unlikely to go down well with New Delhi, which has consistently spurned mediation by any third party. Khan made the call for the US administration to help resolve the dragging Kashmir issue during an interview with the news programme Axios on HBO. In the past, Khan found a ready taker for his calls for US intervention on Kashmir in former president Donald Trump, but such efforts were always shot down by India. The Pakistani premier acknowledged he hasn’t spoken to US President Joe Biden since the latter assumed office in January and said he would raise the issue of Kashmir if there was a meeting between the two leaders. Asked what he would discuss during a meeting with Biden, Khan replied: “The US has a big responsibility, the most powerful nation in the world – almost 1.4 billion people living in the subcontinent, we are held hostage [by] one dispute in Kashmir. Also Read | Pakistan exposed as documentary tracks journey of Paris attacker linked to 26/11“A disputed territory, according to the UN Security Council resolutions. There should have been a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir to decide about their own future. That has never taken place, it’s festering. If the Americans have the resolve, the will, this can be sorted out.” There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s remarks. In the past, India has ruled out intervention or mediation on the Kashmir issue by any third party. In response to recent statements from Islamabad opposing any possible changes in Jammu and Kashmir, New Delhi has maintained that the region is an integral part of India and such moves amounted to interference in the country’s internal matters. Khan had raised the Kashmir issue at least twice with Trump in 2019 and 2020 and the former president had offered to help India and Pakistan settle the issue. Despite pushback from New Delhi, Trump had persisted with similar offers. During the interview, Khan contended that India and Pakistan would no longer need their nuclear arsenals if the Kashmir issue was settled. Asked if his goal for the two countries was nuclear disarmament, Khan replied: “I am completely against nuclear arms, I always have been. We’ve had three wars against India and ever since we’ve had [a] nuclear deterrent, we have had no war between the two countries. “We have border skirmishes but we’ve never faced war. The moment there is a settlement on Kashmir, I believe the two neighbours will live as civilised people. We will not need to have these nuclear deterrents.” Khan ducked another question on assessments by experts that Pakistan has the world’s fastest growing nuclear arsenal and indicated his country’s atomic weapons were needed to achieve some sort of parity with India. “I don’t know where they [experts] have come up with this. Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is simply as a deterrent, to protect ourselves,” he said. “I’m not sure whether we’re growing it or not because as far as I know...the only one purpose [of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons] – it’s not an offensive thing. Any country which has a neighbour seven times the size as Pakistan has, would be worried,” he added. Khan also made the surprising admission that he hasn’t spoken to the US president since Biden assumed office in January. Asked why such a conversation hadn’t happened, he said: “Whenever he has time, he can speak to me but at the moment clearly he has other priorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-again-seeks-us-intervention-on-kashmir-101624274376335.html

Earlier on March 29, terrorists killed two councillors and a policeman in an attack on the office of Sopore Municipal Council.Police then identified the killings as a Lashkar-e-Taiba operation, following which Kashmir police chief Vijay Kumar met senior army and CRPF officers in Sopore and named Mudasir Pandit as one of the two local terrorists involved in the June 12 attack on policemen.Pictures of these militants were circulated in Sopore and adjacent villages and Kumar said it helped the forces track them down. “The trio were hiding in the house of a man, whose son was also a terrorist,” IGP Kashmir said.One army soldier was also injured in the encounter, which ended on Monday morning with the recovery of bodies of all the terrorists apart from two AK 47 rifles, an AK 56 rifle9 mm pistol, 77 AK ammunition rounds, 21 pistol ammunition, nine AK magazines, three pistol magazines, one hand grenade, three ammunition pouches and two matrix sheets from their possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-among-3-top-lashkar-commanders-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-encounter-101624273836394.html

The relationship between the two allies has been a bit strained in the past few days after the Congress became vocal about wanting to fight the upcoming civic polls in Maharashtra by itself and not as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi or MVA alliance that’s ruling Maharashtra.Also Read | After Congress talks of going solo, Sena-NCP say they may contest Assembly polls as alliesLast week, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that his party would fight all the forthcoming elections alone.“We already have announced that we will go solo in all forthcoming local body elections, likely to be held from November, and thereafter the Assembly polls too. We do not want to keep our allies in the dark and ditch them ahead of the polls. We are preparing to go solo and they too are free to do so. The Congress will be the single-largest party in 2024 Assembly polls,” he said. There’s no word yet on what Pawar discussed with Kishor, whose firm I-Pac worked with the Shiv Sena in the run-up to the 2019 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-chief-pawar-tmc-s-yashwant-sinha-to-host-rashtra-manch-meet-in-delhi-101624271736380.html
21-06-2021||India||UP ATS arrests two Delhi men for mass conversion racket||Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) of UP Police on Monday claimed to have busted a nationwide mass conversion racket with the arrest of two men. The men, identified as Umar Gautam and Jahangir Alam, are both residents of Jamia Nagar in New Delhi. They also allegedly received funding from international organisations, and targeted specially abled children and other vulnerable groups in the society for conversion to Islam. They were involved in conversion of over 1,000 people in the past 18 months, police said.ATS has lodged a First Information Report (FIR) in Lucknow against the duo, some unidentified persons and Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) under section 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 120 B(criminal conspiracy) 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) 153 B(imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) 295(injuring or defiling place of worship) 511(attempt to commit offences) of IPC along with relevant sections of the state’s new anti-conversion law, Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act. In a press conference, additional director general (Law & Order) of UP, Prashant Kumar said in Lucknow, “The duo was involved in an illegal, large scale conversion of people of different faiths to Islam in UP and other parts of the country. Our teams are working to identify other members of the group and their supporters.”Jahangir Alam, a mufti (Islamic preacher), is linked with IDC in Jamia Nagar. Alam allegedly used the centre for mass conversions, and organised an annual convocation for the newly converted there. Umar Gautam allegedly looked for people they could convince to convert, said the police officials. Gautam himself converted to Islam a few years ago.The officials have also recovered a register from the accused that contains details of over a 1,000 people who were converted by the duo in the past 18 months.“They targeted vulnerable groups in the society and lured them with the promise of jobs and other avenues to convert them. They also targeted specially abled children living in various institutions and converted them forcefully without their parents’ consent,” said UP ATS chief GK Goswami. “The duo also converted girls of poor households and married them off to Muslim men,” he added. The officials also alleged that the men received funding from various international organisations, including Pakistani spy agency ISI, for their activities. “We are looking into the financial aspects of the group to get more details about the funding which will be presented before the court,” said Prashant Kumar. The authorities came to know about the group in June following the arrest of two Muslim men who tried to enter a temple complex in Dasna area of Ghaziabad district pretending to be Hindus. “Their interrogation led us to Umar Gautam and the mufti. They were called for questioning on several occasions and were arrested after we had gathered enough evidence against them,” said ADG Prashant Kumar. “We are trying to ascertain the motive behind these activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upatsarrests-two-delhi-men-for-mass-conversion-racket-101624270176176.html

21-06-2021||India||As Centre begins free vaccination for all against Covid, Nadda has a question for Oppn||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda said on Monday that the issue of Covid-19 vaccine was heavily politicised by the opposition parties, adding the ongoing vaccination drive in India is the fastest and the largest globally.“Firstly, it was said that there will be hesitancy in taking the Covid-19 vaccine and the medical trials haven’t been completed. Some politicians even said people should be treated as guinea pigs or rats. What kind of language is this?” Nadda said while speaking to reporters after paying a visit to the vaccination centre in Delhi’s Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.His reference to the phrase ‘guinea pigs’ can be seen as an indirect attack at senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who said in December last year that India should not be made an experiment lab and the citizens should not be made guinea pigs for vaccine trials.Also Read| Free vaccination for all from today as new policy rolls outNadda pointed out an attempt was made to malign the vaccination drive but despite this, 1.3 billion citizens of the country came forward to get inoculated against the viral disease on the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“I want to ask a question to those politicians who called themselves guinea pigs. Today, they are getting themselves vaccinated. So what happened to them? These people left no stone unturned in politicising such a holy initiative,” the BJP president told reporters.Several leaders of opposition parties including the likes of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi have heavily criticised the Centre over its vaccination policy.Akhilesh Yadav, who said in January that he won’t vaccinate himself, took a U-Turn and announced on June 8 that he will take a jab against the viral disease. “Seeing the public outrage, the government instead of politicising the corona vaccine announced that it would give the vaccines doses. We were against the BJP’s vaccine but welcome the vaccine of the Government of India. I will also get vaccinated. I appeal to those who could not get vaccinated for the lack of vaccines to do so,” Yadav tweeted.Also Read| On Covid-19 vaccine, Ravi Shankar Prasad's appeal to Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi, who has been the strongest critic of the Centre’s Covid-19 response, targeted the Centre on June 16 over its decision to extend the gap between two doses of Covishield from 12 to 16 weeks.

21-06-2021||India||Pakistan's terror net gets exposed again as documentary traces journey of Paris attacker linked to 26/11||A new documentary has shed light on the involvement of Paris attack conspirator Muhammad Ghani Usman, a Pakistan national and Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist, in the planning and execution of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Usman is in a French jail after being arrested in connection with the 2015 attack on the French capital.The documentary has been aired by German broadcaster DW. It aims to find out financing, planning and commissioning of terror attacks in Europe. The makers of the film follow the leads which reveal the terrorists' connection to Pakistan intelligence service ISI."This man was a key member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. It is believed that he was a part of the operations planning for the attacks in Mumbai in 2008. Yet, nothing was done," the film quotes London-based security analyst Sajjan Gohel as saying.Watch the documentary here:Usman was questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which was probing the Mumbai attacks cases, in 2019. According to NIA, Usman was in touch with David Coleman Headley, the Pakistan-origin US terrorist who plotted the 2008 Mumbai terror strike.The film then talks about the major conspiracies being hatched by indoctrinated terrorists, and reveals the name of Sajid Mir, a shadowy figure. "Suspects in the US confirm the existence of Sajid Mir and his role in recruiting and indoctrinating westerners with an aim of sending them back to Europe or the US to carry out attacks in the name of LeT," the documentary quoted Jean-Louis Bruguiere, a former French investigative judge, anti-terrorism.Hindustan Times reported last year about the whereabouts of Sajid Mir, who was the handler of Headley. The terrorist carries $5 million on his head.India has blamed LeT, which is allegedly linked to Al Qaeda, for the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. The documentary makers also claimed to have found evidence that showed that the ISI increased its cooperation with the terror organisations, especially Lashkar-e-Taiba."The documentary shows that Pakistan continues to be the terror factory of the world. This is quite evident when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan calls the 9/11 Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a martyr and foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, in an interview to Tolo News, gives it a pass. Pakistani political leadership continues to deny the presence of Taliban leadership, including Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and Sirajuddin Haqqani in the country. What makes it worse is that Sajid Mir is still living in Rawalpindi and David Coleman Headley was a relation of former Pakistan prime minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani. Till date, the American intelligence has not shared the financial transactions of Headley with India. With the American forces leaving Afghanistan next month, the terror factory in Pakistan will be running full steam with impact on the entire world," said Shishir Gupta, the author of best selling book 'Indian Mujahideen: the enemy within' and an expert on terrorism.French investigators suspect that Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks and the suicide bombings in Brussels, sent Usman and Haddadi to Europe to carry out attacks.Usman, the 34-year-old bomb-maker, was arrested in October 2015 along with his Algerian aide and suspected Islamic State fighter Adel Haddadi soon after they arrived on the Greek island of Leros along with 200 other refugees for carrying forged passport. Investigators believe there were two other men in the boat who later blew themselves up outside Stade de France stadium, one of a series of brazen assaults by around 10 people around the French capital.Haddadi and Usman were detained by Greek authorities for 25 days because they had fake Syrian passports. Once let go, they followed the main migrant trail and made it to Salzburg in western Austria at the end of November - after the Paris attacks. They applied for asylum at a refugee shelter in Salzburg.The two were arrested again in December 2015 when a fingerprint search linked them to the passports stolen by the Islamic State. An Austrian court later approved their transfer to France for trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-exposed-as-documentary-tracks-journey-of-paris-attacker-linked-to-2611-101624263886829.html

"It will be someone who the whole of Punjab feels proud of," said Kejriwal, addressing a press conference in Amritsar. It was at the same event that former Punjab police officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap also joined the party after a day of speculation over the same.आज PUNJAB के लिए खुशी का दिन है।Kunwar Vijay Pratap जी नेता नहीं है, ना ही इनके दादा-परदादा जी नेता थे। मैं और भगवंत मान भी नेता नहीं है।हमारी नेताओं की पार्टी नहीं है, हम राजनीति करने नहीं आए। हम देश और समाज की सेवा करने के लिए आए है - CM @ArvindKejriwal#PunjabDiUmeedAAP pic.twitter.com/L3EevmNZlWGOOD NEWS!Former IPS Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh (IG) joins AAP in the presence of Delhi CM Shri @ArvindKejriwal.#PunjabDiUmeedAAP pic.twitter.com/B5bSWNvc54Arvind Kejriwal had been hinting at making inroads in the state's politics for a while now. Yesterday, he tweeted, “Punjab wants change. The only hope is the Aam Aadmi Party. See you tomorrow at Amritsar,” without elaborating any further. Punjab AAP leaders also remained tightlipped about the induction of any leaders to the party at Amritsar.However, the party already seems to be hedging its bets in the state. The day saw the induction of Kunwar Vijay Pratap, an ex-inspector general (IG) who was part of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident in Punjab.Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh took premature retirement in April after the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed a report by the earlier Punjab Police SIT into the firing at people protesting in Kotkapura in 2015 over the alleged desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot district. Singh was part of the SIT which was probing the 2015 Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan policing firing incidents. The court had then directed the state government to set up a new SIT without Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had initially refused to accept the resignation of Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who otherwise was to retire in 2029. But when the former IG-rank officer remained firm on his stand, the CM accepted his premature retirement request. The former police officer had assured the government of full help and support even outside his service in connection with the probe led by him in two cases of police firing.Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Sanyukt) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and patron Ranjit Singh Brahmpura will reportedly visit the Golden Temple at the same time when Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal will pay obeisance at the shrine. This led to a buzz in political circles about a possible tie-up between the two parties ahead of the 2021 Punjab assembly elections.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-reveals-punjab-poll-plans-says-aap-s-cm-candidate-will-be-local-101624262105755.html

The 43-year-old leader from the influential tea tribe community, who represented Mariani for four consecutive times since 2006, joined the BJP at a function attended by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at Gerukamuch in Dhemaji district. “We welcome Shri Rupjyoti Kurmi to BJP family. A prominent leader from tea tribe community and a four-term MLA, he has always been working for uplift of poor and development of the region. BJP, and Assam shall immensely gain from his experience,” tweeted Sarma after the event. Also Read | Uttar Pradesh follows Assam to raise concerns regarding rise in populationOn Friday, Kurmi had cited the Congress high command’s failure to listen to second-rung leaders like him and promotion of a few select leaders in Assam as reasons for his resignation. He had also claimed that the Congress joining hands with Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) for the Assam assembly polls had cost the party many seats in upper Assam. This time, the Congress won 29 seats, three more than 2016, while AIUDF won 16. The 10 party ‘grand-alliance’ led by the Congress won 50 of the 126 seats in the state. On the other hand, BJP (60) and its allies Asom Gana Parishad (9) and United Peoples Party Liberal (6) bagged 75 seats. “Congress under leaders such as Rahul Gandhi is a sinking ship. In Assam, there’s a lobby of leaders in the party which is interested in promoting only its personal interests. The party overlooked indigenous people of the state and gives importance to immigrant Muslims from Bangladesh,” Kurmi said on Monday. “Kurmi’s exit from the party is a loss for the Congress in Assam. He was a capable leader and was close to me. It would have been better if he had raised his grievances on the party platform before quitting. We are aware of the complaints similar to Kurmi’s coming from within the party and are trying to address them,” Congress legislature party leader and Leader of Opposition on assembly Debabrata Saikia said after Kurmi’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-days-after-quitting-as-assam-congress-mla-leader-joins-bjp-101624263996113.html

21-06-2021||India||Odisha’s test positivity rate dips below 5 after over 2 months||For the first time in the last 80 days, Odisha’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) for Covid-19 came down below 5 on Monday, signifying the rapidly declining infection curve during the second wave even as the daily fatalities continued to hover above 40.On Monday, the state reported 3,021 new Covid cases from 61,000 samples tested in the last 24 hours with a test positivity rate of 4.96, the first time it went below 5 since April 2. Despite the declining TPR, which is the percentage of people testing positive out of the total people tested, the situation in at least six districts, including Bhadrak, Balasore and Khurda, continues to be matter of concern as the weekly TPR between June 14 and 20 was more than 10. In Bhadrak, the weekly TPR was 15.66 followed by 14.86 of Balasore and 14.44 of Jajpur. In western Odisha district of Nuapada, the TPR seems to be on the rise at 10.45.Also Read | UP to ease Covid-19 curbs from today: Check latest guidelines hereThe lockdown, which has been extended till June 30, is still in force in all the 30 districts even as it has been partially relaxed in 17 districts due to their low TPRs. Director of health Bijay Mohapatra said even after the lockdown is lifted, no one should take it easy. “Masks and social distancing have to be followed rigorously. We are prepared for the third wave. The state government is ramping up vaccination so that we can vaccinate 300,000 people daily. Besides, training is being imparted to doctors and healthcare workers in special paediatric care,” he said.June has been the most devastating for Odisha with 842 Covid deaths officially recorded so far, though by unofficial estimates, the number would be at least double. The state BJP has demanded a white paper on Covid deaths while a lawyer has filed a PIL in Orissa high court seeking a special audit of the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishas-test-positivity-rate-dips-below-5-after-over-2-months-101624259735959.html
21-06-2021||India||AICC in charge leaves Goa after 4-day visit, leadership issue yet unresolved||All India Congress Committee in charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao wrapped up his four day trip to the state on Sunday after holding extensive discussions with local leaders, primarily to settle the divisive issue of leadership ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections. He also attacked the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over handling of the coronavirus pandemic, state of economy, employment and environment. On the first day of Rao’s visit on Thursday, a scuffle broke out among supporters of different factions in the state unit, serving as a reminder of the need to resolve the pressing issue in time. Leaders aware of developments said Rao held several rounds of meetings with south Goa parliamentarian Francisco Sardinha, leader of opposition (LoP) Digambar Kamat and some other candidates aspiring to head the state unit. The need for new leadership arose after state Congress president Girish Chodankar resigned after the party’s poor showing at local level elections. While Chodankar-- who continues to head the party till the new leadership is chosen-- has the youth wing’s backing, not many MLAs support him despite having been at the helm of party affairs for more than four years now. Political observers say he has failed to unite the party and secure any notable electoral wins. Speaking to HT, a Congress leader said the party was eager to resolve the issue to ensure it has a “face” in the run up to the elections.“The party is facing challenge from both the BJP which seeks to retain the Bahujan Samaj vote and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is trying to eat into the Catholic vote. The party leadership has received feedback from several leaders and will accordingly make a decision based on the realities. There are several aspirants for the post,” another Congress leader, who didn’t wish to be named, said.“The party is also deliberating on possible alliances ahead of the polls,” he added. Political observer Cleofato Almeida Coutinho however said it will be difficult for the party to change the leadership six months ahead of elections. “The Congress finds itself in a difficult position and may yet decide against a change of leadership. Changing of leadership barely six months ahead of elections will upset the plans that are already in place and may not make for good optics,” he said. Keeping dissensions within Congress aside, Rao publicly attacked the incumbent BJP government and promised to scrap all the environmentally sensitive projects like the doubling of the railway tracks, construction of highway and laying power lines across the eco-sensitive Western Ghats after 2022 state polls, which he said will return the party to power.“Goa needs to be saved from this government and its horrible administration. That should be the main issue,” Rao claimed.“There is failure of government, the CM does not know what he is doing; his Covid administration was pathetic; people have suffered; the economy is suffering; youth don’t have jobs; environment is being harmed,” he added.Rao also announced that the party won’t take back MLAs who jumped ship to the BJP earlier and may look to return ahead of the polls. “We will not take such people (defectors) back. We have to end this virus. Goa can’t have this kind of politics going on forever. They are still elected members of the Congress,” Rao said at a press conference before his departure and added, “When we select our candidates this time, we will be doubly careful. We now know what the BJP is capable of.”Despite winning 17 seats in the 40-member Goa assembly in 2017, Congress was outmanoeuvred by the BJP, which only won 13 seats yet formed the government with the support of parties it had campaigned against. Later in September 2019, 10 Congress MLAs moved to the ruling party. The assembly speaker rejected a plea to disqualify them under the anti-defection laws in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aicc-in-charge-leaves-goa-after-4-day-visit-leadership-issue-yet-unresolved-101624258956370.html
21-06-2021||India||'Get ready with tractors': Rakesh Tikait rallies farmers against govt, says 'false cases' won't hold||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Monday rallied fellow farmers against the government, asking them to "get ready with tractors" as he issued an ultimatum to the central government over the contentious farm laws. "This government is not going to agree. It needs treatment. Get ready with your tractors, we will have to intensify the movement to save our lands," Tikait posted from his official handle on Twitter. A day ago, the farmer leader had said that the central government should get over its 'misconception' that the farmers would go back from their protests because they won't.Rakesh Tikait asked the farmers to unify under one cause and said, "Either the farmers and the public will remain or this government. The voices of farmers can't be subdued with false cases."सरकार मानने वाली नहीं है। इलाज तो करना पड़ेगा। ट्रैक्टरों के साथ अपनी तैयारी रखो। जमीन बचाने के लिए आंदोलन तेज करना होगा। #FarmersProtestया तो ये किसान और जनता रहेगी या ये सरकार रहेगी। अन्नदाता की आवाज झूठे मुकदमों से दबने वाली नहीं है..#खट्टर_सरकार_किसानों_पर_अत्याचारThere were isolated reports of disturbances across protest sites over the past few days, as the police blamed the farmers for dismay, while the protesters, in turn, said that their movement has been largely peaceful, yet the police used force to disperse them. Protesting farmers have also been opposing the public functions of the BJP-JJP leaders in Haryana over the farm laws.The Delhi Police alleged earlier this month that several protesters had assaulted two of its special branch officers at the Singhu border who were at the site for ground analysis. An FIR against unknown protestors had also been lodged at the Narela police station. Decrying the allegations, Rakesh Tikait had said that the intention of the police and government is to instigate farmers.The farmers' protest, which is still underway at the border sites of the national capital Delhi, has been consistent with its single-minded demand to repeal the three farm laws, even though more than 200 days have passed since the movement began. They have demanded that the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-ready-with-tractors-rakesh-tikait-rallies-farmers-against-govt-says-false-cases-won-t-hold-101624256109946.html

21-06-2021||India||Govt proposes to boost medical, wellness tourism post-Covid||The government has released a draft strategy to boost travel in the wake of Covid-19 by promoting the country as a medical and wellness tourism destination.To achieve the same, in its draft recommendations released past Friday, the ministry of tourism suggested a restructuring of the National Medical & Wellness Tourism Promotion Board, headed by the Union minister, and a more liberalised visa policy.“The board will be restructured to streamline its functioning and discharge its responsibilities as one-stop centre for medical value travel. The board will have an advisory committee, a technical committee and an executive committee to discharge its functions,” it said in its June 12 draft, seeking comments from the public till June 30. “In post Covid-19, demand for wellness travel will increase and it provides a great opportunity to India with its varied offerings,” the draft added. Also Read | Skywalk project proposed for LonavlaThe board was constituted in 2015 to “provide dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of medical and wellness tourism, including the Indian system of medicine covered by Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopath (AYUSH).”Thailand, Mexico, US, Singapore, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan are the top destinations in terms of number of patients for medical value travel. “The global medical value travel market size is in the range of USD 60-80 Billion and some 141 million people travel across the borders for medical tourism . India has been ranked 10th in Medical Tourism Index (MTI) for 2020-21 out of 46 destinations of the world by Medical Tourism Association,” the draft said. “Global Wellness Institute has estimated global wellness tourism market to be USD 639 Billion in 2017 with Secondary wellness travellers accounting for 89% of the trips and 86% of the expenditure. Domestic wellness travel contributing 82% of total trips and 65% of expenditure,” it says. Global Wellness Institute is a non-profit organisation with a mission to empower wellness worldwide by educating public and private sectors.As per estimates by Global Wellness Tourism Index, as mentioned in the report, India ranked 7th position in 2017 with 56 million trips in wellness tourism and total revenue of USD 16.3 Billion.The draft also identified the lack of government regulations for the sector and also the absence of a nodal body to spearhead Medical Value Travel as areas that need special attention. “Under Heal in India campaign, an integrated communication strategy to promote brand India will be prepared and executed in partnership with the industry. This will be promoted as a sub brand of Incredible India on all the digital platforms and global media campaign of the ministry,” it said.It has also proposed a more liberalised visa policy. “India has already introduced e-VISA and other measures to facilitate medical value travellers to visit India. India will further liberalise and put in place a holistic and transparent visa regime to make it more patient friendly,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-proposes-to-boost-medical-wellness-tourism-postcovid-101624253315507.html

The new provisions include a jail term extending up to three years for piracy, and a fine of not less than ₹3 lakh. There is also a move to grant film’s certificates in perpetuity, while the present system only allows for a film to be certified for 10 years. According to Prasanth Sugathan from the Software Freedom Law Centre, granting revisionary powers to the Government goes against the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Union of India v KM Shankarappa. “This effectively gives the Union Government supervisory power over the Board as well as the Tribunal,” he said. “This will result in a situation where a few persons protesting can virtually stall the exhibition of any film. This will be a case of heckler’s veto prevailing and, in a country, where there will always be sections who are easily offended by any work of art this will have dangerous repercussions for freedom of expression.”Film critic Gautam Chintamani said, “The age-appropriate certification proposed is one of the key elements of the new Cinematograph Act. It’s a much-needed change, which has been suggested many times in the past including by the Shyam Benegal-led committee. In addition the certification aspect, the compliance of the same needs to be ensured. The abolition of the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) by the Government of India last week — under the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance, 2021 — has evoked criticism from some quarters. As this was the penultimate forum for filmmakers to appeal against edits suggested by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), its absence means now the filmmaker would have to go to the high court. In my personal opinion, an updated Cinematograph Act where the definitions such as obscenity, anti-national, etc. are clearly defined so that there aren’t any misunderstandings around the interpretation of the nature and scope of these words and age-appropriate certification could lead to CBFC having a clearer and more contemporary understanding of certification.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-seeks-public-feedback-on-cinematograph-act-amendments-101624251395527.html
21-06-2021||India||Child, adoptive parents separated by Child Welfare Committee, reunited by SC||The Supreme Court has reunited a two-year-old girl with her adoptive parents in Mumbai almost two years after they separated by a court order. The girl had been lodged at a child-care facility since June 2019 after her adoption was declared illegal by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Mumbai. The Bombay high court too had dismissed the adoptive parents’ plea in March this year.The couple, who have no biological children, had moved the top court to get the child back. They had adopted her in January 2019 from a single mother who worked as a housemaid. The biological mother, due to her weak health and poor financial condition, had willingly signed an adoption deed in January 2019 with the couple under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.Also Read | SC dismisses doctors’ plea for cancelling, postponing PG final year medical examHardly had the child spent six months with her adoptive parents that the CWC, Mumbai, suspecting that the child had been sold by the mother, declared the adoption illegal and lodged the girl with a special adoptive agency. After the Bombay high court refused to hand over the child to her adoptive parents in March this year, the couple requested the Supreme Court for the child’s custody.The vacation bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian observed, “Generally, a child is orphaned by natural events. But here the child is orphaned by the orders of the court.” The court referred to the Bombay high court’s decision of March 18, 2021, refusing to hand over the child to the petitioning couple.The bench termed it “unfortunate” that the order gave rise to a situation where the child was neither with her biological mother nor the adoptive parents, but in a child care home.The adoptive parents in their petition filed through advocate Syed Mehdi Imam pointed out that the adoption was legal under Hindu Adoption Act and the religious ceremony of dattak (adoption) was also performed as per the requirement of the Act in the presence of witnesses. They were financially able to take care of the child and a social investigation report (SIR) prepared by a NGO attached with the CWC found considerable improvement in the health and wellbeing of the child within six months of her adoption.Even the biological mother appeared before the top court and said she had no objection to the child being given to the petitioner. The only other party left to be heard was the CWC, which had set aside the adoption deed and ordered an FIR to be lodged against the couple and the child’s biological mother. The bench directed the child’s biological mother to file her affidavit by the date of the next hearing.Issuing a notice on the petition and posting the matter for hearing after four weeks, the bench held, “In the meantime, custody of the child be handed over to the petitioners (couple).”For the next hearing, the court told the petitioners to check upon a 2003 Supreme Court judgment (Anokha v State of Rajasthan) which exempted adoptions under a personal law from the purview of the adoption guidelines formulated by the top court in its earlier judgment of 1984 titled LK Pandey v Union of India.The 2003 judgment is regarding an Italy-based couple who wanted to adopt a child from her biological mother in India. The question was whether the LK Pandey guidelines would apply to a case where the child was not destitute, and the biological mother had voluntarily agreed for adoption. Under the LK Pandey guidelines, every inter-country adoption requires a sponsorship from a social or child welfare society recognised by the country of origin of the adoptive parents. The couple had to then apply for a no objection certificate from Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA). The 2003 judgment decided that the LK Pandey guidelines would not apply to voluntary adoptions made by biological parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-adoptive-parents-separated-by-cwc-reunited-by-supreme-court-101624250315968.html

Yoga tells us that so many problems might be out there, but we have infinite solutions within ourselves. We are the biggest source of energy in the universe," PM Modi said as he addressed the nation on the seventh International Yoga Day. "Today even medical science lays emphasis on the healing process, besides medical treatment. Yoga helps in the healing process," PM Modi added.This year, the theme of the International Day of Yoga is 'Yoga For Wellness', and the focus will be on practicing yoga for physical and mental well-being.In pics: From Delhi to New York, here's how the world celebrated Yoga DayPresident Ram Nath Kovind, vice president Venkaiah Naidu, several union ministers and citizens across the country performed yoga on the occasion. However, the celebrations and events were mured and held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.International Yoga Day has been celebrated every year on June 21 since 2015.In UNThe proposal to observe an International Yoga Day was first introduced by PM Modi in his address during the opening of the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly. “Yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action ... a holistic approach [that] is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and nature,” PM Modi said.Also read | M-Yoga app to promote yoga videos in different languages: PM ModiPM Modi proposed that June 21 be picked for celebrating International Yoga Day as it marks the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere – the longest day of the year and considered auspicious in many cultures.The United Nations, recognizing its universal appeal, proclaimed June 21 as the International Day of Yoga by resolution 69/131 on December 11, 2014. The International Day of Yoga aims to raise awareness worldwide of the many benefits of practicing yoga.The draft resolution establishing the International Day of Yoga was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states.

The International Day of Yoga created two records, a Guinness World Record for the largest yoga class at a single venue and the other for the highest number of nationalities to have participated.“From the Upanishads, comes the idea of yoga to transform human consciousness through control of body and senses through constant practice. The body is the vehicle for the realisation of the Supreme Being,” PM Modi said during his speech at the event.The day billed as one to promote "harmony and peace" also triggered a controversy with some Muslim organisations saying yoga is essentially a Hindu religious practice and is against Islam. Authorities denied the charge and said that participation in the yoga day is not mandatory.Celebrations were held in 192 of the 193 UN member countries, except Yemen, and events were held in 251 cities in six continents with 30,000 people performing yoga in Times Square in New York.Yoga, an ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice, originated in India thousands of years ago.

21-06-2021||India||Indian Army and Navy favour theatre commands, Air Force plays the lone ranger||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has called a meeting on Wednesday of the tri-services and other stake holders to understand their concerns over theatre commands and iron out differences before working towards the raising of maritime and air defence commands this year. The ministry of defence had accorded acceptance in principle to theatre commands in 2017 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi handing over the mandate of reorganization to Gen Rawat.Earlier this month, after a presentation, defence minister Rajnath Singh had asked Gen Rawat to call a meeting of stake holders and discuss all the issues threadbare before taking the theatre command concept to Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) for final approval. Majority nations, including tiny Maldives to mighty US, function on theatre command concept with the idea of seamless integration among the land, sea and air forces for better coordination and response. While China has reorganized its seven military districts into five theatre commands, Pakistan has sought support of Beijing to help its forces also be reorganized under the same military concept.Although there have been media reports indicating that the entire process may be delayed, the ministry of defence, Indian Army and the Indian Navy are totally in favour of activation of the theatre commands with the Indian Air Force ploughing a lonely furrow on even issues like naming of the commands. Since the end of 1999 Kargil war, the Indian Air Force has its own version of jointmanship and integration with the sole purpose of keeping its air assets undivided and protecting its own turf. The fact is that even today, official files pertaining to army are labelled as Integrated Headquarters, Army (Ministry of Defence). The Navy filed are labelled Integrated Headquarters, Navy, but the Air Force files are still labelled as air headquarters only. This speaks volumes about Air Force vision of integration of the three services.A senior military commander explained the context and said: "Those in doubt are confused and outdated. Has corporatisation of ordnance factory boards come with 100 per cent consensus or is it based on efficient and better management of resources. Leadership in military is meant to take decisions in best interests of security ensuring optimum and efficient management of resources. Whatever is the best way for us to achieve the objective is the way forward.”Under the present theatre command concept, there will be three land-based commands - North comprising only of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, East comprising land area from Himachal to Arunachal Pradesh and West comprising of land area from Punjab to down south. Apart from this there will be an air defence command and a maritime theatre command with the Andamans and Nicobar Command under its jurisdiction. The maritime and air defence command will be raised by serving commander in chiefs after announcement this year and start functioning next year under the newly appointed theatre commanders. The theatre commanders will be selected from the serving commander in chiefs of the three services with air defence command going under an air marshal and maritime theatre command under a vice admiral without creation of any new posts.With Pakistan on its west and China on its eastern flank, the northern command will remain a single unit under an army general as the theatre is expected to remain active on the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control for time to come.Apart from getting its air assets divided and issues like rotation among services for theatre commanders, the IAF’s concern is the perceived dilution of powers of the air chief as the theatre commanders will be in-charge of operations and directly report to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee with three chiefs as members. This concept is similar to the US concept where the chief of staff is responsible only for procurement and training while the theatre commanders report to the defence secretary.The present command structure in the Indian military is lop-sided with Indian Army having seven commands, a much smaller Indian Air Force having similar number and Indian Navy having three commands. This structure will be rationalized under the theatre command concept with the Indian Navy expected to get one more commander in chief position.With the Chinese PLA already functioning as one integrated unit under the Western Theatre Command along the 3488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian military needs to get its act together and move fast on theatre commands for a cogent and strong response to the adversary in future. India has no other options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-and-navy-favour-theatre-commands-air-force-plays-the-lone-ranger-101624245785895.html

21-06-2021||India||International Yoga Day: Yoga takes us from stress to strength, says PM Modi||When there are threats to humanity, yoga offers a holistic way of life and takes us from stress to strength and from negativity to creativity, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday during his address on the occasion of the seventh international Yoga Day, even as he announced the launch of M-Yoga app. The app, which will be available in many languages, will show videos on yoga training based on a common protocol.. Referring to the benefits of yoga during the Covid-19 pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the globe, the PM said yoga, which addresses physical as well as mental health concerns, has emerged as a beacon of hope at a time when the world is facing the challenges posed by the pandemic. The Prime Minister stressed on the impact that yoga has on mental and physical well-being and said when the Covid-19 virus knocked on the doors, no country was prepared for it logistically or otherwise, yet yoga became a medium of great self-confidence during such difficult times. He said the world over, yoga became an important medium for self-reliance and give people the confidence that we can fight this disease. “When I speak to frontline workers and doctors, they tell me how they have made yoga an important tool in the fight against Corona. They use it to strengthen their own bodies and for their patients as well,” he said. On the benefits of yoga, he said many doctors as well as health experts have shared their own experiences of Pranayam and other yogic exercises and how their respiratory system has benefited. The PM quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar who had advised to seek the root of the disease, find the reason of the illness and then ensure its treatment. “This is what yoga does. Today, medical science also focuses on healing apart from treatment and yoga helps in the healing process,” he said. He said there are many people who are carrying out research on yoga across the world. He said research is also being carried out to assess the impact of yoga on immunity. Underlining the popularity of yoga for its many benefits, he said, “Even though major public events have not been organised in India and across the world, the enthusiasm for Yoga Day has not diminished. During this difficult time, people could have ignored it or overlooked it. For many countries, Yoga Day is not part of their culture yet their love and enthusiasm for yoga has increased.” He went on to say that In India, sages taught us that yoga and exercise are good for the body and give us a longer life. “For us, good health is the medium for success,” he said. He also referred to yoga as a means of finding solutions. “We are the biggest source of energy, but we do not realise this energy because of the many divisions that exist…at times, the lives of people exist in silos. The shift from silos to union is yoga, the realisation of oneness is yoga,” he said. He said the mantra of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) is now finding global acceptance as we all are praying for each other’s well-being. “Yoga also gives us a healthier way of life I’m sure it will continue playing its preventive and positive role in taking care of the masses. When India put forth a proposal of Yoga Day in UN, it was with the intent that it should be beneficial for all,” he said. The PM said India had taken another important step in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) with the launch of M-Yoga app and the world will benefit from it. “This will help us in making the ‘One World, One Health’ motto successful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-yoga-day-yoga-takes-us-from-stress-to-strength-says-pm-modi-101624244075110.html

The theme for the International Day of Yoga this year is 'Yoga for wellness', a motto aligned to the current pre-occupations.

Yoga is also playing a significant role in the psycho-social care and rehabilitation of Covid-19 patients in quarantine and isolation. It is particularly helpful in allaying their fears and anxiety."International Yoga Day 2021: History and significanceThe idea for an UN-mandated International Day of Yoga was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2014. In his speech, Prime Minister Modi called Yoga an "invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition" and called for the "harmony between man and nature" through Yoga. This initiative was backed by as many as 177 nations, the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA Resolution of such nature.Following Prime Minister Modi's proposal, 21 June was marked as the date to celebrate International Yoga Day since it marks the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere, which holds special significance in many parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-yoga-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-on-its-theme-history-and-significance-101624235276514.html

The day also brings in the shortest night.The word "solstice" originated from Latin word "sol" which means sun and "sistere" which means stationary or stand still. The summer solstice occurs between June 20 and 22 every year.Summer Solstice is also referred to as Midsummer, First Day of Summer, June solstice (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the longest day of the year. This phenomenon occurs twice a year, once in the Northern Hemisphere (between June 20-22, depending on the year and time zone) and once in the Southern Hemisphere (between Dec 20-23).This year, the day is coinciding with International Yoga Day, which is being celebrated virtually due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.On the occasion, Union petroleum and steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan said he hopes the rising sun would lead to disease-free earth.Taking to Twitter, Pradhan said that sun worship has been an intrinsic part of sacred traditions throughout history and many cultures across the world and the summer solstice is an auspicious time to revere the sun, align the body and mind with positive energy and embrace nature."Summer Solstice is an auspicious time to revere the Sun, align the body & mind with positive energy and embrace the nature. Sun worship has been an intrinsic part of sacred traditions throughout history and many cultures across the world," he tweeted.The minister also called for taking pride in the cross-cultural, universal and holistic appeal of yoga and hoped that yoga guides people to immunity and unity.Last year, the day witnessed an annular solar eclipse, which was visible in many parts of the world including India. The ‘ring of fire’ was visible to people in Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/summer-solstice-2021-longest-day-of-year-coincides-with-international-yoga-day-101624235354869.html

The Trust has denied all allegations of irregularities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-land-deal-row-3-booked-for-post-on-temple-trust-gen-secretary-101624219270951.html
21-06-2021||India||Raghunath Mohapatra: Famed sculptor who dreamt big||Raghunath Mohapatra often said that the last spectacular work carried out by Indian sculptors was nearly 400 years ago when they built the Taj Mahal in Agra under Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’s reign. So it’s little wonder that the much-decorated sculptor from Puri – and member of the Rajya Sabha – wanted to create a spectacular work.The 78-year-old belonged to a state that has long been considered a land of sculptors as their detailed understanding of architectural science and immaculate attention to the human form gave rise to the renowned school of Hindu temple architecture, exemplified by the Lingaraja temple in Bhubaneswar, the Jagannath temple in Puri, and the Sun temple in Konark built between the 11th and 13th centuries.“His dream was to build a second Sun temple like the one at Konark. He dreamt big and had the necessary rigour to make it a reality. His power of imagination set him apart from others,” said Adwait Gadnayak, director general of National Gallery of Modern Arts.Mohapatra died of Covid on May 9.Born and brought up in Puri’s Pathuria Sahi, a neighbourhood of 50-odd sculptor families a few kilometres away from Jagannath temple, Mohapatra honed his sculpting and chiselling skills under the watchful eye of his maternal grandfather, eminent sculptor Aparti Mohapatra. While in primary school, the young Raghunath was once punished mercilessly by his class teacher, which prompted his grandfather to pull him out of school. The young ward took to crafting stone idols and sold them to pilgrims on the streets of Puri. At 18, Mohapatra was drafted as a master craftsman in the Handicraft Training and Designing Centre in Bhubaneswar.In 2013 Mohapatra founded Raghunath Mohapatra Arts and Crafts Foundation at Sisupalgarh, which has trained over 2,000 students till date. He received several awards over the years, including the National Award, the Padma Shri, and later, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan. He was nominated to the Upper House in July 2018 for his contribution to the world of arts. Mohapatra first caught the country’s imagination when he made a statue of the warrior and stallion –Odisha’s emblem taken from the Konark temple -- outside the open-air Barabati Stadium in 1968. The then deputy minister Bhairab Mohanty put out a call for a sculptor who would be able to replicate the emblem. Mohapatra, then 25, was paid ₹68,000 for making a stallion in Khandolite stone.His career took off in 1974 after he made a six-foot-tall grey sandstone statue of the Sun god, now displayed in the Central Hall of the Parliament in the National capital. The following year, he won a Padma Shri award. What followed was a series of remarkable works: a lotus sculpted out of a single black granite block of stone for the final resting place of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi at Vir Bhumi, New Delhi; Mukteswar Gate, a red sandstone gate at the popular crafts complex in Surajkund; a wooden statue of Buddha at the Buddha Temple in Paris; in 1985, he made two white Dholpuri stone lamps made by the sculptor still adorn the office of the prime minister.But Mohapatra kept returning to his muse: in 1980, he sculpted an 18-ft long and 15-ft high replica of the Konark horse, which remains a signpost in the capital city at the Master Canteen square; another 14-feet-high Konark wheel in red sandstone made the same year for the India International Trade Fair is now displayed at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi.Mohapatra married Rajani in 1966 and they had three sons -- Jashobanta, Prashanta and Sushanta – and two daughters Rajalaxmi and Meenakshi. Sushanta alone followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sculptor. Four years ago, however, Sushanta who lived in Bhubaneswar, died of a heart attack. Prashant was a star batsman of the Odisha cricket team and a BCCI umpire, while Jashobant looked after the operations at the crafts village. Both the daughters are home makers.Towards end of April, Jashobanta, Prashanta, Rajani, Mohapatra and other family members got infected with the coronavirus disease. On April 20 when Mohapatra tested positive, he was running high fever with depleting oxygen saturation. The next day, he had to be rushed to AIIMS Bhubaneswar. Rajani accompanied him to hospital. Prashant had already been admitted to AIIMS, and Jashobanta followed soon after. While Rajani survived, Mohapatra and his sons succumbed to Covid.Mohapatra was close to his grandson Smitesh, 25, and pushed his grandson to do a post graduate degree in Business Administration, as his own lack of formal education rankled him. “He taught me chiselling stones and encouraged me to pursue higher studies telling me that he always felt the lack of school education. ‘I will pay your MBA fees. You don’t have to tell your father,’ he would tell me. He would get angry at anyone who raised hand on me,” Smitesh, Jashobanta’s son, recounted. “The pain of losing him would never go away,” he said.His dream to re-construct the 13th century Konark sun temple only became stronger over the years.He bought around 100 acres of land in Sakshigopal area of Puri district 10 years ago and set up the Aditya Narayan trust. “He would tell me if that he passed away, then I would have to complete the Sun temple project,” said Mohapatra’s youngest brother, Ramkanta, 55, who will look after Mohapatra’s trust and the arts foundation with Smitesh’s assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raghunath-mohapatra-famed-sculptor-who-dreamt-big-101624216953514.html
21-06-2021||India||No reduction in fuel prices: TN finance minister||Chennai: Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Sunday ruled out any immediate measures to reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel due to the fiscal situation in the state. It was an election promise of the DMK government, and the minister said it would happen later when the situation is better.Speaking to reporters, the minister listed reasons for not doing this immediately. He said that the Union government, in its budget, imposed and increased the cess on fuels and deprived the state of the revenue. He added that the price and taxes of fuel are high, but the dues to the states have been reduced. Taxes collected by the Union government for petrol and diesel have increased by 63%, from ₹2.40 lakh crore to ₹3.90 lakh crore, he said. He also said that states are yet to receive their dues. He added that the “fiscal situation was much worse than what they had feared,” and the second wave of Covid-19 had increased state spending to thousands of crores. The finance department is preparing a white paper on the fiscal situation, which will be released in two weeks, he said.For these reasons, he said that the state government is unable to cut petrol prices immediately. “But, we will not go back on our word,” the finance minister said, adding that once the ‘injustice’ is corrected, the reduction will be done. “In our history since independence, we have never seen the state rights and finances being taken away like this and laws made by the Union government on subjects that are in the state lists,” he said.A political commentator, Sumanth Raman criticised the government on Twitter, saying that these facts were known when the DMK had made a poll promise. The DMK had stated in its election manifesto that when they come to power, they will reduce the price of petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹4 respectively. To this, the finance minister responded, “Things we didn’t know then: Union budget would switch ₹50,000 crores from excise to cess (not shared with states). The full extent of fiscal decay.” He added that they did not promise an immediate cut, but a cut during their term.Political analyst Maalan Narayanan agreed with the state’s decision not to cut under the present circumstances. “Technically, it is the right thing to do because VAT is one of the main resources for states,” Narayanan said. “If they introduce a reduction now, it will affect the state’s finances, which are already in bad shape. Due to the lockdown, TASMAC (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation, the state-run liquor outlets) was shut, there wasn’t much revenue from GST and registrations for land and vehicles had come down. Politically, this was the same predicament that the AIADMK was in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-reduction-in-fuel-prices-tn-finance-minister-101624216893478.html
