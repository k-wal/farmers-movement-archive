This indicates that the country overall has progressed forward in its journey towards achieving the SDGs,” the report titled SDG India Index 2020-21 said.In 2015, all members of the United Nations adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, at the heart of which were 17 SDGs (and a further 169 targets). This, the third edition of the India-specific study that tracks progress on all 17 goals, and on 70 targets; the second edition covered 17 goals and 54 targets while the first, covered 13 goals and 39 targets.“Kerala retained its rank as the top state with a score of 75. Chandigarh too maintained its top spot among the UTs with a score of 79,” the report, which was the third instalment of the index, said.Among UTs, Delhi was ranked second, with a score of 68, up from last year’s 61.Bihar’s score was the lowest at 52 points, and the other worst performers were Assam (57) and Jharkhand (56). Although the three states made some advances, they have continued to be among the lowest performers since the rankings began in 2018-2019.Tamil Nadu (74) and Himachal Pradesh (74) took the second spot, seeing an improvement from their previous scores of 67 and 69, respectively. Goa, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were ranked fourth on the list, with all remaining among the top ten performers.Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar, who presented the report on Thursday, said that the index encourages efforts to reach SDG goals. “Our effort of monitoring SDGs through the SDG India Index & Dashboard continues to be widely noticed and applauded around the world... We are confident that it will remain a matter of aspiration and emulation and help propel monitoring efforts at the international level,” he said.“The report reflects on the partnerships we have built and strengthened during our SDG efforts. The narrative throws light on how collaborative initiatives can result in better outcomes and greater impacts,” Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant added.The report noted there has been considerable improvement in scores. The range for states has improved from between 50 and 70 to 52 to 75 . Similarly for the UTs, the previous range of scores was 59 and 70, which has now improved to 62-79.According to the index, India has seen progress in nine parameters: health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life on land, and peace, justice and strong institutions. The two areas where the country needs to focus on are eradicating hunger and gender equality, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-retains-top-spot-bihar-at-the-bottom-in-sdg-india-index-101622743648489.html

We are willing to observe the ceasefire as long as they do so,” General Naravane said.He, however, said that other activities like terror infrastructure including terrorist camps and presence of terrorists on the other side of the LoC were continuing.General Naravane said there has been decades of mistrust between India and Pakistan and the situation on that score cannot change overnight. “If the ceasefire continues in letter and spirit and they (Pakistan) stop pushing terrorists inside and foment trouble in India, then all the small steps definitely go to build up trust in the two countries,” the army chief said.He said though the ceasefire is on, “there can be no slackening of our level of preparedness.” He added, “We have the CI (counter insurgency) grid to prevent any movement from across the LoC, we also have the counter terrorism grid in the hinterland and all the deployments are dynamic and dependent on situation on threat perception.”The Army chief said the review of deployments is being done from time to time and if the situation permits, then definitely they could take recourse to pull out some troops from active deployments to rear areas. “They (troops) won’t be pulled all together,” he said.The Army chief said the role of the army is to bring down the levels of violence to an extent where a civil administration and local security forces could focus on development of the region and J&K.“The ultimate aim is to bring down the levels of violence so that peace and development can take place. I have been briefed by all the commanders on ground on the situation both on the Line of Control and hinterland. I am glad to say that all the parameters that we judge normalcy have seen great improvement. There have been very few terrorist initiated incidents. There have been hardly any cases of stone pelting or nil cases of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) in the recent past,” General Naravane said.The army chief said all these are indicators of return to a sense of normalcy and people also want the same, which is a very good thing.“In the context of return to normalcy, we are from our side prepared and have taken all the necessary steps for the smooth conduct of Amarnath yatra. The decision to conduct the yatra lies with the civil administration but we are ready from our side,” he said.“My message to all, not only youth, would be that when there is peace and tranquility can there be development and when there is development, we will all prosper and they (youth) should shun path of violence as it’s not going to take us anywhere,” he said.On the second day of his two-day visit, General Naravane also reviewed the security situation along the Line of Control.The army chief was accompanied by Northern Army Commander Lt Gen YK Joshi and Chinar Corps Commander Lt Gen DP Pandey. They visited the formations and units, wherein the local commanders briefed the army chief on the existing security situation and the measures instituted to foil infiltration from Pakistan occupied Kashmir. On Wednesday, General Naravane also met J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-indo-pak-mistrust-army-chief-gen-naravane-says-it-can-t-change-overnight-101622737152313.html

The "Choksi matter" was one of the agenda items discussed over during a cabinet meeting on Thursday chaired by Antigua and Barbuda prime minister Gaston Browne and attended by all his ministers, an official post informed.Also Read: Mehul Choksi row lights up a political firestorm in Antigua, PM Browne hits backFugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi was reported to have gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda, where he was staying since 2018 as a citizen, but was recently found in Dominica. Now, the matter of repatriation of Mehul Choksi has triggered a political storm in the Caribbean island nations.Antigua and Barbuda prime minister Gaston Browne has accused his country's opposition party -- the United Progressive Party (UPP) -- of supporting the fugitive businessman in order to secure its own campaign funding. Denying his government’s involvement in Choksi’s disappearance, Browne alleged that the UPP was funded by the India-born businessman.

03-06-2021||India||UK should press India for Christian Michel’s release, say his lawyers, family||New Delhi: The United Kingdom should press India to release Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, in the aftermath of a UN panel ruling that his detention is arbitrary, Michel’s lawyers and family said on Thursday.Michel’s sons, Alaric and Alois, and lawyers Francois Zimeray and Toby Cadman, who are working with Michel’s Indian counsel Aljo Joseph, told a virtual news conference they feared the British national would not get a free and fair trial in India.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the latest comments by Michel’s lawyers and family.Christian Michel has been held in India since he was extradited from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in December 2018. He recently sought bail in cases registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate on the grounds that the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) concluded his detention was arbitrary.The lawyers said they planned to petition the UN to take further action following India’s failure to act on WGAD recommendation in March this year that Michel should be immediately freed. They said they would also submit a report to the UK government and the European Union (EU) on Michel’s case.Zimeray, France’s former ambassador-at-large for human rights and a former member of the European Parliament, and Cadman, a London-based barrister specialising in international law, contended India had violated its obligations under international treaties and conventions by failing to act on WGAD’s findings.Alaric Michel, 26, said his father was “rotting in jail” amid fears about rising Covid-19 cases in India. “We want his trial to take place despite fears that such a trial won’t be free and fair...We are imploring the UK government to do what is right, which is protecting one of its citizens who is being treated badly,” he said. Alois Michel, 24, said the family has been waiting for more than three years for developments in Michel’s case amid “fears about a trial ever happening”. Both of Michel’s sons pointed out he had spent many years in India and didn’t represent a flight risk.Zimeray pointed to the actions of the Indian and British governments and said he had rarely seen “such a lack of respect for basic human rights and indifference”. The UN panel’s recommendations didn’t amount to a political decision as WGAD’s findings were technical in nature and based on whether India’s position was in line with international treaties and conventions it has signed, he said.“It is up to the UK government to raise its voice and raise the issue [with India] as Michel has been jailed for political reasons,” Zimeray said. “What’s happening is absolutely illegal and goes against the treaties India has ratified.”Zimeray also said Michel is “not above the law”. He added, “If there are questions from the Indian justice [system], he must face them, he is willing to answer them... He is not guilty, he is presumed innocent and has to be treated as such.” Cadman – who is joint head at Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, which petitioned WGAD on Michel’s behalf in 2019 – alleged CBI was still attempting to “coerce a confession” out of Michel. “They are trying to intimidate him till he provides a confession to conclude what is a very, very political case. Members of the Indian government have made statements convicting him even before a trial,” he said.“There is no privileged consular access to Michel and prison guards or CBI officials have been present whenever officials of the British high commission have met him,” Cadman said, adding there were “repeated attempts by the CBI to coerce him into giving a confession”.Michel was living in Dubai when India sought his extradition for involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2010 deal to acquire 12 AgustaWestland helicopters worth 556.2 million euros. At the time, Michel was a middleman and an external consultant for a subsidiary of AgustaWestland. He has denied all charges levelled against him.Even before the formal release of WGAD’s report, the external affairs ministry said the group’s conclusions were based on “limited information, biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-should-press-india-for-christian-michel-s-release-say-his-lawyers-family-101622729591968.html

While stating that there would be moderate recovery in June with an acceleration in air traffic from the second quarter, CAPA said there will also be rising confidence and continued traffic recovery in the second half of this financial year and that international air passenger traffic will be in the range of 16-21 million.According to the consultancy, airlines are estimated to need around US$5 billion of re-capitalisation in FY 2022 just to survive, and Air India and IndiGo combined will represent around US$4.5bn of the approximately US$8bn of losses.CAPA said the second half of the year is expected to see more domestic traffic. Also Read | India’s domestic air passenger traffic down by 65-67% from April to May: Icra“As was the case in the second half of FY 2021, we expect to see rising confidence and continued traffic recovery in the second half of this financial year—partly due to the easing of restrictions and the expansion of bubble agreements, but also due to the prospects of increased international deployment by Indian carriers. For example, Vistara is likely to launch routes to North America and other long-haul destinations with its fleet of four 787s,” CAPA said in its airlines outlook for FY 2022.CAPA, however, said that international traffic is likely to be constrained because of border restrictions and that it will be particularly sensitive to discrete decisions taken by governments on such matters, which is unpredictable.CAPA said that the aviation industry is heading into a higher-cost environment at a time when it can least afford to. “Our projections assume an average oil price of US $70/barrel and an exchange rate of US $1= ₹75. It is possible that oil could spike to US$75/barrel, and the currency could depreciate to ₹77 per dollar. Airport charges are also expected to be a potential challenge. It is possible, in certain scenarios, to see a domestic user development fee (UDF) of around ₹1,000 per departing passenger, and an international UDF of ₹2000-2500,” CAPA’s estimation stated.In the domestic market, fare and capacity regulation are expected to continue for a large part of FY 2022, according to CAPA. It also said that removing caps may be more challenging than it was to introduce them. “The government may need to develop a framework to conduct a financial stress test of carriers prior to removing price and capacity regulations,” the aviation consultancy said.It also said that international operations to/from India are expected to continue under air bubble agreements for much of FY 2022, with the capacity available under these bubble agreements expected to increase from October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-domestic-air-traffic-to-accelerate-from-july-capa-101622729411661.html

On Thursday, according to news agency Reuters, the head of Japan’s Olympics organising committee ruled another suspension of the Games, despite deep disquiet at the prospect of thousands of athletes and officials arriving during a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections.In New Delhi, officials told the prime minister that efforts are being made to ensure uninterrupted training for athletes.“From vaccination to training facilities, every need of our sportspersons must be fulfilled on top priority,” PM Modi told the officials, according to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office.PM Modi was told that a total of 100 athletes have qualified for Tokyo Olympics across 11 sports disciplines and about 25 more athletes are likely to qualify.“While a total of 19 Indian athletes had participated at the last Paralympics in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro. 26 para-athletes have qualified (this year) and 16 more athletes are likely to qualify…,” the PMO statement said.PM Modi said that he will connect with the Olympics contingent through a video conference in July to encourage them and wish them on behalf of all Indians “…Sports is at the heart of our national character… For every young sportsperson shining on the global stage, a thousand more will be inspired to take up sports,” PM Modi said.Tokyo Olympics chief Seiko Hashimoto has said that the cancellation of the games was not very likely and could happen only if the majority of the countries are unable to take part in the event.“If various countries around the world experience very serious situations and delegations from most countries can’t come then we wouldn’t be able to hold it.,” Seiko was quoted saying by Nikkan sports, a Japanese sports daily.Over 10,000 of the 80,000 unpaid volunteers who play an important part in the smooth conduct of the Games have already quit due to Cvid-19 concerns.The authorities have already decided not to let people from abroad enter the country for the Games. They have, however, not decided whether Japanese spectators will be allowed to attend Olympics events. There are fears that shouting, hugging and high-fiving could promote contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinate-athletes-asap-says-pm-modi-at-meet-to-prep-for-tokyo-olympics-101622726111550.html

03-06-2021||India||SC sets 2-week deadline for scheme to evaluate Class 12 students||The Supreme Court on Thursday set a two-week deadline for the Centre to come up with a “well defined objective criteria” for assessment of Class 12 students of the Central Bureau of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) following the cancellation of their examinations.Attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the Centre, shared an official communication intimating the court about the cancellation.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said they were happy over the “in principle” decision to cancel the examinations but asked the government why no decision had been taken with regard to the criteria of assessment. “...what will be the objective criteria to assess students. It has not been spelt out in your letter,” the bench said. Venugopal said a decision in this regard was still pending as the government needed to settle whether to include the performance from Class 10 onwards or restrict the assessment to Class 12 alone. “There is another issue of which subjects to assess. All this may take at least three weeks.”Senior advocate JK Das, who appeared for CISCE, sought four weeks to come out with a scheme. “This time unlike last year, we have asked for data from all principals with regard to all subjects,” Das said.Also Read | Delhi communal violence: SC quashes FIR against Vinod Dua for ‘inciting’ peopleVenugopal agreed to the two-week deadline after the court said in the age of videoconferencing, a decision could even be taken overnight.The court told Das students were concerned about admissions to higher education courses not just here but abroad as well. “Impress upon your clients that this is a matter of urgent basis.”The Centre on Tuesday cancelled the CBSE Class 12 examinations in view of the second Covid-19 wave and ended uncertainty for roughly 1.4 million students, who were to appear in them.The decision was taken at a meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired on Tuesday amid appeals by students, who feared the exams could end up infecting them because those under 18 are not currently eligible for vaccination.Hours later, CISCE also scrapped its Class 12 exams or ISE exams. The CBSE Class 10 board exams were cancelled in April.The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned the matter until June 17 and said it was mindful of the interest of students at schools affiliated to state boards and will address their concerns after the objective assessment for CBSE, CISCE is settled.The court’s deadline came on a petition filed by advocate Mamata Sharma, who had sought an objective assessment scheme within a specified time frame.The petitioner referred to state boards and said most of them are yet to cancel the Class 12 examination and sought uniform directions for students across the country.The court asked Sharma to be patient and said her petition sought directions for Class 12 students of CBSE, CISCE only but was now “asking for heaven”. “Interests of student community will be taken care of whether CBSE, CISCE or state boards. First let us settle for CBSE, CISCE and then we will go into other issues.”The CBSE put forward two options for holding Class 12 examinations at a meeting the Centre last month held with representatives of state governments. Under the first option, examinations would be conducted for major subjects at the designated examination centres. CBSE suggested marks for minor subjects could be calculated based on a student’s performance in major subjects. It also proposed two-hour exams (instead of three) at schools where students were studying. Most states preferred the second option while some expressed reservations over holding the physical examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-2-week-deadline-for-scheme-to-evaluate-class-12-students-101622724551585.html

03-06-2021||India||In talks with Pfizer, Moderna, J&J on manufacture of vaccines: Foreign secy||India is in talks with pharmaceutical giants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson about sourcing, and possible local manufacture of their Covid-19 vaccines even as it awaits WHO approval for the indigenous Covaxin vaccine, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. Addressing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Southeast Asia regional health partners’ forum on Covid-19, Shringla said the government has taken several steps to speed up domestic manufacturing of vaccines such as easing “regulatory disruptions” of supply chains for raw materials and components. With the pandemic well into its second year, India is “fighting an exceptionally severe second wave”, and the country has “lived through a series of extraordinary stresses and shocks” while dealing with “unprecedented economic and social disruptions”, he said. Listing the steps taken by the government to overcome the impacts of the pandemic, Shringla said: “We are also part of the discussions with major vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna about sourcing and possible local manufacturing of their vaccines in India. We have also helped to expedite the introduction of Sputnik-V vaccines.” Also Read | How long do Covid-19 vaccines take to start working?He added, “We are also looking forward to WHO’s approval for India’s indigenous vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech.” Noting that the manufacture of vaccines is dependent on complex supply chains, he said: “We have worked to ease regulatory disruptions to these supply chains with key partners through diplomatic interventions.” India is also working with other countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on a “targeted and temporary waiver under TRIPS to ensure timely and secure access to vaccines for all,” he said. South Africa and India have proposed a temporary waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines and the move has been backed by the US, China, Russia and several other countries and groupings such as Brazil-Russia-China-India-South Africa (Brics). Experts have, however, said negotiations on the issue could take months or even years while the transfer of technology to make the vaccines too is a lengthy process. Despite temporarily putting vaccine exports on hold in March, India’s vaccination programme has been hit by a shortage of vaccines and the government has ramped up efforts to both buy doses from abroad and increase domestic production. The government has sought help from the US in increasing access to raw materials and components needed for making vaccines and is also hoping to benefit from the Biden administration’s plans to distribute 80 million surplus doses to countries around the world. For India to meet its target of vaccinating its entire adult population by the end of 2021, the country needs to administer a total of 1.88 billion doses, of which 1.67 billion or 89% are yet to be administered. This means India needs to deliver 238 million doses a month from June or it risks falling behind the target, data analysed by HT shows. Till May 31, India had administered more than 215 million doses, the third highest number of total doses delivered in any country, behind only China and the US. Shringla said India had rapidly adapted to virtual diplomacy amid the pandemic and the prime minister conducted more than 12 virtual summits and more than 75 virtual bilateral meetings. The external affairs minister and the ministry had conducted hundreds of ministerial, joint commission and senior officials’ meetings, multilateral engagements, and foreign office consultations. “Going forward, we will participate in the process of creating global scale capacities that are needed to deal with pandemic-scale challenges. A number of serious global conversations are underway on this in platforms such as the G7, the G20, Quad, Brics, the United Nations and the WHO itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-talks-with-pfizer-moderna-j-j-on-manufacture-of-vaccines-foreign-secy-101622723651469.html

Earlier, Gambhir said that even if a thousand PILs are filed against him, he will continue to serve people. His tweet quoting Bhagat Singh comes as a reiteration of his stance in this case.I am a man and all that affects mankind concerns me - Sardar Bhagat Singh!The drug controller of the Delhi government on Thursday informed the Delhi high court that the Gautam Gambhir Foundation has been found guilty of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing Fabiflu medicine. This comes after the court on May 31 rapped the drug controller department for not examining properly how the BJP MP procured such a huge quantity of Covid-19 medicines.On April 21, Gambhir put out a tweet stating that people of East Delhi can get Fabiflu from the MP office at 2 Jagriti Enclave between 10am and 5pm showing a prescription and the Aadhaar card. The tweet came under scrutiny as several AAP leaders questioned how he hoarded the medicine stock at a time when medicine shops ran out of their stock.People of East Delhi can get ‘Fabiflu’ from MP office (2, Jagriti Enclave) for FREE between 10-5. Kindly get Aadhar & prescription पूर्वी दिल्ली के लोग “Fabiflu” मेरे कार्यालय (2, जाग्रति एन्क्लेव) से 10 से 5 के बीच मुफ़्त में ले सकते हैं. अपना आधार और डॉक्टर की पर्ची ले आएंHearing a plea, the court earlier asked whether the Gautam Gambhir Foundation has a licence on what basis he made the bulk purchase. In a press conference, Gambhir earlier said one should question why the medicines were not available at Delhi's medicine shops. "The medicines I distributed were the need of that hour. Not one even if thousands of PILs are filed against me, I will continue to serve the people and try to save their lives," he had said.After Fabiflu, his foundation was also involved in arranging oxygen cylinders, concentrators etc.Gautam Gambhir Foundation is also organising free vaccination camps, Gambhir tweeted on Thursday. "Delhi doesn’t need blame game, it needs intent. GGF is organising FREE vaccination camp with hospitals. Those interested can msg at 8595785545, fill simple form & get your jab with all social distancing guidelines. GGF will bear the cost!

The result of these two machines in these last assembly elections reconfirms its genuineness as earlier."Four states - Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam -- and one union territory Pondicherry, went to polls earlier this year.The EVMs were developed in 1989 by the Election Commission of India. The VVPAT units were used across all constituencies in India in the 2019 general elections, however, in 2014, VVPATs were used in eight constituencies.There were 1,492 VVPATs in West Bengal, 1,183 in Tamil Nadu, 728 in Kerela, 647 in Assam and 156 in Puducherry in the recently held assembly electionsIn April 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that it is mandatory for the Election Commission to carry out physical counting of VVPAT slips in five random EVMs in each parliamentary constituency in the 2019 general election.This direction of the apex court of the country came after a petition was filed by 21 opposition parties where they demanded cross-verification of VVPAT slips in at least 50 per cent randomly chosen polling stations in each AC.In the 2021 Assembly elections, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had written to the EC and asked for a tally of all VVPAT paper slips in correspondence with the EVM count.As per the rule, in the event of a mismatch between the number of VVPAT slips and corresponding EVM counts, it is the VVPAT count that prevails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evm-vvpat-tally-data-shows-100-match-in-recently-concluded-assembly-elections-101622721762359.html
03-06-2021||India||PM Modi phones Mukul Roy a day after TMC leader visits latter||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday phoned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukul Roy to inquire about the latter’s wife undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a hospital in Kolkata amid speculation about the return of former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders to the ruling party in West Bengal.Roy did not comment on the conversation. But BJP leaders aware of the matter said Modi’s calls lasted around two to three minutes. The two spoke a day after TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee visited the hospital on Wednesday to meet Roy, and triggered speculation about the latter’s next political move.Abhishek Banerjee spent about 10 minutes at the hospital and inquired about Krishna Roy’s health. TMC leaders aware of the matter said Abhishek Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, also met Mukul Roy’s son, Subhranshu, to inquire about his mother’s health.On Thursday afternoon, Abhishek Banerjee commented on his visit to the hospital. “We may have political differences (with Roy) but some things are above politics. I know his wife since I was a child. To me, she is like my own mother,” said Banerjee while on a visit to villages in East Midnapore district that were ravaged by Cyclone Yaas. Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh visited the hospital around two hours later and met Subhranshu Roy, who on May 29 wrote on social media that self-criticism is more necessary than criticising a government elected by people. He did not name any party or state, but many took it as an obvious reference to BJP in Bengal.Also Read | Bengal BJP divided over Centre’s notice to ex-CS, politicians’ arrestMukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in the March-April assembly polls, but Subharanshu Roy lost. One of TMC’s founder members, who was a close aide to Mamata Banerjee, Mukul Roy defected to the BJP in 2017. His son switched sides two years later.Mamata Banerjee added to speculation about her stand on Mukul Roy when she drew a comparison between him and Suvendu Adhikari, who defected to the BJP from TMC ahead of the polls and defeated the chief minister from Nandigram. “Poor Mukul has been fielded from Nadia district although he hails from North 24 Parganas. He is not as bad as Suvendu,” Banerjee said at a rally.Mukul Roy was the BJP’s election strategist in the 2019 Bengal Lok Sabha polls in which the party emerged as the second largest in West Bengal with 18 out of 42 seats. The TMC swept back to power by winning 213 of the 292 seats for which polling was held. The BJP managed to win just 77 seats and many leaders, who defected from TMC, have since been trying to return to the ruling party.TMC leader and minister Chandrima Bhattacharya took a swipe at Modi’s call to Mukul Roy. “It feels good to see BJP leaders following us. Our youth leader Abhishek Banerjee showed them that there is a space for courtesy in politics.”The West Bengal elections were among the most keenly contested polls lately in which Modi and Union home minister led the BJP from the front.Giving his first reaction to the local media on Thursday afternoon, Subhranshu Roy said Banerjee had also inquired about his mother.“I am grateful to the chief minister because despite her busy schedule she regularly asked her aides to inquire about my parents. Abhishek Banerjee’s visit had nothing to do with politics, but the example he set should be followed by all parties. PM Modi called my father a BJP leader but Abhishek’s visit has a different significance. In the past, Union home minister Amit Shah and other BJP leaders had called up my father. I will not get into a debate on who called first and who called later,” said Subhranshu Roy.Asked whether he would return to the TMC, he said, “Those decisions will be taken later. My mother’s recovery is my only priority right now.”He said he believes what he wrote about self-criticism in his social media page. “When a boy comes first in class in an examination, the student who comes last should find the reason for the topper’s success,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-phones-mukul-roy-a-day-after-tmc-leader-visits-latter-101622722271106.html

The extent of unlocking will vary from district to district ranging from level 1 to level 5 — level 1 being the one allowing maximum relaxations. The five-level unlocking plan has been prepared taking into account the Covid-19 positivity rate, the medical infrastructure of the districts, officials said. While 18 districts with less than five per cent Covid positivity rate, including Thane, fall in level one, Mumbai is in level two. These 18 districts are likely to see a complete unlocking from June 4."We have prepared a 5-level unlock plan for the state on the basis of positivity rate and status of occupancy of oxygen beds in the districts. Districts with the lowest positivity rate will have no restrictions," Maharashtra minister Vijay Wadettiwar said.After the minister's announcement, the Maharashtra government clarified that a proposal to categorise the districts and cities based on positivity rate and occupancy rate of oxygen beds is being considered.The lists of the districts falling under these five levels will be reviewed every week for further amendment — the districts can move up and down based on their Covid-19 numbers.Level 1 districts will be allowed to unlock almost completely with restaurants, malls, shops and public places reopening. Offices, gyms will also be allowed to resume operations. Aurangabad, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Jalgaon, Jalna, Latur, Nagpur, Nanded, Nashik, Yavatmal, Washim, Wardha, Parbhani and Thane fall under the tentative list of level 1 districts.Level 2 districts will reopen partially with gyms, salons, beauty parlours functioning at 50 per cent occupancy. But Section 144 will remain imposed in districts falling under level 2.Districts falling under level 3,4 and 5 will see a limited to no lifting of restrictions.The lockdown-like restrictions across Maharashtra were imposed in April during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic.Owing to these restrictions, the Covid-19 situation of the state — the worst-affected in both the first and the second wave of the pandemic — became stable in the past few weeks.Thane, for example, recorded 568 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total infection count to 5,18,831. Mumbai on Wednesday reported less than 1,000 fresh Covid-19 infections, while Maharashtra's daily tally has dropped to around 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-reopen-in-5-phases-mumbai-in-phase-2-no-change-in-mumbai-local-restrictions-101622718663838.html

The meeting was organised by the Union education ministry days after the decision to cancel Class 12 board examinations.The Prime Minister also interacted with the parents of the students during the meeting and had a chat with them on various issues and concerns.The Class 12 exams were cancelled after a high-level meeting chaired by PM Modi on Tuesday to ward off the threat of Covid-19 infections. Long deliberations were held at the meeting with all the stakeholders.“After extensive consultations, we have taken a decision that is student friendly, one that safeguards the health as well as the future of our youth,” PM Modi tweeted after the meeting.Many students had appealed to the CBSE and the Centre to cancel the examination. The students feared that the exam could infect them because those under 18 aren’t currently eligible for vaccination.The students have been posting message of thanks on various social media platforms after the government's decision.The CISCE and various state governments followed suit and announced cancellation of their respective Class 12 board examination on Wednesday and Thursday.The Supreme Court, which had asked the Centre to take a decision on the issue, welcomed the move and granted the central government two weeks time to devise a well-defined objective criteria for assessment of Class 12 students.CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi on Thursday said they will try to give the result in the shortest possible time. Tripathi added that the evaluation process is likely to begin within 15 days.PM Modi keeps holding such interactive interaction. In April, interacting with students virtually in his annual 'Parikasha Pe Charcha' programme, the Prime Minister told the students not to fear exams but to see them as a test to improve themselves. He also said students sometime become over conscious regarding exams and asked them to consider it as a small destination in their long lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-interacts-with-students-days-after-cancelling-class-12-exam-101622717929936.html
03-06-2021||India||'Vaccine of ₹400 reaching people at ₹1,500': Anurag Thakur explains Congress's 'One two ka four policy'||Finance minister of state Anurag Thakur on Thursday brought serious allegations of vaccine black marketing against Punjab and Rajasthan governments and said the chief ministers of these two states, the favourites of the Gandhi family, are behind this "corruption".The Centre buys vaccines from manufacturers and sells them to the states at ₹400 per dose, but the Punjab government is selling those vaccines to private hospitals at ₹1,060 for which those hospitals are collecting ₹1,560 from the public, the minister said.अब राज्य के दस जिलों के 35 वैक्सीनेशन सेंटर पर वैक्सीन की हज़ारों डोज़ कचरे के डिब्बे में मिली हैं। कांग्रेस ने ये कचरों के डब्बे में वैक्सीन नहीं जनता का विश्वास , ज़रूरतमंदों की आस और बीमारों की उखड़ती साँस को फेंका है।ये सरसार विश्वासघात है, जनता माफ़ नहीं करेगी।"The vaccine doses which are to be given free are now translating into ₹3,120. This is Congress's favourite one two ka four policy," the minister tweeted.The Rajasthan government is two steps ahead of the Punjab government, the minister said alleging that it has wasted 11.50 lakh vaccine doses. "Now, thousand of vaccine doses are found in garbage dumps. Doing this, the Congress has actually thrown public's trust into the garbage," the minister said.The vaccination has become a Centre versus opposition state issue shortly after the vaccination drive began in January as opposition-ruled states, including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, complained of an inadequate supply of vaccines. Recently, the Union health ministry pointed out that Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh — both opposition-ruled states — have wasted the maximum number of vaccine doses, which the states refuted and said was not based on full facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-of-rs-400-reaching-people-at-rs-1-500-anurag-thakur-explains-congress-s-one-two-ka-four-policy-101622717344907.html
03-06-2021||India||Active internet users likely to reach 900 mn by 2025, rural may lead: IAMAI||The number of active internet users in the country is likely to grow nearly 45 per cent to 900 million by 2025 compared to 622 million as of last year, an IAMAI-Kantar Cube report released on Thursday said.According to the report, rural India may have a higher number of internet users compared to urban centres by 2025 which indicates the need to strengthen the digital ecosystem in the country.“By 2025, there would be a greater number of internet users in rural India than in urban India. Given this, the digital ecosystem will need to evolve to address the specific needs of this emerging demography."Vernacular, Voice and Video will emerge as the game changers for the digital ecosystem over the next few years," Biswapriya Bhattacharjee, Executive Vice President, Insights Division, Kantar said in a statement on the report.The report suggests that even though the internet penetration in urban India is over two times than rural areas, the usership in rural areas has been growing at a faster rate on a year-on-year basis."While internet users grew by 4 per cent in urban India -- reaching 323 million users (67 per cent of urban population) in 2020, digital adoption continues to be propelled by rural India – clocking a 13 per cent growth to 299 million internet users (31 per cent of rural population) over the past year," the report said.The study by internet companies body IAMAI with consulting company Kantar found that small towns account for almost two out of five active internet users (AIU) while the top 9 metros account for 33 per cent of the AIU in urban India.According to the report, of the 1433 million (143.3 crore) population in India, 622 million individuals are AIU and this translates to about 43 per cent of the total population across urban and rural India.However, with a sizable population not accessing the internet actively in rural India, there is huge headroom for growth in the next few years, the report said."This indicates that there's a lot of headroom for growth in rural India and this would help in bridging the urban-rural digital divide," the report said.As per the finding, nine out of ten AIU access the internet every day.On average, AIU spend around 107 minutes (1.8 hours) actively on the internet daily."Though the proportion of daily users is marginally higher in urban India as compared to rural India, AIU in urban India is spending 17 per cent more time as compared to rural India," the report said.Mobile continues to remain the device of choice for accessing the internet in both urban and rural areas."Given the affordability of mobile devices along with the availability of cheaper data plans, accessing the internet through a mobile device has clearly become the first choice," the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-internet-users-likely-to-reach-900-mn-by-2025-rural-may-lead-iamai-101622713526776.html

The figure stood at 27 during the second wave, said Dr Jayanta Ray, Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of AGMC."At least 225 corona infected pregnant women delivered healthy babies and the newborn babies were not infected by the virus due to utmost care taken by the doctors and the healthcare staff. It was a big challenge to the doctors to bring smiles to the infected mothers", said Dr Ray."A pregnant mother needs the best care, which was quite a challenging task during the pandemic. But, our doctors and other healthcare staff did their best to ensure the safety of both the mothers and the newborns with the highest standard of hygiene," he said.Ray said that some doctors and healthcare staff handling such cases were infected by the virus, but they ensured the safety of the children from infection."Shortage of skilled manpower and lack of infrastructures are common issues in any small state. But, the way the Paediatrics and Gynaecology section of the AGMC managed the situation and conducted successful deliveries, even in case of critical cases, has set an example," he said.Dr Sanjib Debbarma, Medical Superintendent of the hospital, pointed out that the AGMC and GBP hospital was the only designated unit for the Covid-infected expectant mothers during the first wave."In the first wave, the workload on the AGMC and GBP hospital was high as compared to the second wave of the virus since it was the only designated unit for giving care to the Covid-infected expectant mothers. However, we managed things smoothly to ensure the safety of both the mother and the infants," the Medical Superintendent said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/225-covid-19-pregnant-women-gave-birth-to-healthy-babies-in-agartala-during-pandemic-101622715272761.html

Roy's wife Krishna is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the hospital."The Prime Minister spoke to my father over the phone at 10.30am and enquired about my mother's health," Roy's son Subhrangshu was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Prime Minister's call came a day after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Trinamool Congress (TMC) youth unit president Abhishek Banerjee visited the hospital. He spent 10 minutes there - a visit which sparked speculations that Roy might eventually return to the party he left in 2017.Roy's son Subhrangshu was present at the hospital when Banerjee visited.A former TMC MLA who joined the BJP following his father's footsteps, Subhrangshu recently said in a social media post that one should do self-introspection before criticising the government, which has come to power with people's support.The post was believed to be directed at the state BJP leadership. However, West Bengal BJP Dilip Ghosh said it's Subhrangshu's personal opinion. “Someone can express a personal opinion. BJP’s policies are not decided by Facebook posts,” said Ghosh.Trinamool Congress leaders said Subhrangshu had said the right thing.While Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district in the recent assembly polls, his son was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in North 24 Parganas district.An accused in the Narada sting operation case being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Mukul Roy resigned from the TMC in September 2017. He was suspended for six years for anti-party activities. He also resigned from the Rajya Sabha in October, 2017. He joined the BJP in November that year. In September 2020, Roy was made national vice-president of the BJP. Subhranshu Roy joined the BJP in May 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-mukul-roy-day-after-abhishek-banerjee-s-10-min-courtesy-call-101622714121668.html

A letter to all states from the Union food ministry on June 2 states: “There are several reports/grievances through Media, newspapers, NGOs, individuals stating that vulnerable and weakest sections of the society i.e. street dwellers, rag pickers, hawkers, rickshaw pullers, migrant labours etc., who are in dire need of foodgrains, are unable to procure ration cards.” “It is felt that some of the poor and needy people, who also may not have address proof, may be finding it difficult to obtain a ration card.” The federal advisory called for “special drive to reach out to the most vulnerable and economically weakest sections of the population in urban and rural areas”. The government offers subsidised grains to nearly 800 million eligible beneficiaries, identified as food-insecure, under the food security Act. They are also eligible for 5 kg of free cereals for the month of May and June under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). Also Read | Foodgrain stock highest since 2016: Govt dataActivists and analysts say lack of ration cards is a major hurdle for many food insecure people to access subsidised food. Yet, India ranked a poorly 94 among 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2020, which placed the country is in the “serious” hunger category. Experts say the Centre’s advisory does not clarify whether the requirements of Aadhaar and address proof can be completely waived to access food aid. “Therefore, there should be immediate universalisation of the public distribution system (PDS) and additional distribution of 5 kg foodgrains per person and 1.5 kg pulses and 800 gm cooking oil under the PDS with its expansion,” said Dipa Sinha, a food-security expert who teaches in Ambedkar University, New Delhi. The PMGKAY should be continued for at least six months, Sinha said. A recent survey by the Centre of Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University however showed only 27% of the eligible households reported receiving the full benefits under the larger Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana announced to cushion Covid distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-give-food-cover-to-most-vulnerable-101622712970714.html
03-06-2021||India||Serum Institute seeks indemnity as govt mulls legal cover for Pfizer, Moderna: Report||Pune's Serum Institute of India has sought indemnity from the government as talks are on that the government may extend legal protection to foreign vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna, news agency ANI reported quoting sources. "Not just Serum Institute of India, all the vaccine companies should get indemnity protection against liabilities if foreign companies are granted the same," sources told ANI.As the government is expanding the vaccination drive in phases, it is actively looking into roping in foreign vaccine manufacturers. Some states have individually approached Pfizer and Moderna, but the US firms made it clear that they would not sell their vaccines to individual states. As consultations are on between the government of India and the foreign vaccine companies, the issue of indemnity has become a crucial one as the government may agree to extend indemnity to these foreign vaccine manufacturers.Explained: What is indemnity for vaccine makers? What Pfizer, Govt say about itIndemnity provides legal cover to vaccine makers as under this agreement, these companies can't be dragged to the court by beneficiaries. No company in India engaged in producing Covid-19 vaccines has this indemnity. In fact, a Chennai volunteer who took part in the Covishield trial moved the court seeking compensation of ₹5 crore from the company claiming serious side effects from the shot. Serum rejected the charge and filed a counter-charge against the participant."We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits... Frivolous claims come up and you see in the media something being blown out of proportion. The government needs to step in with the right messaging," Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla had said earlier.Existing norm on legal casesWhen India started the vaccination drive on January 16, it decided not to give indemnity to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India. So, according to the existing norms, the companies are responsible for adverse impacts, if any.Why Pfizer, Moderna want indemnityTheir demand is not specific to India. In all the countries where these firms have supplied their vaccines, they are insulated from legal cases.What Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla said on the issue of indemnityEarlier, Adar Poonawalla said that the government should indemnify vaccine manufacturers like the US did. "..the government can act, the US, for example, has in fact invoked a law, to say that during a pandemic, and this is especially important only during a pandemic, to indemnify vaccine manufacturers against lawsuits for severe adverse effects or any other frivolous claims which may come about because that adds to the fear and also will bankrupt vaccine manufacturers or distract them if they have to just all-day fight lawsuits and explain to the media what is happening," Poonawalla had said.Legal cases against CovishieldSince the vaccine makers in India are not indemnified, one can file a case against the manufacturers. In 2020, a Chennai man who took part in the trial of Covishield sought ₹5 crore compensation from Serum Institute, alleging side effects. The company filed a counter-complaint against the man.An Uttar Pradesh man has recently filed a complaint against the company and also against Dr Balram Bhargava, the head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, alleging that no antibodies were formed in his body after receiving the first dose of Covishield.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-wants-indemnity-if-govt-protects-pfizer-moderna-report-101622710337103.html

The Chinese weaponized drone has been acquired by Pakistan and has plans to jointly produce the same with parent manufacturer Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.The Indian Navy, which has been designated as lead by both Army and Air Force in the acquisition of MQ-9 drones, has asked the Defence Ministry for early convening of Defence Procurement Board meeting under the chairmanship of Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar to get the project cleared in principle. Once the DPG clears the project, the Navy will move the Defence Acquisition Council for acceptance of necessity (AON) of the procurement, which will be done through the US Foreign Military Sales route under government to the government scheme. The Navy and the other two services are most satisfied with the performance of the two unarmed Predator drones on lease from the US as it has developed maritime domain awareness from Sunda Strait in Indonesia to the eastern seaboard of Africa.

Appearing for the drug controller, advocate Nandita Rao said the cricketer’s group, Gautam Gambhir Foundation, committed an offence under Drugs and Cosmetics Act as it was found stocking medicine in an unauthorised manner.The body also found Aam Aadmi Party's MLA Praveen Kumar guilty under the same act. The court asked Rao whether the status report submitted by the drug controller was in relation to Gambhir only or "does it relate to Praveen Kumar also?""Status report deals with MLA Praveen Kumar also and we have found him guilty too," Rao said in a response to the court.Delhi HC asks them to take action against these people as well as others saying that an example needs to be set. "We want you to take action against these violation in terms of your report so that an example is set," the court said.It also directed the body to file a status report on the same. The matter has been listed for further hearing on July 29.The court was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Deepak Kumar, seeking a first information report (FIR) against Gambhir and others involved in the matter.Acting on the PIL, the high court on May 7, directed Delhi Police to carry out an investigation in the alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders and medicines like Fabiflu. The court later asked the drug controller to carry out an independent probe into the matter after Delhi police gave a clean-chit to Gambhir and nine others involved in the case.In the status report submitted to the court on May 31, Rao said Gambhir through his foundation organised a medical camp from April 22 to May 7 with the help of Garg Hospital and that while there was no prescription, a request letter by the hospital was sent to the foundation. She said based on the letter of April 19, Gambhir made a purchase order from a licensed dealer.Further speaking on the matter, the HC said that the drug controller made the amendment to the report which clearly shows that it was "trying to protect these people.""When we rapped you then you came out with the truth. It is clearly evident... Don't put on a brave face today. We find that you have made a mistake and the good thing is that you have rectified your mistake," it said during the hearing."We want to curb this practice," it also said, adding, "Just because some people have money and they can easily buy, does not mean that they would be hoarding.""You (Gautam Gambhir) did charity and tried to help the people, but in that you caused a shortage because of which genuine patients could not get the medicine. There could have been other ways of helping people," the court also said.On May 31, the high court pulled up the drug controller for giving a clean-chit to Gambhir and Kumar for hoarding Covid-19 supplies. Calling the drug’s controller’s status report on the enquiry on Gambhir and Kumar “trash,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said, “You want us to shut our eyes to it. You think you will get away with this kind of a false statement. Don’t we know what the situation on ground was like? One thing is very clear. You cannot take us for a ride. If you think we are gullible, so naive; we are not. We will give it back to you very, very hard."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gautam-gambhir-foundation-guilty-of-hoarding-fabiflu-drug-controller-tells-delhi-high-court-101622707253556.html

The DMA said in its petition that Ramdev's company Patanjali is propagating false information about its Coronil kit that it is a cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The DMA, on behalf of its doctor members, said Ramdev's statement in public is damaging the reputations of science and doctors. "This is a suit for civil rights of doctors," said advocate Rajiv Dutta, who represented the DMA.The high court also asked Ramdev's counsel orally to tell him not to make any provocative statement till the next date of hearing on July 13 and respond to the suit.Ramdev, the founder of Patanjali Group, is in the eye of the storm over comments against the allopathic system of medicine, including coronavirus vaccines.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) took strong objection to the comments made by Ramdev last month. Citing a video circulating on social media, the IMA said Ramdev claimed that allopathy is a "stupid science".The medical body shot off a letter to the Centre, asking strong action should be taken against the yoga guru for denigrating the tireless services rendered by doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic in which many medical practitioners have also succumbed.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan wrote a letter to Ramdev in which he called the comments "unfortunate". Though Ramdev withdrew his comments and in reply to Vardhan said he wants to put the matter to rest, the IMA has been putting pressure on the government to take action against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-issues-summons-to-ramdev-over-patanjali-s-coronil-101622707144446.html

03-06-2021||India||Can blended learning be the way forward in higher education?||Despite the closure of educational institutes for over a year due to Covid-19 and the shift towards online education, colleges and universities say the decision to opt for the blended mode of learning in the post-pandemic era should be decided by students and not implemented in a standardised manner.This comes after the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a draft note on May 20 allowing 40% of the syllabus of all courses to be taught in online mode and through e-content while the rest 60% in offline classes. The commission has asked stakeholders to submit their suggestions on the draft note by June 6.While teachers and principals agreed it was important to adopt blended learning practices in a digital era, they also pointed towards the existing digital inequalities in the country exacerbated by the financial struggles due to the pandemic and suggested that the policy be introduced on a voluntary basis.What does the policy suggest?The UGC committee tasked with preparing the note said that the decision was taken as per the new National Education Policy 2020, which calls for blended learning. “Given the emergence of digital technologies and the emerging importance of leveraging technology for teaching-learning at all levels from school to higher education, the NEP 2020 recommends for use of blended models of learning. The NEP 2020 states that while promoting digital learning and education, the importance of face-to-face in-person learning is fully recognised. Accordingly, different effective models of blended learning will be identified for appropriate replication for different subjects,” the UGC document said.The document added that blended learning increases the opportunity for collaboration between stakeholders in different cities in addition to “learning anytime and anywhere” without “the barriers of time and location”.Also Read | New UGC rules facilitates autonomy to seven MU colleges in past one yearThe report said the blended learning mode would enable students to engage in self-learning and would develop a “self-driving force.”The draft concept note also lists seven blended learning activities that can be improvised and adopted for the higher education sector. These include flipped classrooms where students watch a short lecture video online and come into the classroom to complete activities like projects, group work, or other exercises.Many stakeholders also pointed out that a year of online learning had provided expertise to teachers on digital content, which should be continued as students needed to be prepared for a digital era.Rama Sharma, principal of Delhi’s Hansraj College, said that adopting blended learning would not be difficult as colleges have had a year of experience in dealing with online content. “Compared to last year, the situation is better now as both students and teachers know how to go about it. The online component right now is at 100% since colleges are closed. So, 40% of the syllabus being taught online will not be an issue. Digital space is growing exponentially, and our teachers and students need to be trained in the area,” she said.Sharma added there are concerns of students in rural areas being left out due to online learning, colleges will be able to help those students during classes held for 60% of the syllabus. “If 60% of the syllabus is being taught offline, it means that students will be coming to colleges. We can hold remedial classes and tutorials and students who weren’t able to understand the e-learning material can take help from their teachers then,” she said.Concerns and demands of teachersManoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, said that despite the growing popularity of online learning content, stakeholders may be wary of opting for remote learning options. “The academic community needs to give the appropriate feedback on the proposed document to the UGC so that the policies are accordingly rationalised. The choice needs to remain with students whether they want to go for the blended mode of learning or classroom learning,” he said.Arvinder Ansari, who teaches sociology at Jamia Millia Islamia, said when it comes to teaching pedagogies, the connection between teachers and students has been lost completely through the digital mode. “Gradually, we can think about blended learning with minor courses going online but shifting completely would not be a good choice. Students should be allowed to choose between the modes of learning due to the digital divide and poor internet penetration across India,” said Ansari.Several teachers said that access to the internet is a pertinent issue and would determine the feasibility of the blended learning programme.Shiksha Rani, who teaches political science at Bhagini Nivedita college in outer Delhi’s Najafgarh area, said that citing internet issues, only 50-60% of her students attended the online classes during the pandemic whereas 80-90% of students used to attend offline classes before Covid.Also Read | Teachers point flaws in CBSE Class 10 pattern, say can’t be applied to Class 12“Online learning is the only suitable during a pandemic because there is no other alternative. But students will learn better through face-to-face interactions and even teachers communicate better when a rapport is established. This proposal will be difficult for teachers as well as they have to simultaneously manage both online and offline lessons,” she said. Rani suggested that if the proposal were to be made mandatory, teachers would have to divide the batches as per the students who were likely to attend online classes and those who would not.The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has also opposed the move saying the policy would “remove the need to hire teachers” and “truncate learning”.Rajib Ray, DUTA president, said that the policy documents fail to address the quality of degree in terms of “meaningful composition and employability.”“Our experience of online teaching of over a year tells us that it is highly unequal and inadequate. Classrooms cannot be replaced. Online teaching-learning reduces human interactions and truncates learning,” Ray said.What do students think?Several students HT spoke to said they were against the blended learning practices and that government universities – state and central – should allow for equitable access to education instead of ignoring the digital barriers in India.Satyajit Kumar from Bodh Gaya in Bihar, who is a first-year student of History at St Stephen’s College, said that several of his friends had to limit the number of questions they asked during virtual classes as it would mean crossing their designated data limit for the day.“Even though I upgraded my internet pack and am spending more than I usually would, I have to limit the number of questions or doubts I ask in each class because, in that limited 2 GB data, I have to attend five one-hour classes. If I ask too many questions, it might extend the class, and then attending the next session may be an issue,” he said.Final-year political science student Hitesh Tanotra, who studies in Rajdhani College, said a large number of students at the Delhi University are from marginalised backgrounds, which is why adopting blended learning is not feasible.“Not every student will have access to the internet and smartphones for online education. In many houses, one smartphone is shared by three students. How can we expect to introduce a mandatory online learning component? Besides, online learning has affected our academic growth along with the overall development of students and won’t be helpful for students,” he said.Also Read | Over 5,000 children in Maharashtra lost parents to Covid-19, state announces schemeSakshi Gupta, a third-year student of Kalindi College, said that in the past year, it has been difficult for her to manage classes. “Internet recharge rates are a matter of concern, and we cannot afford Wi-Fi. These factors, along with connectivity issues, made online education difficult for us last year,” she said.Lessons from the pandemicWhen Covid-19 struck last year, the education sector was unwillingly propelled towards a massive change without any preparation within a few weeks. Learning shifted from classrooms to virtual rooms leaving many students behind due to lack of access to uninterrupted internet or devices along with connectivity issues in several parts of the country.From learning to tutorials to even examinations, everything moved online leaving several students at a disadvantage including disabled students who found it harder to access the online learning material due to lack of inclusive content.In September, an undergraduate student from Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi died by suicide in her hometown in Telangana after undergoing several problems including the switch to online education, her parents said.According to a survey conducted by the Lady Shri Ram College Students’ Union last year, 40% of around 1,400 students said they were attending classes without a stable internet connection.Delhi University professor Rajesh Jha said during the online open book examination conducted last year, several disadvantaged students from marginalised categories suffered the most.“The most affected were the students from School of Open Learning who mostly come from marginalised backgrounds or disabled students who did not get the necessary infrastructure. A pandemic is not the time for reform and introducing mandatory blended learning as it will leave students at a huge disadvantage.”Jha said that the availability of the internet and smartphone does not signal that classroom learning can be replaced by blended learning. “Online classes or learning material require more data and not every student can afford the internet pack which comes at around ₹400-500 and even then, does not have enough data per day. Several teachers and colleges had to raise money last year to help students from low-income backgrounds or even lower-middle-class backgrounds with internet access,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-blended-learning-be-the-way-forward-in-higher-education-101622705050344.html

The SDG index evaluates the progress of states and union territories on social, economic and environmental criteria and is released every year by the government.India’s overall score across sustainable development goals improved marginally by six points, from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2021, Niti Aayog said while releasing the index. This rise in the score was due to the country-wide improvement across clean water and sanitation (Goal 6) and affordable and clean energy (Goal 7), it added.Kerala scored 75 out of 100 while Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu scored 74 each. Andhra Pradesh was placed next in the list with 72 points. On the other hand, Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam were the worst-performing states this year with 52, 56, and 57 points, respectively.Releasing the third rendition of the index, Niti Aayog vice-chairperson Rajiv Kumar said, “Our effort of monitoring SDGs through the SDG India Index and Dashboard continues to be widely noticed and applauded around the world. It remains a rare data-driven initiative to rank our states and union territories by computing a composite index on the SDGs.”The index was first launched in December 2018. Over the years, it has fostered competition among all states and Union territories by ranking them on global goals developed in collaboration with the United Nations in India.“The report reflects on the partnerships we have built and strengthened during our SDG efforts. The narrative throws light on how collaborative initiatives can result in better outcomes and greater impacts,” Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said.This edition of the index covers 17 goals, 70 targets, and 115 indicators, while the last covered 17 goals, 54 targets and 100 indicators. The first edition, in 2018-2019, covered 13 goals, 39 targets, and 62 indicators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niti-aayog-unveils-sdg-india-index-kerala-retains-top-spot-bihar-at-the-bottom-101622701460540.html
03-06-2021||India||World Bicycle Day: Meet the tea maker who travelled from Kerala to Kashmir||Imagine covering a distance of 5647kms on the humble bicycle! This astonishing feat has been achieved by 23-year-old Nidhin Maliyekkal, who cycled from his hometown Thrissur in Kerala to Kashmir. And, he sold tea to make ends meet while on this journey. “I love to travel! What started with short journeys locally grew into a passion,” says Maliyekkal laughingly, when asked what inspired him to undertake the unbelievable cycling trip. “I used to make tea and juice at a restaurant in Thrissur. But because of the pandemic, I lost my job. While at home I decided that I needed to step out and fulfil one of my dreams of cycling to Kashmir. And that was my moment!”Strapped for money, Maliyekkal sold his camera in order to repair his younger brother’s cycle – their only vehicle in the house – to accomplish the voyage. “My camera was my only saving, but I needed to repair the cycle that my brother uses. My parents had no clue that I barely had any money. I set out with a mere ₹170 in my pocket, and decided to sell tea on the way to fund my journey,” he says describing the initial struggle.On January 1, this year, he set out with bare essentials such as a tent, a kerosene stove, flask, tea and two pairs of clothing. He recalls, “I didn’t know the route, but people have been incredibly kind to me throughout my journey. Someone sent a water bottle for me, another gave me a helmet, and a shop owner also made a placard that I hung on my cycle to describe my journey. I would cover a certain distance, and then find a good location to sell tea. Then I would wrap up for the evening and set out in search of petrol pumps, small dharamshalas and gurdwaras to spend the night. I don’t think I could have completed the journey if I hadn’t got the help of these kind-hearted people.” From Gulmarg to Baramulla, Dal Lake and Tulip Garden, Maliyekkal has seen them, and expresses how surreal the experience has been. Sadly, he had to forego his desire to make the entire journey back on cycle. “After I reached Delhi, a lockdown was imposed in the city. So someone I had met on the trip arranged a lorry to drive me back to Thrissur, where I reached on April 30, wrapping up my 120 day trip,” he adds. Having lived a life of penury and deprivation, Maliyekkal shares how the journey gave him a sense of confidence. “It was surely daunting, but I just wanted to do this for myself. Achieving something doesn’t depend on what you have, but how far you are willing to go for your dreams. You don’t need a fancy car or bike to travel, even a cycle is enough for one who really wants to do it. If I can, anyone can,” he says. And the same hope and positivity he applies to his dream of working in the film industry as well. Maliyekkal confesses, “I want to be an actor, script writer, and director — I have big dreams. It is one of the reasons I wish to travel. And I want to study the culture of India, and for that I believe seeing this country in its entirety is important. And after hearing about my journey, a few directors have reached out to me... Who knows, I might just tick another thing off my list!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-bicycle-day-meet-the-tea-maker-who-travelled-from-kerala-to-kashmir-101622702414176.html

People have seen how campaigning was done. I think the ECI should probe the election expenses furnished...”RJD treasurer Sunil Kumar Singh, who said they have sent their report to the EC within the stipulated time, said the ECI should indeed cross-check the details of election expenditure furnished by all parties, especially those in power. “ RJD has been in opposition for a long [time] and gets small contributions. Whatever expenses were incurred by the RJD have been shared. ...some parties having deep pockets have understated their election expenses.

While on one hand a spring tide, during which the water level in the sea and rivers rises at least a metre higher than the usual high tide, is expected to hit in the last week of June, officials apprehend that it could trigger more damage if it hits when the monsoon rains are in full swing. “Two more tides are coming. While one is expected to hit around June 11, a second one, which would be bigger, is expected to hit around June 26. If these tides hit during heavy rains, then the water level would increase further,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday. Cyclone Yaas, which coincided with the perigean spring tide on May 26, inflicted heavy damage to the river embankments in the Sunderbans, flooding several villages. Many are still inundated under a few feet of water. Officials said if the breaches are not repaired, river water would gush in again, flooding the villages once more. “The chief minister has directed officials to plug some of the breaches before June 11-12. By June 25, we must repair all breaches in the embankments, she said,” a senior official said. According to officials present in the meeting, the chief minister was visibly peeved with the recurring breaches that the embankments were suffering after every storm and cyclone, flooding the villages and damaging property worth thousands of crores. Also Read | Post Cyclone Yaas, Bihar begins crop loss assessment“The damage stays for the next few years because once the saline water from the rivers and the sea gushes in, inundated croplands and sweet water ponds are rendered useless. Traditional crops won’t grow and sweet water fishes such as rohu and katla won’t survive. Villagers need to wait for at least two to three years till monsoon rains can wash away the layer of salt,” said an official. According to the forecast, the water level at Sagar which is a part of the Sunderbans, could rise up to 5.67m on June 25 when the spring tide hits. Usually, it remains below the 4.5m mark during the high tide. While the delta was hit by Cyclone Amphan in May 2020, Cyclone Yaas hit on May 26. Even though Yaas made the landfall in Odisha, the tidal waves and storm surge inflicted heavy damage in the Sunderbans and coastal districts of East Midnapore, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas. The state has come up with an estimates damage of ₹20,000 crore whereas the Centre has allocated ₹1,000 crore for the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breached-embankments-spring-tide-and-monsoon-bengal-braces-for-another-crisis-101622700489742.html

The terror operative, however, displayed complete defiance to such persuasions and not only refused to surrender but also fired upon the police party engaged in persuasion. One of the policemen was hit with a bullet on chest and survived because of his bulletproof jacket,” the spokesman said narrating the sequence of events.Police said after efforts to make him surrender failed, Maik was engaged in a gun fight and neutralised. “The snatched weapon was recovered from the possession of the terror operative and his body was sent to the police hospital in Srinagar for medico-legal formalities,” it said.Police said that Malik was an active member of banned terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen in the past and was arrested in 2003 and that his brother Shabir Malik was also a militant who was killed two years ago during an encounter at Brenpathri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizbul-terrorist-killed-in-jammu-kashmir-police-camp-after-refusing-to-surrender-101622700429838.html

In the document, the Centre told the court that WhatsApp, an instant messaging service owned by social media giant Facebook, is “indulging in anti-users practices by obtaining ‘trick consent’ from users for its updated privacy policy,” news agency ANI reported.“WhatsApp has unleashed its digital prowess to existing users and would force them to accept updated 2021 privacy policy, to transfer existing user base committed the updated privacy policy before Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill becomes law,” it said in the affidavit, as per ANI.In the affidavit, the Centre urged the high court to issue interim direction to WhatsApp to desist from any action of 'push notifications' onto users related to updated 2021 privacy policy. It also sought direction to ask WhatsApp to place on the record number of times such notifications are being pushed daily and their conversion rate."It is submitted that millions of WhatsApp existing users, those who have not accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy are being bombarded with notifications on everyday basis," the Centre said in the affidavit. It also noted that these notifications are against the "very grain of prima facie opinion of the Competition Commission of India's order."The Centre also submitted that the current notifications being pushed by WhatsApp on its users, existing and new ones, is against the “very grain of prima facie opinion of the Competition Commission of India's order” of March 24.Earlier this year, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy in which it said that the platform will share some data with its parent company in instances when a user interacts with a business account. The company first proposed to implement it in January and said users who do not accept it will have their accounts deleted, but delayed it to May 15 after a backlash from users as well as the government. On May 14, a WhatsApp representative told HT that users who had not lost any functionality till that point would not lose any additional features.The government has been insisting that the new policy be withdrawn entirely.On May 26, WhatsApp moved the Delhi high court against the latest IT guidelines claiming that the requirement for them to adopt features such as traceability for identifying originators of messages violated the right to privacy under the Indian law and the company’s end-to-end encryption policy.Invoking the 2017 Justice K S Puttaswamy vs Union Of India case against the traceability provision, WhatsApp said that it was "unconstitutional and against people’s fundamental right to privacy."Responding to the lawsuit, WhatsApp said it was "an act of defiance," and an "unfortunate attempt to keep the guidelines from coming into effect”.It also clarified that the government will only seek information in cases of serious crime or are in the interest of national security and the normal functioning of WhatsApp will not be impacted for the users. None of the measures proposed by India will impact the normal functioning of WhatsApp in any manner whatsoever and for the common users, there will be no impact, the Centre had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-obtaining-trick-consent-govt-in-delhi-hc-amid-row-over-privacy-policy-101622698684045.html

It held that Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. This definition has been taken as precedent for all matters pertaining to section 124A ever since.The FIR was registered against Vinod Dua on May 6, 2020, in Himachal Pradesh by a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader.The Supreme Court had protected the journalist from arrest in June 2020 when he approached the apex court after being served with a notice to appear before Himachal Pradesh’s Kumarsain police station, 80km away from the state’s capital Shimla, for questioning in the case.A total of 53 people were killed and more than 400 were injured in the riots that ravaged parts of north-east Delhi in February last year.

The plan, also known as the Mountbatten Plan, came to be celebrated as the 'last plan for independence'. Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy to India to speed up the process of transfer of power by the then British prime minister Clement Atlee. After his 'Dickie Bird Plan', under which he proposed that the provinces be declared independent successor states and be allowed to choose whether to join the constituent assembly or not, was opposed by Jawaharlal Nehru, he decided to abort it and come up with the June 3 plan.Here is all you need to know about the Mountbatten Plan:- The June 3 plan announced that India would be splitting into two nations after its independence -- India and Pakistan. The division came into effect on August 15, 1947.- The plan included the principles of partition and gave autonomy and sovereignty to both India and Pakistan. It also gave the nations the right to form their own constitution.- Under this plan, the Princely states, such as Jammu and Kashmir, were given a choice to either remain independent or join India or Pakistan.  - Unlike the Dickie Bird Plan, this plan was accepted by both the Congress and the Muslim League. - The Indian Independence Act of 1947, which was passed in the British Parliament and received the royal assent on 18 July 1947, was drafted based on the Mountbatten Plan. - According to this plan, the British monarch would no longer use the title ‘Emperor of India’ and the British Parliament could not enact any law that would be binding on either of the two nations.- Until the formation of new constitutions, the Governor-General was made a constitutional head. He was made responsible for assenting to laws passed by the constituent assemblies of the nations as part of this plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mountbattens-last-plan-for-independence-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-june-3-1947-plan-101622694800571.html

A lot when it comes to Naveen Patnaik’s Odisha||On Tuesday, the Naveen Patnaik government started a new department called Mission Shakti to govern 6 lakh-odd women self help groups (SHGs) in the state that have emerged as the single-largest vote bank of Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD) two decades after it began as a scheme in 2001. Mission Shakti was turned into a directorate in 2017 till it was carved out on June 1 as a separate department with IAS officer Sujata Karthikeyan at its helm.“It is a historic step by the Naveen Patnaik government in empowering women... The Mission Shakti department would lead to larger inclusion of women in development of Odisha,” tweeted senior BJD leader Pranab Prakash Das, referring to the 70-lakh women members of the SHGs, who take loans from banks and provide small loans to their members.While a new department will likely translate into a separate budget for the SHGs from the next fiscal, political observers are unsure if it will transform their functioning on the ground or end up as another “renaming” exercise aimed purely at delivering political dividends.“Under Mission Shakti, Women members of SHGs may have been empowered financially, but has anyone reviewed whether the SHGs are creating any tangible assets? Most loans given to SHG members are being utilized to meet household expenses such as children’s education, marriage, and husband’s business. I don’t understand how having a separate department would lead to better governance,” asked retired bureaucrat Prasanna Mishra.Over the last few years the Odisha CM has created or renamed at least half a dozen departments and buildings, including the state secretariat which is now called Lok Seva Bhavan, suggesting people’s service was its reason for existence. At the height of farmer suicides in Odisha in 2015-16, he renamed the agriculture department as agriculture and farmer empowerment department. In December 2017, he split the tourism and culture department and made a separate Odia language and culture department to promote Odia language. A few years ago the planning and coordination department was renamed as planning and convergence department while the revenue department became revenue and disaster management department. Three days ago, his government renamed the forest and environment department as forest, environment and climate change department.“It’s nothing more than [a] delusional activity. The name game is just to hoodwink people. From Garibi Hatao of the 80s to Mo Sarkar now, most of these names don’t convey anything to anyone. What is worse is poor and middle class people are not protesting against the government taking them for a ride,” said sociologist Rita Ray.Political science professor Gyana Ranjan Swain said the naming and renaming exercise is essentially Patnaik’s way of leaving a legacy behind. “After ruling the state for 21 years, he surely wants to leave his mark. Creation of new departments is a good move to decentralise power, but does he really intend to do it,” asked Swain.Many others like former bureaucrat Prasanna Mishra see it as Naveen Patnaik’s tactic to create a grand spectacle without delivering anything on the ground. Mishra points out that Odisha is actually ranked at the bottom of governance rankings, along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the Public Affairs Index (PAI)-2020 released by the Public Affairs Centre, a not-for-profit organisation based in Bangalore last year, Kerala topped a composite index reflecting sustainable development, while Odisha and Bihar scored negative points of -1.201 and -1.158 points respectively.Former finance minister Panchanan Kanungo agrees that the creation of a new department is nothing more than a gimmick. “After creating a separate department for Odia language in December 2017, an Odia university was supposed to [be] set up in Satyabadi in Puri district with facilities for post graduate studies in Odia. It remains a non-starter. All shops and business establishments in the state were supposed to display signboards in Odia language, but it has not happened. This is repackaging of old wine in a new bottle,” he said.BJD general secretary Bijay Nayak however disagreed. “Unlike BJP’s slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, creation of new departments and initiatives like Mo Sarkar and 5T is transforming governance. Had it not been so, how is Naveen Patnaik winning elections after elections,” asked Nayak.Patnaik started the 5T programme - technology, transparency, teamwork, time leading to transformation – after winning 2019 assembly polls and it has now become a buzzword in Odisha. His trusted aide and private secretary VK Pandian is now known more as the ‘5T secretary’ as he looks after the implementation of the formula in different departments.BJP leader Sajjan Sharma said the state government has little to show in administration, but was ready to reap political benefits through name-games. “In the name of [building a] Smart City, the government has dug up the capital city of Bhubaneswar over [the] last 4 years, but roads get waterlogged after showers. If this government was so active, why did Odisha slip to the 29th position in the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ rankings for 2019,” asked Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whats-in-a-name-a-lot-when-it-comes-to-naveen-patnaik-s-odisha-101622696769530.html

03-06-2021||India||Amid China’s high tariffs, India, Australia ramp up farm trade||India and Australia are deepening trade ties by providing greater access to each other’s markets and technologies, as the two nations -- which have had disagreements in the past – look set to come closer in the backdrop of Australia’s escalating trade disruptions with China. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and his Australian counterpart David Littleproud held a virtual meeting on June 1, an official said, in which key issues were thrashed out, according to India’s farm ministry. Australia has given market access for export of Indian pomegranates, while a joint plan will be worked out for access to Indian mangoes and pomegranates, officials said. The Australian minister also assured access to items, such as okra and pomegranate arils. Australia is seeking access to sell barley, a major produce of that country. Also Read | Tenancy Act gets nod, to boost house rentingThe new trade developments follow the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership announced by prime ministers of India and Australia during their summit on June 4, 2020. Battered by China’s increasing of tariffs in recent times, Australia is looking at a wide range of trade agreements with India, analysts say. China has targeted barley farmers in Australia with high tariffs, a trade war that has spilled on to other exports from Australia to China, including coal and wine. India has imported very little of Australian barley since 2009, when it updated some of its phytosanitary requirements, which refer to measures to control plant diseases. “India has prohibited weed seeds, including ryegrass and wild radish, which can be found in barley. This was a barrier,” said Abhishek Agarwala of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. India is especially looking to Australia for better farm-to-fork supply-chain technologies, he said. On March 5, The Australian, a newspaper, reported that India was “moving to fill the Chinese vacuum for resources and wine, as a free-trade agreement between Canberra and New Delhi gains momentum”. India is also seeking greater access to Australian coal, rare earth minerals, copper, steel aluminium, cobalt and nickel. For agricultural partnership, the Indian side has made the National Institute of Agricultural Marketing as the nodal organisation. It is also pushing for Australian expertise in post-harvest management to strengthen rural grain storage and modernising supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-china-s-high-tariffs-india-australia-ramp-up-farm-trade-101622694609374.html

03-06-2021||India||Monsoon likely to hit India's southwest coast today: 5 points||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said south-westerly winds strengthened in Kerala, resulting in an increase in rainfall in the state and set the favourable stage for the onset of monsoon on Thursday."The spatial rainfall distribution has increased over Kerala. Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels over the south Arabian Sea and deepened," IMD said, adding that an increase in cloudiness over the area means there is a high possibility of even more rainfall over 24 hours. "Hence, the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place during the same period," the weather department said.Here are 5 points on this year's monsoon in India:- Monsoon is an important variable in the state of India's rural economy. The country receives about 70% of its annual rain during the monsoon season, which is crucial for crops such as rice, soybean, and cotton.- After two years of above-average rainfall, the IMD, in its second long-range forecast, has predicted normal monsoon rainfall at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) this year. The LPA is the average rainfall (88cm) recorded in India every year between June and September from 1961 to 2010.- According to IMD, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA in 2020 and 2019. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, it was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%, respectively.- As part of the monsoon's onset, strengthening of lower level south-westerly winds will take place and widespread rainfall is likely in the north-eastern states this week, IMD said. Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura are likely to witness heavy rainfall.- Last week, the weather department had predicted that the monsoon would reach India on May 31 but it revised its forecast after it got delayed by a few days. Issuing a clarification over the previous announcement, M Rajeevan, secretary at the ministry of earth sciences said "no one can be perfect". “@Indiametdept will never manipulate data or make statements to justify their forecasts. They admit forecast failures with humility. In weather & monsoon forecasts, no one can be perfect. We are also accountable to Indian tax payers. We show respect to our country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-hit-india-s-southwest-coast-today-5-points-101622685055691.html

03-06-2021||India||HC serves notice to Tejpal on Goa’s plea||The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court on Wednesday observed that the sessions court's judgement acquitting journalist Tarun Tejpal in a 2013 rape case was like a "manual for rape victims" as it goes into how a victim should respond in such cases.Justice S C Gupte issued a notice to Tejpal and posted for June 24 the appeal filed by the Goa government against the sessions court's order acquitting him in the case.The HC also directed the registry department to call for all papers and other documents related to the case from the sessions court."The judgement goes into how she (victim) responded. There are some observations on this. It is like a manual for rape victims," Justice Gupte said.The HC said the judgement also does not include the prosecution's case.It (judgement) directly goes into the gist of the case and then the victim's evidence and statements of witnesses, Justice Gupte said."There is a prima facie case to consider the leave (permission) to appeal (against the acquittal). Issue notice to the respondent (Tejpal) returnable on June 24," the high court said.The HC bench made the remarks when Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Goa government, read out portions from the sessions court's 527-page judgement which, while referring to the victim's behaviour (both during the alleged incident and afterwards), said the narrative was of "extreme implausibility"."The judgement says the victim, who is an intelligent woman and physically strong as she is a yoga instructor, could have prevented the sexual assault on her," Mehta said.On May 21, sessions Judge Kshama Joshi acquitted Tejpal, former editor-in-chief of the Tehelka magazine, in the case where he was accused of sexually assaulting his then colleague in a lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013 when they were attending an event.The trial court had in its judgement questioned the woman's conduct, saying she did not exhibit any kind of "normative behaviour" such as trauma and shock which a victim of sexual assault might plausibly show.Mehta on Wednesday pointed out to HC the observations made by the sessions court on how the victim met with eminent women lawyers like Indira Jaising and Rebecca John."What is wrong if the victim decided to get legal advice from women lawyers before approaching the court or police?" Mehta said.The court then noted that the judgement, while referring to Jaising, says the victim had saved her mobile number in her phone under the name 'Brahmastra'.Mehta said all this was irrelevant and hence, should be redacted."This will have a pan-India effect as everyone will read the judgement. In future, a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in taking legal advice. There is a portion in the judgement that these lawyers are feminists," he said, adding that even he is a feminist.The HC said it would go into all these issues on the next date of hearing."The judgement is already uploaded and is in the public realm. As per our earlier order, all references to the victim's identity have been redacted from the judgement," Justice Gupte said.Mehta further argued that the sessions court's judgement exhibits complete lack of sensitivity towards crimes against women and absolute lack of knowledge on this subject."We don't know if the victim was on trial or the accused. The entire judgement is as if the victim is on trial. Why should there be so much discussion on the victim's sexual history," he said.The sessions court's judge has been a mute spectator when the accused's lawyers brazenly went on to shame the victim, Mehta argued.

03-06-2021||India||IMA probe into deaths of doctors in Bihar points to multiple causes||Continuous work without any leave, administration of just one vaccine, lack of oxygen and ventilators during the peak of the second wave, poor infection control in hospitals and inferior quality of PPE kits and other protective gear are some of the reasons that have emerged to account for the increased fatality of doctors during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reasons emerged after an investigation carried out by a committee formed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar Branch.With nearly 100 doctors from Bihar succumbing to the infection during the second wave of the pandemic - more than three times the figure during the first wave last year - the IMA had on May 21 constituted an eight-member committee to investigate the reasons behind the high fatality rate of doctors. As part of the investigation, the committee distributed forms in a prescribed format to the family members of the deceased doctors to elicit their response on certain issues.IMA president elect Dr Shahjanand Prasad Singh said lack of oxygen and ventilator availability during the peak pandemic period also affected doctors, who worked without breaks both in the government set up and private set up at the call of chief minister Nitish Kumar and health minister Mangal Pandey. “Patna alone has over two hundred private hospitals, but only 90 could get oxygen supply. Some big hospitals also could not get oxygen supply. However, dedicated to their service and bound by the Hippocratic oath, they kept working. Sometimes social distancing also could not be maintained with patients, as the doctors kept their doors open. Sometimes the doctors also fumbled by not wearing masks properly or removing it,” he added.Singh said the doctors who had taken both the doses of vaccines were relatively safer, while those who could not take the second dose for whatever reasons and kept working despite risks seemed to fall prey to Covid-19. “There have also been instances of secondary infection or blood clots in chests. It is a fact that this time there was an explosion of cases within a short period, but the doctors and healthcare workers responded to the challenge with full devotion even at the cost of huge risk,” he added.Dr. Sunil Kumar, state secretary of the IMA and a member of the investigation committee, said the responses through the forms given to the family members of the deceased doctors had started arriving. “The reasons that are emerging point to continuous work, inferior quality of PPE kits and poor infection control, while several doctors have been found to have taken just one dose of vaccine. More responses are awaited. Once all the responses come, we will put the report in the public domain,” he added.Last year, a Central team visiting Bihar’s first dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) facility, Nalanda Medical College & Hospital (NMCH), in Patna, had flagged poor infection control in hospitals and underlined the need to provide a safer working environment to instil confidence among frontline healthcare workers, especially doctors. Later, training programmes were also organised for doctors and healthcare workers to improve safety for them.Dr Sunil Kumar, who had released a full list of deceased doctors from Bihar, said that the high fatality rate was a cause of concern and therefore, the IMA had decided to investigate the matter so that timely steps could be taken in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-probe-into-deaths-of-doctors-in-bihar-points-to-multiple-causes-101622664247113.html
03-06-2021||India||Govt to start course for O2 tanker drivers||The Covid-19 pandemic is set to add a new syllabus in the Union government’s skill development programme, with an agency that operates under the skill ministry preparing a training module for Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tanker drivers, with supply of medical oxygen increasing, and many states acquiring tankers.Documents available with HT show that the Chennai-based Logistics Sector Skill Council (LSSC), a society set up by the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, has prepared a module for this and already trained a few drivers.The society said a sub-committee has been constituted to focus on training liquid medical oxygen tanker drivers as it requires “niche skills”.Liquid oxygen is considered a hazardous material to transport (one reason why it can’t be transported by air), and requires drivers to undergo special training.Autonomous industry body All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers’ Association said it welcomes the move, but raised concerns about who will conduct the training.“To meet immediate requirement, hazardous material certified drivers (Haz-Mat Drivers) who are with Transporters who are Members of the Indian Chemical Council will be given a tutored online training module. Drivers will also be provided a structured apprenticeship wherein the driver will be assessed after undertaking two return trips (empty tanker),” a letter from LSSC to the top brass of the skill development ministry said.The proposal also includes physical training for such drivers at skill centres near LMO manufacturing premises by certified master trainers under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) format followed by apprenticeship.India has about 1,200 tankers that are presently deployed to ferry the LMO across the country. The country faced an acute oxygen crisis in April and May as Covid cases surged during the second wave.More oxygen tankers were pressed into action.The communication further said, as most of these vehicles are continuously on the move and hence need to be deployed with two drivers: “The drivers for LMO Tankers (cryogenic tankers) are especially trained and are in short supply. Covid pandemic is further fast depleting available human resource.”The skill development programme is an ambitious project of the Union government to train young people in several sectors such as construction, telecom, logistics, handicrafts, and jewellery. After the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, many migrant workers who returned home were encouraged to take up some of these training programmes.But this is the first time a training programme for oxygen tanker drivers has been planned.Under the skill mission, apprenticeship of commercial vehicle drivers is for six months.As the requirement is to have drivers available as soon as possible , the drivers will be deemed to have completed the apprenticeship once they are assessed as competent by the local skill centres and the employer.The documents also said that “there is a need to create a ‘bench strength’ of 2,400 drivers allowing for attrition due to Covid and other factors and it is intended to focus on the manufacturing locations of the oxygen plants. The driver distribution geography and the physical locations of the manufacturing plants.”“We, AIIGMA, supply 95% of all gases required in the country. It is good if the skills ministry decides to train drivers. But the key issue is who will be the trainers? Cryogenic tanker driving requires specialised training. AIIGMA with the support of PESO (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation) have been conducting training programmes and organising workshops on safe handling of liquid cryogenics and on safety while filling, storing and transporting compressed gas in cylinders,” said Saket Tiku, president of All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-start-course-for-o2-tanker-drivers-101622662767742.html
03-06-2021||India||Covid-19: Four steps that can help India avoid a third wave||India has avoided a potential superspreader event by cancelling the CBSE Class 12 exams, with the ISE board following suit, and other boards expected to do the same. This is the best possible outcome from the perspective of containing a pandemic and preventing a third wave.Unlike some experts, who are convinced a third wave is inevitable, I believe it is possible for India to avoid a third wave, but this is contingent on four actions.The first is on deciding when and where to ease lockdowns and restrictions on movement and activities that now cover most parts of the country. Some states and Union territories have already started the process; others have announced plans and deadlines for doing so; but none of these is based on the one parameter that matters.This is simply the proportion of the eligible population in a district that has been vaccinated. Ideally, this parameter should be read in consonance with the positivity rate. Some states and UTs are looking at the latter, but none appears to be basing its decision on the former. Given that the Union government no longer wants to be associated with lockdowns — the economic pain caused by the 68-day hard lockdown last year is still fresh in everyone’s memories — it is unlikely that either the health ministry, or the Indian Council of Medical Research, or any of the empowered groups dealing with the pandemic, will prescribe guidelines for this. Therefore, it is up to the states. I’d suggest a benchmark for opening up that is a combination of a positivity rate (it needs to be either declining or stable) of a maximum of 5% for at least two weeks, and a vaccine coverage (at least one dose) of a minimum of 20% of the current eligible population (those over the age of 18). As of Tuesday night, this proportion was 18.4% for the nation as a whole, which means there will be districts that have exceeded 20%, and those that have done far less.The second, which is related to the first, is to keep pushing ahead with the vaccine programme — in terms of approving more vaccines, lining up supplies, and enhancing delivery capacity — with the immediate target being coverage of at least 40% of the entire eligible population as soon as possible. Once India approves vaccines for those under the age of 18 years, the new target will be covering 40% of the entire population. Several countries have already done this. Israel has covered 62% of its entire population, the US, 51%, and Canada and the UK, 58%. Even Brazil has done 22%. India has covered around 13%. An honest effort to increase this number is required — not empty statements about administering 10 million vaccines a day from July or August (an unrealistic target given the supply situation).The third is to link the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions in place in a district to the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated. More than anything else, this will give states the framework to decide when they can open up for certain activities. For instance, I believe that at 40%, most activities, including physical schooling, can be allowed, with masking and social distancing. It may still not make sense to allow large religious, cultural, or social events (including weddings). As a corollary, states should also decide which activities they will curtail in case of a flare-up in infections.The fourth is to enhance surveillance, including sequencing enough viral genomes to identify potential threats from new variants of concern (new variants of the virus that are potentially more infectious), and acting on this knowledge. For instance, the UK, which, earlier this week celebrated zero deaths from Covid-19 for the first time since last March, is seeing an average of 3,300 cases a day, with almost 75% of these being caused by B.1.617.2 or Delta, the Sars-CoV-2 variant that was first spotted in India — and there are signs that the country may not end its lockdown on June 21 as it was scheduled to do on account of this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101622662242120.html
03-06-2021||India||BJP ups ante against ruling party, alleges malpractice in distribution of vaccines||The Bharatiya Janata Party has upped its ante against the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal with the leader of the opposition alleging that malpractices have surfaced in vaccine distribution in the state. BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari claimed that he had a word with the Union health minister and would be sending a report to him soon. “Deeply concerned about the malpractice started in distribution of vaccines in the state. After a conversation with the Hon. Union Minister of Health @drharshvardhan, I am noting the specific incidents and will be sending a report to him at the earliest as per his advice,” Adhikari tweeted. Although the TMC returned to power for the third consecutive time winning 213 out of the 292 assembly seats, where polls were held, Adhikari managed to defeat TMC chief Mamata Banerjee by 1956 votes from Nandigram in East Midnapore. The TMC, however, has hit back saying that Adhikari joined the BJP to evade arrest in scams and was now making false allegations against the TMC to survive. Till June 1, West Bengal distributed around 1.5 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has alleged on several occasions that the state government was not being allocated enough vaccines to undertake universal vaccination. Till now only around 12 lakh people in the age group 18 – 45 years have been vaccinated. “Where was he when the state was facing crisis of vaccines, medicines and oxygen? I never saw his tweets at that time. He joined the BJP to evade arrest in the Sharada and Narada case and is now tweeting to survive in the BJP. Hence his tweets have no value,” said Kunal Ghosh. Adhikari also met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar later during the day. He said that the state is yet to constitute the State Security Commission (SSC) as mandated by the Supreme Court. “The basic essence behind the formation of the SSC is to ensure that the state government doesn’t exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the state police. Various committees and commissions have recommended different models of the SSC. The leader of the opposition is a member in every model,” he said, while submitting a letter to the Governor. The BJP has been alleging that the Mamata Banerjee administration has been using the state police to implicate BJP workers in false cases. They are being harassed and put behind bars. “The BJP doesn’t have the right to make such baseless allegations against the TMC when they themselves are using central agencies against the TMC. While BJP leaders are roaming freely TMC leaders are being harassed. We have seen what the ECI did. The BJP is not being able to digest the defeat,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-ups-ante-against-ruling-party-alleges-malpractice-in-distribution-of-vaccines-101622662326950.html
03-06-2021||India||Centre plans to find partner to run vaccine complex||The Union government has informed Tamil Nadu that it intends to bring in a partner on its own to operationalise Integrated Vaccine Complex (IVC) at Chengalpattu. It was revealed in a letter written by chief minister MK Stalin to union health minister Harsh Vardhan. Stalin had previously written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for the IVC which was established by HLL Bio-Tech Ltd in 2012 under the union health ministry to be handed over to the state on a lease so it can find a private operator and begin producing Covid-19 vaccines from the facility. The state government also sent two representatives to Delhi to speed up the matter. “Subsequently, it has been informed to us that the union government intends to bring in a partner on its own to operate the plant,” Stalin said in his letter. “While I would like to reiterate our earlier request, I wish to highlight to you the urgency of the moment, given the need for immediate commencement of production. Irrespective of whether it is the union government or the state government which is to find the partner to operationalise the plant, the need of the hour is to ensure that there is absolutely no further delay in the process.” The letter dated June 1 was released on June 2. The chief minister, in the letter, also raised the issue of vaccine shortage as the state’s stocks were over by June 1 and inoculation was to be suspended but the Centre delivered fresh stocks of 4.2 lakh doses by Wednesday evening. Stalin requested the union government to prioritise Tamil Nadu and frontload the June’s supplies from the first week itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-to-find-partner-to-run-vaccine-complex-101622662146333.html
03-06-2021||India||Vaccine policy for 18-45 ‘arbitrary, irrational’: SC||The Union government’s coronavirus vaccination policy that has put the onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 years age group entirely on states and private hospitals is “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday, ordering the Union government to submit within two weeks “all relevant documents and file notings” that reflect how the strategy came about.Picking holes in the national vaccination policy, the top court held that the liberalised policy introduced on May 1 “conflicts with the constitutional balance of responsibilities between the Centre and states”.“…due to the importance of vaccinating individuals in the 18-44 age group, the policy of the central government for conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first 2 phases, and replacing it with paid vaccination by the State/UT Governments and private hospitals for the persons between 18-44 years, is, prima facie, arbitrary and irrational,” said the order by the bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud.The issue has also sparked a row between some states and the Union government. States such as Delhi and West Bengal have said that they have been left to fend for themselves to secure doses for the under-45 age group, alluding to Centre’s stand that doses can directly be bought from vaccine makers also based outside of India. Several state governments opened bids for purchase orders, but the response has been muted with most key vaccine makers saying they deal only with national governments.The bench, which also included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, asked the Union government to explain how ₹35,000 crore, earmarked for procuring vaccines in the Union Budget for 2021-2022, have been spent so far and why they could not be utilised for vaccinating persons in the 18-45 age group.It called on the Centre to submit an affidavit within two weeks with details of percentage of people vaccinated (single dose and double dose) as against all eligible people in rural and urban areas; an outline for how and when the Centre seeks to vaccinate the remaining population; complete data on purchase history, orders placed and projected dates of supplies, as well as the steps being taken to ensure drug availability for mucormycosis.The court further requisitioned copies of all relevant documents and file noting from the government, “reflecting its thinking and culminating in the vaccination policy”.States and UTs have also been directed to clarify through affidavits before the next date of hearing on June 30 if they have decided to vaccinate their population for free.The court, which noted submissions may be the Union government on May 9, said that if the Union government’s “unique monopolistic buyer position” was the only reason for it to be receiving doses at a lower price, it was important for the so-called liberalised vaccination policy to be examined under Article 14 of the Constitution since “it could place severe burdens, particularly on States/UTs suffering from financial distress”.Article 14 guarantees the fundamental right to equality in India.The order came following a hearing on Monday in a suo motu (on its own) case initiated by the top court. The bench began its 32-page order by rejecting the Union government’s contention that any “overzealous judicial intervention” by the Supreme Court in the vaccination policy may lead to unintended circumstances.“Our Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies. Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform,” said the bench.The Union government effected significant changes to its Covid-19 vaccination protocol from May 1 in a set of decisions it called the liberalised vaccination policy. This change paved for people in the 18-45 age group to get doses, as long as these shots were acquired directly by the states or private hospitals from the manufacturers.The government decided the doses will be split in a ratio of 50:25:25 between the Centre, states/UTs, and private hospitals. While the Centre is paying manufacturers ₹150 per dose for Covishield, states are buying it for ₹300 a dose. Similar disparity in prices apply to Covaxin as wellThe order went into what it said were several issues with the government’s vaccination policy and directed the Centre “to undertake a fresh review of its vaccination policy” since vaccination of the nation’s entire eligible population, it emphasised, “is the singular most important task in effectively combating the Covid-19 pandemic in the long run”.The number of issues regarding the procurement process, distribution and availability of vaccines must be clarified and the government must disclose a roadmap on how it planned to vaccinate all eligible persons by the year-end, the order said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta on Monday said all eligible people will be given doses by December 31.Some of the issues the bench raised were those relating to equity of access. “Marginalised sections of the society would bear the brunt of the accessibility barrier” under the policy since it exclusively relied on a digital platform (Co-WIN) for registration and therefore, may cause “serious implications on the fundamental right to equality and the right to health of people”.“…the present system of allowing only digital registration and booking of appointment on CoWIN, coupled with the current scarcity of vaccines, will ultimately ensure that initially all vaccines, whether free or paid, are first availed by the economically privileged sections of the society,” it said.The court also asked why inoculation was open for 18-45 group in the third phase on a payment basis even though the experience of the second Covid-19 wave showed people of this age group were also affected.It also asked the Centre to clarify the rationale behind equal apportionment of vaccines between states and private hospitals by specifying whether there was any mechanism to oversee how the hospitals were administering the jabs, in addition to ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines across sections of the society.The bench was further not convinced by the Centre’s justification that vaccine prices were allowed to be more for states and private hospitals in order to spur competition that would attract more private manufacturers and eventually lower prices.“The liberalised vaccination policy may not be able to yield the desired results of spurring competitive prices and higher quantities of vaccines... Prima facie, the only room for negotiation with the two vaccine manufacturers was on price and quantity, both of which have been pre-fixed by the central government. This casts serious doubts on UoI’s justification for enabling higher prices as a competitive measure,” said the court.It asked why the Centre did not procure 100% vaccines when large purchase orders for vaccines helped them get vaccines at lower prices.Nudging the Centre to utilise its position as the monopolistic buyer in the market and pass down the benefit to all persons in the country, the court said that the “avoidable expense” due to the differential pricing will eventually hurt the welfare of individuals residing within those states and UTs.About the pricing of the vaccine, the court questioned the Centre for intervening in pre-fixing procurement prices and quantities for states and private hospitals but choosing not to impose statutory price ceilings.It asked the government to mention in its affidavit a comparison between the prices of vaccines being made available in India, to their prices internationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-policy-for-18-45-arbitrary-irrational-sc-101622661079374.html
03-06-2021||India||K’taka minister performs last rites of 560 unclaimed Covid victims||Bengaluru: Karnataka revenue minister R Ashok on Wednesday performed the last rites and immersed the ashes of the over 500 persons who died due to Covid-19 infection. These are among the 1,400 persons whose ashes remain unclaimed at various crematoriums in the state. Revenue department officials said that in most of the cases, despite repeated pleas from the concerned officials, family members refused to collect the bodies. Following this, the government took a decision to perform the last rites of these unclaimed ashes. “Today, we are immersing ashes in the Cauvery river. It is considered holy, and it will help reach heaven. 560 persons’ ashes will be immersed in Cauvery today. The families of those who died, for various reasons, could not collect the ashes,” said the minister. He further added that families of the deceased are also going through a tough time, especially when it is about performing the last rites, so the government decided to step in. “They are going through difficult times. The government is sharing the pain with them and trying to be a part of the family. It is an emotional issue for us all, brothers and sisters of Karnataka people. It is my duty as a revenue minister to do this,” he added. The minister also said that distressing scenes emerging from north India of how bodies are being disposed played a major role in his action. “We are seeing in the Ganga, thousands of bodies of those who died in Covid time,” he said. “The birds are eating ...This is a shame to us. So, we decided to give a respectful farewell to all the deceased who lost their life to Covid. That is my duty.” Compared to the first wave of Covid-19, in the second wave, the state reported a more than 100% increase in the number of deaths due to the pandemic. A comparison of the data in the first wave between August 1 and September 30, 2020, and the second wave from April 1 to May 27, 2021, the state reported 6,551 and 14,167 deaths respectively.The increase in the number of deaths was so high that four out of the 13 electronic crematoriums broke down as they were running overtime. Since most of the crematoriums were running well beyond their capacity, the government had to start four open-air crematoriums as well. Giridhar Babu, head of epidemiology department at the Public Health Foundation of India and member of state Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19 said that change between the first and second wave shows that the medical facilities in the state were overwhelmed by the surge in cases, which could have contributed to the higher number of deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-minister-performs-last-rites-of-560-unclaimed-covid-victims-101622661486326.html
03-06-2021||India||BSY chairs meet with task force on Covid third wave||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday held the first meeting of the newly formed taskforce, constituted to increase preparedness for the imminent third wave of Covid-19 infections expected by the end of the year.The meeting of the newly constituted task force comprising 13 members and headed by noted cardiologist Dr Deviprasad Shetty, was held in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Though still in the grip of the ongoing second wave of infections, warnings of which the state government is accused of ignoring, the Yediyurappa-led government is now trying to minimise or contain the impact of the subsequent third wave by increasing preparedness.“Preventive measures to be taken, the infrastructure and treatment facilities required, human resource, medicine etc were discussed during the meeting,” a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) stated.The statement added that a detailed report on the subject by the newly formed taskforce would be submitted within a week’s time.“The government is making all efforts to provide the required infrastructure and drugs to hospitals in its battle against the pandemic and is also gearing up to face the probable third wave,” Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, the deputy chief minister of Karnataka and head of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce said in a statement.The third wave, experts and others said, would make youngsters and those who are not vaccinated particularly vulnerable.Taking note of the second wave of infections, that turned out to be more transmissible and severe, the government is now improving on its existing healthcare infrastructure. The state has proposed to increase more pediatric care and other facilities to house and treat children who may get infected with the Covid-19.According to the existing rules, persons below the age group of 18 are not yet eligible for vaccinations.The vaccination drive in Karnataka, among other states in the country, has stagnated or declined due to shortage of vaccines. However, at least 50% of all vaccination being administered in Bengaluru, the biggest city of Karnataka, is being done by private healthcare providers, Hindustan Times reported on Monday.Karnataka is yet to decide on whether to relax or lift the ongoing lockdown restrictions in the state which is in effect till at least June 7.Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs on Wednesday said that a decision on the lockdown would be taken on June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-chairs-meet-with-task-force-on-covid-third-wave-101622661426221.html
03-06-2021||India||Liquor sales bring cheer to K’taka||Bengaluru: The excise duty on sale of liquor has become one of the steadiest sources of capital inflows for Karnataka, giving it funds not just for developmental activities but also to pay the bills during the hardships heaped on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has earned ₹1,445.03 crore in the form of excise duty levied on sale of liquor in May, which is marginally lower than ₹2,205.66 crore a month ago, according to data from the state’s excise department. Though the state has recorded a decline in collection from April, officials said the difference will be made up in the coming months. “We will meet revenue targets this year as well,” said one senior government official, requesting not to be named. With one of the more liberal policies for sale of liquor in the country, the state has reported decline in excise revenue collection only once in 1977-78, when the collection of ₹52.24 crore was ₹4 lakh less than the previous year. In 1967-68, Karnataka recorded ₹7.11 crore in excise duty collection, data shows. Despite the complete lockdown for nearly two months last year (April and May 2020), Karnataka was able to not just meet its annual target of ₹22,700 crore but exceeded the same by around ₹300 crore, bringing in much needed revenues for the state, which is among the worst-hit regions due to Covid-19. Excise has assumed more importance in recent years after the onset of the goods and services tax (GST) regime, in which states are left with very few avenues of direct income like cess from petrol and diesel, professional tax, stamps and registration and transport department among others. With Karnataka’s share of central taxes being cut sharply under the 15th Finance Commission, the dependence on excise has increased, according to people aware of the developments. The revenue collection target for the transport department fell short of the target of ₹7,115 crore in 2020-21 while the revenue goal for 2021-22 has been fixed at ₹7,515 crore, according to the budget document. Likewise, revenue collection for stamps and registration too fell in 2020-21, failing to reach its target of ₹12,655 crore, prompting the government to retain the same goal for the current fiscal as well. Revenue collection target for commercial taxes department for 2021-22 is fixed at ₹76,473 crore. While collections have improved in the state with the help of revenues from excise, the same may not hold true for sales of liquor and beer, retailers said. Karnataka increased duty on excise twice last year, ranging between 17% and 25%, which brought in higher revenue, they added. The government has fixed a revenue target of ₹24,580 crore for 2021-22, as presented in the budget document by chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government. The total sales of Indian Made Liquor or IML in May was 4.36 million carton boxes (CBs), registering a 1.78% dip, as against 5.59 million CBs in April. Meanwhile, beer registered a 37.59% decline with sales of 767,000 CBs in May as against 2.57 million CBs in April, data from the excise department shows. “The increase in excise duty brings in more revenues for the state but sales are down for most of us,” said Lokesh, president of the Bengaluru Wine Merchants Association. He said that information, or misinformation, that people should not consume alcohol for a month after getting vaccinated, economic difficulties and loss of livelihoods during the Covid-induced lockdown have weighed on the industry. According to industry insiders, most of the annual renewal of permits is done in June. The industry is now hoping for some respite in the form of any concessions, they said. Last year, the department had extended the date of renewal and a provision to pay licence fee in instalments and the same is expected this time too, the official cited above said. “The timing for opening liquor shops is now from 6am to 10 am. So not many people come this early as the same timing applies to other essentials shops as well,” said Govindaraj Hegade, secretary of the Federation of Wine Merchants Association. Liquor sales work for standalone shops but revenue is hard to come by for restaurants and breweries, whose margins come from dine-in customers. “Our business is less than 10% of what it normally is. We are trying to pay our staff and keep our kitchens running,” said the owner of a Bengaluru-based microbrewery, requesting not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-sales-bring-cheer-to-ktaka-101622661367551.html
03-06-2021||India||Relations can’t be normal till Article 370 restored: Imran Khan||Relations between Pakistan and India cannot be normalised till New Delhi rolls back its decision of August 2019 to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday. Addressing a joint press interaction with Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon in Islamabad, Khan said the full potential of the region can be achieved only if the situation in Afghanistan stabilises and there are better ties between Pakistan and India. Following back-channel contacts facilitated by countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, the militaries of India and Pakistan recommitted themselves to the 2009 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. However, efforts initiated by Khan’s government to resume normal trade ties fell through because of opposition to the move within his government. “The challenge for Pakistan is that the full potential of the region will be realised if there is peace in the region,” Khan told the joint media interaction, speaking in Urdu. Referring to Pakistan’s strained relations with India, he said, “Unfortunately, since their unilateral decision on Kashmir on August 5, 2019, and because of the violation of international laws and UN Security Council resolutions, it is very difficult for us to normalise trade with [India] because it will be a betrayal of the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people.” He added, “So till India reverses [these steps], our relations can’t improve.” His remarks were a reiteration of his recent comments that Pakistan can’t normalise ties with India until it reverses its 2019 decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and to split the state into two union territories. India has dismissed Pakistan’s demands as interference in its internal affairs.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s latest remarks.Khan further said, “If the relations don’t improve, then it will be a loss for India, Pakistan and the whole of Central Asia because the whole region can be connected.” Noting that the Central Asian states can access Pakistan’s Gwadar port for trade, he said, “But if our ties improve [with India], China is one side and Pakistan is in a pivotal position to connect the whole region. But this is all dependent on India rolling back the unilateral steps they took in Kashmir on August 5, 2019. Till they move back, the whole matter is stuck here.” Khan said he and Rahmon had discussed trade and investment and challenges such as climate change and the security situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of the drawdown of US forces. “We need peace in Afghanistan. If the US leaves without a political settlement, like when the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, the resulting situation could lead to losses for Pakistan and Tajikistan. It could affect connectivity and trade and we [Pakistan and Tajikistan] fear that terrorism could increase,” he added. Pakistan and Tajikistan want a political settlement in Afghanistan that leads to stability and a government formed through consensus, and both countries will work with other nations for such a settlement, Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relations-can-t-be-normal-till-article-370-restored-imran-khan-101622661126903.html
03-06-2021||India||New IT rules don’t apply to search engine: Google||New Delhi: American technology giant Google told the Delhi high court on Wednesday that India’s new IT rules for social media companies don’t apply to its search service since it cannot be classified in the way Twitter or Facebook are. The submission was made as part of the company’s challenge to an April 20 order by a single-judge bench of the high court, which classified Google as a “social media intermediary” or a “significant social media intermediary” while hearing a request by a woman to take down links to pornographic websites where her images had been posted.Senior counsel Harish Salve told a two-judge bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that the search engine has been “mischaracterised”, and that it differed from social media services Google since the function of a search engine is to gather existing information available or published or hosted by independent, third-party websites. “Such a process of crawling and indexing is done in a passive and automated manner with no human intervention or user interaction,” the company told the court. Rules under the Information Technology Act give social media companies the legal prerogative to moderate content in good faith, and they have legal immunity for these decisions as long as they adhere to certain conditions – such as following takedown orders. The high court on April 20 said that if Google, like other social media intermediaries, failed to take action, it was liable to lose the exemption from liability. In that case, a woman moved court for directions to Google to remove links to pornography websites to which her images had been uploaded by some people.The IT rules were amended and notified on February 25, which add new compliance requirements for social media companies such as appointing compliance officers and identifying the originator of content within 36 hours. Google said it will not be able to comply with such provisions.“The impugned direction is impossible for a search engine to comply with given its automated and passive functioning. It also violates the settled principle that no proactive monitoring can be directed as it has a chilling effect on free speech and may result in over-blocking of even content that is otherwise legitimate,” the plea said.The company said that while it was an intermediary as defined by the Information Technology Act 2000’s section 2(1)(w), it was not a “social media intermediary” or “a significant social media intermediary” as laid down in IT rules, 2021. “The single judge has misinterpreted and misapplied the New Rules 2021 to the appellant’s search engine. Additionally, the single judge has conflated various sections of the IT Act and separate rules prescribed thereunder and has passed template orders combining all such offences and provisions, which is bad in law,” Google said in its plea.The court has asked the central government to clarify its stand on the internet giant’s contention by July 25. It declined Google’s requests to pass an order halting any possible coercive actions, saying the matter would be finally heard on July 25. Google CEO Sundar Pichai last month said local teams were studying the new rules and it is committed to work with local laws. It has already agreed to comply with the new IT rules for “aggregators”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-it-rules-don-t-apply-to-search-engine-google-101622661068302.html
03-06-2021||India||Arrest should be last option for police: Allahabad HC||Prayagraj: Holding that indiscriminate arrests are a gross violation of human rights, the Allahabad high court has held that arrest should be the last option for the police, and it should be restricted to those exceptional cases where it is imperative or custodial interrogation is required. While granting anticipatory bail to one Jugendra Singh, a police constable, on May 28, Justice Siddharth cited a 1994 case — Joginder Kumar vs State of Uttar Pradesh — in which the Supreme Court had referred to a National Police Commission report that said arrest is a chief source of corruption in the police. The report suggested that, by and large, nearly 60% of the arrests were either unnecessary or unjustified and that such unjustified police action accounted for 43.2% of jail expenditure. “Personal liberty is a very precious Fundamental Right and it should be curtailed only when it becomes imperative. According to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the arrest of an accused should be made,” the apex court had said in the 1994 case. In the present case, constable Jugendra Singh was accused of taking money from passing trucks. His counsel submitted that there was no forensic report establishing this, nor was any money seized from him. Investigation is still underway, and the applicant apprehends that he may be arrested, Singh’s counsel said. But the state’s counsel said the allegations being serious, Singh shouldn’t get anticipatory bail. “The apprehension of the applicant is not founded on any material on record. Only on the basis of imaginary fear, anticipatory bail cannot be granted,” the state counsel added.However, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusation and applicant’s antecedents, and also the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the court accepted that Singh was entitled to anticipatory bail for a limited period, considering the exception made by the Supreme Court in the 2020 case of Sushila Aggarwal vs State (NCT of Delhi). Jugendra Singh was booked under Sections 7/13 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 at Delhi Gate police station in Aligarh district, Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-should-be-last-option-for-police-allahabad-hc-101622660947527.html
03-06-2021||India||Choksi to face illegal entry charges: Court||A top Caribbean court on Wednesday ordered fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi to face charges of illegally entering Dominica, and adjourned till Thursday a petition filed by the businessman’s lawyers challenging his detention in the island.The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court said that Choksi -- who mysteriously vanished from Antigua on May 23 before being detained three days later in Dominica, roughly 100 nautical miles away – should be brought from jail to a Dominican magistrate court to respond to the charges by the Dominica government.The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition by Choksi’s lawyers, who argued that he was illegally abducted from Antigua, where he is a citizen, and physically tortured.The lawyers told the court that Choksi was a citizen of Antigua, had family there, and was currently fighting two cases pertaining to his extradition and revocation of citizenship, so he should be repatriated to the island.Judge Bernie Stephenson heard the matter through video-conferencing with the 62-year-old businessman attending virtually from the hospital where he was admitted recently.During the roughly three-hour hearing, Choksi’s lawyers said that Dominica Police violated the island’s law of producing a person in court within 72 hours of charging them with a crime.The court ordered Choksi be immediately produced before a magistrate’s court, where a separate trial is likely to commence if he doesn’t plead guilty to the charges. The Dominican magistrate is expected to hear the matter in the early hours of Thursday, India time.People familiar with developments said the government of India was not mentioned in court on Wednesday.“Our stand that Mehul Choksi was in illegal detention as he was required to be produced within 72 hours before the magistrate and was not so produced, has been vindicated; in order to remedy this, he has been asked to be produced before the magistrate,” said Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal.“This establishes illegal detention of Mehul Choksi as pleaded by the defence. Contrary to numerous media reports, there was no discussion regarding government of India,” he added.In the hearing, the prosecution rejected Choksi’s submissions and argued the habeas corpus petition did not stand as he had illegally entered the country and was subsequently detained.The Indian government has been pushing to deport Choksi, wanted on ₹13,500 crore bank fraud case, to India because he doesn’t enjoy citizenship privileges in Dominica. An Indian team, including two officers from Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has reached the island to apprise local authorities of the “strong evidence” against Choksi and the need for him to face trial in India.But legal experts say the repatriation process could be long and legally complicated.They said that before any deportation plea to India was decided, Dominican authorities will have to present their view. Last week, the Dominican interior ministry had said that Choksi will be sent back to Antigua after ascertaining his citizenship details.For India to seek direct deportation, documents will have to be filed separately through a local counsel, possibly leading to long hearings as Choksi’s legal team will be given time to respond, the experts said. This, they added, might mean that Choksi’s stay in Dominica could be extended by few weeks.The controversy around Choksi’s deportation also triggered a political row in the neighbouring island nations.Antigua & Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne on Tuesday denied his government’s involvement in Choksi’s disappearance and alleged that the opposition party United Progressive Party (UPP) was funded by the India-born businessman. UPP accused Browne of disregarding the law and Choksi’s constitutional and legal protection in Antigua.In Dominica, leader of opposition Lennox Linton said his party sought a probe and alleged that Choksi was abducted at the behest of PM Roosevelt Skerrit. A day later, local media alleged that Linton had received a bribe from Choksi’s brother Chetan, a charge denied by the Opposition leader on Wednesday.But the businessman’s wife, Priti Choksi, rejected the charges being hurled at her husband and said he was treated as a criminal in Antigua because of statements by Browne.“After seeing the pictures of his torture, don’t you think we have every right to fear for his life if he is sent to India?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-to-face-illegal-entry-charges-court-101622660161920.html
03-06-2021||India||Palestine ‘concerned’ over India’s abstention during vote at UNHRC||New Delhi: Amid a perceptible shift in India’s Middle East policy, Palestine has expressed concern at India’s abstention during a vote at the UN Human Rights Council that resulted in the setting up of an inquiry into rights violations during the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Palestine’s concerns were conveyed by foreign minister Riad Malki in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on May 30. The letter, accessed by HT, stated that India’s abstention during the vote on May 27 “stifles the important work of Human Rights Council at advancing human rights for all peoples, including those of the Palestinian people”. The development comes against the backdrop of India dropping its traditional reference to support for the “just Palestinian cause” in at least three recent statements at the UN Security Council, General Assembly, and Human Rights Council. The statements, however, retained the usual reference to a two-state solution to be achieved through direct negotiations to ensure lasting peace between the people of Israel and Palestine. Malki’s unusually strongly worded letter stated: “I write to express our concern by the position taken by Republic of India in the Human Rights Council 30th special session of 27 May 2021, on the seminal resolution [titled] ‘Ensuring respect for international human rights law and humanitarian law in Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel’.” It added, “Republic of India missed an opportunity to join the international community at this turning point, both crucial and long overdue, on the path to accountability, justice, and peace.” Following the adoption of the resolution, presented by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Palestinian delegation, by 24 votes, the Human Rights Council established an international commission of inquiry into “violations of international humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law” during the Israel-Hamas conflict. The move was rejected by Israel. India, Brazil, France, Italy and Nepal were among the 14 countries that abstained during the vote. It was not immediately clear whether Malki wrote similar letters to his counterparts in other countries that abstained. Malki further said in the letter that the resolution was “not an aberration to the Human Rights Council”, and it was the “by-product of extensive multilateral consultations” and “thorough investigations into and reporting on Israel’s grave violations by States, United Nations experts, Human Rights Treaty bodies, and international organisations”. He added that the Palestinian people had been “excluded from the applicability of the universal and the indispensable principle of accountability, a prerequisite to justice and peace”. Malki contended that the root causes of injustice suffered by the Palestinian people include “decades-long dispossession, displacement, colonisation, oppression...and the denial and violation of their every human right by Israel”. Unless these root causes are addressed, Malki wrote, the “situation will not only remain volatile, but will continue deteriorating with far-reaching and grave repercussions”. Palestine is ready to “engage positively and seriously to achieve this goal and realize peace in the region”, he added. In its latest statement at the UN Security Council on May 27, India said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has “arrested the sharp deterioration of the security situation” though the “situation continues to be fragile”. India reiterated its call for all parties to observe “maximum restraint and avoid acts of violence, provocation, incitement and destruction” and also underlined the need to respect the historic status quo in Jerusalem.While focusing on rehabilitation and reconstruction in Gaza, India called for resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine for a two-state solution. “The absence of direct and meaningful negotiations between the two parties has only widened the trust deficit, which, in turn, increases the chances for similar escalations in the future,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palestine-concerned-over-india-s-abstention-during-vote-at-unhrc-101622660466812.html
03-06-2021||India||Wife says Choksi being treated as a criminal because of Antigua PM||Priti Choksi, the wife of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi, has said that her husband is treated as a criminal in Antigua because of statements made by prime minister Gaston Browne in the past, and that she fears for his life if he is sent back to India.Terming her husband’s custody in Dominica as a “hostage situation”, she said the Antiguan government should be focusing on bringing its citizen back.Both jewellers involved in the fraud on Punjab National Bank, Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, moved their families outside India and then made good their own escape. Nirav Modi is currently fighting extradition proceedings in the UK.“We, as a family, are deeply anguished by PM Gaston Browne’s statements. My husband is treated as a criminal here (Antigua) because of the statements that Mr Gaston Browne has made in the past of calling him a ‘crook’, etc.; and on what basis, I have no idea. A man who was trying to live his life quietly is being targeted in this manner,” Priti told HT over the phone from Saint John’s.Explaining the sequence of events on May 23, she said Choksi went to meet Barbara Jarabica for dinner.“When he reached her house to pick her up, she asked him to come inside, saying she wanted to show him something. It was the day time so my husband went inside. As soon as he entered, he was accosted by men with Indian and Antiguan accents; they tased him, gagged his mouth, tied him in a wheelchair; and put him in a boat. Then he was transferred to another boat. His last seen image is from 5.11pm on Sunday (and his phone was last on at 5.16 pm,” she said, adding that all the CCTV cameras at Jolly Harbour were not working at that time.Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said the woman was known to the Choksi family, and alleged she was planted to abduct him. PM Browne alleged Choksi had gone to Dominica with his “girlfriend”.Choksi was reported missing on May 23, and was taken into custody by police in Dominica two days later. His lawyers have filed a habeas corpus petition in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court at Roseau. Indian government officials have reached there to seek his deportation.Apart from presenting evidence on Choksi’s role in the fraud and money laundering, the Indian argument is expected to revolve around whether he continues to be an Indian citizen.Priti Choksi said: “Indian constitution says that the moment you take citizenship of another country, you cease to be Indian citizen. And his Indian passport was suspended in February...” “After seeing the pictures of his torture, don’t you think we have every right to fear for his life if he is sent to India?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-says-choksi-being-treated-as-a-criminal-because-of-antigua-pm-101622659926741.html
03-06-2021||India||SC plea seeks scrapping of state board exams too||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court for cancellation of the State Board examinations as amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.The petition was filed on Tuesday by child rights activist Anubha Shrivastava Sahai and seven others on behalf of students from different states and Union territories.In their plea, the petitioners told the apex court that more than 10 million students studying in Class 12 in state boards across the country are uncertain about their future as the respective state boards have postponed the decision to conduct or scrap the exams.At the time of filing the petition, the decision of the Centre to cancel this year’s Class 12 board examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) had not been taken.At a meeting on Tuesday chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was decided to call off the Class 12 exams conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in view of the raging pandemic. Later, CISCE also decided to cancel the Class 12 board examinations this year.With the top court expected to take up on Thursday, a petition filed by advocate Mamta Sharma to cancel Class 12 CBSE and CISCE Boards, now stands cancelled. The petitioners seeking cancellation of state board exams have decided to appear during the proceedings and mention the matter to the court for urgent hearing. Advocate Shashibhushan P Adgaonkar who will represent the eight petitioners in court said, “Our petition is ready for hearing but has not been listed yet. I have received instructions to mention the matter on Thursday when the hearing on the plea for cancellation of CBSE and CISCE examinations is taken up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-plea-seeks-scrapping-of-state-board-exams-too-101622659866111.html
03-06-2021||India||BJP leaders call for putting up united front ahead of UP polls||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BL Santhosh stressed on the importance of unity as he completed a three-day feedback session with the Uttar Pradesh government and party, people aware of developments said on Wednesday, roughly nine months before India’s most populous state goes to the polls.Senior leaders aware of developments said Santhosh, who is BJP’s general secretary (organisation), advised the party and government to project a united front and take the achievements of the Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath governments to the people.The visit by Santhosh and BJP’s national vice president Radha Mohan Singh, which began on May 31, had triggered speculation of a rejig in the organisational structure. But a senior party leader said changes in the party structure were unlikely and any possible additions to the cabinet would be carried out only with chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s inputs.The feedback sessions occurred amid mounting criticism of the state government’s handling of the second wave of Covid cases with Opposition parties and even BJP lawmakers pointing out lapses. The state is scheduled to go to the polls in the first half of 2022.The senior leader quoted above said the priority for the party and government right now was to address problems, provide healthcare facilities and assuage public anger. “Now is not the time to join issue or give explanations,” the leader said.Santhosh had also tweeted praise of Adityanath’s handling of the Covid crisis on Tuesday. “I haven’t seen such feedback sessions being held anywhere,” an old party leader said. Before leaving for Delhi, Singh also described the state government’s handling of the Covid situation as “unparalleled”.“The message of the central BJP leadership is clear. We can’t go into the elections looking like a divided house. That is the spirit behind those two tweets - first one praising Yogiji’s handling of the Covid crisis and then the second one praising him for vaccinating parents of children below 12 years,” said a second senior BJP leader. “In one of the meetings, when told that there was an issue of co-ordination, Santhoshji made it clear that it was not the time to play the blame game,” the second leader added.A third BJP leader said with about nine months to go for assembly polls, major shake-ups were unlikely. “Maybe some strategic shifts might happen to streamline issues that may have come up during the three-day feedback sessions. But all stakeholders to the decision would be on board,” the leader said.On Wednesday, Santhosh met mostly Lucknow-based leaders, including law minister Brijesh Pathak and Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore.Both Pathak and Kishore were among the first to flag concern when the second wave was at its peak. Pathak slammed officials while Kishore advised the government to prioritise Covid management over panchayat polls.“It was an introductory meeting,” Kishore said while Pathak said the discussions centered on how to take the poutreach mission forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-call-for-putting-up-united-front-ahead-of-u-p-polls-101622659806140.html

Police and security forces have cordoned the area and massive search operation has been launched to nab the assailants,” the senior officer said.BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur condemned the killing of party leader. “Such attacks won’t stop BJP leaders from serving the people. Attacking unarmed people is no bravery and that police must track down the culprits and punish them accordingly,” said Thakur.People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone tweeted, “Yet again gunmen attack a non-combatant. This gun is a curse. Just ponder. Since the day this menace came into Kashmir. What have we seen. In a nut shell total disempowerment of the Kashmiri. Dear gunmen. Can u please go back where u came from. We have had enough.”Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the incident. “Shocked to hear that BJP leader Rakesh Pandit has been shot dead by militants. These senseless acts of violence have brought only misery to J&K. My condolences to the family & may his soul rest in peace,” Mufti said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-bjp-leader-rakesh-pandita-killed-by-terrorists-in-j-k-police-101622659687840.html
03-06-2021||India||Odisha suffered losses worth ₹610 crore due to Cyclone Yaas||Odisha suffered losses worth ₹610 crore including ₹520 crore of government property after Cyclone Yaas swept through Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Mayurbhanj districts though it made landfall with much less force than predicted.A review meeting chaired by CM Naveen Patnaik this evening estimated that over 6 million people in 11,000 villages were affected by the cyclone. Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said that 150 villages were marooned due to the cyclone apart from inundation of several acres of agricultural land by saline water from a tidal surge.The storm accompanied by rains and a wind speed of 130-140 km per hour barrelled through coastal Odisha leaving behind a trail of destruction. Thousands of farmers in the coastal districts of Balasore, Bhadrak and Kendrapara had their crops ruined by tidal inundation and flood.Mohapatra said the Panchayati Raj department suffered the maximum loss of ₹277 crore followed by ₹150 crore of the energy department, ₹108 crore of the water resources department and ₹75 crore of the rural development department. At least 30 lakh electricity consumers were affected post Cyclone Yaas. However, 99.9 per cent affected consumers have had their connection restored.Last week, PM Modi had sanctioned an immediate assistance of ₹500 crore for Odisha after conducting an aerial tour of the affected regions. Odisha had made two long-term demands --- disaster-resilient power system and a disaster-resilient coastal protection system to deal with storm surges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-suffered-losses-worth-rs-610-crore-due-to-cyclone-yaas-101622659686724.html
03-06-2021||India||Patnaik pushes for consensus on jabs||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday called for a consensus between states on asking the Centre to procure and distribute Covid-19 vaccines, and pointed out that global tenders being floated directly by the states were not yielding results.Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn a letter to his counterparts, which comes amid accusations from some states that the Centre has left them to fend for themselves as vaccine supplies are unable to match demand or capacity, Patnaik said that while administrating vaccines must be decentralised, procurement should not be.“Many states have floated global tenders for vaccine procurement,” Patnaik said in the letter addressed to the chief ministers of all Indian states. But, he added, global vaccine manufacturers are looking to the Union government for clearances and assurances, and are unwilling to get into supply contracts with the state governments. Meanwhile, he added, “...domestic vaccine manufacturers are having supply constraints and are not able to commit required supplies.” Patnaik said his government wants all states to reach a consensus for the early resolution of the problem.Chief ministers Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi), Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), Pinarayi Vijayan (Kerala), and Hemant Soren (Jharkhand) are among the CMs who have raised concerns over the Centre’s vaccine procurement policy.India administered an average of 1.93 million doses a day in May, even as most states ran out of supplies by the fourth week of the month for certain groups of recipients, primarily those between 18 and 45 years of age. Though at least 10 states have issued global tenders over the past month, none of them have been able to get doses so far.Patnaik called the pandemic the greatest challenge the country has faced since Independence, and added that states should set aside political differences and come together.“Especially, after the second wave, people are very scared about future waves and variants...” Patnaik said.Responding to criticism that the Centre was not doing enough to help states procure Covid-19 vaccines, VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, in a statement last week said, “The Central government has remained engaged continuously with all the major international vaccine manufacturers right from mid-2020. However, it is not that their vaccines are available in free supply...”Till Tuesday, Odisha had fully vaccinated 89% of its health care workers, 95% of its frontline workers and around 9% of its population above the age of 45 years.However, it has been able to give first dose to only about 0.038 % of its population in the age group of 18-45 years.Vaccine expert Dr Epari Venkat Rao in Bhubaneswar’s SUM Hospital said though Odisha’s efficiency rate in vaccine was good, it should not be a criteria in distribution. “Population and sub-population that is vulnerable should be the criteria...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patnaik-writes-to-states-pushes-for-consensus-on-jabs-101622659626102.html
03-06-2021||India||6 states cancel Class 12 exams, others may follow after parleys||Taking a cue from the Centre, states such as Haryana, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Goa have decided to cancel Class 12 board examinations, government officials said. Many other states are expected to follow suit, but Bihar and Kerala, which have already held Class 12 exams in full or part, will work on the next steps, while Assam and Tripura are keen on holding the exams as soon as the second wave of the pandemic ebbs.At a meeting on Tuesday chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was decided to call off the Class 12 examinations conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in view of the raging Covid-19 pandemic. CBSE is expected to announce the module for evaluating students’ performance in the past academic year based on which results will be announced.Reacting to this, Uttarakhand school education secretary R Meenakshi Sundaram said on Wednesday that her state has also decided to scrap the Class XII exams. “A formal order will be issued by the chief minister’s office on Thursday,” she said.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also announced the cancellation of the MP board exams. “A committee of ministers has been formed to take a decision on how to do evaluation of the grades of the students,” the Chouhan said. The MP government was in favour of conducting the exams, but changed its stand following the PM’s announcement.In a tweet on Wednesday, Rajasthan education minister Govind Singh Dotasara said that board exams for Classes 10 and 12 have been cancelled over the concerns of the third wave.Goa CM Pramod Sawant also tweeted: “After extensive consultations, it has been decided that the Class 12 Exams shall be cancelled as the health and safety of our students is of utmost priority.”But Uttar Pradesh hasn’t taken a decision on this yet. It has 2.6 million registered candidates for the UP Board’s intermediate Class 12 exams, but deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said on Wednesday that a final call will be taken after a meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The UP board has already cancelled the Class 10 exam for which 3 million students had registered. “It will take two to three days to take any final decision on the UP Board intermediate Class 12 exams,” said Sharma who is also the minister for secondary education.He said that decision would be based on reports from all district magistrates about the Covid-19 situation in their districts and added that cases in 66 districts have reduced and the situation is expected to improve further. Opposition parties like the Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party have been demanding the scrapping of the board exams.Tamil Nadu also hasn’t made up its mind. Its school education minister, Anbil Mahesh Poyamozhi, said that chief minister MK Stalin has asked him to discuss with various experts and see what other states are doing before taking a final call.The West Bengal government has formed a committee of experts to submit suggestions on conducting board examinations. This committee will submit a report within the next few days after which the state will take a decision. Last week,CM Mamata Banerjee had announced that while Class 12 exams would be held in July-end, Class 10 exams would be held in the second week of August in the schools where the students have studied, with the examination period curtailed by 50%.The Himachal Pradesh government would likely take a decision on holding the exams in a cabinet meeting slated for June 5. Odisha, on the other hand, is still discussing if it should cancel the exams, according to school and mass education minister Sameer Ranjan Dash.But the Assam government is firm about conducting both Class 10 and Class 12 board exams in the state as soon as the Covid-19 situation eases. Assam Higher Secondary Education Council has submitted a proposal to the education department, suggesting that students appear in only three of the five compulsory subjects for science, arts and commerce streams. “A decision on the proposal will be taken soon,” said an official requesting anonymity. Like Assam, the Tripura Board of Secondary Education (TBSE) is also keen on conducting examinations in select subjects, though the exam schedule is yet to be finalised. TBSE president Dr Bhabatosh Saha said for Class 10, there will be exams for English, mathematics, and science, but the subjects for Class 12 haven’t been decided yet.Chhattisgarh has already started the Class 12 exams from June 1 in an “open-book” format where the students are allowed to collect the question papers from specified centres, take them home, and submit the answer scripts within five days. But no result date has been decided yet. Bihar conducted its Class 10 and 12 exams in February and is now planning to declare the results in June. Kerala also held its Class 12 exams in April and would soon announce the schedule for practical exams to be held by June-end, officials said, adding that the results are expected by July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-states-cancel-class-12-exams-others-may-follow-after-parleys-101622659326081.html
03-06-2021||India||Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corp to produce 228 mn Covaxin doses annually||The Centre on Wednesday said that the Maharashtra-owned Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corp will produce 228 million Covaxin doses per annum as part of a technology transfer arrangement with vaccine maker Bharat Biotech , a move that will increase the number of Covid-19 vaccines produced locally.Also Read | Why start vaccination centres if you can’t provide 2nd dose of Covaxin: Delhi HC﻿The announcement came days after the Centre last week rejected criticism from several states that it was not doing enough to improve vaccine production in the country and said, Haffkine , the National Dairy Development Board promoted Indian Immunologicals and the Centre-owned Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals will together aim to produce up to 40 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines by December. It said this was apart from Bharat Biotech’s own efforts to enhance Covaxin production to 100 million doses per month by October. Serum Institute is also ramping up Covishield production from 65 million to 110 million doses per month.In a statement on Wednesday, the science and technology ministry said that as part of the effort to enhance vaccine capacity, “three public enterprises are being supported by the Department of Biotechnology under Aatmanirbhar Bharat [Self-Reliant India] 3.0 Mission Covid Suraksha.”Officials on Tuesday claimed India will be in a position to vaccinate 10 million people every day by July or August. The government’s representative separately told the Supreme Court that the country will administer doses to all eligible individuals by the end of the year.India administered an average of 1.93 million doses of vaccine a day in May. Several states ran out of supplies by the fourth week of the month for at least some groups of recipients. Experts say the government’s target will depend on the availability of doses; supply for June has been pegged at 120 million.Sandeep Rathod, managing director, Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals, said the Centre has provided the company ₹65 crore grant and Maharashtra ₹94 crore for the production of Covaxin.“We have been given a timeline of eight months. The vaccine production process involves two stages – drug substance and final drug product. For the production of drug substance, we need to build a Bio Safety Level 3 (BSL 3) facility. Haffkine already has the fill finish facility,” said Rathod. Fill finish refers to the process of filling vials of the vaccine and packing the product.BSL 3 is a safety standard applicable to such facilities where work involves microbes that can cause serious disease if inhaled or consumed.Renu Swarup, secretary, the department of biotechnology, said enhancing vaccine production capacity using public sectors assets will go a long way in building the production capacity of vaccines in the country to support the massive vaccination drive.Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd is an offshoot of the 122-year-old Haffkine Institute, which is one of the oldest biomedical research institutes in the country, named after the Russian bacteriologist Dr Waldemar Haffkine, who invented the plague vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haffkine-biopharma-to-produce-228-million-covaxin-doses-annually-101622631005212.html
03-06-2021||India||Kerala assembly passes resolution asking Centre to provide free Covid vaccines||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala assembly on Wednesday passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to provide free Covid-19 vaccines to all states and ensure its easy availability. State health minister Veena George moved the resolution which was supported by opposition members after certain amendments. “To fight the pandemic we need to provide free universal vaccination which will ensure that all sections of the society are protected from the virus. The Union government can’t shirk its responsibility and leave everything to states. It has to ensure vaccination in a time-bound manner,” said the resolution. The resolution is in line with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s attempt to get 11 chief ministers of non-BJP governments to form a pressure group to ask Centre to fund the vaccination drive as a measure for public good, citing limited financial resources available to states. Several opposition-ruled states have questioned Centre’s decision to let states separately buy Covid-19 vaccines from manufacturers for the third phase of the drive. States have also cited poor supply of vaccines and their differential pricing as major problem areas.The resolution therefore asks the Union government to invoke compulsory licensing provisions to enable manufacturing of vaccines by the public sector pharmaceutical companies to ramp up supply. It said vaccination was an effective tool to achieve herd immunity against the raging disease. Though the opposition parties in Kerala said the state was deliberately underreporting Covid-19 deaths, triggering a war of words between health minister Veena George and leader of the opposition V D Satheesan. The minister said the state government was following the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and didn’t attempt to lower the death rate. Satheesan too relied on ICMR norms and statistics to counter the minister. Kerala logged 19,760 new Covid-19 cases and 194 deaths on Tuesday, taking the total caseload to over 2.516 million and the death toll to 9,009.In a related development on Wednesday, the state told Kerala high court differential pricing of Covid vaccines for Centre and states was ‘encouraging’ its black marketing, as per a news agency report. The government argued that the rates must be fixed based on the cost of production and private vaccine makers shouldn’t be allowed to charge exorbitant prices taking advantage of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-passes-resolution-asking-centre-to-provide-free-covid-vaccines-101622627764813.html
03-06-2021||India||In Chennai’s schools, the MeToo movement arrives||In what is now being termed as Chennai schools’ #metoomovement, there is an outpouring of students and alumni recounting sexual abuse they faced inside classrooms, on the sports field and during online classes conducted due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the city’s schools. The city police have received close to 100 complaints in the past week even as anonymous complaints rapidly accelerate on social media. Eight students have filed formal complaints that has led to the arrest of three teachers on serious charges, including attempt to rape. The state commission for protection of child rights (SCPCR) has summoned the management of six top schools to appear for enquiry on different dates from June 4 to 10. These schools include the Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan (PSBB), St. George’s Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Shenoy Nagar, Chettinad Vidyashram, Kendriya Vidyalaya- CLRI, Maharishi Vidya Mandir and Sushil Hari International Residential School, said SCPCR chairperson, Saraswathi Rangaswamy. “We inspected each of these schools and they have confirmed that they have received complaints from multiple students,” she added. This has created a cascading effect where students from across Tamil Nadu have begun calling out their teachers for sexual abuse and approaching the SCPCR and police with complaints.The beginning of the movementIt started just a week ago, when M Kripali, a Mumbai-based alumna from a Chennai school, PSBB, began to share screenshots on Instagram stories of juniors from her school sharing sexual abuse they faced from G Rajagopalan, their commerce teacher. “A student at PSBB reached out to me on Instagram asking me if I or anyone I know went through it while we were studying,” says Kripali, who was not sexually abuse at school. “But I was bullied, and slut shamed by the teachers. Regarding this case, I’ve witnessed him (Rajagopalan) cracking inappropriate jokes, which was normalised by our teachers so we students didn’t do much. I asked the student if she wanted me to post what she said on my stories and get more evidence against him since she had mentioned she wanted to take legal action. That one story of mine brought forward many.” Kripali has also been summoned by the SCPCR and has been facing backlash—supporters of Rajagopalan, and people from other schools are circulating her pictures and posting nasty comments on social media. “I can’t stop them. Neither can they stop me. My only goal was to help the students in any way possible.”Also Read | Kuwait’s MeToo moment: Women denounce harassment, violenceThe allegations against Rajagopalan, 59, outlined how he had asked a student out for a movie, sent a porn link to a class group, showed up to an online class wearing just a towel wrapped around his waist, touched girls and regularly passed sexual innuendos. More than a 1,000 alumni from the school wrote to the management demanding action against him. The school dismissed charges that they had not acted on previous complaints against Rajagopalan, who had taught there for two decades. School authorities said they had received no complaints, but suspended him. The issue escalated with political leaders calling for action. The school education department also swung into action and chief minister chief minister MK Stalin has ordered a committee to be formed to frame guidelines for the conduct of online classes and directed that online classes be recorded and reviewed regularly.The city’s crimes against women and children wing arrested Rajagopalan on May 24. He was booked under under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Indian Penal Code’s Sections 354 A (sexual harassment) and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) as well as provisions of the Information Technology Act related to publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form and that containing sexually explicit act. The domino effectThe action against him emboldened students to share their experience of abuse. On Monday, a martial arts instructor, E Kebi Raj, 41 was arrested following a complaint by a college student. He is booked under sections 376 r/w 511 (attempt to rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Woman Act. A day before that, an athletic coach and superintendent in the GST Commissionerate in Chennai, P Nagarajan, 59, was arrested after an athlete complained that he had touched her inappropriately while administering physiotherapy. Since the complaints came up on social media, the police approached several of the complainants and counselled them to register a formal complaint to proceed with the case. “Third parties were helping the victims by highlighting the complaints and predicament through forums. At times, we had no knowledge of the complainant so it was a laborious process to filter through the social media posts and identify victims,” said Shankar Jiwal, Commissioner, Greater Chennai City Police. Social media was also agog with instances of abuse of which students had heard. So the personal number of H Jayalakshmi, deputy commissioner, crime against women and children, was released so victims could call her directly and their identity would be protected as mandated by law. “That yielded good results. Her task was cut out,” Jiwal said.The investigation processesIt took a lot of convincing before a victim became the first person to register a formal complaint against Rajagopalan. Now, at least five victims have lodged complaints against him, including a man. After receiving a complaint, police maintain that the identity of the complainant is protected. In some cases, in plain clothes, they meet the victims in their homes or any other place of their comfort and timing to take their statements as required by POCSO Act. After verifying complaints, they immediately inform the division officer to register a case. Police have seized Rajagopalan’s phone and laptop as he had left behind a digital footprint, an officer on condition of anonymity said. “In cases registered so far, we have been able to gather prima facie evidence quickly because a lot of team members were pressed into service,” said Jiwal. The team has drawn up a plan of action post arrest. “We want the cases to reach their logical end through speedy investigation and by way of filing a charge sheet at the earliest. If investigation against the accused is proven, we want him to be brought to justice as soon as possible. It shouldn’t stop with registering an FIR.”Complaints have also been made about sexual abuse that victims were subject to many years ago. “But these are serious offences and there have been case laws to investigate and enquire,” said Jiwal adding said that they are following a Delhi court’s order in February 2021 on the acquittal of journalist Priya Ramani against former Indian minister MJ Akhbar who filed a defamation case against her. The ruling had crucially noted that a “woman has the right to put her grievance even after decades.”The complainantsTwenty-two former students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, CLRI in Chennai complained to the school’s management of sexual abuse by a Hindi teacher who still teaches there. The complaints span students from several batches that span over 18 years.The former students recalled that the Hindi teacher held their waist, touched their backs and often in front of other students. Several of them also said that they switched to Sanskrit to avoid this Hindi teacher.A former student shared that on her 14th birthday, she had gone to a class to distribute chocolates where he grabbed her buttocks. Her friend saw this and asked her what it was. “I was embarrassed. That’s how I remember feeling,” said one of the complainants. “The PSBB incident is what triggered me to complain. My motivation is that children should no longer be exposed to this man.” The school management has asked the complainants on June 1 to come to Chennai for an internal enquiry slated for June 2. Several of them aren’t in the city and given the pandemic-induced lockdown, they wouldn’t be able to travel either. They have requested for virtual conduct of the enquiry. “I don’t have faith in the management, they are making this difficult for us and don’t seem to be invested in finding the truth,” said one of the complainants. The school has set up a four-member committee for enquiry. Failure of multiple stakeholdersThe due process or the system that has dissuaded children from reporting sexual abuse has led to them taking to social media. “This episode shows that the entire system has failed,” says Andrew Sesuraj, state convener, Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch who is also helping connect police and victims. “It shows that parents never gave their children the confidence that they can share this with them. The schools didn’t have a safe space for children to speak up and those who spoke were silenced. None of the children seem to have contacted the 1098 Childline.” He proposes that the state should make a child protection mechanism that is child-friendly, transparent and accountable mandatory in every school, wherein every teacher and staff member is made to sign an undertaking against child sexual abuse. This committee should include children and parent representatives and child rights activistsVidya Reddy of Tulir- Centre for Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse reiterates an aspect that several victims have shared that they do not want to file a police complaint. The POCSO Act mandates reporting sexual crime against a child under Section 19(1) and failure to do so is a punishable offence under Section 21 of the Act. “It’s either going to the police for criminal action or no other recourse, which I find problematic when you’re dealing with children,” says Reddy. “We have to understand that not all adults who have been abused as children and those who are now posting on social media may want to be entangled in the criminal justice system. We must also offer a space which provides acknowledgement and retribution by keeping a victim’s best interest in mind.” Reddy cites the examples of the US and UK, where they involve child protective services and educational services to evaluate and assess a child sexual abuse complaint. They respond appropriately and involve the criminal system, if required. “India has blindly imported mandatory reporting without certain structures and processes accompanying it,” says Reddy. “This has become counterproductive to what was originally envisioned. It has driven down reporting. Children who are victims of sexual violence and require abortions do not go to hospitals because of mandatory reporting. So in the case of sexual abuse in schools where only punitive action is considered, it is detrimental to the child’s wellbeing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chennai-s-schools-the-metoo-movement-arrives-101622624765801.html
03-06-2021||India||Monsoon onset in Kerala likely today: IMD forecast||Conditions are favourable for the onset of monsoon in Kerala on Thursday, two days behind schedule, as south-westerly winds have strengthened, resulting in an increase in rainfall in the state, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement on Wednesday.The arrival of monsoon, crucial to the country’s farm-dependent economy, is announced based on factors such as wind speed, consistency of rainfall, intensity, and cloud cover.“The spatial rainfall distribution has increased over Kerala. Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels over the south Arabian Sea and deepened,” the IMD statement said. It cited satellite imagery and added that there is an increase in cloud cover over the Kerala coast and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea. “The... conditions [are] likely to favour further enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala during the next 24-hours. Hence, the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely in the next 24 hours.”In its second long-range forecast on Tuesday, IMD said monsoon rainfall was likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rainfall. LPA is the average rainfall (88cm) recorded in India every year between June and September from 1961 to 2010.In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the monsoon was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%, respectively, according to IMD.“Conditions are favourable for monsoon onset over Kerala. We said this morning that it’s likely to arrive in the next 24 hours. We will issue updates on its onset,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.IMD cited the strengthening of lower level south-westerly winds and said that widespread rainfall was likely in the north-eastern states this week, including heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura on Wednesday.It also predicted fairly widespread rain accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds in the western Himalayan region and the adjoining plains of north-west India on Wednesday and Thursday; apart from scattered to widespread rain accompanied by thunderstorm, lightning, and gusty winds in parts of south Peninsular India during the week.India receives about 70% of its annual rain during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybean, and cotton cultivation. Good rainfall has been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years, and its ability last year to buck the Covid-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, India recorded 18% excess rain during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to May 31. Of 36 subdivisions, 17 recorded over 60% excess rainfall to be categorised as “large excess”; 9 subdivisions recorded 20 to 59% excess rain in fell in “excess” bracket; 6 subdivisions received (-19 to 19%) rain to be categorised as “normal” and only 4 subdivisions received -59 to -20% rainfall. Most of central, east and west India recorded large excess including parts of peninsular India like Kerala, coastal Karnataka, Konkan and Goa. Most of northeast India including Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalya, Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur and all of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh region were rain deficient.“There were two cyclones in May – Tauktae and Yaas. Tauktae which formed over Bay of Bengal interacted with a western disturbance which was affecting the Western Himalayan region. There was rain over north and west India for 2-3 days continuously. Yaas also brought good rains to east India. Peninsular India was affected by an easterly wave activity especially northeastern southern peninsula. So overall the water table came up and temperature was very comfortable all of May. There were very few heatwave events,” said DS Pai, head of climate research and services, IMD Pune.“We also had one of the coolest Mays since record keeping began. Temperature data is being assessed,” said OP Sreejith, scientist, Climate Monitoring and Forecast, IMD Pune.While the cyclones have left soil conditions moist in most parts of the country, Pai said sowing should be well timed with monsoon progress. “We are expecting monsoon to progress quickly after June 7 to 10. There may be slightly slow progress before that. Farmers should decide on sowing Kharif crops in consultation with agromet and agriculture scientists,” added Pai.The standard precipitation index (SPI) shows a large part of central, north, east and west India are either “extremely wet” or “severely wet.” SPI is an index used for drought monitoring and is negative for drought, and positive for wet conditions. Most parts of the northeast and Peninsular India are also dry with some pockets severely and extremely dry indicating drought like conditions.But extremely wet conditions are not necessarily good for agriculture. “When the annual rainfall is normal and pre-monsoon rainfall is excess during the Kharif season, the deficit may increase. This is because as the soil organic matter is low, water holding capacities are lower. So excess pre-monsoon rain may not result in holding soil moisture,” explained G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-onset-in-kerala-likely-tomorrow-says-imd-101622604723325.html
