15-06-2021||India||Interim compliance officer named: Twitter||Microblogging platform Twitter on Tuesday said that it has retained a chief compliance officer, ending a continuing stalemate with the government over the new social media and intermediary guidelines.“We are keeping the MeitY apprised of the progress at every step of the process,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “An interim Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with the ministry directly soon. Twitter continues to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines.”The chief compliance officer will be liable for penal action under the new guidelines in case of violation or failure to follow the rules.On June 7, HT first reported that the microblogging platform had conveyed to the government that it was “committed to complying with the new rules”, even as it raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and intimidation by the police. The social media company sought a week from the ministry to comply with the key clauses of the new guidelines after the ministry issued it an ultimatum earlier this month. The government said Twitter would have to face “unintended consequences” that can involve it losing its legal protection from criminal liability for user content if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, was notified in February, with all clauses of it coming into force on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies, such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook, to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.There have been several instances of confrontation between the United States-based company and the government of India, particularly around the government’s content takedown orders and Twitter’s actions against prominent people linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for violation of its terms of use.Against this backdrop, the new IT rules hardened the stand-off last month, with the microblogging website earlier asking for three months to comply, raising concerns over the “core elements” of the norms, and flagging potential threats to the safety of its employees after a visit by the Delhi Police the same month.Twitter becomes the latest social media firm to convey to the ministry that it has met the requirements, with Google, WhatsApp and Facebook already sharing the details of the officers with the government. The new rules have been contested by several parties, including WhatsApp which has argued that the traceability provision mandated in the guidelines would violate end to end encryption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-chief-compliance-officer-in-effort-to-comply-with-the-new-guidelines-101623781387288.html

The National AEFI committed on Tuesday released a report where it said that a sexagenarian man died due to anaphylaxis, which means a severe allergic reaction, following vaccination. The beneficiary had received the Covishield jab.“This is the first death linked to Covid-19 vaccination due to anaphylaxis. It re-emphasises the need to wait for 30 minutes at the inoculation centre after receiving the jab. Most anaphylactic reactions occur during this period and prompt treatment prevents deaths,” Dr NK Arora, advisor to the National AEFI committee was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The health ministry also said that the death rate is 0.0002% out of the 235 million doses administered so far, highlighting that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks.The national AEFI committee report also said that there were 2.7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered as per data recorded till the first week of April.“The safety parameters of vaccines approved in our country are very good. When 23.5 crore doses were given then AEFI leading to deaths was as low as 0.0002% which comes to 488 deaths but these deaths are not because of vaccination,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.“There can be multiple factors and detailed analysis will be conducted by district and state level officials and then a conclusion will be reached on whether death was due to vaccine or due to any underlying comorbidities or other conditions,” the health ministry said.The ministry said that reports which showed at least 488 deaths between January 16 and June 7 following vaccination were linked to post-Covid complications, were based on ‘incomplete data’ and ‘limited understanding’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-why-waiting-for-30-mins-post-vaccination-at-inoculation-centre-needed-101623777645708.html

Thereby there is a need for regulating the content in the media,” the person said.The petition, filed by a retired bank employee and union activist H Nagabhushan Rao, also sought the police not to leak such video clips and other incriminating material to the digital media, Hindustan Times reported on April 12.“It is described as sex scandal of several political leaders, religious leaders and other celebrities. Though the programme is shown as news, it is shown as if it is an A-rated movie with sound effects graphics and repetitive dialogue delivery in thematic sound effects. While telecasting the news the sex video tapes are exhibited in a different form, sometimes as blurred photographs and sometimes with or without editing or without censoring,” the petition stated.The plea came a month after the alleged sex-for-job scandal that rocked the Karnataka government. It involved then cabinet minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. A social activist filed a complaint on behalf of the victim along with a video and audio recording which was played on loop by TV news channels.The HC is expected to hear the case again on June 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-karnataka-govt-to-formulate-guidelines-prevent-police-from-leaking-info-to-media-101623778267132.html

However, three of the 14 " core members" of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), the Centre's advisory body, said the gap was doubled without the agreement of the scientific group, that the government said recommended the increased gap, according to a Reuters report.Announcing the decision to increase the gap between the two doses from six to eight weeks to 12-16 weeks, the government said it was recommended by NTAGI, based on real-life evidence mainly from the United Kingdom. But the NTAGI members refuted the claim and said the body did not have enough data to make the recommendation, reported Reuters.Also read| India missed early alarm, let deadly coronavirus variant spread: Health expertsThe former director of the National Institute of Epidemiology said, reported Reuters, the advisory body had backed increasing the interval to 8-12 weeks, which was the gap advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the body did not have the data to extend the interval beyond 12 weeks, Gupte added, reported Reuters."Eight to 12 weeks is something we all accepted, 12 to 16 weeks is something the government has come out with," Reuters quoted him as saying. "This may be alright, may not be. We have no information on that," he added.The government's decision to increase the interval between the doses came at a time when the country was facing a huge paucity of Covid-19 vaccine doses in comparison to demand and surging infections.It had later denied that the interval increase was not to address vaccine shortage but was a "scientific decision."Gupte's colleague Mathew Varghese also said that the recommendation was only for 8-12 weeks. J.P. Muliyil, a member of the seven-strong Covid working group said NTAGI had discussed increasing the dose gap but it did not recommend 12-16 weeks, reported Reuters.Also read | 6 million Covid vaccine doses given in Capital: Delhi govtMuliyil further said that the recent data released by South Korea that said one dose of the vaccines from AstraZeneca and Pfizer was 86.6% effective in preventing Covid infection among people aged 60 years and above, increased confidence within the body that delaying the second dose would not be harmful, reported Reuters.The AstraZeneca or Covishield vaccine accounts for almost 90% of the 257.5 million vaccine doses administered in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didnt-back-increased-interval-between-covid-19-vaccine-doses-says-ntagi-scientists-101623774410852.html
15-06-2021||India||EPFO extends deadline for mandatory UAN-Aadhaar linking to September 1||The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Tuesday extended the deadline for mandatory Aadhaar-linking with universal account number (UAN) of individual subscribers by three months from June 1 to September 1, 2021. The extension was ordered on the request of the government in view of the second wave of Covid pandemic, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The decision has been taken after several representations to Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar about the inconvenience faced by EPF subscribers at the time of pandemic, they said requesting anonymity. Issuing a circular regarding extension of the deadline on June 15, EPFO said: “Further, all the employers may be advised by concerned field offices to be ready for implementation after the period of deferment.” HT has reviewed a copy of the circular.Hindustan Times on June 10 reported that the two social security arms under the Labour ministry took different views on making Aadhaar mandatory to meet one of the clauses of the Code on Social Security (CoSS).While the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) decided against denying benefits to insured persons for want of Aadhaar, EPFO went ahead to make Aadhaar-linking mandatory from June 1, citing a law which was yet-to-be fully operational. This made it impossible for employers to deposit provident fund contributions of lakhs of employees who hadn’t linked their accounts to the 12-digit identity number.EPFO, with more than 220 million accounts and a corpus of ₹12 lakh crore, is one of the world’s largest social security organisations.The labour ministry on May 5 specifically clarified that the government has only notified the particular clause – “Section 142” of the Code on Social Security and as other provisions of the Code were pending, Aadhaar should not be made mandatory at this stage.“At present, only Section 142 of CoSS is notified, which aims to create the National Database for unorganised workers (NDUW) and not to create any inconvenience to members of ESIC or EPFO,” one of the officials said.On May 5, Gangwar said Section 142 was notified “only for collection of data of workers including migrant workers. No benefit will be denied to workers for want of Aadhaar”.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India said: “Effective 1 September 2021, employers will not be able to remit PF for cases where such linking is not done... Employers need to use this extended time to make sure that suitable communication is sent to employees advising them of the consequences of non-linking, and provide guidance on how the linking can be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/epfo-extends-deadline-for-mandatory-uan-aadhaar-linking-to-september-1-101623776707176.html

The pace of vaccination should see a renewed energy from next week onward when we will realign our efforts, that of the state and effective scale up at the ground level. Teams both at the Centre and states are working on building new guidelines for high-speed coverage of the vaccination across the country," he said.On Monday, Novavax Inc said its vaccine was 90% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing moderate and severe symptoms of the virus. It demonstrated 93% efficacy against predominantly circulating variants of concern and variants of interest, the company added."The vaccine candidate 'NVX-CoV2373' demonstrated 100 per cent protection against moderate and severe disease, 90% efficacy overall, and met the primary endpoint in its PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial," Novavax's statement read.The study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the United States and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/novavax-vaccine-efficacy-data-promising-trials-in-advanced-stage-centre-101623771478038.html

The police had then claimed to have identified the suspects but there wasn’t convinced if the two cousins had been murdered or died by suicide.After meeting the family, Himanta Biswa Kumar said he had asked the police to probe both angles. “If its murder, the accused should be arrested and handed appropriate punishment. And if it’s a case of suicide, the probe should be on what led the sisters to commit the act,” he said on Sunday.Assam police chief Bhaskarjyoti on Tuesday said the girls were killed.“The accused involved in rape and murder are Muzamil Sheikh (20), Farizul Rehman (22) and Nasibul Sheikh (19). We have been able to establish their direct involvement in the crime,” he added.The DGP said the police have started the process of retrieving data deleted from the mobile phones of the accused. Citing initial investigations, the chief minister on Sunday said the victims probably knew the accused and may have been in touch with them before the crime. Mahanta said the police were yet to receive the autopsy report of the two girls. The viscera of the girls has been preserved for tests and DNA fingerprinting of evidence collected from the accused and victims would be done.“We did a recreation of the crime scene on Tuesday during which independent witnesses, magistrate and forensic experts were present. I am sure that the medical reports will match our findings,” Mahanta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-teens-found-hanging-from-tree-were-raped-then-murdered-7-arrested-cops-101623774066818.html

The Government had issued a notice to Twitter giving it one last chance to "immediately" comply with the new IT rules and warned that failure to adhere to the norms will lead to the platform losing exemption from liability under the IT Act. Following this, Twitter had assured the Indian government last week that it is in advanced stages of finalising the appointment of chief compliance officer as required under the new IT rules, and that it will submit additional details within a week. A Twitter spokesperson on Tuesday said the company continues to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and is keeping the IT Ministry apprised of progress at every step of the process. An interim Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with the Ministry directly soon, the spokesperson added. The move by Twitter assumes significance as the microblogging platform has been facing heat over delay in complying with the IT rules that mandate large digital platforms to undertake greater due diligence, and make them more accountable and responsible for the content that is hosted. As per the rules, significant social media intermediaries -- those with over 50 lakh users -- are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-interim-chief-compliance-officer-for-india-to-share-details-with-it-ministry-soon-101623771572386.html

The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore.Citing the May 2020 order of the international arbitral tribunal that both India and Italy accepted, the court added that the Republic of Italy shall resume its criminal investigation into the fishermen’s shooting incident of 2012. “It is further directed that the Union of India, Republic of Italy and the State of Kerala shall cooperate with each other in pursuit of that investigation,” said the bench.After Tuesday’s order, civil proceedings pending before the Supreme Court and the Kerala high court as well as a criminal murder case pending before a special court in Delhi shall come to an end.The peaceful burial has followed an intense legal and diplomatic row that began on February 15, 2012 when the marines aboard Italian Vessel MV Enrica Lexie shot dead Valentine, 44, and Ajeesh Pink, 20, who were while fishing off the coast of Kerala. The Kollam police registered a murder case against the marines and arrested the duo on February 19.While the marines and Italy challenged the jurisdiction of the Kerala police by filing a writ petition before the high court in February, the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner filed an admiralty suit before the high court demanding compensation. A separate petition was also filed by Enrica Lexie before the high court seeking permission to continue the voyage with other crew members.In April 2012, the Italian government paid a compensation of ₹1 crore each for the deceased fishermen and ₹17 lakh for the boat owner in an out-of-court settlement. But the petition by Lexie was dismissed by a division bench of the high court compelling the shipping company to move the Supreme Court. On May 2, the Supreme Court allowed the vessel to sail away with all 24 crew members, subject to certain terms and conditions.To be sure, the criminal case continued against the marines and, on May 18, 2012, the Kollam police filed a charge sheet against the two, charging them with murder and attempt to murder. The writ petition filed by the marines along with their government failed before the high court which on May 29, 2012, affirmed the jurisdiction by the Kerala and the concerned circle inspector of police at Kollam.The marines and the Italian government then rushed to the Supreme Court, seeking protection under the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Italian government asserted that India and Italy, having signed and ratified the 1982 treaty, must settle the dispute concerning the incident in question, in terms of the binding dispute resolution mechanism provided under the UNCLOS.The Italian government also claimed sovereign immunity for its marines but, by a judgment in January 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed this contention and upheld India’s criminal jurisdiction over the marines. At the same time, the court clarified that Kerala had no jurisdiction to investigate into the incident since the incident had taken place over the Contiguous Zone that was in exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government.While the proceedings were then shifted to a special court in Delhi and the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency, the top court gave liberty to the Italian government to raise issues of UNCLOS at appropriate forum.Then came a phase of diplomatic tension when the marines, who were allowed by the top court in February 2013 to go to Italy for a brief period to vote in the general elections, did not come back, and Italy went back on its undertaking. As the court fumed over breach of undertaking by Italian ambassador Daniele Mincini, the Indian government restrained Mincini from leaving the country. Following diplomatic pressures, Italy returned the marines to India.In September 2014, Latorre sought permission to go back to Italy for medical treatment, and the court allowed it on humanitarian grounds. The initial period of four months was later extended from time to time.In July 2015, Italy took the case to International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, an independent judicial body under the UNCLOS, which asked both India and Italy to suspend all court proceedings and referred the matter to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organisation based in The Hague in Netherlands.On a joint request by both the governments, the Supreme Court suspended all proceedings against the marines by an order in August 2015.In May 2016, the apex court allowed the second marine, Girone, to leave for Italy. In September that year, the Centre told the Supreme Court it had no objection if the marines were allowed to remain in Italy until the arbitration proceedings before the tribunal were over, following which the court permitted their stay at home.In May 2020, the tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them. At the same time, the tribunal held that Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.On July 3, 2020, the Centre moved the top court, saying it had accepted the PCA’s ruling and wanted the proceedings to be closed. When the plea was taken up by the court in August 2020, it clarified that the proceedings could be closed only after the families of the victims were heard and given “adequate” compensation.Again, in April this year, the Supreme Court reiterated that the compensation money must be deposited in the registry of the court and the victims should agree to it before the proceedings could be ended. Last week, the court was informed that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims has been deposited. It had then reserved the order that was delivered on Tuesday, ending all proceedings in India against the marines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-ends-proceedings-against-2-italian-marines-after-7-yrs-of-twists-and-turns-101623770226603.html

15-06-2021||India||INSACOG helped detect Covid variants of concern, data shared with states, UTs: Govt||The Centre on Tuesday dismissed the media reports alleging a low quantum of sequencing in the country and significant lags between sample collection and sequence submission into a database for pattern detection and actionable alerts. It said Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium (INSACOG) has helped in the detection of Covid-19 Variants of Concern (VOC) in real time, which was also shared with the relevant states. The present turnaround time for VOCs is only 10 to 15 days.In addition to the existing 10 laboratories, 18 more labs have also been approved for incorporation in the INSACOG network, the government said on enhancing the number and capacity of genome sequencing.Also read| Covid-19 vaccination: 'All deaths following inoculation cannot be linked to it'The Centre clarified that a sampling strategy is developed based on the country's objectives, scientific principles and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.Accordingly, in view of rising Covid-19 cases, the existing capacity of RGSLs and timely detection of the VOCs including other variants, the strategy was revised to “Sentinel Surveillance” on April 12, the government said.The strategy was also endorsed by the WHO, the government claimed. Under the present Sentinel surveillance strategy, states have identified five labs and five tertiary hospitals each as sentinel sites for sending samples to designated RGLS. Each of the sites sends 15 samples routinely for WGS to the designated labs."In addition to the sentinel surveillance, an additional event-based surveillance for special/unusual events like large clusters, unusual clinical presentation, vaccine breakthrough, suspected reinfections etc to detect, investigate and respond to these was also approved," the Union ministry of health and family affairs informed. This is in line with the revised objectives of INSACOG.INSACOG is a forum established under the ministry on December 25 to study and monitor genome sequencing and virus variation of circulating strains of Covid-19 in India.Initially, sampling was done to identify international travellers who could be carriers of new strains and to find out if the variants are already present in the population.Also read | Online registration or appointment booking not mandatory to get Covid shot: GovtA two-pronged strategy was adopted later, as per which, international passengers arriving from selected countries and their contacts were targeted for genome sequencing and community-based sampling of 5% of the RTPCR positive cases from each state was done."It is important to note that the 5% norm was selected based on the then daily new case load (10,000-15,000 per day) and the sequencing capacity of the RGSLs at that time," the government explained.The government said both these objectives were achieved when it was conclusively established that international passengers were carrying the mutant strains and their transmission has also been established in the community (UK variant) in a few states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insacog-helped-detect-covid-variants-of-concern-data-shared-with-states-uts-govt-101623759224765.html
15-06-2021||India||From leadership aspirations to losing LJP, how Chirag Paswan got outmaneuvered||On November 23, 2020, soon after the Bihar Assembly election verdict, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan had put up a brave front despite being relegated to just one seat. He derived consolation in achieving his aim of reducing the Janata Dal (United) to a poor third, which many political analysts felt was done at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While the BJP denied that it had anything to do with Paswan quitting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state while remaining with NDA at the Centre, and chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi sharing dais at public meetings, the murmurs did not go away.Chirag Paswan’s attacks on Kumar kept getting more pointed as the election progressed. He seemed to be on a mission to dislodge Kumar, the man his father, the late Ram Vilas Paswan, had helped install as CM 15 years earlier by dislodging the 15-year Rashtriya Janata Dal rule in 2005. Chirag Paswan wanted to play a decisive role post election, but the outcome left him with little leverage — at either the Centre or in the state.Yet, he found solace in the fact that despite its near wipeout, LJP had gathered enough votes to upset JD-U’s calculations.The JD(U) push, the BJP silence That was over six months ago. And that is indeed a long time in politics, as Chirag Paswan learnt this week. Nitish Kumar waited, and has now extracted his political revenge. The JD-U has played an active role in pulling the rug from under Chirag Paswan’s feet by engineering his ouster as both parliamentary party leader and party president.The BJP has maintained a silence on the happenings so far. “What do we have to do with whatever is happening? It is an internal matter of the LJP.” said Bihar BJP president, Sanjay Jaiswal.While Chirag Paswan has won support from other quarters such as the RJD and the Congress, the BJP’s role has drawn attention. He had openly asserted during the assembly elections that he had picture of Narendra Modi in his heart and that he would like a BJP-LJP government to be installed in the state. Top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionaries and BJP leaders joined his party just ahead of election, leading to speculation about a tacit understanding, though, to be sure, the BJP suspended the rebels promptly.Also Read | The fracture in LJP will impact Bihar’s politicsHowever, the way LJP split from within, and the fact that Chirag Paswan’s uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, got instant approval from the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for the change in the leadership of the parliamentary party has fuelled speculations that the young leader may have lost the plot in the face of political needs and compulsions of the JD-U and BJP combined.The BJP, despite emerging larger than the JD-U in the elections, has reconciled itself to Nitish Kumar’s leadership in the state. The CM has also been wary of his partner, and expanded his own party’s base by copying Upendra Kushwaha’s formation and the lone sitting LJP MLA in the state assembly.Political analyst NK Choudhary said that the BJP could not afford to antagonise or lose Nitish Kumar at this stage when it is itself faced with stiff challenges from various quarters. “In politics, political requirements govern decision. The basic premise is self-interest and power politics. The BJP may not like to lose Chirag Paswan, but it has been left with no choice. It can’t choose him over Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar is a master craftsman when it comes to politics and he has created a situation in which BJP can only play safe at a time when it has bigger challenges in big states and attempts by a new emerging third front to corner BJP in 2024.” he added.The future of PaswanDespite the assembly defeat, Chirag Paswan was positive — till this Monday. Soon after the results, he had said, “LJP has done well. We were at second place at many places, while at some places we lost by less than 2,000 to 3,000 votes. This gives us the platform to fight 2025 elections with full force. The circumstances in which we had to fight election are hidden from none. I got to know on October 7 which seats JD-U was contesting from, while the next day, my father passed away. We did not have enough time to strategise, yet we got higher vote share than earlier. We would have been happy to win more seats for a BJP-LJP government, but that could not happen.” But the assessment no longer holds, given the fragmentation in the party.In the 2005 October assembly elections, the LJP under late Ram Vilas Paswan had contested 204 seats, but could win just 10. Yet, it was content for having played its part in bringing down the RJD regime and also got the rewards. Chirag Paswan, however, finds himself alienated from all sides, even from the ones he seemed to bank on and work for.Also Read | In Karnataka, the BJP’s BSY dilemmaFormer director of AN Sinha Institute of Spcial Studies, DM Diwakar, said the episode had given a lifetime lesson to Chirag Paswan, which could either galvanise him to throw his hat in the largely vacant Dalit politics with greater maturity or to demoralise him. “His father was acceptable in all parties. He could get along with all and read the political situation right and that is why Laluji (Lalu Prasad) called him mausam vaigyanik. (Weather scientist). Nobody was ever unhappy with him. But Chirag alienated his own and allowed his adversaries to cash in on his weakness.”Diwakar said that BJP used Chirag Paswan, and his inexperience blurred his vision. “Now, he will have to start afresh without the protective cover of his father. This is different from Tejaswhi Yadav, who has had both his father to guide him and his father’s aides to work with. Whether Chirag Paswan can bounce back like his father did consistently, only time will tell,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-leadership-aspirations-to-losing-ljp-how-chirag-paswan-got-outmanoeuvred-101623762425514.html

No injury to any person and nor any damage to property was witnessed except window panes of three vehicles parked nearby, officials said.Also read | Iran guided Israeli embassy blast through local module, upsets India: Officials#WATCH | CCTV footage of suspects in a blast that took place on January 29th outside the Israel Embassy in Delhi.(Video source: NIA) pic.twitter.com/KS1jIcKSkJThe minor explosion coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Israel on January 29, 1992.The blast caused by a "very low-intensity improvised device" shattered the windscreens of three cars in the area, Delhi Police officials said.Immediately after the explosion, the police checked the CCTV cameras in the vicinity to ascertain the sequence of events, officials said. Forensic experts of Delhi Police are at the spot to lift the samples of the explosive.Preliminary investigations from February had revealed no connection with a suspicious package found outside the Israeli embassy in Paris on the same day.Forensic experts had ruled out any traces of PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) in the Improvised Explosive Device (IED), which was fitted in a beverage can and was attached with a tiny timer before it was placed near a palm tree on the pavement at Abdul Kalam Road. “Experts have opined that the PETN, even in small amounts, would have caused much bigger impact at the blast site,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.Also read: Govt upgrades probe into Israel embassy blast after Iran link.

15-06-2021||India||Bengal witnessed worst post-poll violence since Independence: Dhankhar||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar wrote a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday, saying the state witnessed the worst form of post-poll violence while urging her to deliberate on the issue in the Cabinet.“With a heavy heart, I am constrained to observe your continued silence and inaction over the post-poll retributive bloodshed, violation of human rights, outrageous assault on the dignity of women, wanton destruction of property, perpetuation of untold miseries on political opponents...worst since independence...,” said Dhankhar, who was scheduled to fly to Delhi on Tuesday and was likely to meet Union home minister Amit Shah. He wrote the violence “ill augurs” for democracy.The letter came a day after Suvendu Adhikari, the Leader of the Opposition, and 50 other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators, met Dhankhar and lodged a complaint on post-poll violence.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) hit out, saying the letter was part of a ploy of the BJP-ruled Centre to disturb peace in the state. “We have urged multiple times to give us a list of victims. There were some incidents when law and order were under the ECI [Election Commission of India). But even since Mamata Banerjee was sworn in, the situation has become peaceful. We have never seen the Governor’s tweets when the Centre does not send Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and oxygen,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.Dhankhar has had an acrimonious relationship with the TMC government.Dilip Ghosh, the state BJP chief, said Dhankhar always speaks on behalf of the people who have been victimised. “Citizens of the state are asking the same questions today... Why is the chief minister silent on the post-poll violence?” In May, Dhankhar visited some of the areas where post-poll violence allegedly broke out. He even went to Assam to meet some of the people who allegedly left the state.In his letter, Dhankhar asked Banerjee to take all steps to restore law and order and provide the much-needed succour to the suffering people and to hold police and administration accountable in an exemplary manner for “partisan stance and failure in containing violence”.In May, the Centre sent an inter-ministerial team to take stock of the alleged post-poll violence in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-witnessed-worst-post-poll-violence-since-independence-dhankhar-101623761405657.html

15-06-2021||India||Abandoned tiger cub in Periyar reserve learns to hunt, raises rewilding hopes||Thiruvananthapuram: Last November, when two forest guards out on a patrol in the Periyar Tiger Reserve spotted Mangala, her hind legs were paralysed, she had sustained some injuries, and she couldn’t see properly. And, of course, the two-month old tiger cub didn’t have a name then. Some forest officials thought the weak cub would not survive, but that didn’t stop them and a team of veterinarians from caring for the small big cat. Three doctors, three forest officials, and a physiotherapist were dedicated to her. They named her Mangala after the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple.near which she was found. Mangala survived. She is now eight months old, weighs around 30 kg, almost par for the course for a young tigress of that age. And forest officials are preparing to teach her lessons to survive in the wild.For starters, they have fenced off a part of the forest near her enclosure and release small prey to get her used to the idea of hunting.“We have limited her human interactions...and she is learning her wild lessons fast. This is the first time in south India we are rewilding a tiger cub,” said KR Anoop, field director of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 777 square kilometres of Kerala’s Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts.But rewilding is a cumbersome exercise and includes protecting or reintroducing key predators and species. The most high-profile experiment to rewild tigers was in Madhya Pradesh, where two tiger cubs were found abandoned in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in 2017. They were one and a half months old. The two cubs, however, did not become used to the idea of killing their prey and were eventually shifted to Bhopal’s zoological park in 2020.In Maharashtra, attempts to rewild cubs have not succeeded. The cub of tigress Avni, who was hunted down in November 2018, was not able to survive in the wild and had to be sent to a zoo. In Pench, a male cub had to be sent to a zoo as he was not able to survive in the wilderness. However, Malini, a tigress, adapted to the wild easily after being kept in an enclosure for several months.Much before her, a hand-reared orphaned cub were successfully re-introduced in the Panna Tiger Reserve in 2010 and it mated with a tigress from Bandhavgarh a year later, reviving the tiger population in the Madhya Pradesh reserve that had lost all tigers in 2008. R Sreenivasa Murthy, former director of Panna Tiger Reserve, said they had to monitor the movement of the fully grown cub to see how he was adapting to the wild. “Initially, we had to help him to catch prey but as there were not any tigers in the wild and there was enough prey, he adapted well,” he said.“It (rewilding) is an uphill task,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust. “Either the tiger re-introduced in the wild can get hammered by another tiger or can starve. Success of re-wilding depends on many factors.”The first is that there should not be any human imprinting when the young tiger is in an enclosure as even a remotely habituated animal can end up in villages, and into trouble, he said. The second is the ability to bring down different types of prey species in undulating terrain without getting injured. The third and the biggest hurdle is the ability to fight with other tigers in the wild, he said.“It is difficult to teach a tiger how to fight with another tiger in the wild in an enclosure,” Andheria said. “Female tigers have a much higher probability of surviving a rewilding experiment than males. On the positive side, in Madhya Pradesh, six hand-raised tigresses have been re-wilded in the last three years. It is important to note that they had all been released in areas that had very few wild tigers. Release of hand-raised tigers in high-density tiger habitats will be fraught with dangers”, he added.Manu Sathyan, assistant field director of the Periyar reserve forest, said they have started with roosters and rabbits for Mangala.“She has started showing her wild instincts. We will slowly increase the size of the prey,” Sathyan said.The forest officials have set up high-resolution cameras around her enclosure to track her. They say Mangala could be released in the wild, after fitting her with a radio collar, before she turns two. Maybe, when she is 18 months old, said one forest official, who asked not to be named. By the time they are 18 months old, most tiger cubs are capable of hunting by themselves, although many stay with their mother till they turn two-and-a-half. A female tiger becomes sexually mature by the time she is three.But those are all well in Mangala’s future. For now, she has to hunt, and become the apex predator she is. According to standard rewilding procedures, a cub has to make at least 50 kills before being released in the wild.According to the 2018 big cat census, Periyar Tiger Reserve is home to 26 tigers. India has 2,967 tigers, about 70% of the global tiger population.Wildlife expert Dr PS Esa said that rewildling of tigers is a time-consuming and laborious process. “In India, elephants and rhinos were rewilded successfully. Big cats, it is difficult because their hunting territory is vast and usually mothers are the best trainers of their offspring,” Esa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abandoned-tiger-cub-in-periyar-reserve-learns-to-hunt-starts-with-roosters-101623761047773.html
15-06-2021||India||In Karnataka, the BJP’s BSY dilemma||Karnataka’s chief minister (CM) BS Yediyurappa and his son, BY Vijayendra, have been making trips to Lingayat mathas (mutt) or monasteries, meeting pontiffs, in what is widely seen as an effort to rally the support of a community that has largely sided with the 78-year-old leader.With key Lingayat leaders making politically charged statements in favour of the CM, speculation is rife that the 78-year-old is trying to consolidate the support base that has so far considered him the “uncrowned” political leader of the community. This, in turn, has also spawned speculation about why the CM has felt the need to rally his base at this particular time — and whether his position is indeed under threat. The main pontiff of Bekkina Kal Matha, Mallikarjun Murugharajendra Swami, on Saturday, said that people should not talk of a leadership change in Karnataka.“No one should talk of a change in leadership which will be a bigger disaster for Karnataka than the Covid-19 pandemic,” the seer said, with Yediyurappa by his side.The rise of YediyurappaIn 2008, BS Yediyurappa led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power in Karnataka — the first time the party, conventionally seen as a north Indian outfit, attained electoral and political success in any south Indian state. It was also the product of a long personal and political struggle, which started in 1983 when Yediyurappa first entered the legislative assembly.HD Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) had broken the alliance with the BJP after nearly two years in power since 2006. He was accused of denying Yediyurappa his turn in becoming CM, which was said to be a part of an earlier agreement between the two parties. Lingayats, believed to be the single largest caste group in Karnataka, saw the denial of the chief ministership to Yediyurappa as an “injustice” to the community.Also Read | Karnataka BJP in-charge Arun Singh to visit state on June 16: MinisterBut while he did make it to power, Yediyurappa’s term since 2008 was riddled with allegations of corruption, infighting, and the surfacing of the illegal iron-ore scam, allegedly masterminded by Gali Janardhana Reddy, who herded legislators to a resort, seeking the removal of Yediyurappa.But the party’s central leadership at the time was weak, compared to what is in place today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and JP Nadda helming affairs. The party leadership allowed Yediyurappa to step down but still retain control of the government and party by getting a replacement of his choice. Not once but twice — the first time with DV Sadananda Gowda, who was then replaced with Jagadish Shettar.However, Yediyurappa’s difficulties with BJP had become insurmountable from his perspective. He left the party to form the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) in 2012, reducing the BJP from its tally of 110 out of the 224 seats in 2008 to a mere 40 seats in 2013.“In 2011, when Yediyurappa resigned (from the post of chief minister) there was no one like (Narendra) Modi, our party was not in power at the Centre, our party was not as strong as it is now. We had power only in four states. That time, Yediyurappa was 100 times stronger than he is today but even then the central party got him to resign. Now, times have changed,” said a senior national leader of the BJP, requesting not to be named.The TINA factor for the BJP While it was with Modi’s rise that Yediyurappa returned to the party, the past few years have seen murmurs of a rift between Delhi and Bengaluru as far as the BJP is concerned. Yediyurappa was said to be more keen in staking claim to form the government when BJP did not have the numbers, and then engaging in a strong political offensive to win over defectors. But his political strength in the state was such that the BJP leadership did not want to upset the equations, and was happy to have another state in their kitty. To do so, however, the party had to make a rare compromise — allowing a 75+ leader to occupy executive office, when all other such leaders have been asked to make way for the next generation. Also Read | Himachal BJP’s three-day review meet begins todayThe tensions haven’t subsided through — particularly with regard to the CM’s tenure, appointments, and the political future of his family. While a segment of the BJP leadership, according to party insiders, believes that it can replace Yediyurappa, the party remains wary of a backlash from both the CM and his support base. Unlike the bloodless transition of power in Uttarakhand, Karnataka has been firmly in the control of local chieftains such as Yediyurappa or even Siddaramaiah of the Congress who have firmly resisted any possible interference by their respective central leadership. Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda has played a key role on more than one occasion, negotiating and oscillating between the two national parties, successfully accommodating his son Kumaraswamy as CM twice despite a proportionally lower number of seats compared to the other two.Analysts said that the BJP also does not have an acceptable replacement and is well aware of the damage the 78-year-old can cause if he is removed in haste.Some of Yediyurappa’s demands, people aware of the developments said, was to allow him to complete his term till 2023 at least and accommodate his son, BY Vijayendra.“When the time is right, he (Vijayendra) might also be considered based on his abilities. But not on account of his father. He has already enjoyed all bonuses the party has extended to Yediyurappa,” the BJP national leader cited above said.The BJP, which stormed to power at the Centre in 2014, specifically targeted the Congress for its “dynastic politics”. Yediyurappa is not the only leader who has propped up his family in the BJP, but in Karnataka, his family’s involvement is conspicuous. Another of his sons, BY Raghavendra, is the Member of Parliament from Shivamogga, the CM’s home district. Also Read | ‘Not defections but violence will weaken BJP unit in West Bengal’But the central leadership’s diktats haven’t worked in Yediyurappa’s case. Unlike its strategy in other states, including Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the BJP did announce Yediyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate exactly a year before the 2018 elections. The recent rumblings within the party and government have barely dented Yediyurappa’s confidence that he is the rightful and only claimant to the job.The intra-organisational rift “For the next two years, I will be CM and will focus more on development works for the state,” Yediyurappa said last week, exuding confidence.One of his known detractors is BL Santosh, the national general secretary (organisation), who has so far been unable to replace Yediyurappa but has kept a close eye on Karnataka, people aware of the developments said.A Bengaluru-based political analyst said that any direct effort by Santosh would lead to the regrouping of the Lingayat support base that, at the moment, appears disenchanted with Yediyurappa. “The community stood by him all these years despite knowing he was corrupt. But there is resentment towards his other activities,” said a BJP legislator, requesting anonymity. Any drastic move could however change social equations. The mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis has added to the CM’s challenges, and plays to the advantage of his detractors both within the party and in the Opposition. But the Congress is mired in its own share of infighting between state Congress president DK Shivakumar and legislature party leader Siddaramaiah.Political analysts said that Yediyurappa has, over the years, become this popular and powerful on account of his caste-based politics and coalition-building abilities, which few others in his party can claim.“At the moment, the Lingayat support base to the BJP is routed through Yediyurappa,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University said. He added the BJP may have no reason to retain Yediyurappa but will not be able to remove him either, unless the CM does not give his consent and is not party to the larger plan.“He has an ability to get people to do what he wants,” said one Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst also added that those calling for Yediyurappa’s removal are also well aware that the power they enjoy is because of the latter’s almost single-handed effort.In an interview with ThePrint, Vijayendra once said that BJP and Yediyurappa are synonymous. And this is probably the biggest challenge for the party as it navigates its troubled relationship with its own CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-the-bjp-s-bsy-dilemma-101623760985574.html
15-06-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination: 'All deaths following inoculation cannot be linked to it,' says health ministry||The Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday dismissed reports that claimed that a high number of deaths following vaccination for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are taking place and these are linked to post-Covid complications. These reports, according to the ministry, were based on "incomplete and limited understanding" of the process."There have been some media reports suggesting an increase in the cases of severe AEFI which have also resulted in ‘succumbing of patients’ post vaccination. As per the media reports, 488 deaths following vaccination are linked to post-Covid complications during 16th Jan 2021 and 7th June 2021 period where the total vaccination coverage was 23.5 crore," the ministry said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAdverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) is when any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunisation, but it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.Deaths or other serious conditions following vaccination are to be investigated at the district level, the ministry said, adding that the state government and the Centre will assess if the causality is linked to the vaccination. "Therefore, any death or hospitalisation following vaccination cannot be automatically assumed to be due to vaccination unless investigated by the AEFI Committees at the district, state and national level and attributed to the Vaccination," the ministry said."Healthcare workers, doctors and vaccine recipients have been always encouraged by the government of India as well as state governments to report all deaths, hospitalisations and events resulting in disability as well as any minor and adverse events following immunization at any point of time after vaccination," it added.Issuing a clarification on the data, the ministry said that the reports were not accurate.The percentage of deaths being reported after vaccination in India is 0.0002% of 23.5 crore doses administered, the ministry said, adding that this was within the expected death rates in a population. "In a population, deaths occur at a certain rate. Crude death rate in 2017 as per SRS data is 6.3 per 1000 persons annually," the ministry said, providing further context.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-all-deaths-following-inoculation-cannot-be-linked-to-it-says-health-ministry-101623752652458.html

I consider Sachin Pilot as leader and Ashok Gehlot is above him. He (Gehlot) is the chief minister, and all have to consider him as the leader. Even Pilot has to consider him as the leader,” said Bhanwar Lal Sharma.The statement came amid calls from the Pilot camp for fulfilling promises made to the former deputy chief minister, who led the rebellion against Gehlot last year.Pilot is believed to have been in touch with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who played an important role in resolving the political crisis when he rebelled. There have also been demands for Cabinet expansion and political appointments for Pilot’s loyalists. Pilot last week expressed his displeasure over the lack of action even as a committee was formed last year to address the issues he raised against Gehlot. HT has reported the central leadership of the Congress was trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan.Also Read | As Sachin Pilot camps in Delhi, his loyalists continue attack on GehlotIn July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp in Haryana’s Manesar, threatening the stability of the Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as the state Congress chief. It was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold.Sharma said he went to Manesar as his works were not getting done. “But now promises made are fulfilled. All the demands are fulfilled in this budget.” He said nine cabinet berths are vacant and there are 25 aspirants.“Who should be taken, whether the MLAs, who came from BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party), Independents or those with Pilot... Gehlot will take this decision...” Sharma referred to the panel formed to resolve issues raised by the Pilot camp and added committees are formed to pacify people. “What is the fate of these committees? Everybody knows this. If justice is not done for a long time, then the matter is put in cold storage. One of the members of the panel has passed away.”Sharma said Pilot will not defect to the Bharatiya Janata Party. “The resentment issue is being exaggerated...Pilot himself has not said anything to date... This impasse will end soon.” He rejected allegations of phone tapping.Sharma is the third lawmaker from the Pilot faction, who has supported and praised Gehlot.Separately, Sandeep Kumar Yadav, who defected from the BSP and joined the Congress in 2019, said the Pilot camp is repeatedly talking about the workers and their share in the government. “But it was because of them that the government was in crisis last year. The government was saved only because we six and other independents were standing by the government.” He accused the Pilot camp of threatening the stability of the government last year. “The Congress high command should not listen to them. Those who saved the government should be rewarded and honoured.”There was no immediate repose from Pilot or his other loyalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-camp-mla-calls-gehlot-his-leader-says-everyone-must-accept-his-leadership-101623759845351.html

The meeting was held at party MP and newly-elected LJP parliamentary party leader and Paswan’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras’s residence in New Delhi. In a parallel meeting held at Paswan’s residence, the five rebel MPs were removed from the party. “A national executive meeting was held where the decision [to remove all the five MPs from the party] was taken,” party leader Raju Tiwari said. “There is a process of doing things in a party. This [the rebellion] is betrayal,” he said. Late on Monday evening, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the leader of the LJP parliamentary party. This came a day after five of the six party MPs informed Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that they had unanimously elected Paras as LJP’s parliamentary party leader.

Sources close to Paras said that the national council meeting, likely to take place in Patna, may make the MP the national president by amending the party’s constitution which favours one man one post. Meanwhile, after failing to meet his uncle Paras and cousin and Samastipur MP Prince Raj on Monday, Paswan reportedly left a letter behind, offering a compromise by making his mother Reena Paswan the national president. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he tried his best to keep the party together, sharing a letter he wrote to Pashupati Paras on March 29 this year where he urged his uncle to take responsibility of keeping the party united like his late father Ram Vilas Paswan. He also likened the party to a mother who should not be betrayed.Paswan assumed charge of LJP after his father died weeks before the Bihar elections last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-working-committee-removes-chirag-paswan-as-party-chief-101623759065574.html

15-06-2021||India||Odisha villagers oppose Nalco’s new red mud pond fearing impact on farmland||A village in Odisha’s Koraput district is opposing aluminium maker Nalco’s plan to build a new red mud pond, alleging the toxic waste would render their fields unsuitable for agriculture while causing diseases.Since last week, more than 600 tribals, Dalits and members of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) in Dengajaniguda village under Dasamantpur block of Koraput district have been preventing the revenue officials from identifying land near their village for construction of Nalco’s second red mud pond. Red mud, also known as bauxite residue, is an industrial waste generated during the processing of bauxite into alumina (the Bayer process) and is composed of various oxide compounds, including iron oxides which give it the red colour. The disposal and utilisation of red mud have been traditionally hindered due to its extreme alkalinity (pH about 10.5–13.5).Villagers led by Bansi Bisoyi said the existing red mud pond of the alumina refinery, situated about two kms from the village, has already led to several health problems. “Our tubewells spew red water and it is leading to several skin problems among villagers. The doctors are not able to detect the ailments. Water seeping from the first red mud pond has destroyed our farmland, natural streams, nullahs and has affected many people. We are forced to collect water from nearby streams,” alleged Bisoyi. Another villager Tuni Muduli alleged leaching of chemicals from the existing red mud pond has rendered farmlands unsuitable for cultivation.Bisoyi said as the proposed red mud pond is just about 200 metres away from their village, it would further imperil their life. “We have been suffering for more than a decade due to the existing red mud pond that was started in 1986. Imagine what would happen when the new one comes up very close to our homes. We would not let it happen,” said Bisoyi. The proposed red mud pond at Damanjodi block is located on the border of Dasmantpur and Damanjodi.Officials said local tehsildar Ajay Tirkey, accompanied by revenue inspectors, supervisors and a platoon of police force were not allowed to do a survey of the area last week. “The villagers asked us to return and didn’t listen. We had to come back,” said an official of the Koraput administration.Pinki Bisoyi, another villager, said they have not gained anything from Nalco’s alumina refinery, which came up in 80’s in Damanjodi. “As there is no high school, our children are unable to study beyond class 5. There is no employment for our youths,” she alleged.However, Nalco’s group general manager (refinery) Bhimsen Pradhan said the villagers’ allegations are not true. “Contrary to what the villagers allege, there is no leaching of chemicals from the existing red mud pond. For the new red mud pond, we are giving an extra layer of protection,” he said.Local politicians, meanwhile, have lent their support to the popular protest. “Nothing should be done at the expense of the health and lives of people. Nalco has not kept its promise in the past and so local people are wary of the company’s promises,” said Bharatiya Janata Party BJP leader Bhrugu Buxipatra.“It is injustice towards people from villages near Damanjodi who were affected due to Nalco’s mines and plant,” said Koraput district’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD) president Ishwar Chandra Panigrahi. Koraput MLA and district planning board chairman Raghuram Padal urged Nalco authorities to conduct a baseline socio-economic survey to ascertain the condition of people affected by the company’s plant and mines.In July 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) hauled up Nalco for exceeding its limit on daily discharge of red mud and red mud pond effluent. “The daily discharge of red mud and red mud pond effluent from the refinery was consistently higher than the corresponding limits specified by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board during the period from 2012-13 to 2016-17,” CAG report said, noting that Nalco discharged 6,723 tonnes of effluent daily, against the 6,087 tonnes limit set by the board. Similarly, on red mud pond effluent, the limit was set for 5,200 kilolitres per day but Nalco recorded 5,425 kilolitres discharge per day.“The company cannot change or alter either the quality or quantity of the rate of discharge without the previous approval of OSPCB,” the report said, recommending legal action under various laws.Incorporated in 1981 as a public sector enterprise of the central government, Nalco runs Asia’s largest integrated aluminium complex in Damanjodi. However, Nalco’s operations have been criticised for severe social, economic, cultural and environmental impacts, including displacement and inadequate compensation for rehabilitation.In the late 80’s, Nalco acquired over 250 acres of land from 9 families of Dengajaniguda for a pittance. Over the last 4 decades, the 9 families have split up and become more than 100 due to separation and marriages in the families. As the new families did not gain anything from the rehabilitation package declared decades ago, there is considerable resentment.A 2018 research into development, dispossession and impoverishment in villages displaced by Nalco, done by B K Srinivas and Jayanta Kumar, professors from Koraput’s Central University of Odisha, found that the living condition of the displaced people had turned worse over the years. “There is a lack of employment other than manual labour. Villages lacked civic amenities while children were deprived of schooling. Most of the displaced people lived in semi-pucca houses and their source of drinking water continued to be either open wells, hand pumps or pond water,” the study found.Activist Prafulla Samantra said most of the affected villages had lost fertile agricultural land. “Damanjodi has the highest number of displaced families where agricultural land was alienated. In several villages where land was acquired, people were not given any alternate livelihood. Besides, compensation for land was given only to those farmers who had pattas, and several adivasi and Dalit families who did not posses pattas never received compensation and lost their only source of livelihood,” alleged Samantra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-villagers-oppose-nalco-s-new-red-mud-pond-fearing-impact-on-farmland-101623757205316.html

The report released to mark the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day titled “The Silent Tormentor: Covid 19 & the Elderly” is based on a six-city survey of over 3,500 people. It found Covid-19 has led to an increased financial dependency among the elderly amid decreasing income among their caregivers. The report has highlighted the increased elderly abuse and how many old-age homes were struggling to stay afloat. It said the elderly people living in the household settings, mostly with their families, wanted someone to just be with them or to just call them to talk. “This when, over 58% of them had family members who were working or studying from home during the pandemic. Even after being in such close proximity to family, many said that they feel trapped and frustrated even in family settings,” the report said.Almost 40% of the respondents were financially dependent on others and most of them belonged to the age group of 80-89 years. Many respondents said they did not get the required assistance mostly because their caretakers either lost jobs or faced pay cuts.Also Read | For those with dementia, Covid’s impact has been brutalMost of the elderly surveyed complained of abuse. Though many were verbally abused by their home-restricted family members, 23% of them were even slapped or beaten. Nearly half of these abused people said the main abusers were their sons and while in a quarter of responses, it was daughters-in-law. Less than 15% said that daughters have been abusive towards them.Some of the major challenges that caregivers said they faced dealing with their elderly parents or grandparents during the pandemic were giving their medicines on time, taking care of their special food requirements, budgeting for their expenses. Many even said it was highly difficult to handle their mood swings.Half of the old-age homes that HelpAge surveyed faced scarcity of funds during the pandemic. As many as 37% of them said there were no isolation or quarantine rooms created in their old age homes. In these old-age homes, almost a quarter of the people surveyed said they were abused during the pandemic.The respondents were misinformed about vaccination with many claiming to be completely immune after getting vaccinated. Over 20% were not even aware of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.For almost 30% of the elderly people infected at these old age homes, no one from their families approached them to take their care.Rohit Prasad, CEO of HelpAge India, said while the elderly people have always been identified as the most vulnerable, there is an increased risk of abuse due to growing dependency. “While battling health issues, they (elderly) are also dealing with the loss of loved ones, and struggling at multiple levels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growing-abuse-dependency-and-loneliness-how-covid-is-affecting-india-s-elderly-101623756125165.html

He had taken over the reigns of the party after his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan died in October last year.Suraj Bhan Singh was made the national working president and was authorised to convene a meeting of party's national council within five days to elect its new national president.According to party officials familiar with the matter, the meeting to elect the party's next leader is likely to be held in Patna and chances are that Paswan's uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras will be made the next national president.As the news of Chirag Paswan being removed from the party's top post broke, his supporters smeared black ink on the posters of the five rebel LJP MLAs outside the party's office in Patna, news agency ANI reported.Bihar: Supporters of Chirag Paswan smear black ink on the posters of 5 LJP MPs including Pashupati Kumar Paras outside the party's office in Patna pic.twitter.com/J3K6KAhhXPThe development comes after five of the six LJP Lok Sabha MPs revolted and chose Paras as their leader on Saturday. Speaker Om Birla later cleared the proposal.On Monday, Paswan attempted reconciliation, but in vain, as the rebels rejected his proposal of giving the post of national party president to his mother, if not him.Paras, the younger brother of Ram Vilas Paswan, was at odds with his nephew's decision to break away from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar election last year. While LJP did not ended up winning only one seat, it was responsible for cutting out on the vote share of Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU).“There are 6 MPs in our party. It was the desire of 5 MPs to save our party. So, I’ve not broken the party, I’ve saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,” Paras said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirag-paswan-removed-from-the-post-of-national-president-of-ljp-101623755044048.html

An undisclosed number of Chinese troops were also killed in the first such clash between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in over five decades.“Having patiently waited for the government to come clean and inform the nation about the circumstances in which the unprecedented incident happened and reassure the people that the sacrifice of our brave jawans was not in vain, the Congress Party reiterates its concern that no clarity is yet available and the Prime Minister’s last word on the subject a year ago was that no transgression had occurred,” said Gandhi in a statement.Also Read | ‘Rahul Gandhi must answer’: Minister on fuel price hikes in Congress statesShe added the Congress has repeatedly sought information on the episode and details on what progress has been made to return to the status quo ante along the LAC.

In such a scenario, the weighted average price of Covaxin for all supplies realised by Bharat Biotech is less than ₹ 250 / dose. Going forward, ~75% of the capacity will be supplied to state and Central governments with only 25% going to private hospitals,” read the company statement.At least 40 million doses of Covaxin have been supplied to date, as per the company, and product development activities towards the development of vaccines against newer variants is also underway at their facilities.It also said that since the supply price of their vaccine to the Government of India ₹ 150 / dose, it is a non-competitive price and clearly not sustainable in the long run. Hence, a higher price in private markets is required to offset part of the costs.Currently, Covaxin is being sold to state governments at ₹400 per dose and at ₹1,200 per dose to private hospitals and institutions, which is significantly higher.“This is purely due to fundamental business reasons, ranging from low procurement volumes, high distribution costs and retail margins among few others…,” it said, and urged the government to allow them to maintain differential pricing for the government and private sector.The company has so far invested at least ₹ 500 crore at risk from its own resources for product development, clinical trials and setting up of manufacturing facilities for Covaxin. The support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was with respect to provision of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, animal studies, virus characterisation, test kits and partial funding for clinical trial sites. In return for this valuable support, Bharat Biotech will pay royalties to ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), based on product sales.According to people familiar with the matter, it is about 5% of the product sales.HT has reached out to the health ministry and this copy will be updated once it responds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-sought-indemnity-from-centre-for-any-covaxin-adverse-events-bharat-biotech-101623753112477.html

According to latest relaxation decided by the government, the night curfew timing has been revised to 9pm to 7am from 7pm to 7am.The decision was taken at a high-level Covid-19 review meeting held by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Restaurants and malls have also been allowed to open with 50 per cent of their capacity by following Covid-19 protocols prescribed by the government.The state government has also allowed parks and street food kiosks to open, asking them to install a Covid-19 helpdesk. Detailed guidelines will be released soon, the state government said.Last week, the state government announced relaxations in 'corona curfew' in all 75 districts of the state. The health department said that all the districts have less than 75 active cases of Covid-19 - one of the key measures announced by the UP government to relax the curfew.The 'corona curfew' was clamped on April 30 after a surge in cases of Covid-19. The state government allowed relaxations from June 1.On Monday, UP recorded 339 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 74 deaths, according to a health bulletin. This pushed the total number of tally to 17,02,937 and fatality count to 21,858, respectively.As many as 1,116 Covid-19 patients were discharged from the hospitals in 24 hours, taking the total number of recoveries to 16,72,968, Monday's bulletin said.A government spokesman said a special vaccination campaign for administering Covid vaccines to street vendors, rickshaw, e-rickshaw, tempo and auto drivers has been started in the state from Monday.These sections come in contact with a large number of people and therefore the government has decided to start a special vaccination campaign for them, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-further-relaxes-covid-19-restrictions-malls-and-restaurants-allowed-to-open-101623750972144.html

The state’s daily caseload now is around the same as when the second wave of Covid-19 began in India in April, raising hopes that lockdown restrictions could be relaxed in around half of its 30 districts.In the last 24 hours, Odisha reported 3,405 new cases, a drop of nearly 20% from the 4,339 new cases that it reported a day before that. The test positivity rate (TPR) which was 6.33% on Monday, reduced to 5.99% on Tuesday.The current phase of lockdown is scheduled to end on the morning of June 17, but the health department officials said it may continue in many coastal and interior districts where the total positivity rate and bed occupancy are still high. The districts of Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Balasore and Mayurbhanj are recording at least 2,500 active cases each, with Khurda leading the pack, while 16 districts are recording a TPR of over 5% since mid-May. Khurda too leads the pack of districts with high TPR at 13.4%.Also Read | Adhere to Covid-19 protocols as restrictions are eased: Rahul Gandhi“The government will review unlock measures only after assessing the present pandemic situation in the state,” said director of medical education and training Dr CBK Mohanty. “But even if the lockdown is lifted, night curfew may continue. People have to stay alert and follow all Covid-19-appropriate behaviour to avoid lockdowns in the future.”As per the government’s assessment, the situation in districts Ganjam, Gajapati, Deogarh, Nuapada, Balangir, Bargarh, Jharsuguda, Kandhamal and Sambalpur is well under control. “As per the data of last seven days, the TPR is below 5% in these districts and the number of active cases as well as patients in hospitals have drastically come down,” said a health department official. For example, in Jharsuguda district, the weekly TPR in the district has seen a sharp drop to 1.84% in the week ending June 14 from over 12% in the week ending on June 9. However, as per WHO’s recommended rate (one positive result for 10 administered tests), the epidemiological parameters may not favour lockdown relaxations in districts such as Sambalpur, Balangir, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Baragarh and Sonepur, which have higher rates. So weekend shutdown would continue in nearly 20 districts, according to a senior health department official.Officials said the districts of Bhadrak, Jajpur, Balasore, Khordha, Cuttack, Kendrapada, Puri and Angul will not see any relaxations in lockdown, except for opening up the window of essential business hours by nearly 2 hours as the TPR is high in these districts. To bring the situation under further control, the government is planning to extend the weekend shutdown till June 30. Non-essential shops in 16 districtsKhurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Puri, Nayagarh, Boudh, Jagatsinghpur, Mayurbhanj, Rayagada, Koraput, Keonjhar, Dhenkanal, Angul and Deogarh - may be allowed to open till 1pm and 5pm-8pm.While gyms and swimming pools are likely to remain closed till June 30, there is no news on when educational institutes would reopen.“As there is a threat to children in the anticipated third wave of Covid-19, the government is readying all infrastructure to deal with the situation. Only after reviewing the situation in the coming days, will chief minister Naveen Patnaik take an appropriate decision on reopening of schools,” said state school and mass education minister Sameer Dash. He said the government does not think it wise to reopen schools without vaccinating children above the age of 6 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-reduce-in-odisha-ease-of-restrictions-in-the-offing-101623750409053.html

The bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah took a dim view of the fact that Zaidi’s bail had to be cancelled in January 2020, after a Superintendent of Police (SP) stated before the Central Bureau of Information (CBI) court that she was being pressurised by him in an attempt to influence the trial. “If you can try to influence an IPS rank officer, what will happen to other ordinary witnesses in the case? We cannot lose sight of this fact against you,” said the bench, as it refused to grant bail to Zaidi.

He is facing a trial at the Chandigarh CBI court for the alleged custodial death of a man accused of participating in the gang rape and murder of a minor girl at Kotkhai, Himachal Pradesh, in 2017. In July 2017, following the directions of the Himachal Pradesh high court, the case was transferred to the CBI. The CBI booked nine policemen, including Zaidi, and filed the chargesheet. However, in November 2018, the accused moved the Supreme Court, seeking a transfer of the case from Shimla to any other state for the trial. In April 2019, the top court transferred the custodial death case to the Chandigarh CBI court from Shimla. It also granted bail to Zaidi on the condition that he would not try to influence witnesses or tamper with the evidence. But in January 2020, SP Soumya Sambasivan, who was a witness for the prosecution in the case, showed up before the trial court, contending Zaidi was trying to pressurise her to change her statement and to depose in his favour. Subsequently, the CBI court cancelled his bail. Later, Zaidi sought interim bail citing the Covid-19 outbreak, but the Chandigarh CBI court and the high court of Punjab and Haryana dismissed his plea, prompting him to approach the Supreme Court for the bail. The caseOn July 4, 2017, a minor girl went missing after school hours from Haliala forest at Kotkhai. Her naked body was found in the forest on July 6 and the post-mortem report confirmed rape. An FIR was registered at Kotkhai PS, and a special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the rape and murder. Zaidi was made to head the SIT. The SIT, on July 13, 2017, arrested one Suraj Singh, along with four others, for allegedly committing the crime. However, on the night of July 18, Singh died in custody after allegedly being tortured by the SIT.

An editorial in the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday said the work on the temple should be “transparent and honest” as it is a matter of “national pride”.Former Samajwadi Party lawmaker Tej Narayan Pandey and Aam Aadmi Party Parliament member Sanjay Singh have alleged that on March 18 a plot sold for ₹2 crore by two people was bought by the Trust overseeing the temple’s construction for ₹18.5 crore 10 minutes later.The Trust on Monday said the land was purchased at rates lower than market prices while refuting the allegations of corruption and dismissing demands for a probe into the land deal.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said the allegations and the evidence brought forward are “shocking”. He asked Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, the Trust, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to clarify their position on the allegations.Also Watch | Ram Temple: Congress’ 3 questions to PM Modi on alleged Ayodhya land deal fraud“The construction of the Ram temple and the procedure behind it must remain transparent and honest.

Sharma said there are times when people have to suppress their desires. The cabinet expansion has been put on hold after medical advise to the chief minister who is in post-Covid recovery stage."Nothing is going to happen for the next two months because CM is not meeting people in-person. I also wanted to become CM but sometimes we've to suppress our desires," Sharma said while interacting with reporters on Tuesday, as reported by news agency ANI.Also Read: As Sachin Pilot camps in Delhi, his loyalists continue attack on Gehlot"There is a proverb - 'Ek Anar, Sau Bimar' (something that's in short supply and high demand). But in this case, there are 25 'bimar' (aspirants). How many would get it (ministerial berths)?" he asked.The politician was at the centre of the storm that brewed in the ruling party in Rajasthan last year, siding with Sachin Pilot-led rebel camp. Sharma was suspended from the Congress party, but came back when the political crisis was resolved by the Congress top brass with a promise to accommodate Pilot loyalists in the government.Sharma reiterated on Monday that he is with the Congress and "Sachin Pilot and CM Ashok Gehlot are my leaders"."Pilot Sahab never demanded any post for himself. He has clarified that he will not join BJP. I believe some junior leaders have occupied some big posts, which is going to hurt the party. Senior-most leaders must be given due respect," he also said.On Monday, the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) of Ashok Gehlot informed that doctors have advised the chief minister to avoid one-on-one meeting."In view of the post-Covid repercussions, as a precautionary measure on the advice of doctors, the Chief Minister is not able to meet people in person. All meetings and interactions are being done through video conference and video calls only. The doctors have said that for a month or two, he should hold meetings with the video conference only. Department meetings and review meetings are also being held through video conferencing," said OSD Lokesh Sharma.At present, Rajasthan has 21 ministers, including the chief minister. The state with 200 assembly constituencies can appoint a maximum of 30 ministers. Last year's patch-up between Gehlot and Pilot factions happened after assurances from the Congress' central leadership that the rebels who followed the latter will be suitably accommodated.But last week, Pilot told Hindustan Times that the Congress high command had failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama.The high command, however, signalled to Pilot that it has initiated the process of reshuffling and that the process will be completed soon.After Jitin Prasada, a close aide of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi shifted to its political rival - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday, speculation is on about more leaders following his suit, including Congress leader Sachin Pilot, who is currently in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-much-awaited-rajasthan-cabinet-reshuffle-a-message-from-congress-leader-101623745218063.html

What happens if deadline is missed?||The government has announced that the last day to link the Permanent Account Number (PAN) card with the Aadhaar number is June 30, 2021. Failing to link the two would result in the PAN card becoming “inoperative” and a penalty of ₹1,000 would also be levied.Earlier, the government had set the deadline as March 31 to link the two documents after extending it multiple times. However, the date was again extended to June 30 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government said.In its order regarding the extension of the last date, the government said on March 31, “Representations have been received from taxpayers that the last date for intimating the Aadhaar number may further be extended in the wake of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping in view the difficulties faced by the taxpayers, the Central Government has issued notification today extending the last date for the intimation of Aadhaar number and linking thereof with PAN to 30th June, 2021”.Also read | Link PAN card and Aadhaar via income tax portal or SMS: A step-by-step guideWith the deadline of June 30 approaching and the government yet to announce any further postponement of the date, here are the ways to link PAN card and Aadhaar number:Linking PAN and Aadhaar via income tax department’s e-filing portalThe income tax department’s e-filing portal has a “Link Aadhaar” section on their list of services.

15-06-2021||India||Where the G7 summit failed||The much-awaited G7 communique from Carbis Bay is long on rhetoric and short on substance.The communique itself runs into 70 paragraphs, covering, as it were, the three Cs: Covid-19, climate and of course, China. For good measure, it also provides important clues into the thinking of G7 countries on issues such as trade, democracy, human rights, multilateralism and post-Covid-19 global economic recovery.On Covid-19, G7 is right to focus on vaccinating the world. After all, it is now conventional wisdom that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The trouble is that even assuming that all G7 countries, India and China can eventually take care of themselves (itself a tall order), at least three billion people in the rest of the world remain to be vaccinated. By providing for a paltry one billion vaccine doses over the next year, G7 has effectively indicated that even by the end of 2022, not everyone on this planet will be vaccinated.Also Read | Covid-19 virus quicker than vaccines, warns WHO as G7 vows to share dosesMore importantly, G7 ignores the three immediate actions recommended by the Report of the Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness and Response led by Helen Clark and Ellen Sirleaf, published in May 2021. The three actions included one billion vaccine doses by September 2021 and two billion doses by end of 2022; waiving intellectual property rights (IPR) if voluntary action does not occur quickly; and lastly, committing 60% of the $19 billion required for Access to Covid-19 Tools (Act) Accelerator in 2021 for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and strengthening of health systems. G7 falls short significantly on all three counts.On climate, the question before the Cornwall Summit was not whether G7 countries would commit to net zero emissions by 2050. That was the basic minimum that they were expected to do, and which they have done. The real question related to climate finance — how will the world’s richest countries meet their Paris Accord commitment of $100 billion every year to finance the energy transition of developing and least developed countries? Here again, the communique comes up with the vaguest of language, referring to increasing and improving climate finance to 2025 and reaffirming the developed country’s goal to mobilise $100 billion.China gets one full paragraph by way of attention. While saying they wish to cooperate with China on issues such as climate, G7 countries call on it to respect human rights in Xinjiang and autonomy for Hong Kong. Taiwan gets a mention, perhaps for the first time, with G7 countries underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. This is certain to roil the Chinese.G7, it must be said, has made a valiant attempt to counter the Belt Road Initiative with its own Build Back Better for the World (B3W) plan that aims to orient development finance towards resilient infrastructure, health systems, digital solutions and advancing gender equality and education. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. On the issue of gender equality, a target has been set for getting 40 million more girls into education with funding of $2.75 billion for the Global Partnership for Education. This is welcome.The biggest signal for China is perhaps the “Open Societies Statement” signed by G7 and guest countries comprising India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. The statement spells out the unconditional commitment of these countries to human rights for all, both online and offline, democracy, social inclusion, gender equality, freedom of expression and rule of law. At a time when there has been backsliding on these issues worldwide, including in the guest countries, this is a welcome move and is perhaps the best sign that democracies can unite on the basis of these universal values. China may pretend not to care about this, but you can be sure it will be concerned.How should India read the G7 Summit?First, PM Narendra Modi’s statement that India is a natural ally of G7, with an emphasis on its civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty, will be welcomed by India’s friends all over the world. It is no secret that an impression, rightly or wrongly, has gained currency internationally that there has been some backsliding on these metrics in India. The PM’s statement should put these doubts about India’s commitment to rest.Second, on climate finance, India has a mountain to climb. India will come under pressure at the COP 26 meeting in Glasgow to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050. Not just this, the communique appears to endorse the idea of “carbon leakage” and hence gives implicit approval to European Union’s idea of carbon border tax. This is particularly unwelcome for India.Finally, the communique harps on “fair trade” much more than it does on “free trade”. Fair trade, by definition, stresses labour and environmental standards and the communique says as much. How these will be implemented without resort to protectionism remains to be seen. Similarly, G7 also endorses plurilateral initiatives at the World Trade Organization, something India hitherto has studiously avoided. Things will come to a head at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in December.Mohan Kumar is a retired diplomat, chairman of RIS, and dean and professor at Jindal Global UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-the-g7-summit-failed-101623744950296.html

It is really unfortunate that those who are supposed to safeguard the rights of the children are exploiting them,” said Benudhar Senapati, director of Childline NGO, which was involved in the rescue.As per Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, employing children under the age of 14-years is a crime and therefore a case has been filed under the act. However, the former bureaucrat will be booked after further probe, officials said.The minor girl, a student of class 5, was allegedly trafficked from her village in Berhampur in Ganjam district in November 2020 and engaged in domestic work at the residence of the retired collector. Her father is a rickshaw puller and mother works as a domestic help.Officials said the girl was produced before the additional chairperson of Khurda Child Welfare Committee as is mandated under the Juvenile Justice Act. CWC sent her to a child-care institution in Bhubaneswar and ordered further probe by Ganjam CWC as well as CWC of Gajapati district, her native home.Childline NGO has also filed a separate petition with the Odisha State Commission for Protection of Child Rights seeking action in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minor-domestic-help-rescued-from-former-district-collector-s-bhubaneswar-house-101623743329080.html

The ambulance carrying the woman started its journey at 6.30am and is expected to cover the distance in eight hours instead of the usual 10-11 hours.Four police vehicles escorted the ambulance up to the Meghalaya border. The Meghalaya police are to offer the same support before it re-enters Kamrup (Metropolitan) in Assam en route to Guwahati. Officials said this was the longest green corridor being provided for a medical emergency in the northeast.The patient, Era Choudhury, was admitted to a Silchar hospital on May 25 and suffers from pneumonia. She is also diabetic and has a history of hypertension, said Dr Amit Kalowar, who was treating her.“Considering her condition, the woman’s family decided to shift the patient from Silchar to Guwahati after consulting some senior doctors,” he said.Also Read | Assam students approach SC seeking cancellation of Class 10, 12 board examsEra Choudhury’s son, Soumen, who requested the district administration for the green corridor, said doctors told them she was not fit to fly and hence they were taking her to Guwahati by road.Cachar police superintendent Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar said he has spoken to his counterparts in Meghalaya and requested them to facilitate the smooth passage of the ambulance. “Our team has escorted the ambulance and cleared the roads till the Meghalaya border. From there, the officials of the neighbouring state are coordinating. After crossing Meghalaya, they will reach Kamrup Metropolitan district.”This is the third green corridor provided by Cachar administration within a month, and the fourth overall.Last year, a 33-year-old man was airlifted from Silchar to Kolkata after testing positive for Covid-19, but he was declared dead on arrival there.This month a 68-year-old man with post-Covid complications was moved to Silchar airport through a green corridor but an air ambulance could not fly him due to his condition. The patient was taken back to the Silchar hospital, and he died within an hour. Another patient was airlifted from Silchar to Guwahati on June 5 and a green corridor was provided for that as well.A green corridor for a medical emergency was created for the first time in Assam in 2017 to shift a critically ill four-month-old boy to the Guwahati airport.

Besides this, the 2013 Depsang Bulge legacy issue is still to be addressed with the PLA blocking Indian patrols to patrolling points 10 to 13 in the area south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.The matters stand further complicated with the PLA inducting another division strength formation from Xinjiang area for the annual military exercises that start around April and end around June every year. The ground exercises are coordinated with air defence war games and this time the Chinese air force flew J-11 and J-17 fighters to test their reaction capabilities. “While the PLA have still deployed more than two divisions along with artillery, armour and rocket support elements since the May 2020 transgression, the Indian Army is watching whether the additional division inducted for exercises goes back to its bases in Xinjiang post June,” said a government analyst.A Cabinet minister confirmed to Hindustan Times that the situation in East Ladakh continues to be tense but under control with the fear that any accident akin to Galwan skirmish could lead to horizontal flare-up between the two deployed armies. “The Chinese have still not agreed to dates to the 12th round of military talks to defuse the Gogra-Hot Springs situation as they want the issue to be settled locally. The forces are deployed on both sides and the PLA is rapidly building military infrastructure behind the Line of Actual Control (LAC) from Karakoram Pass in Ladakh to Kibuthoo in Arunachal Pradesh. Situation can go south any moment and hence we have to be prepared,” he said.Senior analyst believe that the Xi Jinping regime may time the Gogra-Hot Springs resolution with the 13th BRICS summit, hosted by India later this year and feel the PLA posture will remain the same till Beijing celebrates 100 years of Chinese Communist Party (CCP next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-de-escalation-at-gogra-area-stuck-an-year-after-bloody-galwan-skirmish-101623741024081.html

Being rescued to safety. Though [the leopard’s] identity will be ascertained scientifically. Advisories may still be followed. Cats are still out there. Results of tinkering with their habitats," Budgam deputy commissioner Shabaz Mirza tweeted on Tuesday morning.The leopard dragged the four-year-old girl away on June 3, when she was playing on the lawn of her house at Ompora village. Her mutilated body was recovered in the forest nursery about one kilometre from her house the next day.According to official records, 196 people have been killed and 2,325 injured since 2011 in attacks by wild animals in Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir has accounted for 118 deaths and 1,877 injuries, while 78 deaths and 448 injuries have been recorded in the Jammu region.Forest officials said two leopards have recently been trapped but more than four are still roaming in the area, where the last incident took place. Local residents and politicians blamed the wildlife department saying it ignored their complaints about the increased citing of the animal in the area, leading to the incident.“...Incidents involving the same wild animal occurred multiple times in the recent months in areas as close to [the] DC’s (District Collector) office. People then were lucky, but this time this innocent little soul had to pay with her life,” former minister and MLA Ruhullah Medhi said after the girl’s deathPeople in the district fear similar attacks and since the last few days, the wildlife department has received numerous calls claiming leopards were spotted in the area. The past many years have seen a rise in the incidents of man animal conflicts.

This follows a government decision in January this year to buy these minor millets from farmers and tribals of the state. The procurement will be done through Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce Association (SMFPA) and the produce will be sold under the brand name of Chhattisgarh Herbals. The SMFPA has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Institute of Millets Research for better processing of Kodo-Kutki. Also Read | Chhattisgarh farmer’s suicide note alleges injustice by revenue officer“Villagers living near the forests grow Kodo-Kutki and Ragi...earlier, they weren’t getting a good price for their produce so the government decided to step in.

Millets are also cultivated in lands with low fertility, mountainous terrain, tribal and even rain-fed areas in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, apart from Chhattisgarh. It is a kharif crop and is sown in July.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, millets are drought-tolerant and resistant to climate change. They are suitable for small growers as their cultivation requires lesser water than that of rice and wheat. In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government decided to procure seven other forest produce at minimum support price from the tribals: Kusmi seed, Reetha fruit (dry), Shikakai, Satavar roots, Kaju Guthli, Malkangani seeds, and Mahul leaves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-process-sell-millets-procured-from-tribals-101623738168676.html

In tehsildar’s court... the farmer was found guilty of encroaching on Kotwar’s land. The tehsildar passed an order for demarcation last year in May itself. However, fifteen days ago, Kotwar again accused the farmer of encroachment. This time, however, no revenue officials were involved,” said the collector.He said the deceased farmer never filed a review petition against the 2020 demarcation ruling by the tehsildar, however, the administration has attached him to the district headquarters to ensure a fair probe into the case.“The patwari who was tasked with [the] demarcation has been suspended and the additional collector has been put in-charge of the inquiry,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-farmer-s-suicide-note-alleges-injustice-by-revenue-officer-101623737748607.html

First, he was booked under Section 153 IPC but later we were told that he was also held under Sections 107 and 151,” he said. Under Sections 107 and 151, a person can be put under preventive detention on the directions of an executive magistrate if there is an apprehension of breach of peace.Ahmad said a delegation even met Jyotsna and apologised on behalf of Sofi. “She said that we should talk to Mir,” he said.Jyotsna, Khan, and Mir did not respond to calls for comments.Tariq Ahmad, the Safapora police station in-charge, said Sofi has been arrested but refused to provide further details. “I am not authorised to provide you with the information. Please call the SSP,” he said.In a tweet, former minister and People’s Conference president Sajad Lone said: “Don’t get it wrong. Don’t make it a Kashmir Kashmir thing. It is an existential crisis for democracy. It is about democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-in-kashmir-for-offending-official-say-locals-101623736968432.html

The bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice MR Shah also said on Friday that it was of the view that the compensation money should be transferred to the Kerala high court so that disbursement could be properly monitored.India accused the two marines on board the MV Enrica Lexie -- an Italian flagged oil tanker -- of killing the two Indian fishermen who were on a fishing vessel in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in February 2012.

15-06-2021||India||Over 900 Central government employees died from March to May||Over 900 Central government employees died from March to May, up from the 600 during the same period last year, officials aware of the matter said. The deaths coincided with the second Covid-19 second wave which overwhelmed the country. It was unclear whether all these deaths were because of the pandemic.An official said in nearly all of the Central ministries, at least 20-30% of the people were affected by the pandemic. In April, the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) was one of the worst-hit by Covid-19 with nearly 80 officials testing positive for the disease. The ministry of information technology was forced to ask most of its officials to work from home for two weeks as many of them contracted the disease.Officials said nearly 50% of the agriculture ministry staff contracted Covid-19. G Narayana Raju, the secretary of the legislative department, ministry of law and justice, was among those who died of Covid-19 in May. Dayawanti Srivastava, Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, and Pushpavant Sharma from the Indian Information Service also succumbed to the disease.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 cases, deaths fall further to 60,471 and 2726According to a second official, 73 people working at the Central Secretariat died of Covid-19. “There is a lot of congestion in certain sections... if one person gets the infection, it travels very quickly,” the official said. “The officials try to maintain social distancing and wear masks but even then, many have contracted the virus. Overcrowding is a major reason for the spread of this highly communicable disease.”The official added people across departments also realised the urgency of the work, which prompted them to attend office. “Even I contracted Covid, but the work is such that we must attend office,” the official said. “There are nearly 150 officials associated with the Central Secretariat who are still positive. Moreover, it is not just us, but even our family members who have suffered because of this.”The government has introduced a scheme to ensure the immediate release of pensions to the families of the employees who have died due to the pandemic.The second official said that considering the toll the pandemic has taken, the government should consider more compassionate appointments (of family members in case of untimely deaths) to support those who have suffered. “At present, compassionate appointments stand at 5%. The government should consider expanding this.”On Monday, the DoPT asked officials of the rank of undersecretary and above to attend office on all working days. Officials below the rank will continue to work at 50% staff strength, with staggered timings in place.The department reversed its order from the third week of April, wherein the government reintroduced staggered timings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-900-central-government-employees-died-from-march-to-may-101623733548600.html

They added that there is no immediate cause for concern in India as its incidence in the country is still low.The already deadly Delta variant led the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and even scuttled UK PM Boris Johnson's plan to open the country from June 21. That date was pushed to July 19 on Monday due to high dominance of the Delta variant in cases being reported in the country.The newly-mutated 'Delta Plus' variant is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India, the scientists said.Here is everything you need to know about the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus disease:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-deadly-variant-of-coronavirus-101623731842083.html

Jagarnath Mahto was brought to Jharkhand on a special chartered flight under the observation of two doctors from Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), Ranchi, by the state government. Chief minister Hemant Soren received him at Ranchi’s Birsa Munda airport on Monday evening.

15-06-2021||India||After Punjab, Rajasthan, trouble brews for Congress in Kerala||The Congress, which has been busy tackling discontent in its Punjab and Rajasthan units, now faces a similar situation in Kerala, where a section of senior leaders is upset at being sidelined and ignored, people aware of the matter said.The discontent within the party surfaced in the southern state after it removed its Kerala unit chief M Ramachandran and the Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala as it failed to return to power. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front swept back to power in Kerala last month.Leaders in the Chennithala camp alleged that he did not get an “honourable exit” and an appointment to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. They say he was not even consulted before the names of the new state unit chief and the opposition leader were announced.Also Read | Gujarat Congress leader Hardik Patel denies reports on joining AAPA Chennithala loyalist said that he deserved an honourable exit. “The Congress president or Rahul Gandhi could have called him for a meeting to explain the situation and why it was necessary to bring fresh faces. Instead, the changes were made without consulting him or former CM (chief minister) Oommen Chandy,” the leader said, requesting anonymity.The leader claimed most of the lawmakers wanted Chennithala to continue. But another leader said that was not the case. “Most of the young MLAs (members of legislative assembly) and the MPs (members of Parliament) of the party suggested changes. Tariq Anwar, the Congress’ in charge of the state, held an extensive discussion with MLAs, MPs, and leaders in the organisation.”VD Satheesan is the new opposition leader while K Sudhakaran has been named as the new Kerala Congress chief.Kerala observers in the Congress maintain Chennithala, 65, still has a lot to offer to the party but they were not certain how a senior leader like him would be accommodated. The post of the opposition United Democratic Front convenor is currently vacant. But K Muraleedharan, son of former chief minister K Karunakaran, is seen as the frontrunner for the post.Congress leaders maintain the crisis in Kerala is not as big as it is in poll-bound Punjab or Rajasthan. But they admit that if Chennithala, who is a prominent leader, is not placated, the factionalism in the Kerala unit might deepen further. Earlier this year, PC Chacko, a Congress leader in Kerala, left the party alleging factionalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-punjab-rajasthan-trouble-brews-for-congress-in-kerala-101623731388301.html
15-06-2021||India||‘Not defections but violence will weaken BJP unit in West Bengal’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is concerned over the impact of the post-poll violence against its workers on its organisational strength but sees no threat to its growing clout in West Bengal by the return of former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders to the state’s ruling party, functionaries aware of the matter said.The BJP, which won 77 seats with a vote share of about 38% in the assembly elections held in March and April, has emerged as the main opposition in the state. The Congress and the Left parties failed to secure even a single seat in the 294-seat assembly.On Friday, the BJP’s national vice president Mukul Roy, without sending his resignation to the party high command, switched back to the TMC. There is speculation that some other leaders, who joined the BJP, could also return to the TMC. Last month, Sonali Guha, who also defected to the BJP in the run-up to the polls, regretted her decision and indicated that she wants to return to TMC.Is the BJP geared for facing defections?A state leader, who did not wish to be named, said the party unit has been in “disarray” even before the elections began. “There were differences in the unit about the state leadership. There were many people who have been with the BJP for years withstanding pressure and violence, but they were overlooked when about 20 odd TMC turncoats were given tickets to contest. That demoralised the cadre. These defections are bad for the party’s image,” the leader said.Also Read | TMC urges Lok Sabha Speaker to disqualify turncoat MPs including Sisir AdhikariWhile some leaders admit that the desertions are bad optics, especially since the BJP has emerged as a strong contender in the state, they say that the threat to the party does not come from defections.“Roy or any other leaders leaving will not impact the party. In West Bengal politics an individual is not above the party. Here the party symbol matters more than the perception of a person. Politics here has been between binaries, earlier it was the Left against the TMC, now it is the TMC against the BJP,” said Samik Bhattacharya, the chief spokesperson for the BJP in the state.Though the central leadership of the BJP has not officially commented on the defections, particularly by Roy, who was given a position in the national team, a second functionary said some defections could be a result of pressure.“Roy has some 60 plus cases filed against him. A Member of Parliament, Arjun Singh, has about 90 cases filed against him. So, it is possible that some of the former TMC leaders are returning because of fear of excesses by the TMC,” said the leader.The desertions have underscored the need for better coordination in the state unit and between the central leadership and the state unit, said a third leader. “There was never a doubt that Roy’s role was overstated. A section of leaders had conveyed to Delhi the concern that the central leadership was banking too much on turncoats and unable to address the concerns of the workers. However, no action was taken. Now we have a bigger problem to address, the continued violence against the workers,” the third functionary said.Some leaders, including Tathagata Roy, also stoked a controversy by referring to Roy and other TMC turncoats as “Trojan Horses”. The statement was condemned by Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta. “It is wrong to view everyone who joined BJP in Bengal after May 2019 as Trojan horses. Many new entrants participated in the election with sincerity. They must not be made to feel unwelcome. Politics is not a game of exclusion; it involves adding support & creating new leaders. As for those who see a political party as a vehicle of personal gratification alone, the door is always open to explore other options,” Dasgupta tweeted.Violence will weaken the partyThe BJP attributes the continued violence against its workers to the party’s growing heft in the state. It is also concerned that the violence will instil fear in the cadres as well as those who sympathise with the BJP.“The fact that the TMC resorted to violence after it won the elections with a huge mandate shows it sees the BJP as a threat. What is really hurting the party is not anyone leaving, but this violence against the workers,” said Shishir Bajoria, state executive member of the BJP.Also Read | ‘Where are your 25 MLAs?,’ TMC MP Banerjee asks BJP’s Suvendu AdhikariThe continued attacks against the cadres were also flagged by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the BJP. An RSS functionary said the fear of being attacked can have an adverse impact on Sangh’s work. “After many years, the Sangh’s presence has increased on the ground through shakhas (branches) and meetings. If these attacks continue then those who attend these meetings will also fear being targeted,” the functionary said.RSS shakhas have gone up from 875 in 2014 to about 1,200 in 2019.All eyes on the CentreThe state BJP unit, which claims that the police have not taken action against the perpetrators of violence, is now resting its hope on the Union government.“In the last three years, we have seen 138 causalities. Between May 2, when the results were declared, and May 5, when the TMC government was sworn in, we lost 10 workers, and since May 5 till date have lost 29 workers. There is an absolute violation of laws. BJP workers are not being given vaccines, thousands of them are unable to return home. There is a perception among people that only the Centre can now bring about a change and end this cycle of violence,” said Bhattacharya.TMC leader Tapas Roy rejected the BJP’s allegation of widespread violence in West Bengal and said there was no such thing. “The BJP is trying to disturb the peace as it not being able to digest the humiliating defeat. Even suicides are being tagged as political violence. In many cases, it was the BJP’s internal fighting. There were some incidents soon after the poll results were declared but at that time the law and order were under the jurisdiction of the ECI [Election Commission of India].”Roy maintained there has been no widespread violence after Mamata Banerjee took over as the chief minister on May 5. “The chief minister has directed the police to take strong actions against any such incidents.”Prof Abdul Matin of the Jadavpur University said the defections will not adversely impact the BJP if the party focuses on building its organisation. “It is true that there is widespread violence against the opposition parties across the state and it is the responsibility of the TMC to take care of this. This violence can be attributed to the binary era of politics in the state which is TMC versus BJP. As for TMC turncoats returning to the party, it will send a bad signal to the workers in rural Bengal. The defections will increase internal factionalism in the TMC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-defections-but-violence-will-weaken-bjp-unit-in-west-bengal-101623730788525.html
15-06-2021||India||As Delta wreaks havoc, five questions answered about the new Covid variant||The delta variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has led to renewed concerns across the world getting ready to ease the restrictions. The variant is highly transmissible, and currently makes up 6% of all cases in the US.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a four-week delay in the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England - set for June 21 - due to the Delta variant. Dubbed "Freedom Day", the last and fourth stage of the lockdown roadmap has now moved to July 19.The Delta variant was first reported in India and later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a 'variant of concern'.So how has the variant affected the fight against Covid-19 across the world? And are vaccines effective against it? Here are a few questions answered:Why the world is concerned about the Delta variant?First detected in India, the Delta variant of Covid-19 is 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first detected in United Kingdom’s Kent. The estimates for doubling rate (time taken for the number of infections to double) of infection for the Delta is also relatively high, with doubling time ranging from 4.5 days to 11.5 days.The Delta variant is said to be the reason behind the surge during the second wave of the pandemic.Are vaccines showing any efficacy against the Delta variant?Absolutely. A new analysis by Public Health England (PHE) showed on Monday that Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalisation from the Delta coronavirus variant. Last week, researchers at Pune’s Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is also effective in neutralising the Delta and Beta variants of Sars-CoV-2.However, a study conducted by Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said last week that the Delta variant can infect vaccinated people, though the infection does not become severe.Has the Delta variant mutated further?The scientists in India have said that they have found a mutated variant of the predominant B.1.617.2, which is wreaking havoc across the world. Called 'AY.1' or 'Delta plus', the new variant is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India.Vinod Scaria, clinician and scientist at Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said on Twitter on Monday that the new mutation is characterised by the acquisition of K417N mutation. It in the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells, he added.According to Public Health England, 63 genomes of Delta variant with the new K417N mutation have been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID. However, in India, its incidence is still low.How crucial is vaccination now?Considering the rapid mutation of the original Sars-CoV-2 virus, which led to the spread of the coronavirus disease, it is very important now to get yourself vaccinated. The second wave of the pandemic, led by the Delta variant, showed how rapidly the infection was spreading. It also caused a high number of fatalities.A number of pharmaceutical companies have said that their vaccines are effective against the Delta variant. So, it is always advisable to take a shot of vaccine in order to create a large immunity pool.Is an increased gap in dosage interval a cause of concern?A few media reports have claimed that it would be better to shorten the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine, in light of the variants in circulation. But on Monday, Dr V K Paul, member (Health) at Niti Aayog, said there is a need to balance such concerns.He said at a press conference that there is no need to panic. "We must remember that when we increased the gap, we had to consider the risk posed by the virus to those who have received only one dose. But the counterpoint was that more people will then be able to get the first dose, thereby giving a reasonable degree of immunity to more people."He appealed to the public to respect the decision taken by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), a body of globally renowned experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-delta-wreaks-havoc-5-questions-answered-about-the-new-coronavirus-variant-101623729090121.html

15-06-2021||India||Monsoon progress over rest of NW India to slow down||After advancing into most parts of the country, including many parts of northwest India, monsoon is likely to slow down, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.Monsoon has so far advanced into the entire peninsular India; east central; east and northeast India and some parts of northwest India. It progressed very quickly over most parts of the country in the span of only ten days mainly due to active monsoon circulations and formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal.“However, due to approaching mid-latitude westerlies winds further progress of monsoon over remaining parts of northwest India is likely to be slow. The progress of monsoon is being monitored continuously and further updates will be provided on a daily basis,” IMD said on Monday.The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) is passing through Diu, Surat, Nandurbar , Bhopal, Nowgong, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar. Monsoon has not arrived over Delhi yet.“A westerly system is approaching which will slowdown the progress of monsoon. It will both weaken the easterly winds, crucial for monsoon rains and curb the coverage of easterlies in northwest India, especially in north Haryana and north Punjab region. After two more days, the easterlies may be able to reach up to certain parts of Uttar Pradesh. We are constantly monitoring the conditions, if the parameters are met, monsoon may make onset over Delhi in the next 2-3 days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Also Read | IMD predicts rainfall in Punjab and Haryana, issues alerts for KeralaMany parts of northwest India recorded “large excess” (60% or more above normal) rains between June 1 and June 13. Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi recorded 134%, 219% and 44% above normal rain; Punjab 180% and Uttar Pradesh 64%; Uttarakhand recorded 29% excess rain.“Early in the month we recorded good rains over northwest India due to a western disturbance and later, due to the development of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. Safdarjung station, for example, in Delhi recorded 88% excess rain. But now, monsoon has not covered the entire west Uttar Pradesh. Entire west and east UP have to be covered before monsoon moves to Delhi-NCR. There is a trough (low pressure area) in the westerlies which may bring thundershowers but that won’t be monsoon rain. There is a slowing down of the monsoon flow presently,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The low pressure area which formed over Bay of Bengal is now over south Jharkhand and neighbourhood. It is likely to move west-northwestwards. A trough (area of low pressure) is running from west Rajasthan to northeast Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels and another trough runs from eastcentral Arabian Sea to south Konkan in mid tropospheric levels. An off shore trough at mean sea level is running from south Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast. Under the influence of these systems, widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning are likely over most parts of east, central and northeast India during the next 4-5 days. Isolated extremely heavy (over 20 cm) is likely over Bihar on June 15. Heavy to very heavy rain, thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Konkan, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala and Mahe.Scattered rain is likely over most parts of NW India during the next three days and then, there is likely to be a decrease in rainfall in all parts of NW India except east Uttar Pradesh. Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning and strong gusty winds are likely over Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar on June 14 and 15; over Punjab and Haryana on June 15. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals staying outdoors, IMD warned. Monsoon is normally expected to cover all parts of the country, except a small part of Rajasthan, by July 5. It advanced to most parts of Madhya Pradesh, the entire Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, most parts of east Uttar Pradesh and some parts of west Uttar Pradesh, entire Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and some parts of north Haryana, Chandigarh and north Punjab on Sunday.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the four-month season that is crucial for the country’s farm-dependent economy and for rice, soybeans, and cotton cultivation. A normal monsoon this year will significantly help the agriculture sector. Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the pandemic. India has over 150 million farmers and nearly half of Indians are dependent on a farm-based income. As much as 60% of India’s net-sown area does not have access to irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-progress-over-rest-of-nw-india-to-slow-down-101623727068421.html

A separate centre shall be set up within hospitals for parents to stay,” a Delhi government official was quoted as saying by Live Hindustan.Also Read: Sputnik V likely to be available at Delhi hospital from todayAdditionally, the panel has suggested that health workers need to be trained to look after children admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Its recommendations also include setting up paediatric ICUs, as well as arranging for more than 10,000 ICU beds to prepare for a possible third wave of Covid-19.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to take a call on the recommendations soon.Also Read: How can India prepare for the third waveVarious experts, including the central government’s principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan, have projected that a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic will hit the country soon. The third wave, the experts have warned, could be particularly hard-hitting for children. This has led to preparations being made on a large scale to protect children from the next phase of the viral disease.

15-06-2021||India||Assam students approach SC seeking cancellation of Class 10, 12 board exams||A group of students from Assam have petitioned the Supreme Court on Monday to cancel state board examinations for Class 10 and 12 to ensure equality with CBSE and other boards that have cancelled examinations. They have also challenged the state government’s criteria for holding examinations as flawed. “Classification sought to be made in present case between CBSE (Central Board Of Secondary Education), CISE (Council for Indian School Certificate Examination) and other state board students on one hand and the students of Assam SEBA (Secondary Education Board of Assam) and AHSEC (Assam Higher Secondary Education Council) on the other hand are prima facie irrational, unreasonable and is bad in law on the ground of violation of the basic feature of our Constitution, namely the principles of equality enshrined under Article 14,” the application said.Several states have announced cancellation of board examinations following CBSE’s lead to protect students from coronavirus infections. CBSE and other education boards have said they will come up with an alternate mechanism to rate students’ performances. However, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state will conduct board examinations in mid-July if the Covid-19 positivity rate in the state drops below 2% by July 1.“The questions papers are likely to be multiple-choice ones, allowing students to score good marks. The exams will be held following Covid-19 protocol provided the positivity rate drops below 2%. If it is above that, we will ask schools to evaluate the students,” he said last week.The students, who seek to join other petitions on the same issue filed earlier in the Supreme Court, have also questioned the state government’s logic and said that the positivity rate on July 1 might have no relevance on the date when the exams are proposed to be conducted.“Positivity rate data is very dynamic in nature which has the potential to increase or decrease exponentially within the span of less than 24 hours,” the application filed through advocate Manu Jetley stated.Test positivity rate refers to percentage of tested samples that turn out to be positive it indicates the spread of the infection in a region.Two independent health experts refused to comment on the issue saying the matter was sub judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-students-approach-sc-seeking-cancellation-of-class-10-and-class-12-board-exams-101623722988358.html
15-06-2021||India||Sero survey in Haryana from today. What you need to know||Haryana will start the state’s third round of sero survey on Tuesday to determine the prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in people, including children aged 6 years and above. “It will help us plan and strengthen our paediatric services, including the establishment and upscale of intensive care units. The study will flag susceptible populations and areas in the state and help us channelise and prioritise the vaccination drive in these areas,” Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (health), said last week. Arora said the study will also help determine the effect and efficacy of vaccination. The senior official said the third round of the sero survey was being conducted is to identify the impact of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic on the community. The seroprevalence in the first round, which was conducted in August, was found to be 8%. It increased to 14.8% in October.Also read | Sero survey will help in building strategy on Covid vaccination: ExpertsHere’s what you need to know about sero survey:How is it done?Blood samples are taken from randomly selected people as part of the sero survey to study the scale of undetected infections. Blood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are important to determine whether a disease has entered the community transmission stage.Also read | Past Covid infection does not fully protect people against re-infection: StudyA serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of the population exposed to Sars-Cov-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by ICMR for its high sensitivity and specificity.What did past sero surveys in India say?The earlier sero surveys suggested that a significant size of the population was still susceptible to catching the viral infection, and India was far from achieving herd immunity. The first one was designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more from 21 states, where the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population.Also read | More antibodies in women to fight Covid-19: BMC sero surveyThe first sero survey conducted in May last year found the infection rate to be 0.73% nationally. Nearly one in 15 (6.6%) people above the age of 10 were found to be exposed to the virus till August 2020 in the second one. Conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021, the third sero survey found 21.4% of those aged 10 and above infected with the virus.In the second and third rounds, all other parameters were the same except for the age bracket — samples were taken from people aged 10 and above.When will the fourth national sero survey start?The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR’s) fourth round of sero survey to detect the prevalence of Sars-CoV-2 , the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), will begin this month in 70 districts in 21 states. Blood samples will also be collected from health care workers in district hospitals of these districts.States, where the samples will collected for sero survey, include Andhra Pradesh (Krishna, SPSR Nellore, Vizianagram), Assam (Udalguri, Kamrup Metropolitan, Karbianglong), Bihar (Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Begusarai, Madhubani, Buxar, Arwal), Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kabirdham, Surguja), Gujarat (Mahisagar, Narmada, Sabar Kantha), Jharkhand (Latehar, Pakur, Simdega), Karnataka (Bengaluru urban, Chitradurga, Kalaburagi), Kerala (Palakkad, Ernakulam, Thrissur), Madhya Pradesh (Dewas, Ujjain, Gwalior), Maharashtra (Beed, Nanded, Parbhani, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Sangli), Odisha (Rayagada, Ganjam, Koraput), Punjab (Gurdaspur, Jalandhar), Haryana (Kurukshetra), Rajasthan (Dausa, Jalore, Rajsamand), Tamil Nadu (Tiruvannamalai, Coimbatore, Chennai), Telangana (Kamareddy, Jangaon, Nalgonda), and Uttar Pradesh (Amroha).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-in-haryana-from-today-what-you-need-to-know-101623720473765.html

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Facebook, also informed the high court that keeping in mind the grievance raised by the petitioner, the copies of the petition shall not be distributed to any unrelated third party.The controversy pertains to highly “obnoxious and objectionable” posts put up by a user on Instagram, as submitted to the court by petitioner Aditya Singh Deshwal. The petitioner also argued that the said content showed abusive language written about Hindu deities, along with their ”vulgar” representation through cartoons and graphics. He also sought directions to Instagram to preserve all details associated with the concerned account so that these could be presented before the court to expose the identity of those behind these “objectionable” posts.Deshwal, represented by senior advocate G Tushar Rao and lawyer Ayush Saxena, further sought the removal of the content from the photo and video sharing platform at the earliest.Earlier, Manish Singh, a Delhi resident and member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed a complaint with the Delhi Police over the posts, accusing Instagram of “hurting the sentiments” of the Hindus. In his complaint, Singh stated that the GIF was made with the “sole intention of inciting the followers of the Hindu community and, in the process, promote disharmony, hatred and enmity.”Also Read: BJP leader files complaint against Instagram for Shiva sticker with mobile and wineUrging the Delhi Police to file a case against Instagram CEO and others under sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Singh threatened to protest outside Instagram’s office if the content is not withdrawn and no apology is tendered.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/removed-objectionable-posts-on-hindu-deities-instagram-tells-delhi-high-court-101623716550966.html
15-06-2021||India||World Elder Abuse Awareness Day 2021: History, aim and theme||World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is dedicated to highlighting the issue of elder abuse. This day came into existence in June 2006 when a request was established to declare June 15 a special day for elders. But it was the year 2011 when the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day was officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).History of World Elder Abuse Awareness DayThe day was established after the UNGA officially acknowledged it in its resolution 66/127 in December 2011. This proposition came into the picture after the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) requested to first establish the commemoration in June 2006.Aim of World Elder Abuse Awareness DayThe principal goal of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is to provide our communities around the world with an opportunity to get a better knowledge of the abuse and neglect of older people. This is a global social issue that not only affects the health of older people but also diminishes their rights.Theme for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day 2021This year’s theme for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is 'Access to Justice'. It serves as a reminder of the importance to fully address the needs of older persons who may seek recourse.The United Nations says that older persons, who have experienced situations of violence, abuse and neglect, often face multiple barriers in accessing judicial remedies such as issues of accessibility, affordability, reasonable accommodation, excessive delays and backlogs in judicial processes, the impact of digitalisation, cultural norms, gender bias, discrimination, and entrenched ageism in policy, norms and practices.Access to Justice impacts older persons’ ability to fully exercise all their human rights including the right to health, adequate social protection and to live in dignity. The preservation or restoration of dignity and respect for older persons is crucial in such situations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-elder-abuse-awareness-day-2021-history-aim-and-theme-101623714557515.html
15-06-2021||India||VHP defends Ram temple trust, says oppn misleading people||The VHP has rejected the allegations of corruption against the Ram temple trust in the purchase of land in Ayodhya and warned of defamation suits against those trying to mislead people ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. "The construction of Ram Temple is authentic and transparent. Attempts to malign this divine movement are unfortunate. It appears that this misinformation campaign is being done by selfish motives. The political parties are trying to politicize the matter but it is related to faith," Vishwa Hindu Parishad's international working president Alok Kumar told news agency ANI.Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Tej Narayan Pandey and Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh on Sunday accused the Ram temple trust of corruption in a land deal and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the matter. "The piece of land was earlier purchased for ₹2 crore by Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari. Ten minutes later, the trust bought the land for ₹18.5 crore on March 18," Pandey said at a press conference.Also read | Ram temple trust's Champat Rai responds to scam chargesPandey also claimed that ₹17 crore was sent to the bank account of Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari through RTGS mode of payment and demanded a probe into the RTGS money transfer.Vishwa Hindu Parishad's Alok Kumar said the land deal was a "transparent agreement". "We have suggested the trust file defamation case against the persons leveling false allegations against Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Uttar Pradesh assembly polls are round the corner that is why they are misleading the people with lies," he said.Also watch | Ram temple: 'Oppn parties misleading people ahead of UP polls': VHP's Alok KumarAlok Kumar, according to ANI, said on Monday that the land was in the name of Kusum Pathak, its original owner. She signed an agreement with Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tripathi a few years ago and agreed to sell the land for ₹2 crore, which was the market rate of the land at the time, Kumar said.Kumar also said that buying and selling of the land are being done on the basis of mutual dialogue and consent. "Kusum Pathak was ready to sell it but she could not sell it because she had already entered into a deal. Meanwhile, both Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tripathi were also willing to sell it, but they couldn't take that decision without the consent of Kusum and moreover, they didn't have any agreement to sell it," he said.Also read | Shiv Sena's Raut demands clarification on Ram temple land purchase in Ayodhya"But this deal was not possible without the consent of these four including Harish Pathak," he added.The VHP leader said the price of land has gone up following the Ram Mandir verdict and the state government's announcement of the temple's construction. "The trust has found that the circle rate has lost its relevance. The present rate of the land in question is ₹18.5 crore," he added.Asserting that there are no irregularities in the deal, he informed that all the money transactions have been done in cash, so there is no question of money laundering.The Ram temple trust, created by the government after the Supreme Court’s landmark November 2019 verdict, has also refuted the allegations of corruption and dismissed demands of a probe. It said that land for the Ram temple in Ayodhya was purchased at rates lower than current market prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vhp-defends-ram-temple-trust-says-oppn-misleading-people-101623715551518.html
15-06-2021||India||Pre-board scores, class 10, 11 marks may factor in CBSE class 12 evaluation formula||Students of Class 12, for whom the school-leaving exam was cancelled due to Covid-19, will likely have their results compiled taking into account their performance in three past examinations: the finals of Class 10 and 11, and their Class 12 pre-board tests. The final scores will be based on a 30-30-40 split, with the latest pre-board test accounting for 40% of the weight in the final tally, and the other two equally contributing to the remaining share.This formula will apply to the theory component of the exam, which can be 70% or 80% of the total score, while the rest is based on their perofrmance in practicals as usual. Practical exams had been held for most before the second wave of the pandemic took hold and forced schools to be closed.The 13-member committee constituted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to fix the criteria to evaluate Class 12 students did not submit its report as per schedule on Monday, said officials at both CBSE and ministry of education. The panel may take a few more days to finalise the details.The Union government on June 1 cancelled the Class 12 exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and said CBSE would come up with “well-defined objective criteria” in a timebound manner to assess the students. On June 3, the Supreme Court gave CBSE two weeks to come up with an evaluation formula. Following that, the Board on June 4 formed the 13-member committee that was to submit its report in 10 days, on June 14.The matter is likely to be heard on Thursday.A member of the committee explained the rationale behind the consensus about expanding the performance parameters to evaluate the students. “The panel has consulted centrally-run schools, including Navodaya Vidyalayas and the principals of other CBSE-affiliated schools, and observed that the entire academic year of this batch of Class 12 was held online and there was so much uncertainty. Classes were not held in a normal situation and assessment did not happen completely,” the member said on condition of anonymity.The panel, therefore, found it unwise to assess students just on the basis of Class 12 performance. “In a crisis like this, it is important to go by the students’ performance in normal situations. Therefore, considering Class 10 performance is crucial. It is the most credible data available since it was conducted by the CBSE at examination centres and evaluated externally. Similarly, Class 11 exams of this batch in 2020 were also completed before the declaration of the lockdown. All these exams were held in a defined condition,” the member added.The committee is in favour of giving more weightage to Class 12 pre-boards. “Overall, everyone is in favour of giving equal weightage to Class 10 and 11 performances (30% and 30%) and 40% to Class 12 pre-board marks. Some members still favour giving more weightage to Class 10 than Class 11,” the member said, adding that a consensus on this hasn’t been reached so a few more days will be needed to compile the report.Some school principals expressed reservations about the plan to consider Class 10 and 11 marks. Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School, New Delhi, said, “There are so many students who prepare for competitive exams and participate in co-curricular activities in Class 11 and don’t take the exams very seriously. Then there are students who couldn’t perform well in Class 10 and opted for humanities in Classes 11 and 12. It will be unfair with them,” Joshi said.However, educationist Meeta Sengupta said it could be the best possible criteria in the present scenario. “No formula will be perfect, but this one is close. It includes both a range of performances and opportunities,” she said.Another official familiar with the development also confirmed to HT that three components might be considered for theory marks that vary from subject to subject. While most of the subjects have 70-mark theory papers, some have 80. The remaining practical marks will be provided by the respective schools. Those who could not complete these exams have now been asked by CBSE to complete them in online mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-10-pre-board-scores-may-factor-in-cbse-class-12-formula-101623714880864.html

15-06-2021||India||How can India prepare for the third wave||The second wave of Covid-19 infections in India peaked on May 9, 2021. The sevenday moving average of daily cases has now come down to 85,807 from the peak of 391,819. The fact that India faced a severe second wave of infections, which overwhelmed the health infrastructure, has underlined the importance of preparing well for the third wave. Of course, the pace of vaccinations will matter the most in determining whether or not there is a nationwide third wave. Vaccinations apart, here are four things that must be done to reduce the impact of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections.1. Testing facilities need to be expandedTesting in time and isolating infected patients is the key to containment of Covid-19 infections. Whether or not people get tested in time depends on access to testing facilities. A symptomatic person is more likely to get a test done if the testing centre is one kilometre away from their house than if it is located at a distance of 20 kilometres. Paid and free tests (at government facilities) are also likely to make a difference, especially for the poor.Data from the Covid-19 Sample Collection Management System of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows that testing facilities are extremely skewed in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The data shows that, as of June 12, the median number sample collection centres (including mobile units) in districts in states such as Karnataka and Gujarat was 90 and 68. This number was just two in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It needs to be kept in mind that these are median values and therefore half the districts will have a lower number of sample collection centres.Thirty-one out of the 735 districts in the country listed on the portal have no sample collection centre; 99 have just one. Clearly, this needs to change, if the pandemic has to be monitored better.2. People, especially the poor, need to be encouraged to seekmedical adviceTo be sure, expanding testing centres will take care of only part of the problem. The 2017-18 survey on health consumption by the National Statistical Office (NSO) shows why. In India, whether or not people seek medical advice when they feel sick is linked to their economic status. The poorest 20% of people, as per Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE), are almost three times more likely to not seek medical advice than the richest 20%, the report shows. Lack of health facilities in proximity and affordability are bigger reasons for not seeking medical advice among the poor than the rich. The biggest reason for not taking medical advice across classes is the ailment not being considered serious.Given the fact that Covid-19 begins with common symptoms such as fever and cold, a behavioural change is required when it comes to suspected patients seeking early testing and treatment.3. Acknowledge the financial burden of Covid-19 hospital admissionsThere is no real measure of the financial burden of health expenditure due to Covid-19 infections. The NSO survey can be used to estimate what this health spending shock could have done to household finances. According to it, in 81% of cases where hospitalisation was required (excluding childbirth), the expenditure was met by family income or savings; 11% of such cases were financed with borrowing; 3.5% of these were met with contributions from friends and relatives; and 0.4% required sale of physical assets.To be sure, the average hospitalisation spending in the NSO survey was .22,380 per case. For cases within the top 10% bracket of spending, including spending of .50,550 or more, reliance on borrowing, contribution by friends and relatives and sale of physical assets increased significantly. An average Covid-19 hospitalisation case is likely to cost much more than ₹50,000.A 2016 Mint analysis of the Household Survey on India’s Citizen Environment & Consumer Economy (ICE 360° survey) by Pramit Bhattacharya gave an idea about the potential impact of health shocks on household finances. The survey showed that 3% of households in the top quintile (richest 20%) faced a health shock that wiped out more than a fifth of their annual income. The comparative figure for the bottom quintile (poorest 20%) was more than double at 6.8% of households. These numbers are likely to have increased manifold during the pandemic.4. Expanding health insurance coverwill helpOver three-fourth of hospitalisation cases in India involved individuals who were not covered by health insurance, according to the 2017-18 NSO survey. Access to health insurance is correlated to incomes, and the share of hospitalisation cases not covered by any kind of insurance increases from 68% among the richest 20% to 85.5% among the poorest 20%. Even in cases where health insurance existed, it did not cover the cost of the entire treatment.NSO survey shows that on average, health insurance was paid for only 10.2% of the medical expenditure and 9.1% of total expenditure (which includes cost of transporting patient as well as the cost of food, lodging, transport, etc., for the household) in cases that required hospitalisation.To be sure, the survey was conducted before the roll-out of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) which aims to cover 107.4 million households or 500 million beneficiaries under health insurance, so the insurance coverage numbers could be underestimated. The PM-JAY website says that there have been 18.6 million hospital admissions under the scheme since its launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-prepare-for-the-third-wave-101623710031453.html
15-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How many dead are there, really?That’s actually the first line of a column I wrote on May 2, putting forth a model for calculating a range for the number of deaths India has seen from Covid-19, but more on that anon. The question is worth repeating because of recent work by data journalist Rukmini S in Dainik Bhaskar and Scroll on excess deaths per million using death data from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. This data isn’t publicly available, and not all states share it (in fact, most do not). According to the data, Madhya Pradesh under-reported deaths between January 1 and May 31 by a factor of 42, Andhra Pradesh by a factor of 34, and Tamil Nadu by a factor of eight. The number has been arrived at by comparing historical and current data.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThese death numbers have been put together by the states themselves, and usually, when such data is revised, it is only upwards. Sure, death reporting has always been patchy across India, although it has improved over the years – but it is unlikely to have suddenly seen a radical improvement in a year that actually made such reporting even more difficult. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some states keen to show their ability in managing the pandemic have under-reported deaths by simply ascribing them to other causes – pneumonia and typhoid are both beneficiaries, I am told – an approach that involves the use of all-cause deaths to calculate deaths has emerged, around the world, as the best way to capture the actual toll of the pandemic. It’s an approach that has been used to good effect by data investigators in other countries. This is actually different from the reconciliation of death numbers carried out in recent weeks by states such as Maharashtra and Bihar, which, as the term suggests, is more of an exercise in factoring in backlogs, updating records, and (in Bihar’s case) accounting for deaths outside the public hospital system.The reports on the excess deaths in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, new research, and the fact that health systems in at least some parts of the country were completely (or partially) overwhelmed during the second wave together suggest that it makes sense to revisit some of the assumptions of the May 2 column.In that column, I accounted for the fact that the number of actual infections could be 10-15 times the reported number. But recent research by scientists at Public Health England has shown that the Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was first sequenced in India (B.1.617.2 is how it is otherwise known) is around 64% more infective than the original Wuhan virus. And a study by Delhi’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology shows that Delhi’s second wave (in April and May) was caused by the Delta variant. It’s entirely possible – we do not sequence enough viral genomes to say for sure – that all of India’s was.That could well mean that the actual infections, at least in those two months, may have been even higher – perhaps (and this is a straight mathematical extrapolation that may not be accurate) 16-24 times the reported number.Finally, there’s enough reporting to show that India’s Covid-19 fatalities in April and May increased on account of inadequate access to hospitals, medicines, or oxygen. The deaths were also inflated by the emergence of mucor. In the May 3 column, I assumed a range for the infection fatality rate (proportion of those dying to those infected), 0.115% to 0.23% (the upper bound was based on work carried out by Stanford’s John PA Ioannidis across 51 regions, and by Middlesex University’s Murad Banaji, for Mumbai; the lower bound was to factor in advances in Covid-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic). It is entirely possible that in April and May, the infection fatality rate in India may have been higher. How high is anybody’s guess, but the math of its impact is clear – a higher infection fatality rate on an elevated infected base (on account of a more infectious variant) is certain to cause a spike in deaths.Over the weekend, the Indian government responded to an article in The Economist (without naming the publication) that said India’s reported death toll was “a small fraction of the real figure” saying there was no way there were “five to seven times excess deaths”. As Rukmini S’s analysis shows, at least in a few states, and for a few months, it was that and more. We need a nationwide comparison of deaths from all causes in 2020 and thus far in 2021 with the historical average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101623701072163.html
15-06-2021||India||KCR hands out cars worth ₹9.6 crore to bureaucrats||A day after the Telangana government handed out luxury cars, bought for approximately ₹9.6 crore, to 32 additional collectors with an aim to help them “carry out developmental works”, the opposition hit out at the move and accused it of financial profligacy during a pandemic when the state is in high debt.The vehicles were handed over to the additional collectors after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao reviewed the developmental works in urban and rural areas at his camp office at Pragati Bhavan in Hyderabad, an official spokesman from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. At Sunday’s meeting, KCR said the government will extend all facilities to the additional collectors. “In every district collectorate, additional collectors will be provided a room adjacent to the collector and enjoy the same protocol of the collector,” the chief minister said.“The vehicles, each costing [the state] around ₹30 lakh, were procured by the Telangana State Road Transport Authority on the instructions of the chief minister. The vehicles will help the additional collectors in extensive tours of the villages as part of their duty,” an official in the transport department familiar with the development, said. The opposition parties said the chief minister was busy “appeasing” the bureaucrats when the state was reeling under a financial crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic. All India Congress Committee official spokesman Dasoju Sravan called it an “irresponsible” decision and claimed that the state’s debt had crossed ₹4 lakh crore. “These officials already have... their official cars for the last one year. Where is the need to give them the new cars...in this hour of crisis?” Sravan questioned.According to the Telangana budget for 2021-22, the total outstanding public debt of the state is ₹2,86,804.64 crore. State transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar did not take calls. Sravan alleged that the state government was struggling to increase the number of beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients in government hospitals, and didn’t have money to buy buses for public transport or even to clear the pending bills of contractors. The state is under Covid-19 lockdown till June19. At present, the state has 20,461 active cases and recorded 1,862 deaths since March 1 this year. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said it was a “criminal splurge” of public money. “This decision to buy ultra-luxury vehicles for additional collectors is horrendous and unthinkable in the current public health situation. We feel this money could have been used to expand beds or provide free treatment to the poor,” Rao said. The Telangana government introduced the post of additional collectors into the bureaucratic structure of the state in February 2020 positioning it as an administrative reform and part of an overhaul of the revenue department. Additional collectors, mostly drawn from Group-I officers, were appointed in each district (except Hyderabad), and were exclusively meant for taking care of developmental projects in rural areas. However, two additional collectors, one each for local bodies and revenue matters, were appointed in 10 districts. Political analyst Suresh Dharur said KCR’s move was likely to send a wrong message. “It is not that the officials are going to the villages by bicycles. They must be having vehicles. Why should the government spend nearly ₹10 crore on buying them luxury cars at this stage? This is nothing but fiscal irresponsibility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcrhands-out-cars-worth-9-6-crore-to-bureaucrats-101623697246507.html
15-06-2021||India||Lakshadweep residents observe ‘black day’ to protest administrator Patel’s visit to island||Thiruvananthapuram: Residents of Lakshadweep observed a black day to protest against the week-long visit of administrator Praful Khoda Patel who arrived in the archipelago on Monday.The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body of all political parties, urged people to mark the day by hoisting black flags, and wearing black dress and masks to express their anger against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) 2021, which it believes would destroy the culture and tradition of the island. They also raised placards seeking the recall of the administrator and roll back of the new rules. The Save Lakshadweep Forum said it will continue its protest till its demands are met. “We observed a black day to protest against Patel’s visit. Despite mounting protests, he is in a denial mode and continues to antagonise people. We are ready to call off the protests if he hears us properly and withdraws some of the controversial decisions,” forum convenor UCK Thangal said, adding that the forum will adopt different modes of protest in the coming days if the administrator ignores their demands. In a recent interview to an English magazine, Patel had said that the troubles in the island were incited by a section of people with vested interests from Kerala. He said in the last seven decades, the island had failed to develop unlike the rest of the country. Patel added that the Centre had announced a number of steps to improve the infrastructure of the island - ₹1,200 crore was earmarked for an underwater optical fibre cable, Kavaratti would be developed as a smart city and Agatti airport runway would be widened for wide-bodied aircraft to land.For over a month, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the three draft regulations brought in by the administrator over fears that it will affect the unique culture and tradition of the island. Last Monday, the residents in the island had observed a hunger strike from morning to evening as a mark of protest. Two weeks ago, the Kerala assembly had passed a resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. Aisha Sultana moves HC for bailMeanwhile, filmmaker and model Aisha Sultana moved the Kerala high court, seeking anticipatory bail in a sedition case filed against her by Lakshadweep Police. Police had registered the case, among other charges, against her two days ago after she allegedly called Patel a bio-weapon launched by the Union government during a TV discussion recently. The case, which was filed on the basis of a complaint by Lakshadweep BJP chief C Abdul Khadar Haji, was registered under Section 124 (A) of the Indian Penal Code among other sections by Kavaratti police.In his complaint, Haji cited a recent debate on ‘Media One’, a Malayalam news channel, in which Sultana reportedly called the new administrator a bio-weapon. He said her words were in bad taste and intended to create hatred and aversion in the minds of people. In her bail plea, Sultana, who is now staying in Kochi, said she feared her arrest if she returned to the island. The high court is expected to take up her plea on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-residents-observe-black-day-to-protest-administrator-patel-s-visit-to-island-101623697185368.html
15-06-2021||India||Former Telangana minister joins BJP, vows to expand party’s base||Hyderabad: Former Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender Monday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party after being sacked from the state cabinet by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on May 1 following the allegations of land grabbing. Rajender was formally given the primary membership of the BJP by the union minister of steel Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi. BJP’s in-charge of Telangana affairs, Tarun Chugh, union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy and other party leaders from the state were present on the occasion. Along with Rajender, former Telangana Rashtra Samithi parliament member Ramesh Rathod, former TRS lawmaker Enugu Ravinder Reddy, former Karimnagar Zilla Parishad chairperson Thula Uma, trade union leader P Ashwathama Reddy and a few Osmania University student leaders joined the BJP. Rajender, a prominent OBC leader representing the Huzurabad assembly constituency in northern Telangana, resigned from the TRS on June 4 and from the assembly membership on Saturday. His resignation from the assembly was accepted, and the vacancy for the Huzurabad seat was notified immediately. Welcoming the former minister into the BJP, the Union steel minister said Rajender’s entry would further strengthen the party in Telangana. “After Karnataka, Telangana will soon become a stronghold of the BJP in the South,” Pradhan said. Expressing thanks to the BJP leadership, Rajender said he would make all-out efforts to expand the footprints of the BJP across Telangana and the rest of South India. In the coming days, there would be an exodus of more leaders from the TRS into the BJP, he said. Originally from the Leftist background, Rajender was an active leader of Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU), a student wing of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) New Democracy, a splinter group of the Naxalites, in the early 1980s. In 2003, he joined the TRS, founded by K Chandrasekhar Rao, and took an active role in the separate Telangana movement. He became the legislator for the first time in 2004 from the Kamalapur assembly constituency in Karimnagar district and represented it twice before the constituency changed to Huzurabad. He continued to represent the same till the 2018 elections. When KCR was a parliament member, Rajender was made the floor leader of the TRS in the state assembly. He was the first finance minister of the Telangana state when formed in 2014. In the second term, he was given the medical and health portfolio, which he held till he was sacked recently. “My DNA is secular. My agenda now is neither right nor left. My only agenda is to get the Telangana rid of the dictatorial and feudal rule of KCR,” Rajender said after quitting the assembly membership.Meanwhile, senior TRS leader and state civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said Rajender defection to the BJP would hardly impact the TRS. “The TRS is strong in Huzurabad, and it is going to win the by-election hands down. We shall develop the constituency 100 times more than what Rajender had done all these years,” Kamalakar, who is looking after the party affairs in the constituency, said. It was unfortunate that Rajender had chosen to criticise KCR, who had given him a political life, the minister added. Senior journalist and political analyst Sangem Ramakrishna said there might not be an immediate impact of Rajender’s exit on the TRS, which is strongly placed in the Telangana. “However, in the long run, he might be a rallying point for the disgruntled elements in the TRS and also the OBC groups in the state.

Her only dream was to give her children a better life than what she had.Born in Madurai as the eldest of three siblings, Selvarani, after her wedding, moved to Achipatti town, a hamlet of about 10,000 people sandwiched between Pollachi and Coimbatore in western Tamil Nadu.The couple came from modest means and Selvarani and her husband, Ramanujam, worked hard. After their second child, Praveen Kumar, was born in 1999, Ramanujam could spend only 18 days with the family before he left for Sharjah, where he worked as a construction worker laying tar on roads. “Since then, my mother has run this family,” said her daughter R Sinduja, 25.Selvarani, who is only a high school graduate, worked as a bookkeeper for a private company. “My father would send his salary, but she took care of everything else. I’ve never seen her rest or take leave. Every day she worked in office, and she worked at home,” said Sinduja.Sinduja, who has a master’s in business studies, is supposed to get married in November and her brother Praveen has just completed his undergraduate studies. “Life is blank. Days aren’t making sense anymore,” she said.Ramanujam suffered a paralytic attack two years ago and can only run errands at the construction company. He returned to India after Selvarani died on May 7 and the family is still in shock.It started as a fever for Selvarani in late April. Her nephew Jaiganesh Balakrishnan took her to a doctor who prescribed medicines saying that it seemed like a normal fever. Balakrishnan wanted to rule out Covid-19 so he took Selvarani for a CT scan but the scan results showed that she had 20% lung infection.He immediately took her to a government hospital which also insisted it was mild. “They told us to take an RT-PCR test and if it was negative, they told us that she may have already overcome the infection,” said Balakrishnan. The report came back negative. “We were so relieved,” recalled Balakrishnan.But worse was yet to come.Late night on May 1, Selvarani started to struggle to breathe. “I remember the date because the next day was the election results,” says Balakrishnan. He called his friend who is an ambulance driver and at 1am they started driving around with Selvarani on oxygen.They drove to every hospital in Pollachi but there was no bed available. The ambulance driver and Balakrishnan began ringing hospitals in Coimbatore but were told none were vacant. With no other option available, they drove to Coimbatore to check in person if oxygen supported beds were available. Some private hospital staff arrived, checked her oxygen levels that was 88 with support.“But after checking, they would say no bed is available,” he said. The ESI hospital finally informed them that the Coimbatore government hospital (GH) had 25 new beds with oxygen support. At the time, the second wave of Covid was ravaging Tamil Nadu, which was posting around 20,000 cases and more than 150 deaths every day in the first week of May.Six hours after they had left home, they got Selvarani admitted. But the ward was newly constructed and oxygen supply wasn’t fully connected, so she was shifted to another ward.Balakrishnan went back to Pollachi but when he spoke to her later in the evening, Selvarani complained that she wasn’t given food and medicines.Balakrishnan tried to find her a bed in a private hospital and when he went to pick her up the next morning, he found Selvarani surrounded by three corpses in adjacent beds.“She told me they had died the previous night, but no one took away their bodies. She spent an entire night next to people in distress who died in front of her. It really scared her.”Her condition kept worsening. In the private hospital, she often pulled away her oxygen mask and screamed, and had to be put on a ventilator. “It was unusual. I think she was traumatised,” said Balakrishnan.He lamented that early diagnosis could have saved her life. The family suspects Selvarani was infected at work where one of her three co-workers was sick. “They didn’t inform her that it was Covid-19. People think if they’re infected, it’s criminal so they hide it,” he said.Despite Tamil Nadu’s markedly superior health infrastructure, the surge in infections overwhelmed hospitals in the hinterlands, especially in smaller cities and of cases there have been a disproportionate number of high deaths in villages and smaller districts.For her family, Selvarani was a feminist though she may have not known the word. “My mother was never dependent on anyone,” said Sinduja. “She was very bold. She pampered me but she also taught me to get a job and be independent.”The family said many women in the city looked up to Selvarani. “She worked all her life to help bring up her family, her children have graduated, one of them got married. But she is gone,” said Balakrishnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-woman-broke-barriers-strived-to-give-her-children-a-better-life-101623697005333.html
15-06-2021||India||‘Misleading’: Bengal counters plea for CBI probe in post-poll violence||Most deaths during the post-poll violence in West Bengal took place when the model code of conduct was in place and the state police was under the control of the Election Commission, the West Bengal government has told the Supreme Court, countering petitions that accused the state police of not doing enough to curb the violence after the Trinamool Congress returned to power and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.“The instant writ petition reeks of political motivation by adopting a misleading narrative and shows that the state administration is complicit with the wrong-doers in the alleged incidents of violence,” the affidavit by Nirmalya Ghoshal, additional secretary of West Bengal’s home department said.Ghoshal said 16 people were killed in violence in two days (May 2-3), five people in the next two days (May 3-5), and one person was killed in the next five days (May 5-9).“From the declaration of WB Assembly Election Results on May 2, 2021 till May 3, 2021, the law and order machinery including both Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and the State Police was under the superintendence of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the model code of conduct (MCC) remained in force till May 3 and thus, the ECI was in charge of the law and order situation in the State till the MCC was lifted.”Soon after MCC was lifted and the new government under chief minister Mamata Banerjee took oath on May 5, “the incidents of violence had reduced drastically and the law and order situation was brought to normality.”The state was responding to two petitions demanding an independent agency or Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the killing of party workers belonging to the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly by persons belonging to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) party.The petitions alleged total inaction by the state police and administration, prompting the judges to seek responses from the state government as well as National Human Rights Commission, National Commission for Women, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and National Commission for Backward Classes.A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah will consider the affidavits filed by the parties when it takes up the matter on Tuesday.The Supreme Court is hearing two petitions including one filed by social activist Arun Mukherjee and four others to seek compensation and rehabilitation of persons displaced due to violence. This petition also accused inaction by police to register complaints of victims and demanded a probe into the incidents.The second petition was filed by family members of two BJP workers, Abhijit Sarkar and Haran Adhikari, killed during the violence.Two applications for intervention have also been filed in support of the petitions by a 60-year-old woman and a minor who alleged rape by Trinamool Congress supporters. The woman alleged that five people barged into her house on May 4-5 night, raped her in front of her six-year-old grandson, and left with all her valuables and property title documents. In the other application, the minor belonging to Scheduled Caste was gang-raped by four men on May 9. Later, her family was threatened not to pursue the case by persons linked to a local TMC leader. Both applicants have demanded transfer of probe to SIT since they don’t trust the police investigation.The West Bengal government has called the petitions “politically motivated” and “misleading” as it concealed the fact that issues raised by them significantly overlapped with proceedings pending before a five-judge bench of the Calcutta high court. The high court had formed a three-member committee to examine the issues of persons displaced due to violence and ordered all complaints by victims to be forwarded to the Director General of Police in the state. As an interim measure, the state government announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for families of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-bengal-counters-plea-for-cbi-probe-in-post-poll-violence-101623696886040.html
15-06-2021||India||AIADMK gives Panneerselvam dy leader post, expels 16 Sasikala supporters||Chennai: Former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy, O Panneerselvam, the two top leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), on Monday came together to block expelled interim general secretary VK Sasikala from trying to regain control of the party and expelled 16 party members including three leaders for their proximity to her.O Panneerselvam was also appointed as deputy leader of the AIADMK legislature party, said a statement issued by the party after the three-hour-long meeting convened at the party headquarters in Chennai. Panneerselvam’s supporter, P H Manoj Panidan, was elected as deputy secretary while Palaniswami’s supporters and former ministers, SP Velumani, Kadambur C Raju and K P Anbalagan, were appointed as whip, treasurer and secretary respectively.Monday’s appointments were a sharp contrast to the tussle between Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, the AIADMK’s dual leadership, which resurfaced after the previous two meetings of the legislature party. Last week, the chill in their relationship also reflected on the streets of Tamil Nadu when their supporters fought a poster war.But on Monday, they spoke in one voice in a four-page resolution that threatened to expel anyone who associates with VK Sasikala. A party spokesperson V Pughazhendhi, former MP VK Chinnasamy and former MLA M Anandan were among the 16 who were expelled.The AIADMK’s effort to shield the party from Sasikala comes against the backdrop of her attempts to reach out to party workers sympathetic to her and release audio tapes of her conversation that has workers pleading with her to assume a leadership role.The resolution called the audio clips ‘drama’ and reiterated that the “party will never destroy itself for the desires of one family”. They recalled that Sasikala who had decided to ‘step away’ from politics before the assembly elections wanted to return because the AIADMK alliance won 75 of the 234 assembly seats, with the AIADMK alone securing 66 seats. That better-than-expected performance has been credited to the former CM’s track record. Palaniswami earlier tried to counter her campaign, telling reporters that she hadn’t been speaking with AIADMK workers but members of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, the party floated by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. But subsequent audio clips released by Sasikala’s team started mentioning the details of the party workers with whom she was speaking. “They don’t understand that it is the cadre who decides the leader of this party,” she said.Sasikala was a friend and constant companion of former AIADMK supremo and CM, the late J Jayalalithaa. She was also, at one time, Palaniswami’s mentor, and made sure he became chief minister after Jayalalithaa’s death, once it became clear that she herself would go to jail after being found guilty in a disproportionate assets case. Palaniswami, however, made his peace with Panneerselvam, the other person in the running for the top post, and expelled Sasikala from the party. She was released from jail after completing her sentence earlier this year. She has since tried to re-enter the party. “The dual leadership (of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam) will continue, if not, the party will break,” said political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy. “They will set aside their egos and move forward together which will benefit both of them. If Sasikala wants and if she has public support she can be her own leader but the AIADMK and party symbol is in the hands of EPS and OPS. They will not let go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-gives-panneerselvam-dy-leader-post-expels-16-sasikala-supporters-101623696826711.html
15-06-2021||India||17 Lingayat mathas back BSY as CM amid leadership row||Bengaluru: Amid voices of leadership change in Karnataka, at least 17 mathas or monasteries of the Lingayat community in Tumakuru, about 70 km from Bengaluru, on Monday rallied behind chief minister BS Yediyurappa, extending their support to the leader from the community to retain his position for at least the next two years. In a statement released on Monday, All Karnataka Sri Veerashaiva Lingayat Mathadipathis Forum said Yediyurappa is a respectable senior of the community and has carried his duties well as chief minister. The forum, comprising at least 17 mathas in the district, said any statement against Yediyurappa would be an insult not just to the chief minister but to the entire community. The statement, in Kannada, said Yediyurappa’s role was important in winning a high number of seats for the party. “In such circumstances, the All Karnataka Sri Veerashaiva Lingayat Mathadipathis Forum condemns any unnecessary creation of problems for Yediyurappa and backs him to complete his complete term,” the statement said. Yediyurappa has been on shaky grounds ever since he took the top chair in 2019 after helping engineer the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government. There has been a concerted effort within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking the ouster of the 78-year-old. Arun Singh, BJP’s national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, is scheduled to arrive in Bengaluru on Wednesday in a bid to calm tempers in the state. The chief minister and his son, BY Vijayendra, have made several visits to mathas, which people aware of the developments, said was to mobilise support in favour of Yediyurappa, who has enjoyed the backing of Lingayats for the better part of the last decade. On Yediyurappa turning 80 in two years, the forum said that former Tamil Nadu chief minister late MK Karunanidhi was active in politics despite being on a wheelchair for almost 15 years. It also cited example of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, saying he is still active and “can put any youngster to shame”. The forum said Yediyurappa was healthy, and it was not right to create any confusion in the minds of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-lingayat-mathas-back-bsy-as-cm-amid-leadership-row-101623696766542.html
15-06-2021||India||Actor Sanchari Vijay declared brain dead||Bengaluru: National award-winning Kannada actor Sanchari Vijay, who sustained serious head injuries in a road accident, was declared brain dead at a private hospital in Bengaluru on Monday, doctors attending the actor said. The 38-year-old actor’s motorcycle skidded on Saturday night, resulting in him sustaining serious head injuries. He was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Apollo Hospital in Bengaluru. A statement from the hospital said he was on life support in the neurology ICU. “Neurologically he is deeply unconscious and is showing signs of brain failure. The family had come forward and consented to organ donation keeping in view the current irreversible brain damage. We will follow the guidelines as per organ donation protocol,” read the hospital’s statement. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said he was deeply pained to know about it and expressed his sorrow. Fellow Kannada actor Sudeep took to Twitter on Monday afternoon to express his condolences. “Very, very disheartening to accept that Sanchari Vijay breathed his last.” Sudeep, who had met Vijay before the lockdown, added, “Met him a couple of times just before this lockdown... All excited about his next film that’s due for release. Very sad. Deepest condolences to his family and friends. RIP.” According to police, Vijay, a resident of Vajarahalli on Bannerghatta Road, and his friend Naveen had gone out to buy medicines and were returning to the latter’s residence when the two-wheeler skidded and hit an electric pole. Around 11.45 pm, Naveen, who was riding the motorcycle, and Vijay were heading from the former’s house to a medical shop to buy medicines. They had dinner at Naveen’s residence at L&T South City and the accident took place a few metres away. Vijay made his debut with the film ‘Rangappa Hogbitna’ in 2011. He has appeared in a slew of Kannada films including ‘Dasavala’, ‘Harivu’, ‘Oggarane’, ‘Killing Veerappan’, ‘Varthamana’ and ‘Sipaayi’ among others. He rose to fame with the film ‘Naanu Avanalla Avalu’, for which he won the National Award in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-sanchari-vijay-declared-brain-dead-101623696705266.html
15-06-2021||India||AAP will contest all seats in 2022 Gujarat polls, says Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday said his party will contest all 182 seats in Gujarat in the 2022 Assembly elections.“The AAP will contest each and every seat in the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections... We will emerge as alternative to BJP in Gujarat. BJP and Congress are two sides of the same coin and I hear that the Opposition party is in the BJP’s pockets,” said Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to Ahmedabad to inaugurate the AAP’s state headquarters.“Gujarat is suffering because of this friendship and alliance between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP ruled this state for the last 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of the BJP. Both the BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop,” he added.After his media briefing, Kejriwal formally inaugurated the AAP’s office also located on Ashram Road.This was Kejriwal’s second visit to Gujarat this year. He last visited Surat in February, after the AAP’s encouraging performance in the city’s municipal corporation elections. In its debut performance, the AAP emerged as the main opposition to the BJP in the city, winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation and leaving the Congress with zero seats.Asked if their campaign would be based on the Delhi model, he said, “Every state has its own problems and aspirations and so Gujarat will have a Gujarat model.”Earlier in the day, former head of a Gujarati news channel, Isudan Gadhvi, joined the AAP in the presence of Kejriwal.Hitting back at the AAP, state BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, “Through the last six elections, we have restricted the Congress to 50 to 60 seats and haven’t allowed them to grow. We don’t need anybody, BJP is a strong force in Gujarat.”“Several parties earlier have contested on all 182 seats but have miserably failed, including those started by Shankersinh Vaghela, Keshubhai Patel or others. Vaghela’s party won 4 seats in 1998. So, let AAP also contest,” he added.Political analyst Hari Desai said the party was new to Gujarat politics. “AAP will, at best, serve the purpose of queering the pitch for the Congress on some seats where it may be doing well against the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-will-contest-all-seats-in-2022-gujarat-polls-says-kejriwal-101623696645870.html
15-06-2021||India||Traffic snarls return to halt Bengaluru as curbs ease||The infamous traffic snarls, which are almost synonymous with Bengaluru, returned to haunt the city on Monday morning as the lockdown restrictions imposed in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases were relaxed after more than a month. In Old Airport Road, which connects central Bengaluru to the IT corridors of Whiltefield and Outer Ring Road, long traffic jams were seen as vehicles returned on the roads after over a month. Similar traffic jams and crowds were witnessed in other parts of Bengaluru, including KR Puram, Indiranagar and Basavanagudi, among other places. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government has eased lockdown curbs in Bengaluru and 18 other districts in the state on account of a decline in new infections. The new guidelines came into force at 6 am on Monday. As restrictions were lifted, the city saw an influx of people returning from other parts of the state. City authorities expressed concerns over the surge in people returning to Bengaluru from various parts of the state. While the number of cases in Bengaluru has come down, the influx to the city could result in another spike in Covid-19 cases, said Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials. “One of the reasons why the lockdown guidelines have not been lifted in some districts is because the positivity rate there is high. People from these districts are allowed to come to the city. Even though the regulations allow only emergency travel, there is hardly any checking. Police are allowing people to come through without any checks at the city borders,” said a senior BBMP official, requesting anonymity. The BBMP official added that strict restrictions on intra-city travel should continue till the positivity rate across the state comes down. However, many people return to the city since they have been allowed to work. “I run a cement shop and I came to the city after the government gave the permission,” said Mohammad Abdullah, a native of Chikkamagaluru. Bengaluru city police commissioner Kamal Pant on Monday issued prohibitory orders across the city, restricting more than four persons to assemble in public spaces. Police said there were some practical difficulties in the implementation. “The situation on the streets has changed. The government has allowed garment factories, construction activities, private companies and others to operate. This means there is a large number of people on the road. The garment factories account for around one million workers. It is not possible to check every vehicle on the road when the volume is high and these industries need to restart work,” Pant said. He added that even on the main highways leading to the city, there was a large movement of people from different districts. “Once again, the numbers are high here. We are conducting as many checks as possible but in some cases, where there is a pile-up, we have to allow traffic. It is the government’s decision to open these industries and these workers are critical for it,” he added. Bengaluru recorded 1,470 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, according to the state health department. The city also witnessed 2,409 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 85,044. The positivity rate in Bengaluru declined to 3.11%, according to BBMP. A total of 12 deaths were reported in Bengaluru, which took the toll to 15,319, state data showed. “Our ability to stay focused and disciplined will ensure cases do not rise again. Stay safe. Get tested if you experience any Covid symptoms. Avoid public gatherings. Follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Take the vaccine when it’s your turn,” Gaurav Gupta, BBMP commissioner tweeted. Bengaluru is home to several multinational companies and its economy and employment opportunities attract people from across the state and various parts of the country. A significant portion of Bengaluru’s workforce comprises migrant workers, employed in various sectors. The state government has announced that restrictions in 11 out of the 30 districts in the state, where test positivity rate remained high, will continue till at least June 21. The state government has decided to go in for a phase-wise lifting of curbs to restrict the sudden rush of people coming out of their homes and adding to the risk all over again. Karnataka recorded 6,385 new Covid-19 infections with the positivity rate of 4.56% on Monday. There were 15,409 recoveries in the state, which brought down the active caseload to 172,141, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Monday. A total of 120 more deaths were reported on Monday, taking the toll to 33,033, data showed. The Karnataka government has extended the timings of shops dealing in groceries, meat, vegetables, milk and other essential commodities from 6 am to 2 pm. Timings of liquor shops have also been extended till 2 pm. Earlier, they were allowed to operate from 6 am to 10am. However, night curfew from 7pm to 5 am and weekend curfew will continue in the state till June 21. The government said it will review the Covid-19 situation around June 21 and take appropriate decisions on further relaxations, if any. Industries and other production facilities have been allowed to operate with 50% strength while garment units have been restricted to 30%, according to the new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traffic-snarls-return-to-halt-bengaluru-as-curbs-ease-101623696645318.html
15-06-2021||India||Collective duty to fight land degradation: PM at UN meeting||Washington: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated the need for the world to come together to combat land degradation as a “collective responsibility” as it threatens the very foundations that societies and economies are built on, and called for more actions saying “a lot of work lies ahead of us”.Delivering a keynote address at a high-level meeting at the United Nations on land degradation and drought, Modi went on to detail steps and measures India is taking at home to address the situations and helping other developing nations in the spirit of South-South Cooperation.“It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse the damage to land caused by human activity,” the Prime Minister said during his virtual address in his capacity as president of the 14th Session of the Conference of Parties of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).If left unchecked, land degradation “will erode the very foundations of our societies, economies, food security, health, safety and quality of life,” he said, and added that the world must “reduce the tremendous pressure on land and its resources. Clearly, a lot of work lies ahead of us.”The United Nations has estimated that one-fifth of Earth’s land area – which is more than 2 billion hectares – is degraded, including more than half of all agricultural land. And 12 million hectares of land is lost to desertification, land degradation and drought each year. In all, nearly 95% of calories from food come from soil, yet topsoil erosion has accelerated tenfold due to human activity. The world loses 24 billion tons of fertile soil annually due to dry-land degradation, with significant negative impacts on food production and economic activity.The high-level dialogue launched on Monday will assess progress made in this fight against land degradation and propose a way forward at the end of the UN Decade for Deserts and the Fight against Desertification, and the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.Modi reiterated Indian commitment to the cause linking it to the “importance [India gives] to land and [considers] the sacred earth as our mother”. Modi said India has taken the lead to highlight land degradation issues at international forums, and pointed to the “Delhi Declaration” of 2019, which called for “better access and stewardship over land” and emphasised gender-sensitive transformative projects.Over the last 10 years, India has added around three million hectares of forest cover, which, he said, enhanced the cumulative forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area. “We are on track to achieve our national commitment of land degradation neutrality,” he added.India is also working to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, which would help create an additional carbon sink — natural assets that absorb carbon dioxide — of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.“We believe that restoration of land can start a cycle for good soil health, increased land productivity, food security and improved livelihoods,” the Prime Minister said, and went on to speak of “novel” efforts under way in the Banni region in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, which is marked by degraded land and lack of rain. India is restoring land there by developing grasslands.Modi then turned to the assistance India is providing to others to deal with land degradation, which, he said, poses a special challenge to the developing world. “In the spirit of South-South Cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies,” he said. India is setting up a centre of excellence “to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collective-duty-to-fight-land-degradation-pm-at-un-meeting-101623696585320.html
15-06-2021||India||Govt’s review of side effects confirms 1 death after vaccine dose||Three people from among the millions who received Covid-19 vaccines between February 5 and March 31 developed anaphylaxis due to the vaccine, and one of them died, according to a government review of serious side effects that could be linked to the coronavirus vaccines.The findings represent the first time a fatality has been linked to the vaccines, and strengthen the trend that these are rare: the three cases were among close to 60 million doses that were given during this period. In all, 28 people died after getting a dose during this period but most appeared not to have been linked, while the cause could not be determined in at least 9 of them.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“This is the first death where causality has been established, with vaccine resulting in an anaphylaxis reaction. But if you look at the overall numbers (crores of doses administered), and there is only this small number that got a severe reaction. There were 31 cases that were investigated and one death was due to vaccine, and among anaphylaxis cases, only two were found to be product-related. Most anaphylaxis reactions are managed,” said Dr NK Arora, chairperson, national AEFI committee.Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.The person who succumbed due to anaphylaxis was a 68-year-old man who received his shot on March 8, 2021, shows the report accessed by HT.The other two cases formally declared as vaccine product related reaction (anaphylaxis) were that of a 21-year-old woman, and a 22-year-old man who received their shots on January 19 and 16 respectively. Both recuperated after treatment in a hospital.This analysis was in a set that was approved for causal investigation by the national AEFI committee between February 5 and March 31. HT’s data showed there were 59.1 million doses given during this period.“Of the 31 causally assessed cases, 18 were classified as having inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental - not linked to vaccination), 7 were classified as indeterminate, 3 cases were found to be vaccine-product related, 1 was anxiety-related reaction, and 2 cases were found to be unclassifiable,” said the committee report.Also Read | What to do after Covid-19 vaccination if you have allergies? Govt repliesA special group has been formed to conduct causality assessment of AEFIs following COVID-19 vaccination. The results of causality assessment done by this special group are discussed in the National AEFI Committee meeting for final approval.As per data in the first week of April 2021, the reporting rate is 2.7 deaths per million doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered.The committee in its report explains that vaccine product-related reactions are expected reactions that can be attributed to vaccination based on current scientific evidence, and examples of such reactions are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.Indeterminate reactions are those that occurred soon after vaccination but for which there is no definitive evidence or clinical trial data. Further observations, analysis and studies are required to establish a causal link in such cases.Unclassifiable events are events that have been investigated but there is not enough evidence for assigning a diagnosis due to missing crucial information. When this relevant information becomes available, the case may be reconsidered for causality assessment.And coincidental events are events that are reported following immunisation but for which a clear cause other than vaccination is found on investigation.“Mere reporting of deaths and hospitalisations as serious adverse events does not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines. Only properly conducted investigations and causality assessments can help in understanding if any causal relationship exists between the event and the vaccine. For causality assessments, priority has been given to death cases,” say experts in the report.Among 18 coincidental cases not linked to vaccination were cases of stroke, heart attack, septic shock and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Among seven deaths classified as indeterminate were cases of intracranial bleeding, acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, cerebral artery ischemic infarct, sudden cardiac death, and a case of haemorrhagic venous infarct with severe thrombocytopenia.The two unclassifiable reactions were the deaths of a 55-year-old man, and a 43-year-old man. A 26-year-old man who was classified as ‘immunisation anxiety related reaction’ was hospitalised due to syncope (temporary loss of consciousness).Experts say it is important to get accurate information about vaccine related mortality through proper investigation.“The investigation needs to be skillfully done even though our competency to investigate vaccine caused mortality scientifically is very inadequate. As a nation we don’t care for accurate information but it is crucial to get to the cause,” said Dr Jacob John, former head, department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-review-of-side-effects-confirms-1-death-after-vaccine-dose-101623696525780.html
15-06-2021||India||Vatican has rejected third appeal against eviction, says Kerala nun||Sister Lucy Kalappura, the Catholic nun who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) in 2019 and who had spoken up against rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal, said on Monday that a canon court in Vatican has turned down her third appeal against her expulsion.Kalappura, 55, said she received a fresh communiqué from the Vatican on Saturday in this regard following which the Mother Superior of the FCC, Sister Ann Joseph, sent a fresh notice to her to vacate her room in the convent, which she has continued to occupy after a local court in Wayanad stayed her eviction from there in 2019. Even the Kerala high court granted her protection that year.“The letter is in Latin, but the covering letter spells out the decision. Details will be available only after the letter is translated fully. But it is dated 2020,” Kalappura said in a telephone call from Manathawady in Wayanad.But it isn’t just the date that’s old — even the signature on it is from last year and there are signs that the original stamps on it were removed, the nun said, adding that it has created doubt in her mind about its veracity. “It seems the letter was fabricated to smoke me out of the convent. I fear it is part of a conspiracy by FCC superiors,” Kalappura alleged.When contacted, a spokesperson of the FCC refused to comment on the issue.According to an internal church communication, Apostalica Signatura, the apex judicial authority in the Catholic Church, rejected the nun’s third appeal against dismissing her from the century-old Congregation. “The appeal of Lucy Kalappura is rejected by Apostalica Signatura and the dismissal is confirmed,” a communication in the Congregation said.A church spokesperson confirmed to PTI that the one more appeal filed by the nun had been rejected by Vatican.But in the covering letter, Mother Superior Sister Ann Joseph said there was no legal remedy available to Sister Kalappura now to challenge her dismissal. “You have availed all three levels possible in the Catholic legal system. You no longer have the right and duty to wear the religious habit of the FCC hereafter and (have to) vacate the convent,” the letter read.Kalappura said she will continue her fight against “corrupt practices” in the church and lamented things not reaching the Pope. “The recent revision of church laws regarding the abuse of minors, vulnerable adults, committing fraud or the ordaining of women gave us much hope. But it seems the papal head is not getting a clear picture,” the nun said, adding that she will continue her fight.The Vatican had rejected her previous two pleas. During the hearing of a plea filed by her in a court in Wayanad last year, FCC authorities claimed “discipline of the convent was affected due to her continued presence”.Kalappura was expelled by the church for “serious indiscipline and flouting orders of superiors” but the nun claimed that she was victimised for supporting the agitation for the arrest of the deposed bishop of Jalandhar, Franco Mullakkal, who was accused of sexual assault by another nun in 2018. When his arrest was delayed, five nuns, all friends of the survivor, carried out a fast in Kochi demanding his arrest in which Kalappura had also participated.Later, she wrote an autobiography, ‘Karthavinte Namathil’ (In the name of Christ), which ruffled many feathers in the church. In the book she alleged that sexual abuse and assaults take place in convents and seminaries frequently and cited many incidents. She also alleged that there were at least four attempts of sexual assault on her during her life as a nun.Kalappura has previously run into trouble with the church for drawing her salary on her own (she was a high school teacher) and bought a car in her name. Catholic clergy are not allowed to own private property and their salaries go straight to church accounts.Save our Sisters (SOS), a Christian reformist body formed in the wake of the protest against the bishop, has pledged support to Sister Kalappura. “We will extend legal aid to her. It is sad that the church authorities are taking revenge on her,” said SOS convenor Shyju Antony.FCC is a Catholic order that traces its roots back to Saint Francis of Assisi in the 13th century.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vatican-has-rejected-third-appeal-against-eviction-says-kerala-nun-101623696525232.html
15-06-2021||India||Recovering economy faces inflation threat||Retail inflation rose to 6.3% in May from 4.23% in April, propelled by an increase in both food and core inflation, going beyond the Reserve Bank of India’s upper comfort level of 6% for the first time since November, and suggesting that the incipient recovery in the economy may run into some headwinds. Experts say that inflation could continue to remain a challenge through the rest of the year. Wholesale inflation, meanwhile, rose to 12.94%,the highest in at least nine years, from 10.49%in April, partly on account of a low base (last May), but also because of higher fuel prices.The inflation data, released on Monday, comes even as the bruising second wave of Covid-19 ebbs in India, and the so-called unlock process with respect to movement and activities continues. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) jumped to 76 in the week ending June 13 from 67.9 the previous week. This is the highest week-on-week improvement in NIBRI since February 9, 2020. A NIBRI of 100 indicates pre-pandemic level of business activities.The faster-than-expected inflationary surge, primarily driven by fuel prices and increase in prices of important food items such as edible oil and pulses, has the potential to squeeze both household and business incomes. The impact could be particularly severe on the poor, who are already in distress. That the inflation metrics are high is worrying experts because demand remains low. As demand rises, inflation may, too, and RBI may find itself in a quandary in choosing between keeping growth going or reining in inflation.For the government, the numbers pose both an economic and a political challenge.“CPI inflation is 6.3%. Do you want to know why? Fuel and power inflation is at 37.61%. Thanks to PM Modi raising petrol and diesel prices every day. Food inflation is at 6.3%... Pulses inflation is at 9.39%. Edible oil inflation is at 30%. These are high marks for competent economic management,” Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said.“A food-fuel driven inflationary spike will burden the poor disproportionately and squeeze their purchasing power. This is bound to have an adverse effect on aggregate demand, pricing power of sellers and therefore growth,” said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Because cost of cultivation will rise sharply compared to the official projections which were made in March 2021, Minimum Support Prices will lose their remunerative cushion, generating headwinds for rural demand,” he added.While the magnitude of jump in both retail and wholesale prices has an element of surprise, the trend was expected. Petrol-diesel prices were kept frozen during the state election cycle in March-April. They have been increasing continuously since May because of rising crude prices and the reluctance of the Centre and the state to cut levies that account for almost 61% of the price of petrol and 54% of that of diesel (in Delhi).But crude is not the only primary commodity to have experienced a price surge. The Bloomberg Commodity Index, where energy related items have a weight of only 30%, increased from its January 4 value of 78.63 to 94.5 on June 14.The food component of CPI -- it has a weight of 39% in the overall CPI basket -- grew 5% in May, a sharp jump from its April value of 1.96%. The food component of WPI grew at 8% in May. What is remarkable about the latest surge in the food component of CPI is that this is happening despite a contraction in cereal and vegetable prices, which have a weight of 40% in the CPI food basket. The main driver of food prices are edible oils, with the oil and fat index growing at 30.8% in May 2021. Edible oil prices have been growing at double digits for 14 consecutive months. But even core inflation, which does not include food and fuel, rose 6.57% in the month, the highest in almost seven years.While part of the WPI spike is the base effect -- it contracted by 3.4% in May 2020, in a month when everything was locked down -- at 132.7, the 2021 number is higher than even May 2019 value of the index (121.6).And primary commodities aren’t exclusively to blame. The manufactured goods component of WPI, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the WPI basket, grew at an all-time high of 10.8% in May. “Elevated prices in the manufacturing segment are indicative of strengthening pricing power of manufacturers,” Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at CARE Ratings, said in a note.An analysis of the results of 1,481 companies that made a net profit of ₹1.8 lakh crore in the quarter ending March 2021, by Mahesh Vyas, managing director of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), echoes that sentiment: “Profits have increased entirely because of an increase in profit margins. This is true although March 2021 was the first quarter when the top-line was distinctly higher than its year-ago level after six quarters.Total income of the 1,481 listed companies in the March 2021 quarter was 14.5% higher than it was a year ago. Yet, this barely contributed 0.2% to the increase in profits. Growth in profits came from the huge jump in profit margin,” he said in the analysis published on the CMIE website.But that may not last.According to a Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) survey, summary findings of which were available at the CMIE website, “58% of consumers think their income in the next six months will be lower than pre-Covid levels. Similarly, 51% consumers expect their spends over the next six months to be lower as compared to 40% in the last round of the survey.”It added: “This decline in income sentiment is steepest among the less affluent income groups and those in small towns.”Put otherwise, the latest inflationary numbers could cloud the optimistic outlook around economic recovery as lockdown restrictions are removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovering-economy-faces-inflation-threat-101623695866360.html
15-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi was not allowed to renounce citizenship: India to Dominica court||India has informed the high court of justice in Dominica that Mehul Choksi, wanted in a bank fraud on the state-owned Punjab National Bank worth thousands of crores, was informed in March 2019 that the ministry of home affairs (MHA) had rejected his renunciation of Indian citizenship, and that he did not challenge this refusal.The argument, cited in a government affidavit filed last week , revolves around one issue that will determine whether or not the court decides to send him to India -- his citizenship. Choksi became a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda in 2016, but that country has been trying to revoke his citizenship (the matter is in the courts).Citing various legal deficiencies in Choksi’s declaration renouncing his citizenship, the government affidavit said the fact that Choksi never made this request “in person” but sent it directly to the Indian high commission in Georgetown, Guyana, is in contradiction with the rules under the Citizenship Act, 1955. Nor did Choksi present his request in the prescribed format, it added. Finally, section 8 of India’s Citizenship Act says a person ceases to be a citizen of India only after registration of his/her declaration by the prescribed authority, which is the home ministry in this case, the affidavit said.That India would use this line of argument before the Dominican court was first reported by HT on May 30.HT has reviewed the affidavit, filed by the ministry of external affairs consular officer Azad Singh, which seeks to “declare Choksi as an Indian citizen” and “deport him to India”.Choksi, 62, went missing from Antigua on May 23 but his family and lawyers have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica. Dominica has charged him with illegal entry. The magistrate’s court in Roseau on Monday adjourned the hearing to June 25. .HT reported on Saturday that the Indian government filed two affidavits in the Dominican court detailing serious fraud charges against Choksi and proof that he continues to be an Indian citizen. In the other affidavit, filed by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) deputy inspector general Sharda Raut, said Choksi was the main beneficiary of the fraud on Punjab National Bank and had not co-operated in the investigation, which revealed he laundered the money through a web of shell companies.Choksi submitted an application to the Indian mission in Georgetown, Guyana, on December 14, 2018, renouncing his Indian citizenship after acquiring Antigua & Barbuda’s citizenship on November 16, 2017.“After his application was submitted, the matter was examined at different levels within the government of India. On January 29, 2019, the ministry of home affairs found various deficiencies in the declaration provided, and also noted that Choksi was an economic offender, and thus advised the consular officer in the Indian mission in Georgetown to consider rejection of his declaration of renunciation,” the affidavit said.A communication to this effect was sent to Choksi on March 15, 2019.Citing Rule 23 of the Citizenship Act, the affidavit said, “declaration should be made in prescribed form XXII” for renunciation of citizenship and acknowledgement “should be issued in form XXIII”, which was not done. In fact, it was never acknowledged by the concerned officer as it was sent through post.“Mehul Choksi has not brought proceedings in India to challenge this rejection. Therefore, he continues to be a citizen of India under the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955,” the affidavit stated.Ministry of external affairs (MEA) has also contested the argument of Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal, who has stated that “a person automatically ceases to be citizen in India if he acquires citizenship of another country, according to section 9 of the Citizenship Act”.The government’s argument is that Choksi obtained Antigua’s citizenship “fraudulently”, a concern already raised with the island’s government; hence the claim under section 9 cannot be maintained.Terming Choksi’s claim erroneous, the affidavit added: “It is pertinent to mention here that authority to determine citizenship of another country – whether when or how citizenship was acquired – is Central government under rule 40 of the Citizenship Rules of 2009.”Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said, “Firstly, in bail proceedings the question for determination is not citizenship. So this affidavit is uncalled for. Moreover, as per section 9, subsection 1 of the Citizenship Act, Mr Mehul Choksi is not a citizen of India and the reliance in the affidavit on various rules is fractured understanding of law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-was-not-allowed-to-renounce-citizenship-india-to-dominica-court-101623695805764.html
15-06-2021||India||Immunity lasts at least a year after infection, gets stronger after jab: Study||Antibodies and immune memory among people who contract Covid-19 remains stable up from six months to a year, and they get even better protection when vaccinated, according to a study published on Monday, which also found the body’s defences to have evolved over time to offer protection from mutations.The findings, from researchers led by a team from Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, were published in Nature as an accelerated article on Monday, and offer among the first concrete clues that immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 may be long-lasting.The researchers followed up with 63 people who were infected with Covid-19 1.3 months, 6 months and 12 months after they got infected. Of these, 26 (41%) received one dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine.“In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Sars-Cov-2, neutralising activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months,” said the paper.It added that in the case of those who got the vaccine, all components “of the humoral response” – or the antibodies that bind to and neutralise the virus – increased and even neutralised variants of concern (VOC) in a manner that was similar or better than how people fought off the original virus that first emerged from Wuhan in 2020.The study‘s findings could provide important clues about the future of the pandemic and, partly, answer one of the crucial questions that have been asked since the pandemic began: How long will immunity last? The answer seems to be 12 months.Experts who reviewed the study and spoke to HT said the findings were promising.“It is incredibly promising that immune response lasts for 12 months with natural infection. Also the immune response becomes significantly stronger after immunisation. This study shows that natural infection will lead to long lasting, at least over one year, population immunity and prevent huge surges of infections in future waves,” said Manoj Jain, infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist at Emory University, Atlanta.Jain said while the protective response against the mutant variants for 12 months was encouraging, particularly positive was the “boost in the immune response against the variants after the vaccine”.“However, the Nature study did not look at neutralising response again the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant which was the predominant one in India during the second wave. While we need laboratory and clinical trials on protection against each of the virus mutations, the present study is great news that our natural immunity and the vaccines are protective against many of the variants,” he added.The Nature study also reported several other crucial findings: persistent long-term symptoms appeared to reduce in people 12 months after their infection, when compared to six months. “Only 14% of the individuals reported persistent long-term symptoms after 12 months, reduced from 44% at the six-month time point,” the authors said.The authors also note that of the four variants they tested – Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Eta (B.1.525), the lower neutralising activity was seen with Gamma, the variant seen first in South Africa.The researchers also found that the 12-month follow-up confirms a finding they saw at the six-month mark: the body’s adaptive immunity keeps evolving to better understand the Sars-CoV-2.In concluding, they noted that this “remarkable evolution” and the robust enhancement of immune response after vaccination suggests “that convalescent individuals who are vaccinated should enjoy high levels of protection against emerging variants without a need to modify existing vaccines.”“If memory responses evolve in a similar manner in naive individuals that receive vaccines, additional appropriately timed boosting with available vaccines should lead to protective immunity against circulating variants,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/immunity-lasts-at-least-a-year-after-infection-gets-stronger-after-jab-study-101623695805196.html
15-06-2021||India||5 LJP MPs rebel against Chirag, choose his uncle as leader in LS||Five of six Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) lawmakers in Lok Sabha replaced party chief Chirag Paswan with his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras as the leader of the parliamentary party on Monday, after a late-night rebellion by senior leaders roiled the regional party and touched off a political storm in Bihar.In a letter to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Monday, the five MPs said Paras was unanimously elected at the LJP parliamentary board meeting on Sunday at 6pm in Delhi. Khagaria MP Mehboob Ali Kesar was named deputy leader and Nawada MP Chandan Singh chief whip.“This is a decision taken out of compulsion. We were feeling suffocated,” said Paras, brother of late Union minister and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, who died last year. Late on Monday evening, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the leader of the LJP parliamentary party.Paras underlined that the LJP will remain in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and praised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, indicating that the party that was earlier bitterly opposed to the Janata Dal (United) might pursue a new direction under him. “There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. I have not broken party but saved it,” he said.Paras added that he bore no ill will towards his nephew and dismissed speculation that the party will break or merge with JD(U). LJP leaders aware of developments said Paras was likely to be formally made the party’s national president soon.The political change of guard was followed by dramatic scenes in Delhi as Paswan drove to meet Paras at his Rajendra Prasad Road residence but was left waiting outside the main gate for 15 minutes. Paswan , who is recuperating from Covid, drove himself with a cannula inserted in his hand clearly visible. He reached the residence at 11.45am and met Paras’s wife, said a person aware of developments.He left after an hour and 40 minutes, added the person, without speaking to the press. “He has been taken aback by the family feud that has threatened his hold over the party,” said a person close to the38-year-old Jamui MP.The surprise rebellion is an attempt to end the LJP’s alienation within the NDA -- where it is not invited to alliance meetings due to objections by the Janata Dal (United) – and comes amid speculation that Paras or his nephew, Samastipur MP Prince Raj, could be given a cabinet berth in Delhi.Paswan assumed charge of LJP after his father died weeks before the Bihar elections last year. But relations between Paras and Paswan nosedived when LJP decided to contest against the BJP-JD(U) alliance and Paswan targeted Kumar of misgovernance and corruption. During the campaign, Paras praised Kumar but was forced to retract his comment.LJP took in many JD(U) rebels and damaged Kumar’s party in at least 30 seats, almost costing the NDA a victory and resulting in the JD(U) posting its worst result and emerging as a junior partner to BJP. LJP also performed poorly, winning just one seat – its worst performance.In April, the lone party MLA, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the JD(U).Paras said some leaders inducted in the party in the run up to the Bihar polls were primarily responsible for the bad choices made. “99% of party leaders and cadres wanted to be in the NDA…however, influenced by some, it was decided to contest the election independently and everybody knows the humiliation the party suffered. It was a wrong decision,” he added.The rebellion is also aimed at ending the LJP’s isolation within the NDA, where the party is not called for meetings due to objections by the JD(U).Paras heaped lavish praise on Kumar. “He is a vikas purush (man of development). Bihar has developed under his regime, and we will support him in this endeavour,” he added.NDA leaders in Bihar said on condition of anonymity that 200 LJP leaders joined the JD(U) after the assembly polls and before his rebellion, Paras met JD(U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, a close associate of Kumar. Singh, assembly deputy speaker Maheswar Hazari and member of legislative council Sanjay Singh met the five LJP MPs on Monday.“It is a well known adage that as you sow, so you reap. Chirag Paswan was heading a party which was with the NDA. Yet, he adopted a stance that damaged it in the assembly polls. This led to a sense of unease within his own party,” JD(U) leader RCP Singh told reporters in Patna.In Delhi, speculation swirled of a possible cabinet berth to one of the LJP rebels.“There has been talk that Paras or Prince could be offered a berth in the Union council of ministers. Since JD(U) made clear their views on not being in favour of Chirag, a change in leadership could be a compromise that can keep the party intact and part of the NDA alliance,” said an LJP functionary on condition of anonymityA second party leader who also did not wish to be named said Paswan took the first step to reach out to his uncle and will do his best to prevent a split in the party. “There is a possibility that he will agree to step down as party president to avoid a split in the LJP,” the second leader said.If the party leaders fail to reach an agreement and the party is split, then both factions will have to prove their majority in order to retain the party symbol.The BJP distanced itself from the issue. “This is an internal matter of the party and the family and we hope it is resolved at the earliest,” said BJP spokesperson Guru Prakash.Bihar Congress on Monday urged Chirag to break away from the BJP-led NDA and align with the Congress-RJD led Grand Alliance (GA) to fulfil dreams of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan.The Congress asked Paswan to join hands with the Opposition Grand Alliance and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) blamed Kumar. “Those who torch other’s houses shall not forget that the fire might also engulf their houses also. However, Nitish Kumar can’t just wish away the troubles that he faces after release of Lalu Prasad from the jail. The game is still on,” said RJD MLA and chief spokesman Bhai Birendra.Experts said Paswan damaged his political future by doing negative politics. “What happened in the LJP was bound to happen. Chirag got politics in platter but could not match his late father Ram Vilas Paswan’s aura. Old party men were feeling suffocated. Dalits have significant place in Bihar but Chirag couldn’t consolidate them,” said DM Diwakar, political expert and former director of AN Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-ljp-mps-rebel-against-chirag-choose-his-uncle-as-leader-in-ls-101623695565194.html
15-06-2021||India||UP journalist dies in ‘accident’ days after alleging threat to life||A television journalist died in Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, ostensibly in a road accident, a day after he said his life was under threat for reporting on the “liquor mafia” in the state. The family of the journalist has filed a complaint alleging that he was murdered, and the incident has sparked a political controversy with opposition leaders demanding a probe.The journalist, Sulabh Srivastava, who was in his forties, was found seriously injured on Katra road under the Kotwali police station limits on Sunday night, police said. Srivastava, who worked with ABP News, was rushed to a hospital in the district where he was declared brought dead, they added.Prayagraj zone additional director general of police, Prem Prakash, said it appeared that Srivastava lost control of his motorbike as the road was slippery, and suffered severe head injuries after hitting an electricity pole.Prakash confirmed that on Saturday he received Srivastava’s letter alleging a threat to himself and his family, and seeking protection. But he rejected claims that the journalist was assaulted. “Sulabh was alive after suffering injuries and spoke to his colleagues. He could have informed them had he been assaulted by someone,” the ADG said.In his letter to the ADG, Srivastava alleged that the liquor mafia was angry with him for his coverage of the illicit liquor trade in the district, and wanted to harm him and his family. He urged the official to initiate a probe into the matter, and sought protection.“ For the past two days I have observed that some persons are following me. Me and my family are living in fear of the liquor mafia who may harm us. Please get the issue investigated and ensure our security,” Srivastava said in his letter to the ADG. HT has seen a copy of the letter.“The incident is being probed from all possible angles,” ADG Prakash said, adding that the report of the post mortem examination was awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death.But Srivastava’s wife, Renuka Srivastava, alleged that he was murdered. A first information report (FIR) has been filed under sections 302 (murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unidentified persons at the Pratapgarh Kotwali police station based on her complaint.Several Opposition leaders on Monday sought a probe into the journalist’s death.In a tweet, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav wanted to know why Srivastava was not provided security when he’d asked for it. “The mysterious death of a TV reporter in an alleged accident is extremely sad. The BJP government, in this case, should constitute a high-level probe, and tell the family members and the public why, despite the apprehension of murder by the liquor mafia expressed by the reporter, he was not provided security,” he said.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state, accusing it of nurturing “Jungle Raj”. “Liquor mafia from Aligarh to Pratapgarh: Dance of death in the entire state. UP government silent. Journalists should expose the truth, warn the administration about the danger. The government is asleep. Does the UP government, which nurtures Jungle Raj, have any answer to the tears of the family members of journalist Sulabh Srivastava?” she said in a tweet in Hindi.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted, “Sad to see that despite “democracy & freedom” being a part of our ethos, we are unable to save lives of those who are working tirelessly towards unfolding the truth.”In a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, Pratapgarh MP Sangam Lal Gupta of the BJP sought financial assistance to the family of the journalist and a government job for his wife. He, too, demanded a thorough probe into the incident.But Gupta termed the allegations of the opposition leaders as “baseless”. “State government is taking strict action against liquor mafia and all other criminal elements in the state.”(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-journalist-dies-in-accident-days-after-alleging-threat-to-life-101623695446611.html
15-06-2021||India||Trust deficit remains a year after Galwan clash||A trust deficit persists between the Indian and Chinese armies a year after their soldiers were involved in a brutal clash along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the remote Galwan Valley, and the lack of confidence in each other has hampered the disengagement of rival troops from friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the border row said on Monday on the condition of anonymity.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020 was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the LAC in more than five decades, and pushed the bilateral relationship to breaking point -- it left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.“It will be extremely hard to bridge the trust deficit created by the actions of the Chinese PLA in Galwan Valley. The damage to the military relationship has been done. The current generation of soldiers will never forget what happened in Galwan,” said an official who has commanded troops in the sensitive Ladakh sector.India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector for over a year, and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of troops and weapons from friction points on the disputed border.Indian soldiers, led by Colonel B Santosh Babu, fought off numerically superior Chinese troops in the seven-hour conflict near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley. Babu, 37, was among the 20 Indian soldiers killed in action.Babu, the commanding officer of 16 Bihar, and five other soldiers who displayed outstanding courage during the skirmish with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were awarded wartime gallantry awards. While Babu was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), the other five got Vir Chakras (VrC). MVC is India’s second-highest war-time gallantry award, followed by VrC. Only one of the VrC awardees is alive.The lack of trust has cast its shadow on the disengagement process, said a second official.“Both armies have not thinned their deployments in their depth areas because there is no trust. Both sides can deploy more troops to forward locations if needed. They are also building infrastructure to support military deployments in the Ladakh theatre,” he said.The Indian Army and PLA have held 10 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers after the skirmish, but the negotiations have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers from friction points. The first round of talks took place on June 6 before the Galwan Valley clash.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue so far has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February.On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that trust levels are bound to be low when a major standoff takes place between two countries leading to casualties on both sides. “However, it is always our endeavour that this trust deficit should not hinder the negotiation process. As two professional armies, it is imperative that we resolve the situation and make progress to restore trust at the earliest,” he said.The Chinese PLA cannot be trusted it will exploit any opportunity that comes its way, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).“The Chinese in their ancient philosophy have a content of deceit. The same philosophy has been continued by the present strategists and planners of China…In Galwan, the Indian armed forces stood up to the Chinese and sent a clear message that we shall defend our territory at all costs,” Jaswal added.While disengagement from Pangong Tso has been completed, talks have not yielded any results in resolving the problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.Also, both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.Naravane earlier said his soldiers were on high alert as PLA continued to base its troops and mechanised elements including tanks in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150km to 200km from the LAC.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-deficit-remains-a-year-after-galwan-clash-101623695385145.html
