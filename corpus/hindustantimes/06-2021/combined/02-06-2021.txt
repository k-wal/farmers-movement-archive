At 24.5% in 2018-19, its current participation rate is well below the global average of 45%, and is also the lowest in South Asia.Despite rising Gross Domestic Product (GDP), increasing educational attainment, rising household incomes, and declining fertility, women’s participation in the labour market has plummeted. Even worse, the gender gap in participation is overwhelmingly large and has been widening over the last decade or so. Moreover, there are considerable variations in the rates of women’s labour force participation between rural and urban areas (26.4% for rural versus 20.4% for urban women), and pronounced disparities are witnessed across Indian states.Multiple factors influence women’s decision to enter the labour market, including demand and supply-side drivers, prevailing socio-cultural and gender norms and attitudes. Specifically, women’s ability to work is influenced by their marital status, the number of children, caste, religion, gender, lack of essential education and vocational skills, and labour market discrimination.Also Read | With Shailaja’s omission, decoding the Indian Left’s gender blind spotAvailable evidence suggests that finding a paid job is much harder for women than men. And once they enter the labour market, women still face limited work options, have fewer learning and career advancement opportunities, and operate in deplorable working conditions. They are overrepresented in the informal economy, particularly in vulnerable, low skilled and poorly paid jobs that have limited social security. Equally concerning is the gender-caste intersectionality that is predominant in India and is manifested in differential employment outcomes for women.One of the often-cited explanations for the declining participation of women has been the rise in enrolment in schools and colleges – making them “unavailable” for paid market work. While this is true, evidence suggests that the decline is not limited to young women workers, and women’s participation has decreased substantially across all age cohorts, especially between 25 to 59 years.Furthermore, the relationship between educational attainment and women’s labour force participation is not unambiguous. The available data from National Sample Survey Office’s employment-unemployment survey and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) depicts a U-shaped relationship between education and labour force participation rates of women, strongly evident in the case of urban women. In other words, women with no or less education and women with tertiary levels of education exhibit the highest rates of paid work participation, i.e. they are significantly more likely to be employed than women who have completed secondary schooling. Even so, relatively low labour force participation persists among highly educated urban women.The low participation rates, however, do not indicate that women are working less. Instead, women’s time and efforts are diverted to unpaid care work (such as raising children, caring for sick and elderly) and domestic work. Women spend disproportionately more time on unpaid care work in India than men, particularly if married. While essential to the welfare of society and the economy, these activities are not accounted for in the System of National Accounts and employment, which means that they remain unrecorded, undervalued and, therefore, find limited focus in policies and programmes aimed at improving labour market outcomes. The Time-use Survey of 2019 shows that, on average, a woman spends 19.5% of her time every day in unpaid responsibilities compared to merely 2.5% by a man. The International Labour Organization notes that the unequal burden of unpaid care constrains women from participating in the paid market work as they are “time-poor”.Another significant impediment is the lack of women-friendly jobs. Researchers have debated that the overall employment situation for women has not improved in the last couple of years and that the declining labour force participation is associated with their limited involvement in sectors that provide jobs in white-collar services.The Covid-19 pandemic has only amplified these inequalities further. As per one recent study, the time spent on household and care responsibilities has increased by almost 30% in India due to the closure of schools and care services. Consequently, women have dropped out of the labour market and perhaps may never return.Women face multiple constraints in society, limiting their mobility and labour market choice, forcing them to take non-wage employment, like working on family farms and rearing cattle, or remain out of the labour force. The need of the hour is to invest in gender-responsive policies to break down these barriers to women’s economic engagement.Policymakers should take a holistic and integrated approach to improve women’s labour force participation and their overall labour market outcomes by enhancing access to timely and impactful skill development, adequate maternity benefits and entitlements, access to affordable childcare facilities, household infrastructure and provision of other family-friendly policies to reduce the burden of unpaid care work and safe and convenient transportation and public infrastructure. Additionally, providing access to better-paid formal jobs or support for women-led entrepreneurship opportunities, investing in public services and women-friendly public spaces and addressing discriminatory employment practices are also critical.Imparting necessary vocational and technical skills can have a remarkably beneficial impact on increasing women’s labour force participation in India. According to a recent working paper by IWWAGE, various forms of training, such as formal vocational training, hereditary training, on-the-job training, raise the probability of women’s labour market participation in rural and urban areas.Finally, we also need to invest in robust data and evidence systems to better measure and count women’s unpaid work and design gender-smart policies and programmes for women’s economic empowerment and overall well-being.Ruchika Chaudhary is a senior research fellow, Initiative for What Works to Advance Women and Girls in the Economy (IWWAGE), an initiative of LEAD at Krea UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-invisible-women-in-india-s-labour-market-101622636345192.html
02-06-2021||News||As the pandemic hit, how much did India spend on health?||When the Covid-19 pandemic erupted last year, it caught the world, and India, by surprise. No one knew what the treatment protocol for the unknown disease was. Most countries were short of masks, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, and testing kits that would form the first line of defence, and hospital beds, oxygen units, and ventilators that would form the second.A year later, as India faced its second wave of infections, the most severe in the world so far in terms of daily cases, the supply constraints only worsened. Everything from testing kits to hospital beds, oxygen to ventilators, medicines to ambulances have seemed to be in short supply.Was India ill-prepared for this calamity? A good way to answer this question is to look at government spending (for both the Union and states), on health from 2019-20 to 2021-22.Union government’s health spending Although 2020-21 has come to an end, we do not have the final numbers on government spending yet. What we have so far are provisional spending numbers from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), which works under the ministry of finance.Also Read | ®India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19The headline numbers do not impress. In 2019-20, the ministry of health and family welfare spent ₹64257.8 crore. This amount was increased by just 4.4% in the 2020-21 budget estimates (BE), which were presented before the pandemic hit India. Health spending in 2020-21 was increased to ₹82,928.3 crore according to the revised estimates (RE) presented with the 2021-22 Budget.If the CGA numbers are any indication, ₹2,234.4 crore, or about 3% of the revised estimate, will remain unspent. The total allocation for the ministry of health in 2021-22 (BE) is lower than the 2020-21 (RE) numbers.State government health spending The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database has health spending numbers from 2019-20 to 2021-22 for 24 states. Unlike central government expenditure, there is no CGA like body which has recent updates on state government expenditure. In 2019-20, these states spent ₹1.34 lakh crore on health (medical and public health under social services). This was expected to increase to ₹1.64 lakh crore in 2020-21, as per budget estimates. This number was revised to ₹1.69 lakh crore as per the revised estimates published in 2021-22. These 24 states are expected to spend ₹1.9 lakh crore on health in 2021-22.The actual spending in 2020-21 will only be known when the actual estimates are published in 2021-22. States spend more than the Union when it comes to both revenue and capital spending.Capital spending on health The trend in capital spending on health by the Union government that will include creation of new health facilities is revealing. It was a paltry ₹1666.9 crore in 2019-20. The 2020-21 BE numbers reduced it to ₹1065.7 crore, which was revised upwards to ₹4233.5 crore in 2020-21 RE numbers. However, only ₹3586.99 crore (or only 85% of the RE) has been spent by March, according to provisional figures by the CGA.The headline 97% number of the ministry of health is driven entirely by the 98% utilisation of revenue expenditure which made up 96% of the ministry’s total expenditure. Revenue expenditure is for recurring expenses such as paying salaries. The 2021-22 BE figure for capital spending is lower than both 2021 RE and provisional estimates put it at ₹2509 crore.The 24 states, for which data is available, have a higher capital spending on health than the centre. They spent ₹12256.7 crore in 2019-20. The 2020-21 BE number for this head was ₹20787.2 crore. However, this was slashed marginally to ₹20177.4 crore in the 2020-21 RE numbers.Many experts have pointed that the states have been forced to cut back on capital spending due to the pandemic’s economic disruption. The 2021-22 BE figures on capital spending health by these states is ₹29872.7 crore.When read with the shortfall of ₹600 in states’ capital spending as per 2020-21 BE and RE numbers, the overall rise in capital spending on health after the pandemic hit India is abysmally low. It is no wonder that the health infrastructure has been on the verge of collapse as the second wave rages through India.Not everyone is equally guilty for the poor health spending Some states devoted a greater share of their expenses to health in 2021-22 than others. Delhi, for instance, spent 12.4% of its budget on health according to the RE figures for 2021-22, over five percentage points higher than Assam, the next big state that used the most share of its expenditure for health. In comparison, the Union government allocated 2.4% of its budget to the ministry of health and family welfare.The only state – among the 24 for which data is available with CMIE – which spent less than this number is Telangana, which spent 2.39%. 12 states spent over 5% of their budget on health. Another nine states spent 4%-5% of their expenditure on health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/as-the-pandemic-hit-how-much-did-india-spend-on-health-101622630464956.html
02-06-2021||Noida||GB Nagar inches closer towards lifting partial curfew||Noida: With 843 active cases on Wednesday, Gautam Budh Nagar is inching closer to lifting of the partial curfew imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the Uttar Pradesh government’s recent order, partial corona curfew is to stay in district with over 600 active cases. When the order was announced on May 30, GB Nagar had 1,184 active cases.However, three days later, 341 patients have recovered from Covid-19, taking the active caseload to 843. On Wednesday, the district reported 79 new cases while 183 patients recovered, according to the state’s daily health bulletin.Almost a week earlier, on May 28, active cases were 2,398 and thus in the past six days, 1551 patients have recovered from the viral infection.As per officials, out of the total active cases, 480 are under home isolation while the remaining 363 are admitted to Covid-dedicated medical facilities in the district.“In the past one week, around 50 home isolated patients on an average are getting cured every day. The trained operators at the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) are making calls to all these patients at least three times a day, to know their complaints and other details,” said Dr Lalit Kumar, district’s additional chief medical officer who is also the nodal officer for the home isolation.He further said that the calls being received at the command centre have reduced in the past 15 days as well. “Till two weeks ago, we were getting over 5,000 calls a day. Most of the queries were regarding beds, oxygen and medicines like remdesivir and tocilizumab. However, now, the calls have reduced to about 500 a day and the queries are mostly about post-covid complications and vaccination centres,” said Kumar. On being asked whether GB Nagar can expect to have lower than 600 active cases in the next 2-3 days, district magistrate Suhas LY said, “That is yet to be seen, but we are hopeful that the downward trend of active cases will continue. Surveillance, containment and vaccination are the vital steps taken by the district health department that is helping control the spread of Covid-19.”However, medical experts feel that while the active cases going down may end up lifting of restrictions, people need to keep following proper Covid protocols.“The data provided by the government can often be misleading and we cannot completely rely on it. While data may say that active cases are down, the reality on the ground is very different. No matter whether the restrictions are lifted or not, we need to keep following Covid protocols like sanitisation and social distancing,” said Dr NK Sharma, president, Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-inches-closer-towards-lifting-partial-curfew-101622658546710.html
02-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Parents succumb to Covid-19, children face testing times ahead||Ghaziabad: Nalin, 23, is wondering how to break the news to his uncle’s daughters -- seven and 10 years old -- that they are now orphans.“Their father died an hour after talking to them over video on May 3 in hospital,” he said who had arrived in Noida recently from Hyderabad after he heard the news that Covid-19 had gripped the family. “They lost their mother four days later.”The girls lived with their parents and grandparents in a high-rise in Ghaziabad. They don’t know that they had lost their grandparents too to the disease. All four deaths happened in a span of 10 days. HT is not revealing the family details to protect their identity.“We had sent both girls to our hometown in Bareilly when the family showed symptoms,” said Nalin. “Both keep asking us when their parents and grandparents will return from hospital. What can we tell them other than ‘soon’? I had got them to speak to their father over video to motivate him and help in his recovery. How will I break the news?”The girls’ neighbours are trying to help them with the death certificates.“We have never seen such a tragedy before, and we are extending all possible help- with the cremation and arranging documents. It was difficult. More difficult was dealing with the deaths,” said neighbour Raj Kumar.The Ghaziabad administration has identified 17 minor children (including seven girls) from eight families who had been orphaned in the second wave of infections.But there are other “children” too, some of them who are yet to start off their lives.In Vaishali, 22-year-old Akshansh lost both his parents in two days at hospital.“My father died on April 22 and the next day, my mother,” he said. “Life has completely changed. I am now responsible for my 16-year-old sister. All four of had been infected but they died. Our relatives performed the cremation while we both were in hospital. They told us two days after we both recovered on April 26. I still cannot accept we are orphans.”Akshansh, A BTech graduate, now hopes to get a job soon in an economy that is trying to find stable ground. Ayush Kumar, 23, lost his mother and father in a week.“My mother tested positive for Covid, and she succumbed at a hospital in Delhi on April 22. On April 29, my 66-year-old father died of shock when he was told of the news. He did not have the infection. I performed all the cremation rituals one after the other. I don’t have many relatives. My life has been shattered,” said Kumar who is pursuing chartered accountancy.Then there are the stories of minors without an earning member. “My husband tested positive for Covid-19 on May 3 and two days later he died at home. He was the only earning member,” said Richa Sharma. “The education of our children (one nine and the other six years old) is under a cloud. I have also my aged in-laws to look after.” Govt responseThe officials said that they are paying more attention to minor children and their relatives and trying to extend all possible help.“As of now, the government has announced for helping out in continuing education of minor children and also helping them out financially. We are waiting for the government order to arrive. As of now it is only for children of deceased parents suffering from Covid and not for suspected cases. All the affected minors are with their relatives and in trauma. We are also taking up online counselling and our officers are in touch with their families,” said Vikas Chandra, district probation officer.Non-governmental organisations are also offering assistance.“We are providing ration to affected families and also tying up with schools where minor children can continue their education. We have been given assurance by seven schools that they will take up free education of such children. Till the other member find some job, we will also continue to provide monthly ration to the family,” said Ajay Sharma, founder member of ‘Hamara Pariwar,’ a charitable organisation which is supporting family of Richa Sharma.Anuj Tyagi, the state vice-president of Uttar Pradeshiya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, association of basic education teachers, said that they have given a list of 11 dead teachers to the basic education department.“We have requested the government to intervene and announce our deceased teachers as Corona warriors as many of them got infected during the election duties. The government has announced ₹30 lakh compensation. In case they are termed as Corona warriors, the compensation will increase to ₹50 lakh which will be more beneficial for survival of the children of the deceased,” he added.Overall, the second wave of the pandemic which peaked after mid of April has claimed 343 lives in Ghaziabad this year with an overall tally of 445 as per control room figures till June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-parents-succumb-to-covid-19-children-face-testing-times-ahead-101622658546061.html

The younger of the two boys is finding it especially hard to come to terms with the loss. It has become difficult for him to reside in the same house in the village where his parents lived as their memories haunt him and the tears are impossible to fight back. Helplessness is writ large on the face of the 71-year-old grandfather as he deals with the enormity of the responsibility of bringing up the two boys at Gudhi Rampuri Chandrasaini village in Bah tehsil of Agra district. His wife, 69, is a cancer patient and he underlines the need for government aid for the boys. The younger child, aged seven years, is a student of class 5 and the elder, aged 13 years, is a student of class 9 at a school in a nearby village. “I will leave no stone unturned to have my grandsons educated although there are financial constraints. Both my son and daughter-in-law were earning before they breathed their last,” says the grandfather. Till Covid turned their world upside down, all of them had been staying together. “I lost my son and daughter-in-law within a span of five days because of Covid-19. I have little choice but to live for my grandsons now,” he says. The grandfather is employed as security man in Delhi, but visits his village from time to time. He has no land to his name, nor any pension. He worked in the private sector all his life. “My daughter-in-law aged 37 was a shiksha mitra (para teacher). She died after being infected by the coronavirus on May 10 despite receiving treatment at a hospital in Agra,” he says. “Within a span of five days, I also lost my son, aged 41, to Covid. He was employed with a construction company. With his death, my grandsons lost both their parents and the responsibility of raising them has fallen on me,” he says. “I have to go to Delhi to report for work. My grandsons are taken care of by my wife, who is 69 years’ old and a cancer patient,” he says. “A sub divisional magistrate was in the village recently and talked to me. But we are yet to get any financial aid from the government. Till then, I have to carry out the responsibility of taking care of my grandsons so that they do not feel orphaned,” he says. “However, we need government help as both my wife and I are old. We may not live long enough to see my grandsons settled. The government should ensure a government job for my grandsons (when they grow up),” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-brothers-lose-parents-to-covid-within-five-days-101622658366099.html

The weather will turn sultry again, following a fortnight of rain and cloudy sky. “Coming days will be warmer with maximum temperature crossing 40 degree Celsius in several places across the state. The heat will be accompanied with humidity in some regions that experienced good rainfall in the past few days,” said state MeT director JP Gupta. While regions with above average rainfall will experience spike in humidity, the dry regions, including Bundelkhand and Prayagraj, will experience heat wave in coming days. “District authorities across the state have been alerted about the shift in weather conditions for further action,” said Gupta. In the state capital the mercury is expected to rise around four degrees over the weekend with clear sky on most days. These conditions lead to spike in average temperatures. The maximum day temperature is also expected to cross the 40-degree mark during daytime. The change was reflected on Wednesday when the mercury reached 39 degrees in the afternoon. Beside the state capital, Banda, Jhansi, Prayagraj and Varanasi recorded the hottest day on Wednesday with the mercury hovering around 40 degrees Celsius. This weather condition will prevail for the next four to five days before another brief spell of rainfall around the middle of next week, according to the IMD forecast. According to experts, the spike in temperature will provide a much needed respite to mango farmers of the state. “High temperature, accompanied with high humidity accelerates natural ripening of fruits. This will help mango growers to harvest the remaining crop and sell it in the market before another spell of adverse weather hits,” said Shailendra Rajan, director of Lucknow-based Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture(CISH)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-temp-humidity-to-spike-over-weekend-101622657886029.html

The governor directed the VCs to hold exams as per guidelines issued by the state government and promote students to the next academic session. She asked the VCs to also begin hiring of staff on vacant posts in a timely manner. Regarding implementation of New Education Policy (NEP)-2020 in state universities, the governor asked the VCs to submit the response and suggestion of their respective universities by June 15 so that the matter could be discussed properly before implementation. Regarding convocations, the governor asked the VC to ensure that students were handed over their degrees soon after convocation. She suggested making a database of names, phone numbers and addresses of the students so that the degrees could be sent to them by post. The governor asked the VC to make arrangements for celebration of Yoga Day on June 21 on campus and participate in plantation drives planned by the state government. Stating that universities should expand their roles, she suggested that every state university must involve itself in social work. “The universities should help women in nearby economically backward areas to form self help groups and try to train them in different skills,” the governor told the VCs as per a press statement issued by the Raj Bhawan. “The university should also adopt specially abled children living in residential areas near universities and help them to pursue their education,” she said. ,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/begin-regular-session-as-per-govt-guidelines-guv-to-vcs-101622657526040.html

In the first phase, the election to the posts of zila panchayat chairpersons will be held around June 20 while voting for the post of kshetra panchayat/block heads will take place in the second week of July, as per the plan chalked out by the state government.“In an affidavit filed with the Allahabad high court last week, the state government had said that indirect elections to elect new zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons will be held and completed by July 12,” said a senior official. “The notification for the polls to the post of zila panchayat chiefs may be issued by the end of next week and the poll process will take 15 days to complete after issuance of the notification by the State Election Commission (SEC),” he added. In an order passed on February 4, the high court had directed the government and the State Election Commission to complete direct elections to all the panchayats by April 30 and complete indirect elections thereafter within 15 days, that is, by May 15, 2021. Though the direct elections to the posts of pradhans, village ward members, kshetra panchayat members and zila panchayat members were held within the deadline set by the court, the government sought to delay the indirect polls supposedly due to the devastating second wave of the Covid pandemic. “As the high court had set the deadline for holding indirect polls too, we had to file an affidavit in the court, informing it about the reasons why it was not possible to hold polls by May 15,” the official said. Panchayati raj minister Bhupendra Singh said the government was ready to hold indirect panchayat elections now when the pandemic had subsided. “We hope to complete the exercise for the indirect polls electing new zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons by June-end or early July,” he hinted. Now, 75,852 kshetra panchayat members and 3,050 zila panchayat members elected in the recent direct polls will vote to elect 75 zila panchayat and 826 kshetra panchayat chiefs, respectively, in the final round of three-tier panchayat polls. Political parties have high stakes in the indirect elections and they are busy setting their electoral arithmetic right to ensure victory of candidates to be backed by them. “Hectic campaigning involving efforts for horse trading and use of money and muscle power to win the support of independents and others is already on in villages these days,” said an official of the panchayati raj department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/process-to-elect-zila-kshetra-panchayat-chiefs-to-be-completed-by-july-12-up-govt-101622656625934.html

02-06-2021||Gurugram||35 under-construction shops near Khandsa Road demolished||At least 35 shops that were being constructed on a 600 square yard plot along Khandsa Road in violation of rules were demolished by a team of the Town and Country Planning Department (DTCP) on Wednesday. DTCP officials said that no licence or permission was taken by the owner for construction of the commercial complex and despite an FIR being registered in the matter, construction was being carried in gross violation of laws. The demolition drive started around 11am by the enforcement team of DTCP, comprising 25 officials, which was protected by a police contingent of around 150 personnel that was deployed to maintain law and order. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that it was a joint demolition drive in which around 35 shops constructed in violation of rules were demolished. “A shopping mall-like structure was being constructed and it took us four earth moving machines and a heavy Pokland machine, which had to be called in later, to demolish the structure,” said Bhath, adding that the drive went on till late evening due to the sturdy nature of construction. Bhath said that an FIR was earlier registered against the owners in this matter under relevant sections. “The owners were asked to desist from further construction,” he said. The owner of the under-construction complex, OP Kataria, when asked about the matter said that he was being targeted for being an RTI activist, to pressure him to compromise in a legal matter. “I am being targeted as I had filed multiple cases of electoral malpractices and I am not ready to compromise in the matter. Why no action is being taken against illegal buildings on Khandsa Road and in the 900-metre area around IAF ammunition dump?” he said. DTCP officials, however, said that the department would take action in all areas under their jurisdiction. “It is wrong to defend illegal actions by citing violations by others. We have strict directions from director, DTCP, to take action against illegal shopping complexes and colonies,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/35-under-construction-shops-near-khandsa-road-demolished-101622655669126.html

The project cost has been estimated at ₹70 lakh.Due to litigation issues, road connectivity in the newer sectors could not be completed, said officials.“Due to litigation issues, compensation of land, delays in land transfer, parts of roads at different places had been left out and could not be constructed. Due to this, residents had to take longer routes, but now these issues have been resolved and we are starting work on the construction of these missing links. We have floated tenders and link roads on five stretches will be constructed within six months,” said Shaveta Sharma, executive engineer, Infrastructure-I division of GMDA.The authority will be constructing missing link roads to connect sectors 81, 82, 86, 92, 95 and outer parts of sectors 91 and 92. During the 8th board meeting of the authority in April, GMDA officials said these roads will have specifications of 2 x 2.99-metre width with central verge varying from three to eight metres, with surface run-off drains on both sides.Residents of the newer sectors said that completion of these link roads is important to bring down the number of accidents in the area.Praveen Malik, the vice-president of United Association of New Gurugram, a body of 40 housing societies from Sector 77 to Sector 90, said, “In 2015-16, these new sectors started coming up which were developed by private builders, and they were responsible for the construction of service lanes, while master roads were to be developed by GMDA. But due to different legal issues, the road construction got delayed. Due to that, residents have to face issues like potholes and waterlogging on roads, making them accident-prone. The construction of the link roads will help in smooth connectivity for residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/newer-sectors-to-get-link-roads-within-six-months-gmda-101622655666437.html
02-06-2021||Gurugram||Power department cuts losses by 2.87%, recovers dues of ₹162 crore||The electricity department has managed to reduce aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses by 2.87% this year, officials of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) said on Wednesday, citing checks on electricity theft on a large scale as the main reason. The department registered 48,729 cases of power theft in 2020-21 and fines to the tune of ₹162 crore were realised, officials said. Dr Balkar Singh, the managing director of DHBVN, said that the transmission and other losses in 2020-21 have decreased sharply as the discom focussed on reducing losses. “The transmission losses have come down from 16.50% last year to 13.63% this year. One of the major reasons for AT&C loss is electricity theft. To check the theft of electricity, campaigns were also organised from time to time by DHBVN, with special teams to check electricity theft and monitor them regularly,” said Singh. Aggregate technical and commercial losses are a combination of energy loss (technical loss, theft and inefficiency in billing) and commercial loss (default in payment and inefficiency in collection).Singh also said was the government departments and agencies were asked to pay electricity bills on time and they also launched a large-scale exercise to disconnect electricity connections of defaulting consumers. When asked about the timelines of the Smartgrid project in the city as electricity consumers across the city face power cuts, especially due to meteorological factors, Singh assured that work will be carried out at an accelerated pace. “The lockdowns have impacted the project work but the Smartgrid team has assured me that two modules will be completed by July this year. The wind storms and squall this year have been far stronger and have damaged cables in many cities, including Gurugram, but this will be minimised,” said Singh. Officials said that around 40% of the electricity lines in sectors 1 to 57 of Gurugram have been laid underground. Kulvinder Singh, executive engineer, Smartgrid project, Gurugram, said, “The remaining areas would be covered in the next one year at the most.”In a related development, DHBVN officials said that consumers can also get meter reading errors rectified from home. An official said that a facility of trust reading is being provided by Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam (Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam). In case the readings are wrong, consumers can get the bill rectified by uploading the correct meter reading on the department’s website, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/power-department-cuts-losses-by-2-87-recovers-dues-of-162-crore-101622655665882.html

The total count of patients now stands at 229. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “Unlike Covid-19, mucormycosis cannot be transmitted from one person to another. Treatment is possible if detected timely. About 45 people have been discharged till now, while 184 are still undergoing treatment. The disease has been notified by the Haryana government, making it mandatory for hospitals to share information of black fungus cases treated in their facilities.” According to the data, till June 1, 951 cases of black fungus have been detected in the state, of which 746 are currently active. As many as 84 people have died due to illness. Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement, the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/45-mucormycosis-patients-recovered-so-far-184-under-treatment-101622655605890.html

However, officials said that sufficient doses are available for those aged 45 and above at the government centres. “The department is yet to receive vaccine stock from the state health department for the inoculation of people aged 18 and above,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. Two big hospitals, Narayana Superspeciality in Sector 24 and Artemis Hospital in Sector 51, have also started vaccination drive in the last two days. Until now, only four hospitals, Fortis, Max, Medanta and Columbia Asia, were providing vaccines for the 18-45 age group. Commander (retd) Navneet Bali, regional director, northern region, Narayana Health, said, “Vaccine has been purchased from the Serum Institute of India by our corporate office in Bangalore. For Gurugram, we have 10,000 doses. The target is to inoculate at least 1,000 people every day. It has been decided the hospital won’t charge any processing fee, and shots will be given at ₹650 instead of ₹900. This is our small way of fulfilling our commitment towards the nation’s goal of vaccinating maximum beneficiaries.” Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent, Artemis Hospital, said that at least 300 people are taking Covishield shot every day since May 31. “Hospital will be holding vaccination drives at workplaces and residents’ welfare association based on requests. The daily coverage will be increased to 800 gradually.” According to the health department data, 708,768 doses have been administered in the district till now, of which 7,544 doses were administered on Wednesday. Over 7,781 people in the 18-45 age group took their vaccine shots at private hospitals. The health department held a special camp for widows in the 18-45 age bracket and inoculated 382 persons across the four blocks of the district. Among those aged 45 and above, 1,712 people took their doses at government health centres, and 264 were inoculated at private facilities. About 95 healthcare workers and 310 front-line workers and their family members also took the vaccine shot. In the last few days, various camps have been organised to cover high-risk population group. To cover people with physical disabilities, who are not enrolled under any social welfare schemes, the district administration is reaching out to them on social media. “A Google form has been generated and promoted on district administration’s social media platform asking people with physical disabilities to come forward. Till now, 92 people have registered, seeking the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine,” said Nayonika Basu, associate, Chief Minister’s Good Governance Associate (CMGGA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccinations-on-hold-for-18-45-age-group-for-third-consecutive-day-101622655547078.html

First, they are more in number compared to the elderly population. Second, they are highly mobile, moving from one place to another for various kinds of work. It makes them more susceptible to contracting the infection.” Over 12, 515 children (7%) in 11-20 years and 6,624 (3.7%) in the 0-10 age group contracted the virus, but no death has been reported in these age groups.

Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Despite 21-40 age group being the most affected population, death rate in the age groups has been lesser compared to the older population. They contribute roughly about 10% to overall deaths. In terms of morbidity and mortality, people between 41 and 70 are the most vulnerable. Among those in their 60s, the death rate has been almost 26% until May 24 and 23% among those between 71 and 80 years.” The data shows that almost 58.6% of the infected population were male, while two transgenders tested positive in the last 14 months of the pandemic. 83 new cases detected The daily case count on Wednesday declined to 83, the lowest since March 16.

Daily mortality is still high, according to the district health bulletin. On Wednesday, nine people died due to Covid-19, taking the death toll to 836. Among the 1,073 active cases, at least 143 are hospitalised, while 926 are home isolated and four are in district covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/people-aged-21-40-account-for-51-of-total-cases-since-pandemic-outbreak-101622655546476.html

The maximum tariff for the Type-A ambulances/medical first responders has been fixed at ₹500 for first 10 km and above that ₹10 per km, while Type-B road ambulances/patient transport ambulance (the cost of which is up to ₹8 lakh such as Maruti Omni, Tata Magic etc) can charge maximum fare of ₹1,000 for per 10 km and ₹20 per extra km. Similarly, the government has fixed the maximum fare for Type-C road ambulances/basic life support ambulances (more than ₹8 lakh and up to ₹10 lakh like Mahindra Bolero) at ₹1500 for first 10 km and then ₹25 per extra km. The Type-D road ambulances/advance life support ambulances (more than ₹10 lakh such as Tata Winger, Force Traveler and Tata 407) cannot charge more than ₹2,000 for first 10 km and ₹30 per extra km. The decision comes after the government received complaints about private hospital ambulance operators charging exorbitant rates when the Covid pandemic was at its peak in the state. A circular issued by principal secretary, transport, Rajesh Kumar Singh here on May 31 after the state transport authority passed a proposal in this regard warned that the transport department would cancel the ambulance’s registration besides cancelling the driver and the conductor’s driving licence if any ambulance operator was found charging more than what the government had fixed. Transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu said that road ambulances were free from the liability of taking a permit to ply and the state government also did not charge any tax from them. “This is because ambulance service is not a commercial venture but a social service and hence they are not supposed to overcharge,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-fixes-max-tariff-for-pvt-ambulance-providers-101622655545880.html
02-06-2021||Gurugram||Third sero survey to be held next week||A third round of the serological survey to detect the presence of antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be held in the second week of June, according to the district health department. Four urban clusters and 12 rural areas have been selected in the district for the survey.“State health department has planned to conduct the third round of sero survey by using the sample size of 400 participants from each district of Haryana. Guidelines on conducting the survey are yet to be received from the state,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram.Officials said that directions were issued to make necessary arrangements for lab equipment, such as reagents and testing machines, among others, before the survey starts.Serological surveys help in gauging the extent of spread and the actual burden of Covid-19 infection in a given area. Blood samples are taken to trace the presence of IgG antibodies, which a person might have developed after contracting the virus but remained asymptomatic.Across the state, 88 urban areas and 264 villages have been finalised for the survey, with an overall sample size of around 8,800, with 400 samples to be collected from 22 districts.In Gurugram, samples will be collected from urban clusters under urban primary health centres of Mullahera, Basai Enclave, Naharpur Roopa and Patel Nagar. These are densely populated areas of the district, largely in old Gurugram, said officials. Besides, samples will also be collected from rural blocks of Bhondsi, Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Wazirabad, Mushedpur, Khalipur, Baluda, Sanchauli, Dooma, Khetiawas and Lohatki.The state conducted two serological surveys in 2020. In the first round in Gurugram, the seropositivity rate of the urban areas was 18.5%, which increased to 25.9% in the second area, while in rural areas, it increased from 5.7% in the first round to 10.1% in the second round. In both surveys, over 800 people were tested.Overall, the seropositivity in the state in the second round was 14.8%. At the district level, Faridabad reported the highest prevalence of 31.2%, followed by 28.6% in the Yamunanagar district.

The young Lok Sabha MP did not speak to the media. TMC leaders said it was a courtesy call.“Abhishek Banerjee briefly met Roy’s son Subhranshu and inquired about his mother’s health,” said a TMC leader who did not want to be named. But the visit nevertheless sparked buzz about the 67-year-old Roy’s next move. As the rumours swirled, Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh too dropped by two hours later.Mukul Roy, a founder TMC member, was suspended for six years from the Trinamool Congress after his meeting with BJP leaders in September 2017. Roy quit from the party and the Rajya Sabha the following month and joined the BJP in November 2017. Mukul Roy was the BJP’s lead election strategist for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. In September last year, Roy, who is an accused in the Narada sting operation case probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation, was appointed national vice-president of the BJP.Abhishek Banerjee’s surprise visit comes days after Mukul Roy’s son Subhranshu wrote on Facebook on Saturday that self-criticism is more necessary than criticising a government elected by people, a remark that was widely seen to refer to the BJP sharp campaign against Mamata Banerjee after she won the state elections.Subhranshu Roy, who joined the BJP last year, had also contested the election from Bijpur in North 24 Parganas district but lost. Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district.To be sure, Mamata Banerjee did make repeated references to Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari - two of her trusted lieutenants who quit the TMC to join the BJP - during campaigning for the eight-phase polls and was seen to be soft on Mukul Roy.“Poor Mukul has been fielded from Nadia district although he hails from North 24 Parganas. He is not as bad as Suvendu,” Banerjee said at one campaign rally.Mukul Roy did try to end the speculation, telling reporters that he was a “dedicated worker” of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-s-nephew-visits-bjp-leader-mukul-roy-s-ailing-wife-sparks-buzz-101622654226396.html

Cancellation of these exams is a sigh of relief for students, as classwork is almost shut in J&K since August 2019,” said Raja Asif, a Class 12 CBSE student from Kashmir.Asif adds that if there was further delay in the exams, students would have lost a complete year. “We have a different session schedule. Schools here fall under the local UT board and they have already conducted exams in Kashmir. Universities and colleges have also started admissions here unlike the rest of India where college admissions begin after CBSE declares the results,” says Asif.“Not only students, parents too were worried about conducting exams in these conditions. Most students and teachers who would appear and invigilate the exams, are still not vaccinated,” said Faisal Ahmad, a student.He added that even if student vaccination would have been given a priority, this meant there was a delay of over two to three months until all students get both doses administered.Another student, Muheeba Ayoub, said it was imperative to cancel these exams for not facilitating a third wave as lakhs of students were at risk of a potential infection through these exams.“The decision of not forcing students to take the exam has relieved us,’ Ayoub added.Meanwhile, academicians in J&K said that the decision to cancel these exams is not in best interest of students.Shah Fayaz, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Teachers’ Association, said that cancellation of exams of Class 12 students will have far reaching impact on the future of the society.Fayaz adds that the government should have instead delayed the exams and conducted them after a few months as Class 12 students, unlike little children, are conscious of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “They are old enough to abide by the safety protocol and conducting exams of such students is not a big deal,” he said.Dr Shashikant Dixit, principal of Delhi Public School, Kashmir, said that there is no replacement to life and cancellation of physical exams was the only option left as students were unprepared owing to persistent crisis in the country.Dixit added that the decision has created distress among students who had been preparing hard to score well in their board exam.He said that CBSE most likely will keep a second option open by conducting offline exams in October for those who don’t wish their grades to be assessed internally by schools.Sofi Rafeeq, a teacher at a CBSE school said the decision is a disrespect to the hard work of students who had been burning their midnight oil amid such a crisis to score well in exams.Rafeeq added that the assessment that will be done now will largely put students in the same fray and there will be an aggregate average scoring of marks by all students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-12-cbse-students-from-j-k-welcome-cancellation-of-exams-101622653266453.html

Vaccination details for other scheduled days will be shared on their official Twitter handles.“Please note that all BMC and government vaccination centres will be closed tomorrow (June 3, 2021). We apologize for the inconvenience. Please watch this space for updates regarding vaccination centres and schedules,” BMC tweeted.The civic body gave no reason for the closure of vaccination centres but news agency ANI reported a shortage of vaccine was the reason behind the sudden closure of centres run by the state government and the municipal body.“Due to lack of adequate vaccine stock, vaccination will be stopped tomorrow (June 3) at Government and Municipal Centers in Mumbai,” ANI said quoting BMC’s department of public relations.Maharashtra is slated to receive six million doses of Covid-19 vaccine in June. Out of these six million doses, four million will be allocated by the Centre and two million will be bought by the state to vaccinate people between 18 and 44 years. State health officials told reporters that the state-procured doses might also be diverted for administering the second dose to individuals in the above 45 age group.Maharashtra has formulated a plan to help reduce the daily cases of Covid-19 by pushing vaccination in areas with high positivity rates and low vaccination rates. The state has been witnessing a sharp decline in the daily tally of cases and reported 15,169 new cases on Wednesday, out of which 923 were from Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-and-govt-vaccination-centres-in-mumbai-to-remain-shut-on-june-3-101622652590784.html

Where is the required social distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour? People are so eager to purchase liquor and it doesn’t matter to them if the virus gets transmitted,” said an elderly man, who had come to an adjacent hardware store to purchase bath fittings.“Is it not a callous approach of the government? There was a lockdown and now everything has gone for a toss. It seems that this government wants revenue even if it comes from the dead,” he rued.New chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta said that there will be “zero tolerance on non-adherence to Covid-apt behaviour”.“There will be zero tolerance on non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. No one has the right to put others’ lives at risk,” he tweeted on the official handle of the health and medical education department.Liquor shops were closed in the last week of April following imposition of Covid curfew after a successful e-auction which fetched ₹140 crore for one year to the government.The e-auction replaced the traditional practice of renewal of license, leaving 228 liquor traders without a job.Setting up of wine shops in residential areas led to protests by residents against the excise department, with the protesters seeking L-G Manoj Sinha’s intervention in shifting the establishments from their areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-in-jammu-as-tipplers-rush-to-liquor-shops-101622652848817.html

Many people have lost their lives allegedly due to non-availability of required medical facilities.“Jammu was given the impression that Article 370 is the only hurdle in development and prosperity of the region. But today, even medicines are not available to people battling the pandemic,” she added.She urged the party leaders to formulate emergency response strategy at district level and reach out to people at grassroots level.Mehbooba said the administration, at the district level, has been crippled as the ruling dispensation in New Delhi is not allowing even the officers to take decisions required for the welfare of people.“Independence and functioning of administration has been made hostage to the political aspiration of BJP and Jammu has been at the receiving end,” she said.Mehbooba said Mughal Road and Kishtwar-Sinthan highways remained closed for vehicular traffic despite huge amount being spent on snow clearance only because those sitting in New Delhi consider surface connectivity of Pripanchal and Chenab Valley with Kashmir region detrimental to their political interests.Mufti said efficiency, experience and competency are no more yardsticks for posting of officers at key places resulting into complete administrative chaos.She said that the SC, ST population has been victimised in the name of anti-encroachment drives and people have been pushed to the walls to appease political heavyweights.“All the sections of society including traders, industrialists, transports, farmers, labourers besides others are at a crossroad today due to official apathy and administrative inertia,” she said.“The recent revelations by BJP leaders about functioning of the party and its leadership and facilitating corruption is indication of how rights of people are being muzzled to benefit few people connected to the ruling party,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/administrative-apathy-more-fatal-than-the-pandemic-mehbooba-mufti-101622652727032.html

He was found dead at his official residence in New Delhi.The Fatehpur assembly seat, on the other hand, was represented by Congress legislator and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania who died on February 12 after a prolonged illness. Section 151A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, mandates the EC to fill vacancies in the Houses of Parliament and State Legislatures through byelections within six months of the date of occurrence of the vacancy.Chief electoral officer C Paularasu said the state government will ask the election commission to consult them before announcing the poll plan.On May 25, the EC, while reviewing the situation amid the second wave of the pandemic, had observed that it would not be appropriate to hold byelections till the pandemic situation improves. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislative party had suggested to the high command to postpone the byelection which was supposed to be held with last round of elections in Bengal. The party had urged the commission to relax the constitutional binding of holding elections within six months. Parties gear up for pollsMeanwhile, political parties have started preparations for the polls. BJP had appointed industries minister Bikram Singh and former state chief Satpal Singh Satti as incharges for Fathepur elections. Former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar is among the claimants for the ticket along with party’s local leader Baldev Thakur. The Congress had appointed former transport minister GS Bali as its in charge and forwarded only one name for candidature -- Bhawani Singh Pathania, the son of Sujan Singh Pathania. In Mandi, there are four claimants for the BJP ticket. Kargil war hero Brigadier Kushal Singh Thakur, who is currently the chairman of HP ex-servicemen corporation, party secretary Payal Vaidya and BJP’s chief spokesman Ajay Rana are in the race while a section of the party is keen on fielding the party’s senior most minister Mahender Singh Thakur, who holds the horticulture and Jal Shakti portfolio.Thakur himself is not keen to contest. On the other hand, the Congress is still in dilemma over the candidates. During the previous elections, it had pitted former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s wife Pratibha Singh against Ram Sawroop Sharma. Pratibha has served as the Lok Sabha member from Mandi while former telecommunication minister Sukhram’s grandson Ashray Sharma who lost to Ram Swaroop Sharma last time is also vying for the ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mandi-fatehpur-bypolls-due-in-aug-eci-seeks-report-on-covid-situation-101622652667293.html

According to conservative estimates, the hospitality industry has borne over ₹1,500 crore losses since the lockdown was imposed in state while more than two lakh persons employed in the hotel industry have gone jobless.After the lockdown was imposed last year, the tourism sector was hopeful of making up for the losses this summer. The peak tour season for Himachal starts in April and end in June but the surge in second wave of Covid forced the government to impose state-wide lockdown.“The three-month summer tourist season plays a big role in sustainability of the hotel industry. The tourism industry lost complete summer season last year due to the pandemic and this year also, they lost almost 75% of the major tourist season,” says Himachal Pradesh Tourist Stakeholders Association president MK Seth, adding, “Our working capital has completely exhausted. Tourism in Himachal has come to a grinding halt since March 2021.”Hoteliers are worried about repaying monthly instalments of the loans. The Reserve Bank of India has brought the scheme of restructuring of loans with a condition that loan account should be standard as on March 31, 2021.The tourism industry remained closed for almost eight months last year due to the nationwide lockdown. This year again just before the tourist season, the second wave of Covid has compelled the hoteliers to keep their units closed due to no occupancy.The RBI has brought Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 3.0 to provide relief to the tourism, hospitality and travel sector but majority of tourism stakeholders could not take the benefit of the scheme due to its stringent conditions.The biggest hurdle in the scheme is the cut-off date of outstanding balance of loan taken as on February 29, 2020 that also with a condition that the account should not have default of more than 60 days as on February 2020.Majority of the tourism units were compelled to take fresh loans past year to meet their running expanses of the units because there was no help extended to the industry by the government since last year.The tourism sector has asked the government to make amendments by extending cut-off date to March 31, 2021 and to relax the condition of number of days of default of the EMI.The state working capital interest subvention scheme is still awaited. Further, the hoteliers have asked the government to ease out restrictions for tourists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemichit-hp-tourism-industry-seeks-govt-help-to-emerge-from-crisis-101622652426245.html

Comparatively, the CFR was 1.2% in April when the state recorded 35,682 infections and 449 deaths.The overall CFR in the state is 1.6%, which is higher than the national average of 1.2%.Shimla has the highest CFR of 2.34% followed by Kangra at 2.14%. However, when one looks at absolute numbers, Kangra’s fatalities (559) outnumber Shimla (211).The other two districts having a CFR above the state average are Hamirpur and Una (1.7% each).Kangra chief medical officer Dr Gurdarshan Gupta said the district’s overall CFR since the outbreak is 2.14% while in May, it was 2.18% and in April, it was 1.81%.“We don’t have a very high CFR but the absolute number of deaths is high,” said Dr Gupta, adding that this was primarily due to the high number of infections. Kangra recorded 8,207 infections in April and 25,628 in May, he said.Dr Gupta further said that another reason is that Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College (RPGMC), Tanda, is a tertiary care centre and people are referred here from at least five districts. “If a patient is detected positive here and eventually dies, the death is counted in Kangra,” he said. Meanwhile, National Health Mission director Dr Nipun Jindal said some of the deaths were of patients in home isolation. In such cases, patients fall in two categories – the first were those who had come in contact with an infected patient and were recommended home isolation while the second type were those who neglected their symptoms and eventually died. Presumptive treatment protocol For suspected Covid-19 patients, the state Covid clinical team has recommended presumptive treatment. It is advised that patients in home isolation and all patients who are suspected to have Covid-19 infection and are waiting for their test reports should be put on presumptive therapy, which includes recommended medicine, said Dr Nipun Jindal.Suspected Covid-19 patients, whose RT-PCR test report is awaited or is negative but show features of severe acute respiratory illness, shall be admitted in the Triage area of the hospital and will be considered for chest scan.Covid-19 treatment of such patients shall be started with the aim to maintain target oxygen saturation, he said.Apart from that, Dr Jindal said, panchcyat-level task forces have been constituted to keep tabs on health vitals of home isolated patients so that they can be immediately shifted to a hospital if required.An IEC programme has also been launched to encourage people to seek treatment and report to the authorities if they have symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-state-grapples-with-high-cfr-hp-issues-presumptive-treatment-protocol-101622652066285.html

Several roads in the suburbs are inundated with water after spells of rain and open storm water drains can prove fatal to the commuters, complained residents. The Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA), an umbrella organisation of over 200 housing societies, has appealed to the Pune Metropolitan and Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), seeking immediate repairs of storm water drains and the laying of fresh drainage lines in the interiors. Similarly, citizen groups in Kharadi, Mohammdwadi, NIBM, Mundhwa and other suburbs have petitioned the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) stating that persistent rains during the past few days had laid bare the inadequate and faulty storm water drainage system. The residents of Undri-Mohammadwadi complained about repeatedly flooding of connecting roads, while Kharadi residents contended that their roads were inundated by sewage water overflowing from clogged drains and chambers. Sanjeev Kumar Patil, director of WHSA, said that storm water drainage in almost all the locations in Wagholi become mini nullahs and rivulets during monsoon. “Wagholikars are living under the fear of getting drowned in the accumulated and flowing rainwater. The rainwater is causing havoc as the approach roads to different societies in our area don’t have a proper drainage system. With rainfall increasing every year, the threat to our lives has also scaled up over the years. We want the PMRDA to immediately prepare a masterplan of storm water drain works in our area. The citizens cannot endanger their lives during monsoon season,” Patil said. Wagholi rural development officer Anil Kumbhar said that the storm water work will be carried out once the necessary funds are made available from the government. “In the meantime, we have taken efforts to ensure that all the drains were cleaned before the onset of monsoon,” he said. Santosh Argade, a teacher at Undri primary school and a resident of Undri Heights said that he had a a tough time driving his car from Mohammadwadi to Undri via the connecting road from Dorabjee Mall. “The entire road was overflowing with water and the water from the nullah too came onto the road leading to traffic jams and chaos. It could turn fatal in the future as the fencing wall has collapsed and the PMC has done nothing about it for the past four years.” PMC road department head V G Kulkarni said that the road will be reconstructed, and fencing will be done to protect the lives of the commuters.Pune Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “All the roads across the city need to have working storm water drains and any lethargy will be dealt wi0h strictly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/eastern-pune-residents-demand-proper-cleaning-of-storm-water-drains-to-prevent-monsoon-tragedy-101622651045614.html

At several spots, the work is overflowing onto the main bypass highway, with huge rocks, mud and construction material obstructing the path of commuters and motorists. “I travel on this bypass every day for my work and often, we have to slow down as material is on the road. I have seen two-wheeler riders slipping over the mud and stones near Katraj,” said Rohan Nalawade, a resident of the Vadagaon Budruk area. Pankaj Shastri, a resident from Warje said, “We have to risk our lives while travelling on the bypass. The service road work is going on at a snail’s pace. There are children and senior citizens who travel on bikes.”The Katraj-Dehu road bypass opened in 1989, to keep heavy-vehicle movement outside the city limits. Trucks going towards Mumbai and Gujarat from Bengaluru and Kolhapur use the bypass. It is a 40-km stretch that connects several residential parts of the city, from Katraj, Sinhagad road, Warje, Kothrud, Baner, Balewadi, and Hinjewadi, to Chinchwad and Dehu road.Atul Namekar, secretary, Sinhagad road-Warje residents’ association, said, “This bypass is a major road for citizens which connects several parts of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. So there is round-the-clock traffic movement. Earlier also there have been many fatal accidents due to repair works going on. There needs to be a permanent solution and the service road work should be completed fast.”State public works department (PWD) executive engineer Dhananjay Deshpande said, “All the safety measures have been taken on the service roads. We will take a review where construction material is on the highway and it will be immediately be removed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/servicelane-work-on-katraj-dehu-rd-bypass-continues-to-pose-a-traffic-hazard-for-commuters-101622650505650.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||BJP-JJP regime hurting youth by keeping recruitment process pending: Surjewala||Congress general secretary and former Haryana minister Randeep Singh Surjewala on Wednesday slammed the BJP-JJP government in the state for hurting the prospects of youngsters by deliberately keeping the recruitment process for thousands of posts pending for years, thus adding to unemployment. Addressing a press conference, Surjewala accused the state government of cancelling the recruitment process for a large number of posts. Quoting the latest data of the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE) for May, the Congress leader said the rate of unemployment in Haryana is 29.10 %. “This horrific unemployment is the result of the inefficiency, incompetence and negative policies adopted by the Khattar-Chautala government towards the youth and employment generation,’’ he alleged. Criticising the state government, Surjewala said first they announce government vacancies, then for years, the vacancies are not advertised; and when advertised, the written test and interviews are not conducted for years. Even after having the exams or interviews conducted, instead of declaring the results, the recruitments are cancelled citing various reasons, he alleged. Giving examples, the Congress general secretary said that advertisements were issued for recruitment of 170 posts in the power department and online examination was conducted but recruitment was not made and the matter has reached the court. “Just before 2019 assembly elections, an announcement for recruitment of 5,000 male constables and 1,000 female constables was made to befool the youth. No action was taken for 18 months. Later, this proposed recruitment was withdrawn on the pretext of announcing fresh recruitment,’’ he said. Surjewala said that around 10,000 temporary and permanent workers were dismissed by the BJP led government in the last seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjpjjp-regime-hurting-youth-by-keeping-recruitment-process-pending-surjewala-101622650206262.html
02-06-2021||Ranchi||‘Jharkhand likely to hold Panchayat polls in Nov-Dec’||Strap: State government to seek Centre’s opinion over extension of powers to panchayat bodies that expire on July 31  The three-tier panchayat polls in Jharkhand can be held in November or December this year, depending on Covid-19 situation in the state, said rural development minister Alamgir Alam on Wednesday.Panchayat polls in the state were due in December last year. In January this year, the government granted a six-month extension to the current panchayat bodies in the wake of delay in conducting the polls. The extension expires on July 31. “We could not conduct panchayat polls last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. We thought that the elections will be conducted during the extension period. But, the second wave of Covid-19 ruined that possibility too. It is not possible to conduct the polls by July 31,” said Alam.Besides, the Panchayati Raj Act doesn’t mention a second extension, putting officials in a fix.Therefore, the state government has decided to seek the Centre’s opinion over further extension, officials said on Wednesday.The rural development minister also called a meeting on Wednesday to explore alternatives so that panchayat works do not get affected after the extension expires. Alam said they were considering two options- to give further extension to panchayat bodies or put them under administrative control.“The Panchayati Raj Act talks only about six months’ extension in case election is not conducted. It doesn’t mention about any extension. So, we have decided to write a letter to Government of India, seeking its opinion if any amendment in the Act is possible. We will also seek advocate general’s opinion in this regard,” Alam said.He said, “If Covid-19 situation remains under control, we will try to conduct the panchayat elections in November-December this year.” The tenure of as many as 4,402 mukhiyas (village heads) and panchayat committees ended on January 4 this year. The state government could not conduct the panchayat polls last year in absence of state election commissioner.In 2015, the four-phase polls for electing the 4,402 mukhiyas, 5,423 panchayat ward samitis and 545 zila parishad committees were held from November 22 to December 12.Meanwhile, Jharkhand State Mukhiya Association (JSMA) demanded extension of power on line of Madhya Pradesh. JSMA president Vikas Kumar Mahto said, “Panchayat polls are also pending since 2019 in Madhya Pradesh, where executive committees of Mukhiyas have been set up and they have been given powers. Such practice is functional for past two years. So, extension to panchayat bodies can also be given on line of Madhya Pradesh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-likely-to-hold-panchayat-polls-in-novdec-101622649905544.html

After being discharged from hospital, many such people are experiencing problems like respiratory distress, headache and body ache, uncontrolled diabetes, sudden fall in oxygen levels, inability to walk for some distance, loss of appetite, weakness or increased heart rate, they said. “Viral infection leading to poor immunity and residual lung damage due to fibrosis/pneumonia are making patients vulnerable post Covid. Majority of these people have co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension,” said Prof Kauser Usman, HoD, geriatric medicine at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU).Sample this. Danish of Alambagh area was admitted to a Covid facility in the second week of April and was discharged 10 days later. However, within 15 days he again had to visit the hospital after his oxygen level dipped suddenly (85-87).“We have increased the number of wards for post-Covid treatment as a number of patients are coming after weeks of recovery has gone up,” said Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson, KGMU. Doctors at the Lok Bandhu hospital too have called back several patients to the OPD post recovery from Covid as they reported breathing problems. “We are calling up all patients discharged from our hospital to take a feedback about their health,” said Dr Ajay Shankar Tripathi, medical superintendent of the hospital. The patients were examined by doctors in the OPD and advised medication. “This is important to save them from further worsening of the condition. We keep track of their medical history and accordingly they are given medical advice,” he said. Patients are also being admitted to different hospitals weeks after they get discharged. “The problem is more among those above 50 years of age as this age group suffers more with co-morbidities due to work stress and lifestyle disorders,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. Lohia institute and Civil Hospital were also running post-Covid care facilities for patients. Asked about the change in policy for discharge adopted by the state government where patients eligible for home isolation were discharged by hospitals without a repeat Covid test, doctors said this had nothing to do with the illness that is developing weeks after recovery. “Patients are discharged only if their clinical condition is fine. As far as repeat Covid test is concerned, people may test positive for up to two months. Hence the decision for discharge has to be taken by doctors based upon clinical condition. But even in home stay, patients have to follow medical advice,” said Prof Usman. Doctors said despite being discharged from hospital, a Covid patient needs to follow instructions of the doctor and continue following protocols that were followed during illness. “Discharged patients should stay in isolation to keep away infection that a healthy family member might bring to them. One has to avoid infection carriers who might be family members,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-with-co-morbidities-vulnerable-to-post-covid-problems-also-say-docs-101622649786219.html
02-06-2021||Lucknow||Demolition of Barabanki mosque: Clerics seek state advocate general’s consent for criminal contempt against DM, SDM||Two Uttar Pradesh clerics have approached the state’s advocate general (AG), seeking consent for the initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against the Barabanki district magistrate (DM) and the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) for their alleged role in the demolition of a 100-year-old mosque at Ram Sanehi Ghat in Barabanki.“Demolition of the 100-year-old mosque was sheer misuse of power and an attempt to hurt one’s religious sentiments. It was also a violation of high court orders not to take any such steps till May 31, following the Covid situation,” said Maulana Mohammed Faizan, imam of the Eidgah, Barabanki, who has sought consent from AG as part of the procedure to initiate criminal contempt against the administrative officers for their alleged role in the act.On May 17, following the orders of the SDM’s court, the old mosque located adjacent to the tehsil premises and opposite the residence of the SDM was demolished amid heavy security. The mosque was registered in the records of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board.Maulana Mohammed Faizan said the act of demolition came as a rude shock for him and for the people of the community who were offering “namaaz” there since ages.“I don’t remember the time and date when the mosque—Gareeb Nawaaz — that was in the tehsil compound at Ram Sanehi Ghat, Barabanki, got constructed. What is known to all is that our father and grandfather, too, had offered namaaz here and we too are offering namaaz here since ages. Hence, its demolition was a setback for all of us,” the maulana added.Wasif Hasan, co-mutwalli (co-caretaker) of Teelay Wali Masjid in Lucknow, too, has sought consent from AG for the initiation of the criminal contempt which, he says, is a part of the procedure.“Basically, there are two types of contempt of court in India. Criminal contempt is regarding anything that scandalises or lowers the image of the court. However, for a private individual to initiate criminal contempt requires consent of AG of state. It is for the same reason we have approached him,” said Wasif Hasan.Besides, he blamed Barabanki administration for misleading the public by saying that the demolition was as per high court orders.Adarsh Singh, district magistrate of Barabanki, said he was not aware of any such developments.The two clerics are being backed by the legal team of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the trust which Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) had formed to look after the construction of the proposed project in Dhannipur village of Ayodhya on the five-acre land allocated in line with the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya title suit verdict.“The act has badly affected our upcoming Dhannipur project, which is 20km from the site where the (Barabanki) mosque was demolished. Our project—under which a mosque, hospital, community kitchen, museum etc would come up—aims at bridging the communal and cultural differences. However, such acts often play spoilsport and create unpleasant environment for the people. We believe people responsible for creating such unpleasant situations should be punished. The maulanas will also be approaching the high court for initiation of civil contempt proceedings against the SDM for violating the high court orders,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for IICF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/demolition-of-barabanki-mosque-clerics-seek-state-advocate-general-s-consent-for-criminal-contempt-against-dm-sdm-101622649785484.html
02-06-2021||Ranchi||Over 7.5 lakh state board examinees in dilemma as govt yet to take decision||More than 7.5 lakh board examinees of classes 10 (matric) and 12 (intermediate) were in catch-22 situation, as the state government was yet to take any decision on Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC) board examinations.While students demand the government to clear the dilemma, parents’ body has urged to cancel the examinations on the line of other educational boards such as Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE).CBSE on Tuesday announced to cancel of board exams of Class 12, while it has already cancelled the same for Class 10. The CISCE has also declared the same on line of CBSE.However, the JAC, which is responsible to conduct the Class 10 and 12 examinations, seemed to be ignorant about the fate of the exams as it has not made any announcement in this regard. Earlier, the JAC postponed the examinations twice in wake of Covid-19 situation in the state. The council said at the time that they will release a fresh schedule after reviewing the situation on June 1. JAC chairperson Arvind Prasad Singh said on Wednesday, “We cannot decide whether examinations will be conducted. The decision needs to be taken by the government and we will follow it.”Poonam Kumar, a student of Class 10 at Adarsh Vidya Niketan in Dhanbad, said, “The current dilemma over the examinations is taking toll on our preparations. The government should clear it. If examinations will be held, we will prepare for it accordingly. If not, then we will focus on preparation for higher classes.”Another student Manish Kumar of Class 12 at a government high school in Ranchi expressed similar views. “Central board and most state boards have cleared their stands. But, Jharkhand government is still waiting. It should consider the mental status of the students,” he said.More than 4.31 lakh students were expected to appear for matric examinations, while over 3.32 lakh students are likely to take intermediate examinations this year.Meanwhile, when contacted, state school education and literacy department secretary Rajesh Sharma said, “The CBSE took the decision to cancel the exams on Tuesday evening. We are waiting for the detailed procedure it is going to adopt to promote the students. Once the details come, we will take our decision. Meanwhile, we are also doing our internal assessment in this regard.”JAC, however, sought opinion of headmasters and other officials concerned on conducting safe examinations amid the pandemic. The council also sought suggestions on examination hours and centres in case examinations are conducted, officials said. General secretary of state parents’ body, Jharkhand Abhibhawak Mahasangh (JAM), Manoj Mishra said, “Keeping in mind the impact of coronavirus disease and lives of students, Jharkhand government should immediately cancel both board examinations on line of CBSE and CISCE. The delay in announcement is causing stress on students.”The state unit of Congress also demanded the Hemant Soren government to cancel the examinations. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “We welcome the decision of CBSE and CISCE and demand the Jharkhand government to cancel the examinations for the sake of students and their parents during Covid-19 period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/over-7-5-lakh-state-board-examinees-in-dilemma-as-govt-yet-to-take-decision-101622649665597.html

There are 2,200 identified transgenders in Patna and over 40,000 across the state, as per the 2011 Census. Dostana Safar convener Reshma said, “There will be 17 rooms for the inmates, besides an office, training centre, kitchen, medical treatment and recreation facility in the building. It will start functioning from June 15.”The inmates will get food, lodging and medical facilities for free. “There will be various kinds of skill development training. Besides, those who want to study can also join online courses in various universities. The Dostana Safar has approached many Universities to start online courses for these people,” she said.Garima Griha is an initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to create short-stay homes for transgender people to improve their economic and social status under the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.Altogether, 13 such homes have been planned to be set up in 10 cities across the country, including Patna. At Garima Griha, transgender people can learn and develop various skills to become economically independent. “Many among them have been demanding this kind of facility for long. They no longer want to be in their traditional vocation or seeking alms. Instead, many among them now want to take up some respectful jobs,” Reshma said.Traditionally, transgender persons have been into begging and sex trade, or have been doing shows on weddings and birth of children, she said.“Though many transgender persons like doing their traditional jobs, a few of them do not like the way they are treated by the general category people,” she said.Giriraj Ranga Samy, deputy director of the National Institute of Social Defence, a part of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, said Garima Griha for transgender persons will be set up in 10 cities. “Transgenders can stay here and get skill development training for six months.

The accused, Kamlakant Prasad, is currently posted as officer on special duty in Central Selection Board of Constable in the state. The FIR was lodged with the Woman police station of Gaya on Tuesday night on the statement of the girl’s brother following the intervention from additional director general of police (weaker section) Anil Kishore Yadav.According to the FIR, Kamlakant Prasad approached the girl’s brother through the then in-charge of Women police station (Gaya), Meera Kumari, for hiring a maid servant for his wife, who stayed in Patna at the time. The DSP instead brought the girl, then 14, to his official residence in Gaya, where he raped her. Gaya’s senior superintendent of police Aditya Kumar said the FIR was lodged after he received a letter from the state police headquarters. “The case is under investigation. The victim has recorded her statement before the court of judicial magistrate. The case was lodged under sections of 376 of the India Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and the SC/ST Act.” According to the Gaya police, the girl was raped by another man in 2016 and subsequently became pregnant. A case was lodged with the women police station and the accused was convicted in the case. Meanwhile, Kamlakant’s wife Anand Tanjua Kushwaha, while talking to media persons, said her husband was a habitual offender in sexually harassing minors and was facing several cases in Patna, Lakhisarai, Gopalganj and Buxar districts. In June 2014, when Kamlakant was posted in Gopalganj district as the subdivisional police officer at Hathua, a 30-year-old woman had lodged a police complaint accusing him of sexually assault. Fate of the case wasn’t immediately known. Kamlakant could not contacted despite repeated calls on his cellphone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/senior-cop-booked-for-minor-s-rape-in-2017-101622649485460.html

And in most of the cases, the fraudsters would use the current Covid-19 pandemic plea, making claims of financial crisis and sharing links of e-wallets for transfer of money. The latest to fall victim to this is deputy inspector general (DIG) of Saran range, Manu Maharaaj. A man created fake Facebook account and started sending obscene messages to girls and demanding money from them.The DIG was shocked when the girls concerned called him to complain“I immediately checked the cellphone number provided by the girls on the Truecaller app. The man was traced with the help of cyber cell. He has been identified as Manu Kumar Yadav alias Manu Maharaaj from Garkha in Saran. On May 20, an FIR was also lodged with the Town police station in this connection,” the DIG said.During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime and told the police that he created the fake profile on Facebook in January and saved a number in Truecaller app as Manu Maharaaj to cheat people and girls. Saran DIG is not the lone police officer to have fallen victim to fraudsters. At least three other police officers, including additional director general (ADG) Jitendra Kumar, have faced similar problems. In a message posted on his FB account, Kumar said, “Dear Friends, It seems somebody has made a duplicate FB ID in my name with same profile picture.

Must take utmost care in Pandemic.” Earlier, cyber criminals allegedly made an FB account in the name of minister for cooperative Subhash Singh and demanded money from his supporters. The incident came to light when one Nilesh Kumar Mishra, a resident of Tiwari Mathania village of Gopalganj district, was asked to pay ₹50,000. “We received a complaint in this regard and the case has been transferred to the cyber cell for investigation,” said Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar. Similarly, minor water resources and irrigation minister Santosh Kumar Suman said that he got to know of a fake FB account in his name soon after receiving a call from his friend who stated that there was request made for ₹26,000 through that social media account. In a message posted on his account, Suman said, “A fake account with same photo and details created... all be careful... because someone may start requesting to transfer some money... all be alert on such requests.” Director general (training) and managing director of Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation, Alok Raj, has thrice fallen victim to such cyber crimes. Fake accounts have also been created in the names of principal secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar, primary education director Ranjit Kumar Singh, Banka DM Suharsh Bhagat, former Munger DM Rajesh Meena, Lakhisarai SP Sunil Kumar, former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey and others. “Public are advised to not fall prey to such frauds and exercise caution while accepting any request from government officers, especially those who are already in your friends’ list.

Bihar diverted 3,97,410 doses of Covishield, which it received from the Serum Institute of India, Pune, Wednesday afternoon as also 1,04,620 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin it received from Hyderabad on May 31 for the 18-45 years age group, said state health officials. The Centre supplies Covid-19 vaccines for 45+ free of cost, while the state has to buy most of them for the 18-45 years population. Vaccination of the younger population had halted across the state at regular session sites due to vaccine shortage, said officials. In what was more a symbolic gesture, the health department was conducting special camps to inoculate a small population. All 59 regular session sites in Patna, which has the highest vaccine demand, were shut for the last five days as stocks had dried up. However, special camps were being conducted at different offices to keep the count ticking in its vaccination database. The accountant general office, the Bihar State Power Holding Corporation, SBI, NTPC Barh, office of the agriculture department, besides a few orphanages under the social welfare department were among the few off-site camps where vaccines were administered in Patna on Tuesday. For instance, on June 1, only 2,438 people in the 18-45 years age group were inoculated out of the total 48,139 vaccinated across the state during the day. Patna accounted for only 889 of them. Similarly, on Wednesday, only 2,216 people in the younger age group out of the total 45,315 people could be vaccinated in the state. Bihar health officials were maintaining a stoic silence on the issue. Repeated efforts to contact Manoj Kumar, state nodal officer for vaccination and also the executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar (SHSB), proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages. No other officer in the health department was willing to talk on record. GOVT MUM ON BLACK FUNGS The health department was reluctant to share information on patients affected by mucormycosis and its fatalites. The state government’s daily bulletin on Covid-19 found no mention of mucormycosis. It did not issue a separate bulletin either, despite the Bihar government declaring black fungus a notifiable disease on May 22 and the state reporting 394 cases so far. The nodal officer appointed for mucormycosis said the integrated disease surveillance progarmme (IDSP) unit of the SHSB was tasked to compile figures on case load and fatality due to black fungus and upload the information on the National Health Portal. The IDSP, on the other hand, said the medical colleges had been asked to do it. The state health brass and executive director, SHSB, chose not to respond on the issue. Meanwhile, the state health department had cancelled all leaves of doctors, nurses, paramedics and health support staff, including fourth grade staff till June 15 in view of high incidence of Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-diverts-covid-vaccines-for-45-to-cater-to-younger-population-101622649425530.html

On May 21, the IMA had constituted an eight-member committee to investigate the reasons behind the high fatality among doctors. IMA president-elect Dr Shahjanand Prasad Singh said lack of oxygen and ventilators during the peak pandemic period also affected doctors, who worked without break both in government and private health facilities. “Patna alone has over two hundred private hospitals, but only 90 could get oxygen supply. Some big hospitals also could not get oxygen supply. However, doctors kept working. Sometimes, social distancing also could not be maintained with patients, as the doctors kept their doors open. At other times, doctors also erred by not wearing masks properly or removing it,” he said.Singh said the doctors who had taken both the doses of vaccines were relatively safer, while those who could not take the second dose for whatever reasons and kept working despite risks seemed to have fallen prey to Covid-19. “There have also been instances of secondary infection or blood clot in chests. It is a fact that this time there was an explosion of cases within a short period, but the doctors and healthcare workers responded to the challenge with full devotion despite huge risks,” he said.Dr Sunil Kumar, state secretary of the IMA and a member of the investigation committee, said the responses through the forms given to the family members of the deceased doctors had started arriving. “More responses are awaited. Once they come, we will put the report in the public domain,” he said.Last year, a central team visiting Bihar’s first dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) facility, Nalanda Medical College & Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, had flagged poor infection control in hospitals and underlined the need to provide a safer working environment. Later, training programmes were also organised for doctors and healthcare workers to improve safety for them.Dr Sunil Kumar, who had released a full list of deceased doctors from Bihar, said the high fatality rate was a cause of concern and therefore the IMA had decided to investigate the matter so that timely steps could be taken in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imaprobe-lists-reasons-for-high-fatality-among-docs-101622649365470.html

Girls completing graduation will now be provided ₹50,000 while those passing intermediate (class 12) would be getting a scholarship of ₹25,000. Earlier, graduate girls or those with an equivalent degree were provided ₹25,000, while intermediate girls received ₹10,000.Kumar said his government was committed to ensuring there was a sufficient number of medical and engineering colleges so that boys and girls interested in these disciplines did not feel compelled to migrate to other states for their studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-to-reserve-33-seats-in-medical-engineering-colleges-for-girls-101622649305508.html

However, it is clear it was only headline management because the government's actions do not reflect their own advisor's advice."On social media, Shivakumar quoted Kang on 10 aspects of Covid management and asked if the Karnataka government agreed with her. Congress asked if Karnataka government if it agrees with their vaccine advisor's comment that vaccine procurement should be done by the Centre and not by the states and whether they agreed with her that India was "late on the table" in acquiring vaccines from global companies.According to an official statement of the party, Dr Kang has been quoted in the media as saying, "The rest of the world has been buying vaccines at risk for a year, so what's the supply that is available in the market for us to go now and say we want to buy vaccines?"Gagandeep Kang has said the central government's claim of 2 billion vaccine doses by December should be taken "with a pinch of salt," the statement said.Karnataka Congress asked the BJP government in the state whether it agrees with their vaccine advisor's assessment and if they plan to explain by when they hope to vaccinate all adults in Karnataka.Congress also asked if the state government agree with its advisor's criticism of the approval that Covaxin got in January without publishing final efficacy data, her criticism that the government ignored early warnings of COVID second wave.Kang has been urging the Indian government to collect better and more data on Covid and vaccines so that we can fight this war better, the party said.According to the Union Health Ministry, Karnataka has 2,98,320 active COVID-19 cases.

The board’s decision will impact on their studies, results and admission process in the upcoming time. College administration and students share their take on the exam cancellation decision taken by the central government. “I concur with the decision taken by the Centre to cancel our board exams. We cannot expect all the students to be in the right mindset for exam during this pandemic situation. The decision has cleared the confusion and calmed fears over the exam as health and well-being of students, teachers and their families have been prioritised. The question of an alternative evaluation of students remains unanswered. I request the government and the CBSE to take a prudential and timely decision in this regard,” said Pragnya Paramita, a class 12 student of ODM Public School. Another student Rushi Jambhale said, “The class 12 exams should have been conducted online or by some other means. We studied online throughout the year and were preparing hard for the exams. I want to pursue computer engineering and there is a tough competition to get admission in a good college. If I get less marks in the alternative assessment process, my career will be affected.” After the CBSE Class 12 exams were cancelled, the Maharashtra state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “On the grounds of CBSE board exams been cancelled, soon we are also going to take a decision about our Class 12 board exams. Our first priority will always be student safety and their health.” Meanwhile, college administrations are worried about the admission process. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar said, “The decision to cancel CBSE Class 12 exams is good for the safety of students, but it will certainly have an impact on admission process for various graduation courses. After Class 12 there is a vast spread of options before students to choose their career subjects and this is the time when students want to go for a better opportunity. Now, for the CBSE board students, it will totally depend on the assessment process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cancelled-cbse-class-12-exam-leaves-students-in-dilemma-over-career-choice-101622644625219.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi High Court says Juhi Chawla’s lawsuit against 5G technology ‘filed only for media publicity'||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday termed as “defective” the suit of actress-environmentalist Juhi Chawla against setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and said it was filed for “media publicity”.The court also questioned Chawla for filing the suit without giving any representation to the government on her concerns related to the technology.Justice J R Midha said the plaintiffs, Chawla and two others, were required to first approach the government for their rights and if denied, they should come to the court.The court, which reserved order on the suit after hearing the arguments of various parties, also asked as to why as many as 33 parties have been added to the plaint and said it is not permitted under the law.“It is not the sweet will of the plaintiff to join as many parties and cause of action. Please see the memo of parties. Tell me how you have joined them. Every party cannot be arrayed in the suit,” the judge said.The court further said, “It is a defective plaint. This suit has been filed only for media publicity and nothing more than that. It is very shocking.”“Did you approach the government with a representation? If yes, is there any denial?,” the court asked to which the plaintiffs’ counsel replied in negative.The court said in the suit, the plaintiff says ‘I have personal knowledge of paragraphs 1 to 8’ only.“Plaintiff has no personal knowledge of the plaint. I am surprised. How can it be? Is the suit permissible when the plaintiff has no personal knowledge of the averment? I have not seen a suit where a person says I don’t know, please conduct an inquiry,” the judge said.The court asked about the knowledge of plaintiffs on the facts and warned to prosecute them on filing false claims.The plea claimed that 5G wireless technology threatens to provoke serious, irreversible effects on humans and permanent damage to the earth’s ecosystems.The suit, filed by Chawla, social worker Veeresh Malik and Teena Vachani, said that if the telecom industry’s plans for 5G come to fruition, no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today.Advocate Deepak Khosla, representing the plaintiffs, said the 5G technology trials involving human population have been done and added that these are not "pigs and rats".The court was hearing arguments only on several applications filed by the plaintiffs, including payment of court fees and permission to institute a suit.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and advocate Amit Mahajan, representing the Department of Telecommunications, said the 5G policy does not fall in the category of public nuisance and it is obviously not prohibited in law.Mehta said the plaintiffs need to show how the technology is wrongful and termed the suit as an ill-conceived litigation.Mahajan said the plaintiffs could have filed a PIL if they wanted to avoid depositing court fees.“What is the hidden agenda”, he said, adding that a petition on similar issues was earlier filed by the plaintiffs before the Bombay High Court and it was not pending in the Supreme Court, which was the reason for not filing a PIL and instituting a private suit.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing private telecom companies, said launching of 5G technology is a policy of the government and as it is a policy, it cannot be a wrongful act.On the issue of public nuisance, he said it has to be first established by the plaintiffs that the policy is a public nuisance and they cannot just make averments and get the relief.“They have to establish that the policy itself is wrong,” he said.Kholsa said the implementation of 5G technology should not be done at the cost of others.On being asked by the court as to what was the special damage done to the plaintiffs, the counsel said, “I am suffering radiation every time I use a cellphone”.The suit has sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large that how 5G technology is safe to humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna.“This suit will reveal a complete sell-out by the regulatory agencies who, statutorily, have been tasked to protect the health and life of the public, but whose actions reveal an utter derogation of their own statutory duty in order to advance private interests...,” the plea has alleged.“Since ‘prevention’ is well-accepted to be far better than ‘cure’, immediate measures must be taken to protect humanity and the environment, in accordance with ethical imperatives as well as formal international agreements, before such harm is actually unleashed,” it said.The plea said that in April 2019, Brussels became the first major city in the world to halt any further steps in the 5G rollout on account of health hazards.“In fact, as recently as on May 5, 2021, the Parliament of Belgium, still not willing to allow 5G rollout in Brussels, invited 45 ordinary citizens drawn at random to address it on their concerns, assuring them that the 5G roll-out will not be permitted till they are heard by Parliament and their concerns are properly and fully addressed,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-says-juhi-chawla-s-defective-lawsuit-against-5g-technology-filed-only-for-media-publicity-101622643303250.html

Of these 464, at least 17 have been confirmed to have lost both the parents to the infection. The action committee would verify the details of the child and the guardian currently taking care of the child and also confirm that the parent died to Covid. District women and child development officer Ashwini Kamble said, “The counting is still in process as we get calls on a daily basis and the data is upgraded accordingly. The action committee, which was formed on March 20, 2019, looks into such children who have lost both parents and have members from the health department of both the civic bodies and the rural areas too and we get information regularly. In view of Covid-19, the health department also informs about kids who have lost their parents to the infection. As of now, we have had about 464 enquiries from across the district regarding kids who have lost either one or both parents. Of these we have confirmed that 17 have lost both parents, and eight of them are admitted at various government homes for orphanages and the remaining kids are still with relatives or guardians. The youngest we have is about six years old and the oldest is 17.” Kamble said that once a kid’s information comes to the WCD, the committee visits the child’s home to inspect the child’s welfare and also the guardian’s details. She said, “We check the claim as to whether the parents die of Covid or not. We check if the guardian is able and willing to take care of the child. In addition to ensuring the child’s welfare, the committee also ensures that the child gets legal help. In case of any property which the child might be legally entitled to, the committee also helps the child get legal advice and help whenever he or she turns 18 and to ensure that the property is legally handed over to the child.” On Wednesday, the government announced a special welfare package for such kids. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Those kids who have lost both their parents to Covid19, for such kids the state government has announced a special fixed deposit package of ₹5 lakh until they turn 18 and also the child would be eligible to get benefits under the state government child welfare schemes until the child becomes an adult. This decision has been approved at the cabinet meet on Wednesday.” As of Tuesday, Pune district has reported a total of over 10.18 lakh Covid cases, and progressive cases up to 1.018 million cases of which 0.975 million have recovered, 12,630 have been declared dead due to Covid and remaining are active cases.

The in-principle decision by the Maharashtra cabinet will be placed before the state disaster management authority, also headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackaray, for the formal orders.The state school education department on Wednesday moved a proposal to the state disaster management authority headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to take the final decision, officials said. A formal announcement is expected after the nod by the authority. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad, who had welcomed the Centre’s decision to cancel CBSE class 12 exams on Tuesday, said their priority is to ensure the health and safety of the students.Around 1.5 million students appear for Class 12 exams in Maharashtra every year.The Maharashtra government had earlier decided to cancel Class 10 board examinations due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation and promote students on the basis of their performance in Class 9 and 10.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday had announced the Centre’s decision not to hold the school-leaving exams conducted by the CBSE this year. Several states such as Haryana, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh also have cancelled Class 12 board examinations.“We informed the state cabinet about the decisions taken by the central government and a few states pertaining to Class 12 exams. We have moved a proposal to the state disaster management authority to take a decision in this regard as all such decisions have to be approved by it considering the unprecedented situation,” Gaikwad said on Wednesday after the state cabinet meeting.“Our stand on this issue has been clear since the beginning. Health, safety and mental stress of the students needs to be considered before taking such a decision. We had clarified our stand in a meeting of education ministers of all the states chaired by the defence minister Rajnath Singh and have also welcomed the decision of cancellation of Class 12 board exams. The same has been proposed before the disaster management authority,” school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said.A senior official familiar with the matter said all ministers supported Gaikwad’s proposal to scrap the Class 12 board exam at the cabinet meeting.“It was decided that it should be approved by the disaster management authority as Epidemic Diseases Act was invoked in the state,” said a senior official, privy to the development.Class 12 examinations were scheduled on April 23 and were put off till May-end owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases and subsequently lockdown restrictions imposed to arrest the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-s-cabinet-decides-to-cancel-maharashtra-s-class-12-exams-101622642468035.html
02-06-2021||Pune||Lockdown hits Maha tourism industry||Pune: The Covid lockdown has choked the economy of various sectors, including tourism, in the state. Two months of suspended operations, trip cancellations and shutdown of tours and travel companies has left the hospitality and tourism companies bleeding. “Last year, Covid outbreak was new for all of us, and even then our pre-booked tours in April and May got cancelled. A similar situation happened this year too, when our industry was somehow settling down again, the lockdown happened. The domestic tours in different states and even the tours within the state were put on hold for almost all the tour operators. People had booked their summer vacations in advance, but lockdown put their plans on hold,” said Deepak Pujari, director, Vihar Tours and Travels and chairman of Pune Tours and Travels Operator Association. “Though the state government has provided assistance to various sectors to cope with the financial crisis due to pandemic, we are yet to receive any aid even as losses are mounting every day. Some of us have even shut shop,” he said. Anantprasad Deshpande, another tour operator and owner of Discover Nature Club, said, “I had a booking of 30 people going to Kanha National Park in June many months back. We had booked hotels, jungle safari rides and train tickets. Now, around 8 to 10 of them want to cancel the tour. We cannot go to Mumbai to board trains because of inter-district travel ban and mandatory e-pass. The hotel management has told us to reschedule the bookings as they cannot refund the money because of the financial crisis. Huge funds are stuck in this industry with no solution in sight.” With inter-district and inter-state travel allowed only emergency needs, the tourism industry is facing its worth situation during the peak summer season. Shrikant Parchure, owner of a resort at Dapoli beach, said, “This is the second consecutive year when our summer vacation bookings got cancelled. Every year we wait for this time when there is a heavy rush when families come to spend summer holidays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-hits-maha-tourism-industry-101622641624981.html

02-06-2021||Mumbai||Banks to sell off Mallya’s properties worth ₹5,646.54 crore to recover dues||A special PMLA court has, in two separate orders passed within the last 10 days, allowed the restoration of properties of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya to a consortium of 17 banks that had provided him loans. The consortium, led by State Bank of India, can now sell off these properties that have a combined value of ₹5,646.54 crore and recover some of their dues. The bank consortium had approached the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court asking for the release of the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate. The ED raised no objections, but Mallya’s legal team did, and so did the lawyers of other companies that have an interest in these properties. Also Read | UK judge’s order brings Indian banks closer to recovering debts from MallyaMallya’s lawyers challenged the jurisdiction of the PMLA court. They argued that the liquor baron had only given a personal guarantee while taking the loans and that didn’t connect him to the offence of money laundering. But the court rejected the claim and accepted SBI’s plea that it suffered huge losses. “It is material to note that the claimants are public sector banks, and these banks are dealing with public money,” the court said, adding that these PSU banks cannot have any personal or private interest in making the claims against Mallya. The court held that the quantifiable loss suffered by the banks was ₹6,203 crore but the properties in question were insufficient to meet it. So, on May 24, the court ordered the release of properties worth ₹4,234.84 crore, and on June 1, it released more properties worth ₹1,411.7 crore. Those released so far include properties in UB City, Bengaluru, worth ₹712.94 crore; Mallya’s under-construction flats in Kingfisher tower worth ₹564.25 crore; several pledged and unpledged shares; and many other properties owned by Mallya through various companies in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/banks-to-sell-off-mallya-s-properties-worth-rs-5-646-54-crore-to-recover-dues-101622637965511.html

Announcing the decision taken during the SGPC executive committee meeting in Amritsar, its chief Bibi Jagir Kaur told reporters: “The army action at the holiest Sikh shrine left deep wounds on the community’s psyche. It was a kind of genocide. They did not even spare Guru Granth Sahib, followed as the Guru by the community and injured the saroops.

02-06-2021||Other||Frequent fires: Hospitals need to watch health of their electrical infra||Frequent hospital fires have put at risk the lives of Covid-19 patients in healthcare facilities across the country, calling for urgent preventive measures.Given the poor enforcement of fire safety laws, fire mishaps at hospitals are not rare in the country. But they have never been as frequent as we are seeing since the pandemic. And the numbers are only going up.From newspaper reports of fires in hospitals, there were roughly about 11 such fires during August to December. This number went up to 17 during January -May, leading to at least 70 deaths. The reasons are obvious. As Covid cases shoot up phenomenally in the second wave of the pandemic, hospitals are constantly expanding their facilities, overloading their electrical circuits, eventually leading to fires.An article on ‘Fire Safety hazards: How safe are our hospitals’ published in the Indian Journal of Community Medicine (Jan-March2020) observes that no hospital estimates accurately at the time of designing and execution, the electricity load. So much so that by the time a hospital is commissioned, it’s power requirement would have almost doubled from the earlier estimate and it goes up further by 25 per cent annually, as it adds newer facilities and gadgets, the article points out. .Given that scenario, one can well imagine the overload on the circuit during the pandemic, with hospitals bursting with patients needing constant emergency care. High oxygen content in the air, sanitizer spills only add to the problem. Besides, in the absence of regular maintenance, any of the overworked or malfunctioning gadgets could heat up and catch fire. A review of 33 major fires reported in hospitals across the country between January 2010 to December 2019 and published in the International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health (September 2020) pointed out that the most common cause of fires in hospitals was electrical short circuit with air conditioners being the most common source. In ten cases, fires originated at or near intensive care units.So it is of utmost importance that hospitals do a regular electrical audit to check their sanctioned load and the actual consumption and upgrade the systems accordingly. Regular maintenance of all electric and electronic equipment and fire protection devices are also a must. It is also extremely important for hospitals to comply with ‘Part IV of the National Building Code of India: fire and life safety’ formulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and incorporated in the fire safety laws of most states. . ‘Fire and Life Safety’, deals with three aspects of fire: fire prevention, life safety and fire protection.Similarly, states/civic authorities running temporary health care facilities in urban and rural areas need to pay more attention to fire safety.. There are standards like the “ Fire precautionary measures in construction of temporary structures and pandals-code of practice” published by the BIS for temporary constructions, but obviously a temporary medical facility with life saving equipment, particularly oxygen cylinders (unlike piped oxygen in hospitals) need more specific standards of fire safety, keeping in mind the fact that these facilities cannot have some of the standard fire safety measures recommended for permanent structures. We therefore need to urgently draw up stringent standards for such temporary medical facilities.But unfortunately, violations of fire safety laws are a rule rather than an exception , with a large number of hospitals in the country running without a fire NOC or without renewing their NOCIn December, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of fires in Covid hospitals and issued detailed directions to all states and union territories to create an oversight mechanism to ensure compliance with fire safety laws by all Covid facilities and also conduct ‘at least once a month’ fire safety audits of each Covid hospital. . The increased fires post-these directions speak volumes about the state of implementation. Are the states waiting for a contempt notice from the apex court to start taking some action?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/frequent-fires-hospitals-need-to-watch-health-of-their-electrical-infra-101622628844205.html

The death toll in the national capital rose to 24,402 after 103 fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the bulletin. Wednesday's numbers marks a further decline from the 623 cases recorded a day before.The positivity rate in the national capital now stands at 0.78% - the third consecutive day that it has stayed below the 1% mark. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a positivity rate below 5% consistently for a period of at least two weeks before an outbreak can be considered to be under control. Delhi’s positivity rate has remained below the stipulated mark for 13 consecutive days now.A total of 73,451 samples were tested for Covid-19 out of which 576 came back positive, according to the health bulletin. This was an increase from the 70,813 samples tested on Tuesday and 65,240 samples tested on Monday.The number of fatalities, however, went up significantly on Wednesday, breaching the 100-mark after three days. At the peak of the fourth wave, Delhi reported scores of deaths everyday, witnessing the highest single-day spike on May 3, when 448 people succumbed to the disease in a span of 24 hours.As per the health bulletin, 1,287 people have recovered from the infection in the last 24 hours.The total number of active cases currently under treatment stands at 9,364, out of which 4,531 are in home isolationHospitalisation went down further with just 4,012 beds being currently occupied by Covid-19 patients, 20,572 beds remain vacant as of Wednesday.

02-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay High Court seeks details of crime rate in Maharashtra during pandemic||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the Maharashtra government to submit details of all FIRs registered and arrests made during the Covid-19 pandemic and inform the court about the present crime rate in the state.The direction came after the state's counsel, Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, told the HC that while orders of the state high-powered committee were being followed on granting emergency parole to eligible inmates in a bid to decongest prisons during the pandemic, jails across the state were still crowded.Kumbhakoni said the "crowd in prisons was not being reduced due to new arrests".He said following the HC's orders passed over the last two months on decongesting prisons and following Covid-19 safety protocols in prisons, 2,168 inmates from seven prisons in the state had been released on interim bail as per the high-powered committee's guidelines.After the HC's orders, vaccination drives for prison inmates and staff had increased, he said, adding that more prisoners were being tested for Covid-19 and the number of active cases among inmates has now come down to 114.He further told the HC that 26 prisoners, who were eligible for emergency parole, were yet to apply for the temporary release.Last month, Kumbhakoni given the instance of these 26 prisoners to say that even though eligible for parole, they had chosen to stay in the prison for reasons like fear of being unable to sustain themselves outside, lack of a place to stay or secure meals for themselves.However, on Wednesday, a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said the state must address the issue of overcrowding in prisons.The court said prison population swells because police make arrests. So, they have to be sensitised about the guidelines made in Arnesh Kumar judgement, the court said."In case some of them are first time offenders, forced into a life of crime because of loss of job due to the pandemic...jobs and employment are an issue now. So they may steal food...basically, first time offenders. Putting them in jail is not going to solve the problem," the HC said.The Arnesh Kumar judgement mentioned by the bench refers to a 2014 verdict of the Supreme Court, where it said to ensure police officers do not arrest accused unnecessarily and magistrates do not authorise the detention casually and mechanically, specific directions must be followed.These directions included instructions to police officers not to automatically arrest when a case is registered under offences where the maximum punishment is seven years or less, but to be satisfied first with the need to arrest as elaborated in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).The HC bench led by Chief Justice Datta said the state prison authorities must also address the issue of vacant sanctioned post for doctors and medical staff in prisons.The prison authorities must also devise a system to segregate inmates above 45 years of age, or who had co- morbidities, from others, and to vaccinate them, he said."We are concerned about the lack of doctors and medical staff in prisons. As an ad-hoc arrangement, can some doctors visit at least once a day for two hours? Doctors can be sent on rotation," the HC said.It also took note of the submission made by senior counsel Mihir Desai, the amicus curiae in the case, that not enough RT-PCR tests were being conducted in prisons.Desai cited the instance where an inmate (Jesuit priest Stan Swamy) at the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai was admitted to a private hospital where he tested positive for the coronavirus.Before being admitted to the hospital, the inmate underwent a rapid antigen test in the prison and he had tested negative for the viral infection.At this, the HC said there had to be "some mechanism" where prisoners were tested, segregated, and those with co- morbidities or those above 45 years of age needed to be vaccinated on priority.The HC was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) taken up suo motu (on its own) on the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates and staff.Professor Vijay Raghavan of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, who is assisting the HC in the PIL, told the court that prison inmates could not be taken for admission to civil hospitals in neighbouring Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai.Thus, all of them were required to be brought to the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai, he said.The HC asked the state government to respond to the above concerns.It will continue hearing the PIL on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-seeks-details-of-crime-rate-in-maharashtra-during-pandemic-101622625986110.html

The motive is to ensure policing in the state stays focused and effective by eliminating a common distraction, the order added.The order says police personnel tend to use mobile phones even during VIP/VVIP visits, law & order situations, festivals, demonstrations, traffic jams etc, diverting their attention and leading to negligence. “At every nook and corner of the city, one can see these constables standing, playing or talking on their phones or (chatting) with each other.

Copies of the order have been sent to all the range IGs (inspector general of police), DIGs (deputy inspector general of police), district SSPs (senior superintendent of police), SPs (superintendent of police) and rail SPs.Most Bihar police personnel are not happy with the order, however, they are refraining from making any statements in public, said a police officer, who didn’t wish to be named.A senior police officer said that Bihar home department has been dealing with the twin challenges of shortage of personnel and reduced efficiency due to over usage of smartphones. He added that the problem was not limited to the police department but was also common among the staff in secretariat, collectorate, SDO’s (sub divisional officer) and CO’s (circle officer) offices, where the general public is made to wait for a long time while they play with their mobiles.Common residents, who often have to cough up fines for talking on phone while driving, have welcomed the move. “We are fined for talking on cellphones while driving. We often find police personnel either playing games on their cellphones or listening to music. It is good that the same restriction has been imposed on them,” said a businessman, Prabhat Kumar Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cops-to-be-punished-if-seen-using-mobile-phone-on-duty-101622619244458.html

Now on this basis, the examinations of other boards and state boards should also be cancelled"."No examination without vaccination", he added.Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma had said in a statement on Tuesday that the cancellation of the exams is in the interest of students, parents, and teachers.He said a decision about the Class XII exams of the UP Secondary Board would soon be taken after a meeting with the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-calls-for-cancelling-up-board-exams-in-view-of-covid19-101622618183878.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Coming to terms with life, death during the pandemic||In the present situation when a sombre event such as death has been reduced to mere statistics, the musings of Japanese writer Haruki Murakami ring true: “Death is not the opposite of life but a part of it.” With the Covid-19 crisis taking its toll on relatives, friends, acquaintances and colleagues and reading their obituaries day in and day out, one is forced to take a step back from life and ponder over it in its entirety and thereby its culmination or corollary, which of course is the endgame for each one of us. We mortal beings presume that our journey ends with the last breath. Is that so? The persona continues to live far and beyond. The first gush of thoughts that deluge the mind on hearing of someone’s demise is the overarching personality traits of the departed one – protagonist for some and antagonist for others. Our cognitive senses are wired to judge and evaluate and then follow the emotive response. While the first response till a few years ago was sadness and mourning, in later years it has graduated and even post-graduated to that of objective evaluation instead of experiencing an overarching sense of subjective grief. This may have precursors in the collective wisdom gathered over the years as one approaches middle age. What one has begun to realise now is that while each of us comes with a stamped expiry date, what makes us unique and different is the way we navigate through this journey. Our personality type and behaviour patterns are woven uniquely through the warp and weft of our psychosocial and socio-economic threads enmeshed with a dash of our genetic composition. These finally determine our unique goals, hopes and aspirations and the journey of life we traverse – either meandering or racing towards the self-designated goals. Also, the means adopted towards achieving these goals count. How many people whose lives we touched were hurt by our actions-inactions or how many people we trampled upon to script our moments of glory? What the pandemic has taught us is that man revels in his invincibility but forgets the harshest teaching by the brutal duo of time and experience. That all of us may not make it to the pages of history books but those whose lives we touch in this sojourn are sure to remember us for reasons both good and bad. While we may be showered with praise and words of affection on our eternal departure, our darker side will sooner or later come up for discussion, albeit in hushed tones. There are bound to be outpourings of exaggerated accounts of our professional achievements, success and qualifications, but we will also be remembered for our shades of grey. The choice is clear for us to make.

02-06-2021||Patna||Lalu slams Nitish Kumar over Bihar healthcare, JD(U) says RJD chief has amnesia||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad has made his presence in Bihar politics felt with continuous attacks on chief minister Nitish Kumar’s handling of Covid-19 pandemic and the poor state of healthcare system since his release on bail in fodder scam cases in April this year.On Tuesday, Prasad posted pictures of one dilapidated building, claiming it was the referral hospital in Saharsa district, which he said was in a shambles like “thousands of other primary health centres” in the state.“The referral hospital in Saharsa, built at a cost of ₹14 crore, was inaugurated by me as the chief minister in 1995 to provide healthcare to lakhs of people living on both sides of east and west Kosi embankment. But it has been ruined, like thousands of other primary health centres, by [the] one [person] who is narrow and negative minded,” the RJD chief tweeted, taking indirect potshots at the chief minister.The former railway minister has been posting a series of photographs of primary health centres in Sitamarhi, Sheikhpura, Kaimur and Madhubani to name a few, alleging their neglect during CM Nitish Kumar’s tenure had turned them either into buffalo shelters or unusable locked properties.In a tweet posted on Monday, Prasad accused Nitish Kumar of shutting down a PHC in Kumar’s home district of Nalanda just because it had been set up during the RJD government’s rule.“Nitish closed the PHC in his home district [of] Nalanda because it was set up by me during my government. But the PHC is shown as operational in pink [government] files,” Lalu said.In another recent tweet, Prasad claimed that Nitish Kumar’s good governance and development existed only on ‘paper’ and that “thousands of PHCs set up during the RJD’s rule” had been shut down by the NDA government but shown as running in government records. He also alleged that crores of rupees sanctioned for these PHCs were being diverted.RJD’s top leaders feel the Yadav strongman is slowly returning to mainstream politics with his tweets. “There is no bar on politics for Laluji. He cannot contest polls but will become more active in politics in days to come,” said Bhola Yadav, former MLA and a close aide of the RJD chief. Yadav said could soon return to Patna once the Covid situation improves and the lockdown ends. Lalu Prasad is currently staying with his eldest daughter and RJD MP Misa Bharti in New Delhi,A few weeks after leaving AIIMS after getting bail, an ailing Prasad, attended a meeting of party MLAs but it had to be cut short since his oxygen level was low. He had then asked party workers to start community kitchens named Lalu Rasoi in their respective areas to provide free food to poor people affected by Covid and the subsequent lockdown.The ruling Janata Dal-United (JD-U) MLC (member of legislative council) and former minister Neeraj Kumar said the RJD chief was suffering from “memory loss’ or else he wouldn’t have forgotten the “pathetic” state of medical care in Bihar during his party’s 15-years of rule, which resulted in flight of doctors from the state.“During RJD’s rule, only 39 patients used to be treated in government hospitals per month on an average, whereas now, 10,000 patients visit government hospitals each month on an average. Lalu is suffering from memory loss while his heir apparent (Tejashwi Yadav) has hardly any knowledge since he has no interest in legislative business and stays away on tours,” Kumar said.Refuting Lalu’s allegation of neglect of PHCs under Nitish Kumar’s tenure, he said the healthcare system had witnessed a turnaround with ANM (Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery) colleges set up in all 54 sub-divisions of the state along with GNM (nursing) and para-medical institutions.“How is it that Lalu’s oxygen level goes down during a RJD meeting but his twitter level goes up? The RJD chief should check facts and should know that during his government, only ₹64 crore was spent on an average in the health sector. But now, more than ₹64 crore is spent every year only from the CM relief fund to treat patients suffering from serious illness,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-slams-nitish-kumar-over-bihar-healthcare-jd-u-says-rjd-chief-has-amnesia-101622616363989.html

The NCB will also conduct an investigation into Khan's role in a drug case linked to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death last year, he said.Khan was arrested on Tuesday after an NCB team, lead by its zonal director Sameer Wankhede, conducted raids at various locations in suburban Andheri, Lokhandwala, and Bandra, the official said."As of now, the NCB has arrested Khan in connection with the Chinku Pathan drugs case, but his role in the drug case linked to Rajput's death will also be investigated," the official said.The anti-drugs agency last week arrested Rajput's flatmate Siddharth Pithani from Hyderabad in the drug case linked to the actor's death.The NCB on Sunday also questioned Rajput's two former domestic workers Neeraj and Keshav in connection with the case.Rajput was found hanging at his home in Bandra in June last year.The NCB had arrested Pathan, a henchman Dawood Ibrahim and a relative of late mafia don Karim Lala, in January this year from neighbouring Navi Mumbai after busting a drug trafficking racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-drug-peddler-to-probe-his-role-in-drug-case-linked-to-bollywood-actor-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-101622613897293.html

02-06-2021||Patna||Bihar parents giving home to children orphaned by Covid under Parvarish scheme||Bihar government’s Parvarish (child raising) scheme meant to secure foster care and home for scores of children orphaned by Covid-19 pandemic is showing promising results with several parents coming forward and a family in Muzaffarpur being handed over the first such child.Over two dozen families from across the state have so far shown interest in the social welfare department’s alternative care plan to raise around 100 children aged above six years, abandoned or orphaned during the second wave of Covid-19 and who have not been adopted yet.While several applications are under process, one has come to fruition with a couple in Muzaffarpur district given custody of a child a couple of days ago with the support of UNICEF and the Centre of Excellence in Alternative Care, an NGO.“Dubbed Parvarish, the plan is intended to provide such children with a home and to help them grow in a family environment. Family is important for better growth of a child. It’s mainly beneficial for the girls at government care institutions as they need a family and home once they become major. And this plan has turned out to be very useful for children orphaned by Covid,” Rajkumar, director, social welfare department said.Earlier the social welfare department used to give ₹1,000 to families for maintenance of a child under foster care. Now, chief minister Nitish Kumar has announced ₹1,500 for children under foster care, he added.The official said soon several other applications will be approved resulting in more orphaned children getting ‘homes’. “Now that the Covid lockdown norms have been relaxed to some extent, things in this direction will move faster. In fact, spot verification of families applying for foster care is very important,” he said.A social welfare department employee, who did not want to be named, said among the applicants there are several families with no children. “But there are many others who have children, even then they want to provide foster care to Covid victims’ children,” the employee said.Among them one family wants a girl child as the couple have three sons but no daughter; while in another case, the couple want a boy as there’s no male child in the family, the department employee added.Meanwhile, Vijay Kumar Sinha, speaker of the Bihar assembly, has urged people representatives to monitor the effective implementation of Parvarish scheme in their areas.“I have asked the MLAs to monitor whether such children in their areas are getting financial and social support,” he said. Even former MLAs have been requested to help out. There are about 600 former MLAs in the state, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-parents-giving-home-to-children-orphaned-by-covid-under-parvarish-scheme-101622610843657.html

The proposal was mooted keeping the Covid situation in mind during a recent academic council meeting of the university, chaired by vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary.“The proposed provisions are exceptions to the usual admission procedure, due to [the] pandemic, which have been suggested only for the current year. The academic council’s resolutions have to be endorsed by the syndicate after which it would be sent to the Raj Bhawan for obtaining the governor’s approval,” Chaudhary said explaining the process for adoption of the proposal.Another varsity official said further movement will take place after the syndicate meeting on Wednesday. “We cannot implement any change in the admission process without [the] assent of the Raj Bhawan,” said Anil Kumar, media-incharge.Last year, more than 42,000 candidates appeared in the combined entranced examination conducted by the PU for various undergraduate courses.Officials said there will be no change in the admission process for postgraduate (PG) courses, done on the basis of marks obtained in previous degree examinations.The academic council has also resolved to change the nomenclature of six courses in the larger interest of the students and also commence National Cadet Corps (NCC) as a general elective credit course.Meanwhile, several aspirants have opposed the proposal to cancel the entrance exam fearing those with poor results in intermediate examinations will be disadvantaged.Amit Raj, a class 12 student, said, “PU should conduct entrance exams to provide fair opportunity to all aspirants. If conducting an offline exam is difficult due to Covid restrictions, then they should hold online exams. Marks of CBSE students are likely to dip since [the board] exams [for class 12 students] have been cancelled, creating a domino effect on their college admissions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-university-mulls-cancelling-entrance-exam-for-ug-courses-aspirants-wary-101622607903656.html

He (chief minister) has said that it (positivity rate) has to come down to 5% and (new cases) 5,000 cases per day, only then we can relax (the lockdown). Until then, it would be good to continue with these stringent restrictions. Whenever we unlock, we have to do it in a phased manner. It (daily cases) has come down as much as TAC wanted. We have to be cautious.”Also read: Centenarian freedom fighter who spoke truth to powerOn Monday, TAC in its recommendation to the government had said that the lockdown should continue till the test positivity rate falls below 5%. The committee prepared a report in which it suggested that the lockdown should be observed for two more weeks after June 7 until the daily new cases fall below 5,000 and the case fatality rate falls below 1%.The committee unanimously drafted the recommendations with its chairman M K Sudarshan saying that the panel is “placing lives before livelihoods”.The daily Covid-19 case count in Karnataka fell to less than 20,000 in the state and to less than 5,000 in Bengaluru Urban district on Monday with around 1.2 lakh to 1.3 lakh tests being conducted every day. The test positivity rate recorded on Monday was 13.57% and the case fatality rate was 2.47%.Deputy chief minister and state Covid task force head Dr Ashwath Narayan also echoed similar views as the health minister, saying that the government would take a feasible decision with regard to the continuation or easing of lockdown restrictions based on experts’ opinion and facts and figures.“There is a possibility of the positivity rate dropping down if testing is done in 1:10 ratio (for each positive case, 10 contacts to be tested). But whatever the case, the decision with regard to lockdown will be taken by the government after considering experts’ opinions and thorough discussion,” he said.Meanwhile, left-wing parties in Karnataka organised a state-wide protest on Tuesday, demanding better policies from the state government to ensure the livelihood of the unorganised sector is not hampered in case of an extension of the lockdown.Also read | BBMP launches app to keep tab on food distribution at Indira canteens“The state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee on Monday had recommended that Karnataka continue the lockdown in a stricter form, thus ‘placing lives before livelihoods’.

02-06-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand extends lockdown-like curbs till June 10 in view of Covid-19 situation||The Jharkhand government on Tuesday extended the lockdown-like restrictions till June 10 with some easing, an official said. This is the fourth time that the curbs, first imposed on April 22 for a week, were extended. The ongoing measures to contain the coronavirus surge were scheduled to end on June 3."The Health Safety Week now stands extended till June 10. Some relaxations have been given, including the opening of all shops in 15 districts from 6 am to 2 pm with certain conditions," the official said. The decision was made at a meeting of the State Disaster Management Authority chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren.As per the order, the districts have been divided into two categories and in 15 of the 24 districts witnessing lesser cases, all shops will be open. In the remaining nine districts, including state capital Ranchi, which are witnessing a high number of deaths, shops other than clothes, jewelry, and shoes have been allowed, the official added.Apart from Ranchi, these districts are - Bokaro, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur, Deoghar, Hazaribag, Garhwa, Gumla, and Ramgarh. All malls and multi-brand shops will remain closed. Norms for travelling have also been relaxed and e-passes would not be required for movement within the district, the order said. However, an e-pass will be needed for inter-district and inter-state movements.Chief minister Soren had earlier sought suggestions from stakeholders including people for gradually unlocking the restrictions.

Chief minister Soren, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, termed the mandate for states to procure medicines as against cooperative federalism."This is probably for the first instance in the history of independent India that the states have been mandated to procure vaccines on their own," he said.

02-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Home is where the bed is||Here’s the bed on the pavement, under the neem tree. The bed consists of a board of plywood placed upon a support of bricks. It has a mattress, a bed sheet, a folded chaadar (bedsheet), and a pillow with rose prints on it. A green comb is placed on the pillow. A mosquito net hangs from a bamboo scaffolding above.“This is my home,” says Jainath Mukhiya.This is also his chai stall. Mr Mukhiya, 33, has been running the stall on this spot, across the road from Aurobindo Market, for 20 years. Never before had his stall been closed for so long. But never before had the world seen such a pandemic.“This lockdown,” he sighs, shaking his head. Since it started, his stall—that would turn into a home only at night—is a bedroom 24/7. In the pre-pandemic era, the stall would teem with customers. Mr Mukhiya would dismantle the bed for the day.A white board on the pavement wall is hand scrawled with the tea stall menu: roti, dal, rice and aloo paratha. For many years, Mr Mukhiya worked as a cook in a household. He seems to be skilled in this art, for this evening he is making himself chicken curry in a pressure cooker. The kitchen is arranged beside the bed—some pans, an earthen surahi, a gas burner.The rest of the home consists of plants in pots and in plastic bottles, and a phool jhadu. There’s also a vase filled with plastic flowers.Overall, the scene is looking idyllic, and an unsuspecting passerby might see it as a Thoreau-like retreat, far from the world of relentless consumerism.“But everybody dreams of a house with roof,” corrects Mr Mukhiya shyly. “I haven’t earned for days... I had to borrow.” He hasn’t been able to send money to his family in Madhubani, Bihar, though his parents and younger brother do manage to earn a bit from the small farm land they own.Suddenly the pressure cooker gives a whistle. Mr Mukhiya will soon settle down to dine. “Though I go to sleep only by midnight, when traffic noise recedes.” He’ll wake up around 5 in the morning, with the day’s early light spilling into his home.Mr Mukhiya now lies down on the bed for a portrait. The wall behind the bed is crudely scrawled in Hindi, with a warning familiar to Delhi’s street walls—“Peeing is prohibited here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-home-is-where-the-bed-is-101622588190608.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||With 75 deaths so far, black fungus a major challenge for Haryana||Black fungus infection, detected mostly in people recovering from Covid-19, has claimed 75 lives in Haryana so far, official data revealed. Advocating the need for research to ascertain causes of black fungus, Haryana health minister Anil Vij had said about a week that the state had at least 64 black fungus patients who had no history of Covid-19 infection. “People with no history of Covid and those who were not on oxygen support during Covid treatment are suffering from black fungus and it is a matter of concern,” he said, asking the Centre and scientists to look into these findings. Haryana has detected not just Mucormycosis, commonly called as black fungus, but also yellow and white fungus cases, the state government said on Tuesday. Until May 31, there were 927 cases of black fungus in 16 districts. Of these, 734 patients are still under treatment while 118 patients have recovered. Out of the 927 cases reported so far in Haryana, 242 were from Gurugram district, 214 from Rohtak, 211 from Hisar 211, 55 from Faridabad, 48 from Sirsa, 37 from Panipat, 30 from Karnal, 26 from Nuh, 13 from Jhajjar, 11 in Fatehabad, nine each in Ambala and Rewari, eight in Bhiwani, seven in Panchkula, five in Yamunanagar and two in Kaithal. As per the data, as many as 61 patients (till May 30) had succumbed to the fungal infection with Hisar recording 19 fatalities, Gurugram 10, Rohtak and Sirsa eight each, Jhajjar six, Nuh three, and Bhiwani, Fatehabad and Kaithal one each. Even after declaring black fungus a notified disease and constituting an expert committee to decide the distribution of injection Amphotericin-B, a drug required to treat the said disease, the challenge before the state government is to ensure timely treatment and uninterrupted supply of injections to patients affected with this infection. As per the official data, the expert committee has approved 975 Amphotericin-B for 515 patients. The dosage is given per kilogram of body weight. For instance, 5mg/kg. The state government has reserved 75 beds in all medical colleges in Haryana for black fungus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-75-deaths-so-far-black-fungus-a-major-challenge-for-haryana-101622579940997.html

One of the protesters allegedly even smashed the rear window of MLA’s SUV. His personal assistant received minor injuries. Police have arrested the man who allegedly smashed the window.Farm leader Rajender Singh said the local MLA Babli had used abusive language against farmers when they were protesting against him. “Babli has been claiming that he was in favour of the farmers but he backed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the trust vote. His real face was exposed today when he hurled abuses at us. We will gherao his residence on June 5 and file a police complaint against him for using abusive language,” he added.Reacting to the incident, Babli said the protesters were goons not farmers. “Farmers can’t attack anyone.

Laddu is Gill’s associate while Pamma is a commission agent at Patti grain market. Manna is also a close associate of criminal Preet Sekhon, who, according to police, had killed the victims.Amandeep Singh alias Aman Fauji, who was close friend of former SAD minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon’s right hand Gurmukh Singh Ghulla, and his accomplice Prabhjit Singh of Patti, were shot dead by two car-borne men when they were returning after paying obeisance at a tomb in Patti on May 27. Aman and Prabhjit’s third accomplice Samsher Singh, alias Shera, received a bullet injury in his stomach.Police said gangster Lakhbir Singh, alias Landa, who is a resident of Harike and currently lives in Canada, had given ₹6 lakh to Preet Sekhon for executing the crime. Landa had conspired the killing along with Laddu, who was appointed vice-president of Majha Truck Union at Patti by the MLA in presence of deputy superintendent of police (DSP-Patti) Kuljinder Singh around a month ago.Police said Laddu, a drug peddler, come into Landa’s contact through commission agent Pumma, who oversees Landa’s work in India. They said Laddu had been at loggerheads with Aman Fauji over stacking of food grains at Chuslewar wheat godown.There are two truck unions in Patti — one is backed by the Congress and the other is led by Gulla, president of the Patti Majha Truck Union. Two months ago, the contract of stacking “specials” at Chuslewar godown was fetched by Ghulla’s union. “Lately, Laddu had a quarrel with Aman Fauji over stacking of wheat in the godown. He had been holding grudge against him,” said a senior police official.Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said: “Someone conducted a recee of the spot on May 20 where the crime took place. CCTV footage led us to Laddu’s arrest. When Laddu was questioned, he disclosed that he had hatched the conspiracy to kill Fauji and his associates at Landa’s instance.”“Laddu has also told us that Landa had sought ₹20 lakh ransom from a person. The person had discussed the ransom call with Aman Fauji. But, Fauji and his associates refused to give the ransom. After this, Landa discussed the matter with Laddu who was already against Fauji. The duo then hatched the conspiracy to kill him and his associates. Landa sent ₹6 lakh though Laddu for hiring Preet Sekhon,” the SSP said. The SSP, however, refused to disclose the name of the person from whom ₹20 lakh ransom was sought.Sekhon, who is already facing four criminal cases, including three of murder, had also posted on his Facebook page claiming the responsibility for the murder.Landa is facing 11 criminal cases in Ferozepur, Tarn Taran and Chandigarh. Similarly, Laddu is facing two criminal cases, including one of attempt to murder, said police. “I have asked the administration to take strict action Malkiat Singh ‘Laddu’. If anyone commits any mistake, he will have to face the music. I never protect criminals. If there is my involvement, I am ready to join the probe, said MLA Harminder Singh Gill. Responding to Ghulla’s allegation, the MLA said: “Aman Fauji and Laddu were Ghulla’s aide. When Congress government came to power, Laddu joined us. But we never protect any accused. We also oppose those who are involved in drug smuggling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patti-shootout-cong-mla-s-aide-among-three-held-for-akali-worker-s-murder-101622578320868.html

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said the interview process was “vitiated and compromised”. It had initiated investigation in 2015 after an FIR was lodged by the Haryana vigilance bureau.All 14 industrial plots were attached as per provisions of PMLA in 2019. This February, the ED had filed a chargesheet against 22 persons, including Hooda and three retired IAS officers.On Tuesday, Savita Chaudhary, special public prosecutor for ED, filed an application for issuance of non-bailable warrant against Katyal on the grounds that he is intentionally avoiding appearance before the court. The court observed this case falls in the priority category and needs to be taken up expeditiously, in accordance with the directions of the Apex Court.In the application, ED stated that Katyal was allotted an industrial plot in Industrial Estate, Panchkula, through an illegal allotment process wherein undue favours were given to the allottees at the cost of other genuinely eligible applicants by the then HUDA chairman and other office bearers.The plot was allotted to him an at abysmally low price, which was approximately four times less than the prevailing circle rates and approximately eight times less than the prevailing market rates. Further, his application for plot allotment was incomplete and had serious shortcomings and should have been rejected. The ED stated: “Now, Katyal was found projecting this plot as being untainted property, whereas conveniently forgetting that all the plots were attained through a process which was vitiated, illegal and riddled with criminal activities related to the scheduled offence.”He has committed an offence of money laundering under Section 3 and 4 of PMLA, 2002, it was stated.

02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Derogatory posters at Bargari: SIT collects handwriting sample of dera follower||FaridkotThe special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents has again collected handwriting sample of a dera Sacha Sauda follower to match it with the writing on derogatory posters that were pasted at Bargari village in 2015.Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, who is in two-day police custody, was presented before a court with a request to collect his handwriting samples claiming that one of the derogatory posters was written by him. The court of judicial magistrate Tarjini on Tuesday allowed SIT’s application and samples were collected by the probe team. The SIT said the sample will be sent to the Forensic Science Lab (FSL).The SIT led by inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar arrested four dera followers saying the posters were pasted by them on the directions of dera’s three national committee members. In the three posters that appeared at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages on September 24-25, 2015, it was threatened that the “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1 that year would be torn if the Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim-starrer film Messenger of God (MSG)-2 was not allowed to be released in Punjab.The SIT, then led then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018, claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers has matched with the one on the posters. But the CBI in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters. With two contrary claims on the record of two investigation teams, the Parmar-led SIT is again going for the forensic analysis of the handwriting of the same accused. The SIT is following the Khatra-led SIT’s lead in the investigation. According to the Khatra-led SIT probe findings, the dera followers in September planned to paste posters to throw a challenge to the Sikh community three months after the theft of the bir from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village. The Khatra-led SIT had further claimed about the involvement of dera followers Mohinder Pal Singh Bittu, who was killed in the Nabha jail, Sukhjinder and Ranjeet Singh in putting up these posters at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala.“The dera followers were also upset with the government for not releasing MSG-2 in Punjab. To execute their plan, they procured A-4 paper along with Reynolds black marker pen from a shop at Bargari of Gopal Das, a member of a dera committee. Shakti Singh bought these papers and Bittu decided what will be written on the posters,” the SIT had claimed, adding that Sukhjinder wrote on the posters at a Kotkapura namcharcha ghar (dera prayer centre) and Bittu handed them over on September 24 to Baljeet Singh, who along with Shakti pasted it at Bargari. The same night, Sukhjinder and Ranjit pasted two posters at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, the SIT had claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/derogatory-posters-at-bargari-sit-collects-handwriting-sample-of-dera-follower-101622578140798.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sikh outfits announce morcha from July 1 if sacrilege, firing culprits not arrested||Sikh organisations, including hardliners, on Tuesday announced to start a morcha from July 1 if the Punjab government failed to arrest those responsible for the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents. Marking the sixth anniversary of the sacrilege incident at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village, Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) president Baljit Singh Daduwal said the desecration was unfortunate and successive governments failed to provide justice. The event was held at the Bargari gurdwara.“The Bargari Morcha was lifted on the Congress government’s assurance. First it was the Badals and now it’s Captain Amarinder Singh who failed to rise to the occasion. We are giving one-month time to the government to put the guilty of sacrilege and police firing behind the bars,” he said. “The investigation officers made efforts to provide justice. We have full faith in special investigation team (SIT). All the witnesses will give them full support. But we don’t trust Amarinder Singh,” he added. Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann said, “We demand arrest of (former chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal, (Shiromani Akali Dal president) Sukhbir Badal and (ex-DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini for their involvement in sacrilege and police firing. In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, I ask the sangat to reach the morcha venue in an 11-member group each from all the districts every day. The groups will go back in the evening.”Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) leaders led by party president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and patron Ranjit Singh Bramhpura reached the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurudwara and held an ardas. Daduwal also joined the SAD (Sanyukt) leaders during the ardas before reaching Bargari. But they did not address the gathering. Dhindsa said, “Instead of providing justice, CM Amarinder and the Badals are doing politics on sacrilege and police firing.” Party leader Nidharak Singh Brar said the release of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Ram Rahim on parole and ardas by a pathi hurt the sentiments of Sikhs.Sukhraj Singh, son of Bhagwan Krishan who died in the Behbal Kalan firing incident, said Dhindsa and Brahmpura never visited the sacrilege-hit villages nor did they meet the victims of police firing in the last six years. “They are only pursuing their political agenda,” he added. Also, the Sikh leaders got into a minor scuffle over holding each other responsible for lifting the Bargari Morcha in 2018.

Sikh hardliners are questioning the apex gurdwara body over the delay. “The SGPC, being custodian of the project, must clarify about the fate of the gallery. The gurdwara body president must tell what hurdle they are facing in completing the project,” said Kanwarpal Singh, a radical Sikh leader. Besides militants, portraits of the devotees killed in the operation were also proposed to be installed in the gallery. The portraits will include those of slain militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the then head of the seminary, and his military adviser Major General Shabeg Singh who helped fortify the shrine complex. In 2017, the SGPC executive body passed a resolution to set up the gallery in the basement of the existing Bluestar memorial. The seminary had constituted a four-member committee to prepare a blueprint of the project and collect information and pictures of those killed in the operation whose anniversary is marked on June 6. Also, a delegation of radical outfits is planning to meet SGPC chief Jagir Kaur in this regard. The Damdami Taksal is likely to face their anger during a ceremony to be held at Akal Takht to mark the anniversary, it is learnt. Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa was not available for comments. Seminary’s media adviser Sarchand Singh said, “The work on the gallery was stopped due to the pandemic outbreak. We are working on a collection of portraits of those killed. This is taking time.” The Taksal has been collecting donations from the devotees at the entrance of the proposed gallery. This had raised eyebrows of many in the community. The SGPC chief could not be reached for comments. “We have repeatedly asked the Taksal to complete the project. Its chief has assured us to do the needful at the earliest,” said SGPC senior vice president Surjit Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-in-a-fix-as-damdami-taksal-fails-to-complete-op-bluestar-portrait-gallery-101622578021555.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||No neurosurgeon in Bathinda AIIMS for black fungus patients||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, is struggling to treat black fungus patients in the absence of a neurosurgeon.On May 24, the central institute constituted a multidisciplinary mucor task force to treat patients diagnosed with black fungus. AIIMS executive director Dr DK Singh said on Tuesday that four mucormycosis patients have been operated upon in the last one week but it is a challenging task to treat patients fully without an expert from the neurology department.Singh said fungus infection in Covid-9 patients is a critical medical condition that needs swift treatment by a panel of experts. While limited resources jeopardise complete treatment, black fungus complexities affect the quality of their lives as it affects various organs, he added.“Scarcity of drugs is another serious challenge in treating patients for a disease that was a rarity in India before the pandemic outbreak. Central and state authorities have been apprised about the drug shortage and efforts are being to streamline it,” he added.“I made best efforts, but no neurosurgeon is ready to join AIIMS on ad hoc basis. Since the institute is at a developing stage, we have limited facilities for faculties. Keeping in view of the grim situation of black fungus, I have decided to hold interviews later this month to appoint neurosurgeons,” said AIIMS head.Institute authorities say the fourth mucormycosis surgery was held on Tuesday afternoon and the patients are under constant medical observation. They all are in post-Covid stage treatment.“The third surgery on Tuesday took over six hours and the patient is in a critical condition. The operation of the fourth patients started at around 3.30 pm and AIIMS has 10 more black fungus patients. Our maiden experience says these cases are very serious,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-neurosurgeon-in-bathinda-aiims-for-black-fungus-patients-101622578020586.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||New rules allow home delivery of liquor in city||The Delhi government on Monday allowed home delivery of liquor in the Capital through websites and apps as part of a new excise policy that aims to introduce sweeping changes in the city’s liquor business, clean up malpractices, and improve user experience.Under the Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules, 2021, which was notified on Monday, the government allowed retailers who hold L-13 licence to deliver alcohol to consumers’ homes. At present, all liquor shops in Delhi are shut due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown.“Only a particular kind of license holder will be allowed to home deliver liquor. In Delhi, we have allowed home delivery of liquor only to L-13 license holders,” said an excise department official, who did not want to be named.A second government official clarified the rules might not be implemented immediately, but the changes would clear the decks for the process to begin.“This notification was meant to notify the changes made to the Delhi excise rules. The date of implementation of these rules, including the home delivery service, will be announced through another notification by the Delhi government. That date is yet to be decided,” the second official said.The excise department official said the L-13 category existed before but was little used due to complex rules that allow home delivery only for orders placed by fax or email. “Such modes of placing orders are outdated now and hence, home delivery of liquor never took off in the national Capital,” the official said.“L-13 is an existing license which has been amended. No license for L-13 or home delivery of license has been issued so far,” said a Delhi government statement.The new excise rules allow L-13 licence holders to deliver Indian and foreign-made liquor to residences only.“The licensee shall make delivery of liquor at the residences only if the order is received through a mobile app or online web portal and no delivery shall be made to any hostel, office, and institution,” read the notification issued by the state finance department.Home delivery of liquor is allowed in other prominent cities, including Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata.The move was welcomed by young people and liquor associations but opposed by some residents and trade associations and political parties.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) called it a progressive step.“Mumbai and Kolkata are two good examples that show that the mechanism of home delivery of liquor can work without any adverse fallouts. Growth of sales in Maharashtra shows such prompt measures helped the state recover some loss in sales forced by Covid lockdowns,” said Vinod Giri, director general, CIABC.Ankita Kumar, a 31-year-old banker, said Delhi’s government should expedite home delivery of liquor. “It is such a relief to hear that people, especially women, will soon have the option to order alcohol at home. I am sure the liquor purchasing experience of 95% of women in the city has been unpleasant at some point or the other,” she said.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the timing of the notification was questionable. “This move of the Delhi government is purported to be taken with a view to earn revenue. Even by allowing shops and markets to open from May 31, the government could have fetched substantial revenue by sale proceeds which would have been made by the traders on the one hand and providing opportunities to earn a livelihood on the other,” said Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT secretary general.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised the move and said the notification suggested “misplaced priorities” of the Aam Aadmi Party government. “At a time when Delhi was reeling under the brutal second wave of Covid-19 during the last two months, the Delhi government was busy working with the liquor mafia to change these rules,” said Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta.Last week, HT reported that lieutenant governor Anil Baijal cleared the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, and the Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules, 2021, paving the way for a raft of changes to boost revenue and crack down on liquor mafia. These changes were approved by the Delhi cabinet.Major changes include slashing the legal drinking age from 25 to 21, getting the state out of the retail alcohol business, overhauling a labyrinthine tax system, reducing the number of dry days in a year from 21 to 3, and improving spread and service. It gets rid of the iron grilles at the front of most liquor vends in the Capital, and allows buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-rules-allow-home-delivery-of-liquor-in-city-101622577600179.html

The Saudi Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has decided to follow tougher quality check of the premium rice from India as it wants fungicide levels not more than 0.01 mg against 1 kilogram, it is learnt. The Gulf country imports the bulk of basmati rice from India.In a communiqué to the Union ministries of agriculture and commerce besides Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the exporters of basmati have demanded regulations on the sale of pesticides and licences to manufacturing companies. ‘Pesticide makers fleecing farmers’ Ashok Sethi, director, Basmati Exporters’ Association, said in the communiqué, “The manufacturing companies sell pesticide to the gullible farmers without any authorisation by the agriculture development or agriculture universities. There is no regulation on the pesticides companies.” “Moreover, the supply of spurious pesticides through unscrupulous traders has resulted in wrong and excessive use. The state governments ban pesticides from time to time, but they can’t do much as the power vests with the Insecticides Board of India under the Union ministry of agriculture. The pesticide companies also approach the courts to get relief,” Sethi pointed out. The government should ban the pesticides not matching the international standards, the association suggested. APEDA general manager (cereals) SS Nayyar said they are concerned over the high pesticide levels in the crops, particularly basmati, and have been taking up the issue at different levels. Punjab contributes 40% share to the ₹34,000 crore (USD 4.66 billion) annual basmati exports from India. From 2018 to 2020, the state agriculture department, APEDA and the exporters association have organised awareness camps and cut pesticide use. Besides Saudi Arabia, others importing basmati from India are Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and countries in North America and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/basmati-exporters-seek-check-on-use-of-pesticides-in-crop-amid-tougher-norms-by-foreign-buyers-101622577965068.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Covid death toll in May over twofold than April||Punjab recorded more than twofold increase in Covid-19 deaths in May as compared to the previous month with an average 178 fatalities a day. As many as 5,528 patients succumbed to the virus in the state in May against 2,154 in April. Besides, May contributed 38% to the state’s total fatalities so far. The state also heaved a big sigh of relief as the number of daily fresh infections came down from a record 9,200 to 2,253 the same month. Among the districts, Ludhiana was the worst-hit in May at 624 deaths, followed by Bathinda at 550. The maximum 202 single-day deaths were registered on May 21. “The trend is reversing now as the daily addition of cases has come to around 2,000 a day,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. A prolonged wave in state Experts believe that the second wave lasted longer in Punjab than Delhi and Maharashtra. Maharastra and Delhi registered their pandemic peak for a shorter period. “This was primarily due to the fact that we didn’t decrease our testing despite shortfall in the daily addition of cases. More testing means more positivity rate. The good thing is despite high testing our positivity rate has decreased to less than 3%,” said the nodal officer. More cases in rural areas In May, the state also registered more cases in rural areas that contributed 35% of the caseload in May-end from 27% in April. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar also attributed it to intensive testing in villages. “We screened 1.37 lakh people in rural areas in the last two weeks of May in our door-to-door campaign with a 3.3% positivity rate,” he said. The positivity rate came down from 14.2% on May 12 to 5% on May 31. It further dipped to 3% on June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-covid-death-toll-in-may-over-twofold-than-april-101622577964173.html

Sodhi said, “ ₹5 crore will be spent on laying international-standard astroturf by the Dutch company Greenfield. An international coach will also be appointed to train the players.”He had come to Dhudike a few months back and saw the pathetic condition of the ground and decided to change it on a priority basis, he added.“Once the Astroturf is laid, the youth of district will be exposed to world-class facilities. Also, a state-of-the-art swimming pool will be set up in Moga. The existing indoor stadium in Moga will also be made operational,” the minister said. Dhudike village had produced many national-level hockey players. The work on the astroturf project that started in February 2017 was stopped the same year. Sodhi said all remaining work will be completed within 7 months.A sports department official said, said, “Though the work on constructing the base was completed, tenders for installing the astroturf were never floated. The tender has been allotted.”He said around 40% funds on the project are being spent by the central government which has already provided ₹2 crore to the state sports department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sports-minister-lays-stone-of-astroturf-for-second-time-101622577960949.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||VB starts probe into recruitment of asst professors at Pbi varsity||The Punjab vigilance bureau (VB) has started an inquiry into the recruitment of 65 assistant professors at Punjabi University, Patiala, from 2009 to 2016. In September last year, the university syndicate, while holding a detailed discussion on the findings of 13 inquiry reports related to allegations of corruption, nepotism and misuse of funds during 2007-2017, decided to handover the probe to the VB.In a complaint filed in 2017, it was alleged that these assistant professors were appointed in violation of the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms related to NET and PhD. It was also alleged that the wards and relatives of then ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders were recruited on regular basis, ignoring the eligible candidates.Assistant inspector general (vigilance) Ashish Kapoor said they have collected record from the university and a detailed investigation has been initiated. “We hope to complete the probe soon and detailed report will be submitted to senior officials for action,” Kapoor said.How varsity tweaked rules In June 2011, Punjabi University issued advertisement regarding recruitment of assistant professors. However, before the recruitment, the university constituted a seven-member committee and allegedly tweaked UGC guidelines and also got it cleared on March 29, 2012.The committee allowed applications from PhD holders, who had done their degree before 2009. It also exempted PhD holders from clearing the NET. According to UGC regulations notified on July 11, 2009, and September 18, 2010, NET/SLET/SET is the minimum eligibility condition for recruitment and appointment of lecturer/assistant professor in universities/colleges/institutions. Only those PhD holders are exempted from the minimum eligibility condition for appointment whose degree has been awarded in accordance with the UGC (minimum standards and procedure for awarding PhD degree) Regulations, 2009.VB already probing fire extinguishers case The VB is already probing a case related to purchase of fire extinguishers worth ₹80 lakh in the university. In 2017, irregularities in the purchase of fire extinguishers at ₹58.4 lakh and smoke-detection alarm systems at ₹21.4 lakh over three years came to light. A 4kg fire extinguisher was bought at ₹8,229, though the Punjab common schedule of rates says it’s available for ₹2,415 per piece. An internal inquiry report on the April 2014-October 2016 period says the purchase of extinguishers was made from a “ghost” company. Following the resignation of former V-C Dr Jaspal Singh in March 2017, the then secretary, higher education, Anurag Verma, was appointed as the officiating V-C. Verma received complaints on irregularities in the university’s functioning from 2007 to 2017. These included allegations of nepotism, corruption, and bungling of funds in the examination branch, among other issues.On the basis of these complaints, Verma ordered 14 internal inquiries in April 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vb-starts-probe-into-recruitment-of-asst-professors-at-pbi-varsity-101622577900754.html

02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu, Pargat stick to their guns, target Capt before Kharge panel||Punjab MLAs Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh, who have been railing against chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh over various issues, continued to do so before the three-member committee formed by the Congress to resolve the internal fight in the party ahead of next year’s polls.Sidhu, who has consistently accused Amarinder Singh of shielding the Badal family in the sacrilege and police firing cases and blamed him for the botched-up probe in the Kotkapura case, met the committee headed by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge for at least one-and-half-hours in New Delhi on Tuesday. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP Jai Prakash Agarwal are the other members of the committee.After the meeting, Sidhu said he was there at the high command’s invitation . “My stand was the same, is the same and will be the same that the democratic power of people that goes to the government in the form of taxes should go back to the people...each citizen must be made shareholder in progress. The truth may be punished but it cannot be defeated. We have to make the truth victorious and defeat anti-Punjab forces,” the cricketer-turned-politician told reporters.Between June and October 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib took place in Faridkot district, leading to huge resentment and protests in the state. On October 14, 2015, two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan. The same day, police also opened fire on protesters in Kotkapura. Amarinder had promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and police firing. On April 9 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation carried out by the state police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The legal setback has fired up the chief minister’s detractors. The state government has constituted a new SIT in accordance with the court orderThough the Amritsar East MLA made a brief statement after the meeting he did not take any questions from the media. Later, Pargat Singh, who is considered close to Sidhu, is learnt to have raised questions over the chief minister’s working style, his failure to deliver on key poll promises and the public perception about Captain and the Badals being close.During his 25-minute one-on-one meeting, the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA also handed over to the committee members copies of a letter that he wrote to the CM around 18 months ago, expressing displeasure over the state government’s performance. In his letter (first reported by Hindustan Times on February 17, 2020), Pargat Singh raised questions over the alleged cover-up of corruption cases, the drug menace, revenue leakages and the delay in dealing with those involved in the sacrilege case. “Though there has been no issue regarding the flow to funds for development works in assembly constituencies, there are several key promises that are still to be kept. If these relate to the CM’s departments, then who is responsible?,” the former India hockey captain said after the meeting.Sidhu and Pargat Singh were among 30 leaders, including Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Dr Amar Singh, Ashwani Kumar, Ajaib Singh Bhatti, Navtej Singh Cheema and Satkar Kaur, who met the committee constituted by the Congress president to resolve factionalism in the state Congress. In addition, heads of frontal organizations such as Mahila Congress and Punjab Youth Congress also met them.The duo’s criticism is unlikely to help . “We need to go into the poll mode immediately and avoid such squabbles. There is no doubt that there is resentment with regard to the sacrilege case, inaction against the Badals and lack of implementation of promises made to Dalits. Once these are addressed, everything will okay. The meetings are not about Sidhu,” one Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. Though there is talk that the peace formula could include appointment of two deputy chief ministers, several MLAs and MPs who have met the panel over the past two days said this is news to them. The panel will meet more leaders, including the remaining MLAs, MPs and former state unit presidents, on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-pargat-stick-to-their-guns-target-capt-before-kharge-panel-101622577240597.html

These booths will function on the lines of special booths to administer doses to parents of children up to 12 years of age on priority basis,” said the chief minister during his visit to KD Singh ‘Babu’ stadium Covid vaccination centre in Lucknow. He was here to inaugurate the UP Government’s aggressive vaccination drive that aims to administer around one crore doses in June. Addressing the media, the CM said so far around 1.83 crore people had been vaccinated in UP. “However, in June we have a target to administer doses to around 1 crore people,” he added. For the purpose, around 2,100 booths have been established in all 75 districts of UP to carry out Covid vaccination drive on a war footing. Of these, 200 are special booths meant to vaccinate parents of children up to 12 years of age on priority basis, said the CM. He said efforts to check the spread of Covid infection were successful as the number of active cases in UP came down to 32,000. “We have so far relaxed curfew in around 61 districts,” he added. The CM not only inspected facilities at the vaccination centre, but also interacted with people. He urged people not to avoid Covid test and vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-cm-announces-special-vax-booths-for-state-staff-teachers-and-others-101622576519922.html

Gram pradhans have also been roped in to dispel misinformation about the vaccine among people. Chief medical officer (Banda) ND Sharma said vaccine hesitancy in villages is a fact and many departments have been mobilised to accelerate the vaccination campaign, particularly in villages. Though 1.30 lakh people have so far been inoculated against Covid in the district, most of the beneficiaries are in Banda town and vaccination in rural areas is extremely sluggish, said health department officials. “That is why it has been decided to hold camps in villages. Today, I got 250 people registered online in my village and they will be vaccinated in a day or two. If we have to vaccinate people in villages, we have to reach out to them. Waiting for them at community or primary health centres will not help,” said Ram Lal Jayan, pradhan of Tendura village in Bhisanda block. Jayan held a series of meetings with sector magistrate and other officials for the camps to be held in the villages. “I have urged them to organise several such camps to cover the entire population,” he added. In the past one week, people who took their first jab met others and persuaded them to get inoculated. “They were going to door to door sharing their experiences post vaccination. The 250 registrations in the past three days is a result of this exercise,” said Jayan.People in the nearby Chausar village are extremely wary of vaccination. Many ran away when the health department teams visited them. Their biggest fear is about death after taking the jab, said Vishambhar Singh Kushwaha, a local. “People think that immunity becomes zero for 10 days after the vaccine It’s a myth that this period makes one vulnerable to catching coronavirus. They also fear fever after vaccination, said Ram Vilakshan of Tendura village.“The mindset will take lot of effort to change. But when the change is happening, the vaccine is short in supply,” said Raju Shrivas, pradhan of Katra Kalinjar. “We had 120 doses against registration of 230 in my village. Nearly 100 people had to return without being vaccinated today,” he said. Similarly, Ranno Patel, pradhan of Ragauli Bhatpura village said the shortage of vaccines hit the efforts to boost inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-up-s-banda-pradhans-roped-in-to-inject-vaccine-confidence-into-villagers-101622576340594.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to appoint commission to get data on OBC||The state, in a meeting of ministers chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray, on Tuesday decided to appoint an independent commission to collect empirical data on Other Backward Classes (OBC).While ruling that the reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% reservation cap, the Supreme Court on March 4 had directed the state to appoint a commission to collect empirical data, based on which, the reservation would be fixed. The state had approached for a review, which was quashed on May 28.This means, no seat will be reserved for OBCs in the upcoming local bodies comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, gram panchayats etc. at least for this year or until the state completes the process.“We have decided to appoint an independent commission. The draft of the order will be prepared on Wednesday and modalities will be fixed,” said OBC minister Vijay Wadettiwar after the meeting at Sahyadri guest house at Malabar Hill.The legislation for local bodies in Maharashtra provides political reservation to the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) based on their population in those particular bodies. In case of OBC, this data is not available as their last census was conducted in 1931.Community leaders on Tuesday blamed the state and decided not to allow holding of polls to district and municipal bodies until their reservation is restored. The decision was taken in a meeting called by OBC Jan Morcha, an umbrella body of OBC outfits. “We have decided to study the SC judgment. Our team of legal experts will prepare its interpretation based on which a memorandum will be made and sent to the chief minister, deputy chief minister, OBC minister, social justice minister and collectors through thousands of emails,” said Chandrakant Bavkar, executive president, OBC Jan Morcha. “We will wait till June 15 to see the steps taken by the state.”“The apex court had directed the state to implement the order passed in 2010 by a constitutional bench in K Krishna Murthy versus Union of India case, in which the court had asked to appoint a dedicated commission, but they didn’t act,” said Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition on May 31. “We have also promulgated an ordinance to save the OBC reservation on July 31, which lapsed as this government didn’t convert it into a law.” Former rural development minister Pankaja Munde on May 31 said the government should appoint a commission. Nawab Malik, minority affairs minister, said, “BJP has always supported organizations that are against reservation system.”State Congress chief Nana Patole said, “BJP can’t misguide the OBC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-to-appoint-commission-to-get-data-on-obc-101622576339956.html

Security personnel faced a tough time in managing the crowd as people broke the queues to enter the centres. People also lined up at the vaccination centres hours before the start of the vaccination session. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said there was good response from people in 18-45 age group. The state government set up 5,500 vaccination centres across UP to facilitate beneficiaries to take the jabs.The parent-special vaccination centres were a unique initiative of the state government to pave way for the vaccination of beneficiaries whose children are below 12 years. The state health and family welfare department set up two to three such centres in each district, he said. Prasad said UP is likely to get adequate doses of the vaccine from the central government quota while the state government had also procured enough doses of vaccine from two manufacturing companies - Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech to inoculated over one crore people in June. The quantity of the vaccine that UP will receive in June will be much higher than what the state got in May, he added.People who missed the vaccination this week should get themselves registered on the CoWin portal when the booking for slots opens on Sunday. He said some anti-social elements were trying to create doubts about the vaccine and people should ignore them to get both doses for protection from Covid-19, said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/340-lakh-people-take-the-jabs-in-up-101622576219944.html

This was part of the UP government’s aggressive vaccination campaign that aims to administer around one crore doses in June.Though Covid protocols and social distancing were ignored in the earlier part of the day as large crowds converged at vaccination centres, health department officials said the drive was successful as they managed to inoculate 5,633 people at the three centres. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the KD Singh ‘Babu’ stadium to inspect the vaccination drive. “The Covid-19 vaccination drive went off smoothly. Against the target to administer around 10,500 doses in a day, we inoculated around 5,633 people at the three mega centres. This was in addition to the 76 regular Covid vaccination centres across the city, which administered over 19,000 doses in a day,” said Dr MK Singh, additional chief medical officer\district immunisation officer (DIO). The Ekana cricket stadium, Chhota Imambada and KD Singh ‘Babu’ stadium were transformed into mega vaccination centres. Despite time slots being allocated, people began pouring in since morning, which made the situation chaotic at the centres, said beneficiaries. “We were given a time slot of 11am. Hence we reached the vaccination centre at 10:30am. But we were surprised to see a huge crowd there and Covid protocols not being followed. The situation was rather scary for us as I also suffered minor injury while entering the main gate,” said Radhika, a college-goer, who reached Ekana stadium to take the jab. Sarita Gautam, a college student who went to Ekana stadium to take the jab, said crowd management there was zero and social distancing went for a toss. “However, the management people said the crowd is huge as it is the first day of vaccination. I hope things improve in days to come or these centres would act as super-spreaders,” she said.She said people with other time slots too thronged the centre and made things worse. The situation was similar at the Chhota Imambada and the KD Singh ‘Babu’ Stadium, which were crowded during the initial hours. However, the things improved as the day progressed. Though the official time for the vaccination was between 10am and 4pm, people were inoculated till 6pm to clear the rush. At the Ekana stadium, 2,085 beneficiaries were vaccinated in 18 plus age group and 507 in the 45 plus group. The KD Singh ‘Babu’ stadium witnessed inoculation of 939 people in the 18 plus age group and 548 in the 45 plus category. As many as 46 people took the jabs at parents’ special booths here, said officials.The Chhota Imambada centre saw vaccination of 956 people in the 18 plus category and 485 in the 45 plus age group while 47 beneficiaries took the jabs at parents’ special booth here, they said.Ekana stadium the biggest centre Of the three mega centres, Ekana stadium was the biggest with around 20 inoculation booths. Of these, 10 were allocated to administer doses to people in 18 to 45 years age group while the remaining 10 booths catered to 45 plus citizens. A team of eight doctors and over 50 vaccinators and data operators, ensured smooth functioning of the centre. The Chhota Imambada and KD Singh ‘Babu’ Stadium centres had eight booths each, of which four were for people between 18 and 44 years of age and the remaining four for 45-plus people. 250 staffers ensured smooth functioning A team of 250 officials, including doctors, paramedical staff and health workers, was deployed to ensure smooth vaccination at the three mega centres. Three doctors took care of the entire vaccination event. Besides, there were four doctors each at the three mega vaccination centres while over 70 vaccinators, 40 data entry operators and administrative officers ensured smooth functioning at the centres. Parent special booths a hit Special booths to vaccinate parents of children up to 12 years old on priority came in for praise. People said it’s tough for people having kids to spend hours in the queues. “I am thankful to the administration for giving a thought to the problem. The move will not only minimise the problem, but also motivate parents to get themselves vaccinated,” said Narendra Gupta, a banker who reached KD Singh ‘Babu’ stadium to get himself vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-drive-5-633-inoculated-at-3-mega-centres-in-lucknow-101622576049368.html

The number dropped to 28 in February, only to rise again in March that saw 115 deaths. As the second wave climbed relentlessly in May, the month saw fatalities surging by 170% from the 231 in April. Contrary to the four-month gap (120 days) between the toll climbing from 750 to 1,000 mark from October 2 last year to January 30 this year, it took just 11 days for the number of total deaths to cross the 1,750 count from 1,500. For the toll to touch 2,000 from the 1,750 mark, it took just two weeks’ time, while it had taken 79 days for the deaths to climb from the figure of 1,000 to 1,250 and 18 days to reach 1,500 from 1,250.222 test positive as cases decline furtherOn a positive note, the daily cases dropped further to 222, keeping up with downward trend noticed since the curfew was enforced in the district on May 10.The number of daily active cases also fell below 4,000 for the first time in 45 days, with 3,916 patients still fighting the infection. Among them, 45 patients are on ventilator support. The fresh cases took the tally to 84,337, of which 78,419 patients have recovered.The three people who died on Monday included a 28-year-old woman from Sahnewal, a 65-year-old woman from Pratap Nagar and a 66-year-old man from Khanna.Even though the cases are declining, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma cautioned residents that there was no room for complacency and everyone must adhere to wearing masks and maintaining social distance at all times. “It is good news that the daily deaths have finally started to show a downturn, but so many people have died in the last one month. Times have been tough for all due to the restrictions and struggle to get admission in hospitals,” he said.Black fungus claims another lifeMucormycosis (black fungus) claimed one more life in the district during the last 24 hours, taking the total casualties in the district to nine. But, no fresh case was reported on Tuesday. The deceased was from another district and was undergoing treatment at a city hospital.As many as 78 black fungus cases have been reported in the district till now, of which 33 are from Ludhiana. Out of the nine fatalities, two belonged to Ludhiana and the remaining were from other districts and states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-covid-toll-crosses-2-000-even-as-daily-death-count-drops-to-three-101622575260967.html

The officials said the factory owner and officials evaded excise duty by allowing two trucks laden with country-made liquor on one gate pass and receipt. They said the SIT had charge-sheeted nine people, including the authorities of the factory, in connection with the two FIRs lodged in March earlier this year. They said the investigation about the involvement of at least seven more people, including the factory’s managing director Pranay Aneja, vice president Virendra Shankdhar, HR head Som Shekhar and sales head Ashwani Upadhyaya was still on. The officials suspected that it could be just the tip of the iceberg. The SIT detected such a large amount of excise duty evasion in just 11 months from one factory, as the records older than this period were not made available and it could not be ruled out that this practice had going on before this period too. It could also not be ruled out that similar practice of tax evasion was prevalent in other country-made liquor manufacturing units in the state, an official said. Superintendent of police (SP) of SIT, Dev Ranjan Verma said those charge-sheeted included eight people who were arrested at the time of search conducted by the local authorities at the factory on March 4, 2021, on the complaint of major anomalies while one person was arrested later by the SIT. He said the investigation was handed over to the SIT on March 6 this year. He said the accused charge-sheeted were the factory’s unit head Govind Rao, bottling in-charge Hari Shankar Tewari, ETP operator Mange Ram Tyagi, assistant manager quality control Sanjay Sharma, chemist Arvind Kumar, barcode dispatcher Pradeep Kumar, transporter Jai Bhagwan, truck driver Gulsher and attendant Ashok Kumar. Another senior SIT official said the SIT investigation revealed that the factory authorities used to prepare duplicate bar code and QR code slips and used one gate pass and receipt for allowing two liquor-laden trucks from the factory. He said the excise department had fixes some time limit for the transporters for transportation of liquor consignment from the factory to the licensed godown meant for it in different districts. He stated that the transporter was allowed 24 hours’ time for transportation of liquor consignment to the godown within 300 kilometres, 48 hours for 500 km and four days for 1000 km. “In connivance with the factory authorities, the transporter used to make two trips in the same time period and deliver extra liquor consignments to the godown and the godown authorities used to sell it in the market with help of their preferred license shop owners,” he said, adding, “The first trip was not registered at the factory while the second trip was registered.” He explained the first trip was registered at the factory only when they were afraid of getting caught by the government authorities. He said one truck contained 1500 cartoons of liquor bottles and one cartoon contained 45 bottles. He said the investigation revealed that factory authorities allowed supply of at least 99 trucks causing loss of ₹35 crore to the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sit-exposes-evasion-of-35-cr-excise-duty-by-country-liquor-factory-101622575199749.html

The high court acted on the plea of Manimajra resident Bhupender Beniwal, who had sought directions to the PGIMER to operate upon his nephew Saksham Bishnoi, a kidney patient. He had claimed that in case the surgical intervention is not done, he would face acute kidney infection, which in all probability would result in kidney damage. This is apparently the first of its kind incident reported during the Covid-19 outbreak, wherein a family approached court seeking directions for treatment.The court was told that Saksham, 22, had developed the problem in April and the PGIMER fixed the date for surgery on April 26. However, he tested positive for Covid-19 and the surgery could not be conducted. After completion of the quarantine period, the patient was taken to the PGIMER again in May, but the hospital “arbitrarily” refused to conduct the operation, citing Covid-19 restrictions, the court was told. The petitioner added that earlier the surgery date was fixed by the hospital noting Saksham’s critical condition, and Covid restrictions were already in place even then. Now that he has recovered fully, he would require the surgical intervention as has already been opined by the treating surgeon, the Manimajra resident pleaded.The PGIMER had told court that certain protocols are to be followed before conducting the surgery, and in case the patient comes to the emergency, he would be examined and assessment for his admission for surgery would be conducted.The court while fixing the matter for Wednesday for hearing told the PGIMER that if the patient tests negative for Covid-19, the surgery be slated as soon as possible. “It is a sanguine hope that every attempt would be made to save the petitioner’s nephew from any harassment,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/denied-surgery-patient-drags-pgimer-to-court-101622575021454.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Four key lessons from second wave in Chandigarh||The uptick in the infection numbers, which had started in the second week of March and transformed into a deadly second wave, caught the authorities off guard resulting in a crisis in the city.With limited resources available in government hospitals, the system trembled under the burden of widespread infections, amid influx of patients from the National Capital Region and neighbouring states. The experts, however, say it is time to look for loopholes in the system and fix them to deal with any urgency in the future.Ventilator-supported intensive care unitsThe pandemic raged on in the first 15 days of May, leaving critical Covid-19 patients scrambling for intensive care beds in city hospitals. Even though the number of ICUs were doubled in the last one and a half months, the arrangements were not able to cater to the increased demand.There were instances of patients dying while waiting for ventilators.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said, “Despite being able to more than double the number of beds from the first wave, we were still left wanting. Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 (GMCH-32), and GMSH-16, besides Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), will be adding more ventilator beds. We are preparing GMCH-32 to convert at least 50 more ICU beds.”Testing in government facilitiesFailing to expand testing facilities in government institutions even till early March, the UT administration roped in private laboratories to meet the target set by the Union health ministry. The UT administration had asked PGIMER and GMCH-32 to expand testing, but the capacity could not be stretched beyond processing 950 samples a day.With cases seeing a major rise in early April and more samples being collected for RT-PCR test, the turnaround period for reports also increased to 48 hours. Underlining the importance of prompt testing, Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and school of public health at PGIMER, said, “If diagnosis is delayed, infection spreads. It takes just 6 hours to conduct the RT PCR test and my impression is that there are inadequate machines and workforce in the city. The testing capacity should be increased to reduce time from sample taking to availability reports which inturn will help better management of the pandemic.”It was only after two months that authorities on May 24 announced that daily testing levels at GMCH-32 had been increased to 700 per day, from 400. PGIMER announced that they were presently testing 1,200 samples, which had now increased to 1,500 per day.Coordination among government agenciesAmid the peak of second wave on May 8, a war of words had broken out between the Chandigarh administration and PGIMER after UT had directed a private refilling plant in Dera Bassi not to fill cylinders from PGIMER from the UT’s quota.Though UT had later allowed PGIMER to partake in some of its oxygen share, the incident had opened the Pandora’s box. Though the administration always wanted PGIMER to convert more beds for Covid-19 patients, the premier institute has not been keen for the same, suggesting that being a tertiary care institute non-Covid service cannot be closed even though non-emergency surgeries and OPDs have been shut.UT had also written to the Union health ministry seeking directions for PGIMER to put additional resources at disposal to deal with the pandemic. Administration at PGIMER is of the opinion that load should be proportionally divided among all the health facilities. “Situations like this require command and control centres in which representatives from every department and hospitals are present and they take decisions in real time,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar.Inconsistency in policies in tricity areaEven though the tricity area is de facto a single urban complex, the three administrations have struggled to formulate a uniform policy on Covid management, with varied night curfew timings, lockdown restrictions and failure to assist each other.It was only after the intervention of the Punjab and Haryana high court that three the administrations were forced into action to set up a unified command centre. Also, when the cases were hovering between 400 to 600 in the second week of April, UT had imposed night curfew. However when the daily infection numbers reached around 850, the restrictions were withdrawn. Later, the administration had to come up with stricter restrictions of allowing only essential services in the city.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Decisions are taken keeping in view all worst-case scenarios. In some areas, restrictions can be common, but similar policies in the three administrative units are not always necessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-key-lessons-from-second-wave-in-chandigarh-101622575020291.html

The targeted ATMs belong to the same private bank. The software in the machines was not upgraded, investigating officers said.Two of the hackers, who are suspected to be part of a gang that carried out a similar operation in Faridabad of the Delhi/NCR region two months ago, were caught on a security camera installed near the hacked ATMs in Kolkata.“We are in touch with the Faridabad police,” said Murlidhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime). “Account holders have not lost anything. The loss was incurred by the company which loads money in these machines,” Sharma added.Kolkata Police started the probe when the bank lodged complaints saying three ATM were hacked between May 14 and 22 and ₹39.6 lakh were stolen in several instalments.While investigating the case, police found that none of the machines located in the New Market, Jadavpur and Cossipore police station areas was forcibly broken. The probe showed that more machines located in Beniapukur, Behala, Phoolbagan and Bowbazar were also hacked during the same period and the quantum of money stolen stood at around ₹2 crore.The hackers, apparently, took around 15 minutes to hack into the system in each ATM. They made the machines dispense cash by connecting to the bank’s server using a device that was is said to be attached to cables in the ATM, said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/atm-hackers-in-kolkata-steal-around-rs-2-cr-more-machines-detected-101622574729877.html

The government machinery is inert. The internal pushes and pulls are badly showing on the governance in UP,” Akhilesh said in a statement referring to the high-level internal meetings in the BJP over UP.Akhilesh had been frequently attacking the BJP and its government in the state as there have been high-level meetings in Delhi recently and then in Lucknow over election preparations by the BJP and possibilities of changes in the party and its government.“People are distressed over treatment, medicines and oxygen supply amid the pandemic. The situation in the party and government is reduced to such a state that after four years in power, they are compelled to do meetings for striking synchronicity between the organisation and the government,” he said.The SP chief added: “The only objective of these meetings and involvement of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh is how to grab power in the state again. The Covid pandemic crisis is far from over, but the ruling dispensation is obsessed and restive for political power.”Akhilesh said the ruling party was spinning false success stories to camouflage their failures. “While the BJP government failed in the first and the second wave of the pandemic, it is claiming to have made arrangements for tackling the possible third wave. People died due to lack of oxygen, medicines and there’s negligence in the treatment of black fungus cases,” he added.“The government has not been able to provide essential injections for the treatment of black fungus. After one and a half years of the pandemic, the government has woken up to get scientific research done,” said Akhilesh.Akhilesh said the government built castles in the air by an announcement that all will be vaccinated by Diwali while the reality is that the rate of vaccination in UP is less than 2%. “In UP, 98% of those who got their first jabs have not received their second dose. How will people be protected against the third wave without vaccination and the second dose,” asked Akhilesh and added that now there are talks that UP would decide to give a cocktail of vaccines because of lack of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tugofwar-within-bjp-reflecting-poorly-on-governance-akhilesh-101622574961430.html
02-06-2021||Other||GDP contracts by 7.3%: All eyes on size of UP’s economy now||Lucknow: All eyes will now be set on provisional estimates about the size of the state’s economy to be released in coming weeks, amid the state government’s claims that Uttar Pradesh’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) is estimated to reach 19,40,527 crore in 2020-2021. The Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in the fiscal year 2020-21, according to the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics released by the National Statistical Office on May 31. The state government had made the projections about the growth in the size of GSDP in the budget analysis presented in the state assembly along with the budget for 2021-2022 on February 22 this year. The state government had estimated that the GSDP would reach up to ₹1791263 crore in 2020-2021. Its revised estimates, however, projected the GSDP to reach ₹19,40,527 crore during the period. “Advance estimates of state’s income as released by the UP’s State Planning Institute’s Economics and Statistics Division in March 2021 have indicated the state’s economy has been adversely impacted by Covid-19. It shows estimated contraction of 6.4 per cent in the GSDP in 2020-2021. This contraction in GSDP comes after a low growth of 3.8 per cent in 2019-2020. Under such a situation the targeted size of GSDP for 2021-2022 put at ₹21,73,390 crore appears to be highly ambitious in view of the damage inflicted on state’s economy by the second wave of Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2021-2022,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, department of economics, Lucknow University. However, a final picture about the size of GSDP in 2020-2021 will be available when provisional estimates are out in the next few weeks. The state government may have to mobilise additional resources as the projected contraction in GSDP is bound to have an adverse impact on the state government’s goal of making the state a trillion dollar economy in five years (2020-2025). “What is more worrisome is the fact that the state’s manufacturing sector has consecutively witnessed negative growth rate of -3.5 per cent (2019-2020) and -5.4 per cent (2020-2021). Agriculture sector is the only bright spot which witnessed a healthy growth of 6.2 per cent in 2020-2021. This clearly indicates that the state government faces a tough challenge of saving lives along with livelihood in the coming months,” said Tyagi. As the state government may need additional funds to complete various development projects before UP goes into poll mode (by end of 2021) for 2022 assembly elections, its task of mobilizing additional resources would become even more challenging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gdp-contracts-by-7-3-all-eyes-on-size-of-up-s-economy-now-101622574960823.html

Registrations will open on the traffic police website within this week. To apply, people need to upload their senior citizen card or Aadhaar details besides the vehicle registration certificate. The sticker will be given only to those who have the vehicle registered under their name and drive it themselves. “We will hand deliver the stickers to the houses of the seniors if needed,” said Goel. Welcoming the move, RK Garg, president, Second Innings Association, said: “These stickers will allow seniors to drive more comfortably. People will keep a check on honking and speeding around us, and in case of an accident more people will be willing to stop and help the injured senior.”However, Garg said instead of asking seniors to register, the traffic police can access the data from Sampark Centres and coordinate with the local beat cops. “Special lanes for seniors or allowing seniors with these stickers the right of way at turns and rotaries can also be considered,” he said. “This is a welcome move,” said Kamaljeet Singh Soi, member, National Road Safety Council. “Now, the traffic police should focus on educating drivers on how to behave around senior citizens on roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senior-citizens-to-get-special-stickers-for-vehicles-in-chandigarh-101622574960310.html
02-06-2021||Chandigarh||Citizens forced to turn to private vax facilities in Chandigarh tricity||With the tricity authorities struggling to procure Covid-19 vaccine for the young age group, the citizens are forced to head towards private facilities to get jabbed. However, the shot comes at a price, anywhere between ₹850 and ₹1,500, unlike free vaccine available at government centres. In Chandigarh, all slots for the 18-44 years age group at government centres are filled till June 4, and the fresh supply of 36,000 doses expected in the first week has been delayed till at least June 10. Panchkula, too, is facing an acute shortage, with the number of doses being administered daily falling significantly. In Mohali, the administration is vaccinating only a few priority groups among the younger population.While private hospitals in Mohali launched vaccination for this age group in early May, even Cloudnine Hospital in Panchkula opened the drive three days back while private facilities in Chandigarh followed suit on Tuesday. These private facilities are buying the vaccine directly from manufacturers. While Covishield is procured for ₹600 per dose, Covaxin costs ₹1,200. However, the citizens have to shelve an extra amount due to service and other charges involved. For example, Fortis Hospital, Mohali, is offering Covaxin for ₹1,250 and Covishield for ₹850. Max Medcentre, Mohali, and Cloudnine Hospitals in Chandigarh and Panchkula are offering Covishield for ₹900. A dose of Covaxin costs the corporates ₹1,350 and other individuals ₹1,500 at Aasharkiran Fertility World in Kharar. In Chandigarh, Global Health Care Centre and Bedi Hospital are offering a dose of Covishield for ₹900. “We are procuring Covishield directly from the manufacturer for ₹600, and with all the services, logistics and wages involved, the cost raises up to ₹900,” said Dr Sanjiv Bhatia of Global Health Care Centre, Sector 21. “This is not a proper system to be followed for distribution. It has caused inconvenience to people, and inequality in distribution, causing a disturbance in an orderly system running successfully for a long time,” said Dr RS Bedi, owner of Bedi Hospital, Sector 33.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/citizens-forced-to-turn-to-private-vax-facilities-in-chandigarh-tricity-101622574480461.html

The union claimed that while officials check identity cards of commuters to ensure they are from essential sectors, miscreants continue to easily board the trains or loiter on platforms. On Sunday, Patil, the mother of three, died after falling off between Kalwa and Mumbra from a moving local train, when a 31-year-old man, Faisal Shaikh, tried to snatch her mobile phone. Patil had recently joined work after six months of maternity leave. Lata Argade, the secretary of Central Suburban Railway Commuters’ Association, alleged that she has repeatedly sent photos of miscreants boarding women compartments but no action has been taken. Argade said that the union will meet railway officials on Wednesday. “We’ll submit a letter seeking compensation for the family. We also want action against the railway officials on duty for allowing the accused on the train. We have being complaining about peddlers and thieves continuously. However no attention is given to the issue, even as common citizens are held for travelling without reason.” Her relative Kamlakar Patil said that if the government has allowed only essential workers on trains, how are thieves travelling without any fear. “Officials claimed that the thief is a habitual offender. So why aren’t such people stopped from entering the station.” “The family’s financial situation is very dire. Her husband is an electrician and had faced crisis during the lockdown. So Vidya decided to join work immediately after her maternity leave was over. Her mother-in-law was also unwell, so Vidya took care of her medical bills. Her loss is too big for them and they will need compensation,” said Kamlakar Patil. A senior railway officer said, “We are looking into the issue and getting details of the officials who were present at that time. The GRP (Government Railway Police) have already arrested the accused within 24 hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unions-blame-security-lapses-by-railway-officials-for-thane-commuter-s-death-101622574181470.html

Even on April 20, nine deaths were recorded, after which the number consistently remained in double digits, peaking at 38 on May 5.While the number of daily cases has seen a steep drop after the peak of 2,612 on May 10, pointing to a receding second wave, the death count has kept mounting and was recorded at 19 on Monday.May proved to be the deadliest month, with 373 patients succumbing in Mohali, 275 in Chandigarh and 142 in Panchkula, which accounted for more than a third of the total death toll in these three jurisdictions since the outbreak last March.However, on the first day of June, Chandigarh recorded five casualties, followed by four in Mohali. In Panchkula, there was no death reported after 10 days. In terms of cases, Mohali recorded 197, followed by 108 in Chandigarh and 94 in Panchkula.With more people being cured and discharged than those testing positive, the cumulative active case load of the tricity dropped to 4,774 from 5,482 the previous day and the peak of 24,201 on May 12. While daily positivity rate, which remained around 20-25% during the peak of second wave, was recorded below 8% across the tricity, even recovery rate jumped above 94% in the three jurisdictions. Case fatality rate stands at 1.4% in Mohali, followed by 1.3% in Chandigarh and 1.2% in Panchkula.‘Need to wait for 2-3 weeks’“We expect that the downward trend in deaths to continue,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, Chandigarh health department. “The number of Covid-19 patients requiring intensive care treatment is also decreasing. As the pressure on health facilities will ease, focused care will be available to patients, which will decrease fatalities.” Meanwhile, Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, said we will have to wait for another two to three weeks to see the number of deaths drop to the levels seen before the second wave. “We witnessed a huge surge in cases in the early part of May, and many patients who tested positive then are still undergoing treatment. Even though the infection numbers are decreasing and even the occupancy of oxygen beds has decreased, the pressure on the ventilator beds is still there,” he said.‘Time to remain vigilant’Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said: “The situation is a little better, but not completely under control as yet. We need to continue to be vigilant. Regular strategic sampling will be ensured for timely case detection and isolation. Adding infrastructure and strengthening of systems to deal with severe cases will also be taken up.”“The numbers are coming down but now individuals have be to very careful and follow safety protocols. Those who have not got vaccinated should get it on priority. As the numbers are coming down, restrictions would be lifted; so we need to ensure strict compliance,” said Adarsh Pal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-deaths-drop-below-10-after-6-weeks-in-chandigarh-tricity-101622574180980.html

Mumbai, Thane and Palghar are expected to see thunderstorm development along with lightning, rain and gusty winds of up to 40kmph, IMD officials said. Light showers scattered across Mumbai and Navi Mumbai on Tuesday evening, though the morning was both dry and sunny, despite official forecasts predicting light to moderate rains. As per BMC’s monitoring stations, Vikhroli Fire station received 23mm of rain between 8pm and 9pm while Kurla recorded 15mm and Goregaon 13mm.While IMD had placed Mumbai under a green category severe weather alert on Monday, it was upgraded to yellow category by Tuesday evening. Light to moderate rains are expected to continue till the weekend, with the entire state subject to dynamic and changing weather conditions, an IMD spokesperson said.IMD on Tuesday also released the second stage long range forecast (LRF) for the southwest monsoon, which is expected to hit Kerala on Thursday and arrive in Mumbai around June 11. “India will receive normal to above normal rainfall which will be spatially well-distributed over the country during the upcoming southwest monsoon season,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD’s director general, on Tuesday.

02-06-2021||Other||Tagged by BNHS on Mumbai coast, bird sighted in China||A curlew sandpiper (a medium-sized wader bird native to Russia’s Arctic tundra), which was tagged by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in Navi Mumbai over two years ago, was seen again over 4,500km away, in China’s Tianjin province last month. The bird was seen in the Tangu Saltpans on May 7, marking the first international re-sighting of a bird tagged on the Mumbai coast, BNHS officials said.The bird was captured and tagged at the TS Chanakya wetland near Palm Beach Road in Nerul on March 18, 2019, and was subsequently resighted on January 12, 2020, at the Bhandup pumping station.Curlew sandpipers tagged by BNHS, as part of various studies to learn more about birds migratory routes, have earlier been resighted around the city.During the current migratory season, birds tagged by BNHS at different locations in India have been resighted across the world. For instance, a Terek sandpiper tagged in the Gulf of Kutch, Gujarat, was resighted in Jandola, Pakistan, last month. A Northern Shoveler tagged at Odisha’s Chilika Lake in February 2018 was resighted by birders in Uzbekistan in April, while a broad-billed sandpiper tagged in Tamil Nadu in October 2019 was spotted in Hong Kong in April. A similar resighting of an Indian skimmer tagged in Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, in June 2019 was in Bangladesh this January.“An isolated resighting does not tell us much because the tags are not like radio collars which allow us to track the journey of the bird. But it is still extremely exciting because of how rarely it happens. Taken together, resightings provide important insights about the political boundaries that birds may cross, and the potential hurdles they face on their often long migratory routes,” said Dr Bivash Panday, director, BNHS.Each year, an estimated 50 billion birds undertake such migrations across the world, and their preferred routes, the timing of travel and the ecology of migration is surrounded by intrigue. The bird ringing-recapture/resighting method is a commonly used method to study this process, and involves banding a bird with a light-weight metal ring (with a unique alpha-numeric code). When enough data through this method is collected, it allows for scientists to discern the migratory ‘flyways’ of these birds.Bird-ringing studies were first initiated by the BNHS in India in 1927, while large-scale studies relying on this method first began in 1959. They were also carried out extensively at Point Calimere in Tamil Nadu, Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan, Harike Lake in Punjab, and Chilika Lake in Odisha among other places during the 80s and 90s, and have been monitored for resightings since decades. Along the Mumbai coast, such exercises have been carried out intensively for about seven years now.In Mumbai alone, since 2018, about 10,000 birds belonging to 36 species have been ringed (or colour flagged). Resighting and recapture records of these marked birds, experts said, have provided valuable insights into their migratory routes, site fidelity and turnover rates. “This information would be useful for proposing species specific conservation actions in future,” BNHS said in a statement on Tuesday.As part of other studies, various species including gulls, terns, shorebirds and flamingos ringed in Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, eastern Asia and along the islands in the Indian Ocean have been recorded along the coast of Maharashtra. “Remarkably, these birds show high fidelity to their traditional feeding and roosting sites as it is evident from their frequent resightings at these wetlands in the same as well as subsequent migratory seasons. This signifies the importance of these habitats and the urgent need for their conservation,” BNHS’ statement concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tagged-by-bnhs-on-mumbai-coast-bird-sighted-in-china-101622574059689.html
02-06-2021||Other||Rate caps for private hospitals in Maharashtra to continue till Aug 31||The state government, while extending its order of the capped rates for private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment till August 31, has also reduced the charges for smaller cities and village-tehsil level hospitals. All the municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, except Vasai Virar, Bhiwandi, Nagpur and Pune, have been classified as A-class areas, while districts such as Nashik, Amravati, Bhiwandi, Nanded, Kolhapur and Sangli have been classified as B-class areas. The remaining rural regions are in C-category. While the charges for the routine isolation range from ₹4,000, ₹3,000 and ₹2,400 per day for A, B and C category areas, respectively, it is ₹7,500, ₹5,500 and ₹4,500 for ICU without ventilators. For the treatment in ICU with ventilators, the rates are ₹9,000, ₹6,700 and ₹5,400 for the hospitals. The rates include monitoring, investigations such as CBC, serum creatinine, urine routine, X-ray, ECG, nursing and bed charges. The state government had fixed the rates during the first wave of the pandemic last year after it received complaints of exorbitant charges levied by private hospitals. The rates have been fixed for the 80% beds in private hospitals, acquired by the government, for Covid-19 patients. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that there was a demand from people in villages and smaller cities to not keep the rates on par with that in cities like Mumbai. “Hospitals in villages, tehsil and district places have started treating Covid-19 patients. It would not have been appropriate to keep universal rates across the state. People in rural Maharashtra will get respite after the decision,” he said. “The cities and areas have been classified on the basis of benchmarks applied by insurance companies and for giving allowances. Until now, the rates were uniform for the entire state. Health and finance department have been getting requests for the reduction in the rates for the hospitals in rural areas. The hospitals are required to charge according to pre-audited bills. Hospitals violating the norms will face action after flying squads review the bills,” a statement issued by chief minister’s office said. However, the hospitals will be free to levy charges for PPE kits, high-end investigations and drugs and Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rate-caps-for-private-hospitals-in-maharashtra-to-continue-till-aug-31-101622573999634.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Day 1 of reopening of non-essential shops sees confusion||On the first day of reopening of non-essential shops in the city, confusion mounted over which shops, with respect to the side of the road, were allowed to open. In several areas like Dadar, Worli, Borivli and Dahisar, shops on both sides were opened. However, they were later forced to shut. The shopkeepers also demanded scrapping of the alternate-day rule by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and demanded flexible timings for opening of shops, citing the time slot of 7am to 2pm as not feasible and that e-commerce websites are benefitting the most. Also, the relaxations also led to traffic snarls, especially along the Sion-Panvel highway, near the Vashi toll naka on Tuesday, which were further complicated by nakabandis conducted by the Mumbai Police at Mankhurd.With Covid-19 cases on a steady decline, the Mumbai civic body had on Monday allowed non-essential shops to function between 7am to 2pm on alternate days from Monday to Friday for the next 15 days, even as shops selling essential items are now allowed to remain open all days between 7am to 2pm. According to the BMC’s circular, starting the first week, shops on the right side will be allowed open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Shops on the left side will be allowed open on Tuesday and Thursday. This rule will be applicable on a rotational basis and the local wards are expected to issue a list of roads, specifying the left and right sides. However, after the coronavirus-enforced curbs were relaxed from Tuesday, there was a mixed response. The city’s 24 wards started issuing circulars, specifying the left and right sides in all areas, only by afternoon, resulting in confusion on day one.Viren Shah, from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, said, “In many areas, non-essential shops were opened, but police came and asked them to shut. The orders are issued late at night and the message does not reach everyone. Even shopkeepers are confused as to what is to be considered left and right.” Shah added, “Additionally, we have also appealed to the state government to revise the timings from 7am to 2 pm to say 10am to 5pm. We are also asking BMC to allow reopening of shops all day, considering once we open shops, we have to pay salaries to employees, rent to landlords.”Paras Bamboli, Chembur Merchant’s Association, said, “In Chembur also, there is confusion among shopkeepers. If we stand towards Kurla, my shop is on the left and if I stand towards Govandi, my shop falls on the right side. Hence, the BMC should ensure they specifically mention what is left and right.” Further, although non-essential shops have been allowed to remain open, saloon, beauty parlour, gymnasiums, restaurant and bars have to remain shut until further orders, civic officials said.Meanwhile, Javed Juneja , Congress corporator from Nagapada, said, “There is confusion among shopkeepers on which side has to remain open on which day, considering it is the first day today. The same thing happened last year, and we hope starting tomorrow, this confusion might be solved.” Another Congress leader and former MP from South Mumbai, Milind Deora said, “I spoke to Maharashtra chief secretary and BMC commissioner about allowing Mumbai’s non-essential shops to open Monday-Friday from 11am-6pm. BMC can review weekends later. Mumbai’s retail sector is devastated — 300,000 non-essential shops impact the livelihoods of 1.5 mlllion families.”About the traffic snarls, Bhanu Khatawkar, senior inspector of the Vashi traffic unit, said, “The number of vehicles on the highway was more than usual on Tuesday, due to the lockdown relaxation. The Mumbai Police also conducted nakabadis at Mankhurd to check the vehicles entering their jurisdiction. The Vashi area saw traffic jams between 9.30am to 1pm. We deployed more officers to manage the traffic.” Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “Navi Mumbai has a positivity rate of 3%, hence we have allowed the limited relaxation of the norms, under Break the Chain order of the state government. The residents have to ensure that all the improvement in the situation does not go waste and that through responsible behaviour of the shopkeepers and the customers, the situation only improves further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-day-1-of-reopening-of-non-essential-shops-sees-confusion-101622573939638.html

The meeting was held at the NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier in south Mumbai on Tuesday evening. He made the observations as leaders organised no protest against rising inflation, fuel prices etc. “Petrol prices crossed the ₹100-mark recently, but state leaders made no attempt to organize any agitation against it,” said Pawar, according to an NCP leader. In the meeting, it was decided to set up a task force to explore alternatives against amendment in the Banking Regulation Act 1949, which according to the NCP, will end the cooperative banking system. Comprising ministers from all three parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – the task force will be headed by state cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil. “Pawar saheb directed us to see if the state government can bring its own law to stop its implementation or if it can challenge it in the court of law,” said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister. It was also decided to celebrate foundation day of the party, following all lockdown restrictions, on June 10. “The NCP chief, state president Jayant Patil and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will virtually address party workers after hoisting the NCP flag at the party office,” Malik told reporters. The party has further decided to postpone its elections. Its membership drive will be launched on June 10 which will be concluded on December 12. Pawar to speak with Poonawalla The NCP chief is likely to intervene to resolve the issue of vaccine shortage in Maharashtra. He is likely to speak with Serum Institute of India (SII) chairman Cyrus Poonawalla or its CEO Adar Poonawalla. “Pawar saheb agreed to speak to SII after party ministers insisted he intervene, as the state needs vaccine doses to cover the 18-45 age group,” the NCP spokesperson said. “Cyrus Poonawalla was classmate of the NCP chief in college, which is why we requested his intervention and he agreed,” said another NCP minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pawar-boost-ncp-presence-on-ground-101622573880306.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||State yet to take call on quota in job promotion||The state government could not take a decision on reservation in promotion, in a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee, due to legal constraints – pending writ petition in the Bombay high court (HC) and negative opinion of the law department. After a high-voltage drama over the scrapped quota in promotion in government jobs last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a high-level meeting of ministers on Tuesday to decide the course of action. The cabinet sub-committee decided to defer its decision till hearing on the writ petition is completed in the HC on June 21. Ministers said that an amicable solution will be arrived at soon. Energy minister and senior Congress leader Nitin Raut said the state government was positive about reservation and a decision would be taken soon. “We have discussed all aspects related to the quota and have decided to wait till the HC verdict. The Congress is firm on its stand of reservation in promotion. The issue is complex, with legal and administrative difficulties, but we are taking legal advice to restore the reservation,” he said. The HC in August 2017 quashed the 33% reservation in promotion given to employees from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Class in 2004. The Maharashtra government, which moved an appeal in the Supreme Court on May 7, announced implementation of the court’s decision and scrapped the reservation. Till then, the state government had been promoting its employees by keeping 33% quota reserved for classified categories. The Congress had expressed its displeasure and threatened to take extreme steps if the reservation was not restored immediately. According to state officials, the law and judiciary department has given its opinion in favour of scrapping the quota. “The high court has scrapped the reservation in promotion and its implementation is mandatory. The SC, too, has not said anything on implementation of the quota, although the petition is still pending in the top court. The law and judiciary department has already given its opinion on two earlier occasions,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-yet-to-take-call-on-quota-in-job-promotion-101622573820248.html

Senior police officers attributed the peak in April during the second wave to the overall spread of the infection and the police’s exposure to the public. There are a significant number of personnel who contracted the virus while they were on leave, an officer said. Another senior officer said that the fatalities could be attributed to the high comorbidities or other illnesses among the personnel. “Every month, on an average, 50 police personnel died of various illnesses and diseases. Cops suffering from a serious disease are the most vulnerable to the infection. During treatment, the cops cannot be vaccinated,” the officer said. Officers from the state police headquarters said that the present strength of the force is 154,039 (excluding 45,000 of Mumbai Police). As many as 138,992 personnel have been given the first vaccine dose, while 104,799 cops have received both the jabs. Mumbai Police have vaccinated 38,113 (90.96%) with the first vaccine dose, while 28,884 (68.90%) have got both the doses. “Due to vaccination, the number of serious cases is very low,” said a senior police officer from Mumbai Police. According to the state police 20 of its personnel have died due to Covid this year despite taking both doses of the vaccine. All unit commanders have been asked to aggressively pursue vaccination of the staff and ensure strict implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour in the force, said a senior police officer. 200 Arthur Rd inmates get the jab A non-profit organisation, Project Mumbai, started the vaccination drive for Arthur Road jail inmates above 40 years from Tuesday. On the first day itself, 200 inmates and a few staff members of got their first dose. Project Mumbai’s CEO and founder Shishir Joshi said, “We had a team of two doctors and three nurses, apart from a cardiac emergency ambulance, and beds reserved at Kasturba hospital in case of any complications after vaccination,” said Joshi. They are awaiting BMC’s permission to vaccinate inmates from 18 years. “All the inmates stay together. So it is essential to vaccinate the younger prisoners also,” said Joshi. Project Mumbai also donated four oxygen concentrators for inmates.(Inputs from Megha Sood)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/47-cops-died-of-covid-19-in-maharashtra-in-may-101622573819625.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Car used for Hiran’s murder brought by cop Sunil Mane: Mumbai Police chief in dismissal order||Former Mumbai crime branch inspector Sunil Dharma Mane, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, has been dismissed summarily from service. Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Tuesday issued the order of Mane’s dismissal under Article 311(2) (B) of the Constitution without holding a disciplinary inquiry.The police said that based on the findings of NIA’s probe about Mane’s role in the serious case, his dismissal procedure was initiated.The dismissal order (of which HT has a copy) stated that Mane borrowed a Volkswagen car from his friend which was used for Hiran’s abduction and murder. “Mane had collected mobile phones and SIM cards from main accused API (assistant police inspector) Sachin Vaze and used it for impersonation and abduction of Hiran. Importantly, Mane also called Hiran using a fictitious name ‘Mr. Tawde, police inspector from Kandivli,’ and called him out of his house and took him to the spot where he was killed (sic),” the commissioner’s order read.The order further stated that when Mane’s house was searched, NIA found incriminating documents, while the agency seized photocopies of four vehicle registration documents, photocopies of three agreements and three bank passbooks from a firm related to him at Goregaon (West).Mane’s disclosure statement has also pointed out the places in and around Thane and Palghar areas, which were relevant to the crime being investigated by NIA.It has also been revealed in the probe that in order to camouflage his identity on the day of Hiran’s murder, Mane had handed over his mobile phone and bag to a witness and asked the latter to deposit them at his residence, so as to mislead the investigation agency.“Mane allegedly abused his official position and instead of upholding the law, misused his position to commit serious crimes, becoming a part of conspiracy, destruction of evidence etc., having propensity to seriously jeopardise law and order in the state. He was fully aware of duties and responsibilities assigned to him as police officer and was duty bound for keeping utmost integrity and its strict enforcement and compliance,” Nagrale observed in the order. The police chief also observed that Mane’s conduct is more like a seasoned criminal rather than a police officer and he shows the very grave delinquency, which is enough to justify his dismissal.On February 25, a Scorpio car was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to the industrialist. A case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day. Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and had reported it stolen on February 17. On March 5, Hiran was found dead at a Mumbra creek. It was later discovered that Vaze had borrowed Hiran’s car in November and returned it in February. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was named the main accused. He was arrested by NIA on March 13. On March 24, the agency began probing the murder too, and Vaze was again named the main accused. After finding serving policemen allegedly involved in the heinous crime, the Maharashtra government, in order to contain the damage, transferred the then commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged poor management of the case. Singh subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Singh approached the courts after no action was taken against Deshmukh. The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, the Central agency registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 24. Mane, a 1995-batch Maharashtra Police service officer, was in charge of Mumbai crime branch’s unit 11 till he was recently shunted out to the local arms division as a part of the clean-up drive undertaken by Nagrale, after Vaze was arrested by NIA in both the cases. According to NIA sources, Mane, who was arrested by the central agency on April 23, was purportedly part of the conspiracy hatched to eliminate Hiran. He was present at crime intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden Scorpio near Antilia. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after the 48-year-trader refused to take the blame and get arrested in the case.Beside Mane and Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi and former constable Vinayak Shinde, who is serving life imprisonment in a fake encounter killing, have also been dismissed from service last month after their arrests by NIA. A cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor is also among those arrested. All the accused are in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/car-used-for-hiran-s-murder-brought-by-cop-sunil-mane-mumbai-police-chief-in-dismissal-order-101622573759717.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||CSMT revamp: Adani, Godrej among nine shortlisted bidders||Adani Railways Transport, Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty are among the nine shortlisted bidders for redevelopment of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The Indian Railways Stations Development Corporation (ISRDC) will be undertaking the redevelopment of CSMT at a cost of ₹1,642 crore. The redevelopment of the terminus is likely to start from December 2021 and is expected to be completed by 2025. The other shortlisted bidders are Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd, ISQ Asia Infrastructure, GMR Enterprises Private Limited, Moribus Holdings Private Limited, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings Limited and BIF IV Infrastructure Holding. CSMT will be redeveloped through a public private partnership (PPP) model. The redevelopment plan will involve construction of commercial spaces, including restaurants and cafes, along with vehicular parking, for passengers inside the terminus. ISRDC had earlier called for Request For Qualification (RFQ) in August 2020 and 10 developers had shown interest. The body will now invite the Request for Proposal (RFP) from the shortlisted developers. The proposal will include construction and development work plan. After evaluation, the redevelopment project will then be awarded to a developer. “Nine firms have qualified for the RFQ stage. CSMT station redevelopment is one of our most ambitious projects and we are committed to transform the station into a state-of-the-art transport hub” said SK Lohia, managing director and CEO, IRSDC. Segregation of outstation and local train passenger movements with interconnecting decks has also been planned. Shifting of harbour railway platforms to PD’Mello entrance of the terminus will be undertaken as part of the redevelopment. ISRDC has also planned an underpass for passengers near the present pre-paid taxi stand near the divisional railway manager’s (DRM) office at CSMT. This will be done by dismantling railway buildings that comprise the main reservation office and railway offices adjacent to DRM office. Additional holding area for passengers will be created at the PD’Mello Road entrance, along with the current main entrance for the outstation terminus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/csmt-revamp-adani-godrej-among-nine-shortlisted-bidders-101622573760329.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC extends Hany Babu’s stay at Breach Candy Hospital till June 3||The Bombay high court (HC) has extended the hospital stay of Delhi University associate professor and Elgar Parishad accused Hany Babu till June 3. The HC was hearing a petition by Babu’s wife Jenny Roweena seeking bail for her husband on health grounds or shifting him to a private hospital to treat an eye infection. Babu was shifted to Breach Candy Hospital as per a May 27 HC order for treating his eye infection along with Covid and the hospital had been asked to submit his health report till June 1. After Babu’s counsel informed the court that his condition had improved, the court extended his stay and adjourned the hearing to June 3, due to paucity of time.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Abhay Ahuja while hearing Roweena’s petition was informed by advocate Yug Choudhry that as per the information available Babu’s condition was much better but he was not aware of the eye infection as the medical report by the hospital was not made available to Babu’s family or lawyer.On May 19, the bench had been informed that though Babu had been complaining of swelling in his left eye to the Taloja jail authorities since May 3, it was not heeded and hence the petition seeking bail for Babu on medical grounds or shifting him to a hospital was filed. Choudhry had informed the court that there was an apprehension that Babu may lose vision if the infection was not treated and there was also a possibility of it being a case of black fungus or mucormycosis. Choudhry submitted that as GT Hospital did not have the facility to treat the infection, Babu should be shifted to a Breach Candy Hospital.Though the state and National Investigation Agency (NIA) had opposed the request, the bench directed that Babu be shifted to Breach Candy for treatment of the eye infection and Covid provided Babu’s family paid for the treatment. On May 27, the court extended his stay to June 1 and asked the hospital to submit a report on Babu’s health and eye infection.On Tuesday, the state informed the bench that the hospital had submitted the report directly to the court.After hearing the submissions, due to paucity of time, the court directed the hospital not to discharge Babu till the medical report was seen by the court and posted the hearing of the petition to June 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-extends-hany-babu-s-stay-at-breach-candy-hospital-till-june-3-101622573699609.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||North civic body sells, leases out property to pay dues to staff||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that it has begun selling or leasing out 37 high value properties under its jurisdiction to generate revenue to clear the salaries of its employees.North body commissioner Sanjay Goel told a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh that the civic body has already leased out Novelty Cinema for ₹37 crore and another commercial place at Karampura for ₹7 crore, last month.“By October or November, the procedure of leasing out or outright sale of nine properties will be completed. We are expecting revenue of ₹700-800 crore from it,” Goel told the court.The high court had on Monday warned the North MCD that it will start attaching the civic body’s properties, pointing out that the employees and retired staff cannot wait endlessly for salaries and pensions.The commissioner of the civic body informed the court that currently, there are 57,000 employees in the corporation.The court noted that besides salaries, the corporation has other mandatory responsibilities which also require funds, and for which it should augment its resources to generate more revenue.It noted that 96% of the corporation’s revenue goes into paying salaries and thereafter, it needs funds for other works, including stopping the spread of epidemic, control dengue and perform desilting of drains. “Ensure maintenance of the city as this is one of the foremost priorities and for that you need to augment resources,” the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, through advocate Ranjit Sharma, seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the North MCD for not paying pension of retired staff despite judicial orders.The bench asked the civic body to make an endeavour to comply with the judicial orders to clear arrears of salaries and pension, saying it is not acceptable that a poor employee is not paid dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/north-mcd-begins-selling-leasing-property-to-pay-staff-101622573639580.html
02-06-2021||Other||Olympian Sushil Kumar’s gun licence to be suspended permanently||New Delhi The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they have suspended the firearms licence given to two-time Olympic medallist and world champion wrestler Sushil Kumar, who has been arrested in connection with the murder of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankad. Police said they have also initiated the process to cancel the licence permanently.The firearm, for which licence was issued to Kumar in 2012, has already been seized by the crime branch team investigating Dhankad’s murder case. Police officers privy to the investigation said they have already arrested nine people, including Kumar, in the case so far.“We have suspended the arms licence of the arrested wrestler, Sushil Kumar, as he was booked in a criminal case. The process for cancellation of his licence has been initiated. He has been served a notice, seeking his explanation on why the cancellation of licence should not be done,” said joint commissioner of police (licencing) OP Mishra.A senior police officer privy to the development said that the notice was served to Kumar on Monday and further action would be taken as per his reply, for which he has been given 15-20 days. The procedure for suspension of Kumar’s arms licence was initiated after the Model Town police station, where Dhankad’s murder case was registered, and the crime branch submitted their reports to the licencing unit, informing about the murder case he was arrested in and the seizure of his licenced gun. A request was made in both the reports to cancel Kumar’s gun licence, the officer said.“Taking the reports into consideration and the fact that Kumar was arrested in a criminal case, we suspended his arms licence and initiated the procedure for its cancellation,” added joint CP Mishra.Kumar is presently in the crime branch’s custody and will be produced before a Delhi court on Wednesday, when his four-day police custody ends. The investigation team is likely to seek further extension of Kumar’s custody to recover his mobile phone and clothes that he was wearing at the time of the crime.On Monday, the crime branch team took Kumar and Bakkarwala to Haridwar to identify the places where he stayed while absconding in the case and to recover his mobile phone and the clothes he was wearing at the time of the crime. However, the recoveries could not be made.The police are still looking for four more suspects who are wanted in Dhankad’s murder case.Advocate Pradeep Rana, who is representing Sushil Kumar, said, “The suspension of Sushil’s arm’s license is not in accordance with the law and there is no cause of action for Delhi Police to act in such hasty and unconstitutional manner and the same is in stark violation of natural justice and right to be heard. The involvement of the said weapon in the alleged incident is a matter of trial but prima facie there were no alleged gun shot injuries. Therefore, it is apparent that the investigating agency is acting in a malafide manner and trying to malign the image of a two- time Olympic medalist. It is incorrect that Sushil has not cooperated with the investigation agency. He is a law abiding citizen and he has duly cooperated with the investigating agency. However, since the investigation agency has failed to justify considerable period of police custody of 10 days, they are making these false claims just to cover up the lacuna in investigation.”Kumar was arrested along with his associate, Ajay Bakkarwala, on May 23, from outer Delhi’s Mundka, 19 days after the duo and at least 11 others allegedly thrashed Dhankad and his friend Sonu Mahal with sticks and other blunt objects at Chhatrasal Stadium. Dhankad later succumbed to his injuries, prompting the police to register a murder case and look out for the suspects involved in the crime.A video footage purportedly showing Kumar and others assaulting Dhankad was allegedly found on the cellphone of Kumar’s associate, Prince, who was the first to be arrested in the case. Prince had allegedly told the interrogators that it was Kumar who had asked him to shoot the assault video as he wanted to circulate it in the wrestling circle and also among his rivals to prove his dominance, the officer cited above said.The case was initially investigated by the northwest district’s Model Town police station’s team and later transferred to the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/olympian-sushil-kumar-s-gun-licence-to-be-suspended-permanently-101622573580833.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||With Class 12 exams cancelled, varsities to discuss ways to tweak undergraduate admission process||With the government announcing the cancellation of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) class 12 examinations on Tuesday, higher educational institutions in the national capital will discuss and formalise changes, if any, that will be needed in the process of admission to undergraduate courses, in view of the change in the assessment pattern.While Jamia Millia Islamia conducts entrance tests for its undergraduate courses, Delhi University and Ambedkar University have a merit-based admission process, whereby students are admitted on the basis of class 12 marks and the cut-offs set, also on the basis of the class 12 results. In Jawaharlal Nehru University, admissions to undergraduate language courses happen through entrance tests and interviews.The cancellation of class 12 board exams also leaves open the possibility of conducting the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admissions to 63 colleges of Delhi University. Last December, the Union ministry of education had formed a committee to look into the modalities of a common entrance test for undergraduate courses at all central universities, in accordance with the National Education Policy, 2020. The committee has submitted its report and universities are currently waiting for the ministry’s response on it.Acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi, who is a member of the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) committee, said the university will now wait for the CBSE criteria for compiling class 12 results. “Since there will be no exams, CBSE would be evaluating students through well-defined criteria. We will discuss the matter with our admissions committee and academic council, if needed, and decide on how to proceed. The university too has to adjust to the situation. Safety of our students is most important.”Last year, DU started the online admission process on June 20 and announced the first cut-off on October 10 while classes started in November, disrupting the entire academic cycle. Generally, the university declares cut-offs around four to six weeks after the CBSE results and that of several state boards are out.Manoj Sinha, secretary of DU Principal Association (DUPA) and principal of Aryabhatta College, said the admission process will become “complex”. “Some sort of screening should be there to make the process fair. Otherwise, when students are evaluated on the basis of internal marks, the line between deserving and non-deserving candidates can get blurred.”Anu Singh Lather, vice-chancellor of Ambedkar University, said, “We were waiting for a decision on the board exams to decide on our admission process. As far as CBSE’s alternative assessment options are concerned, we don’t feel it will lead to much of a difference in results. CBSE has adopted a continuous evaluation process in its schools; so internal marks will not vary much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-class-12-exams-cancelled-varsities-to-discuss-ways-to-tweak-undergraduate-admission-process-101622573580212.html
02-06-2021||Other||20%-45% of Mumbai’s population infected in second wave of Covid-19: Mathematical model||The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has so far affected 20%-45% of Mumbai’s population, according to an estimate by a mathematician from Middlesex University, London. A significant part of these infections could be reinfections, suggested the model by Murad Banaji, senior lecturer in mathematics, department of design engineering and maths at the university, who has been studying the epidemic in Mumbai. Banaji has used Monte Carlo simulation – a mathematical technique used to estimate possible outcomes of an uncertain event in multiple scenarios. The model by Banaji takes into account that the second wave in Mumbai began on February 15. Between February 15 and May 21, around 380,000 new cases were added to the city’s tally.“A broad estimate is that between 20%-45% of the city’s population have so far been infected during the current wave. The estimates assume that there will be around 4,000 recorded deaths associated with infections acquired during this surge so far,” said Banaji. “Cases have not increased much in the last week. Daily fatalities have come down, so second wave recorded fatalities could end up at less than 4,000 – we’ll have to wait and see. But the broad conclusions should still hold,” he added. The surge in infections in the slums suggests that a significant percentage of infections in the slums during this wave could have been reinfections, Banaji said. “It would be great to have more clarity - hopefully the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation will eventually share data on cases where the same individuals tested positive more than once. Of course, because of very limited testing in the slums during the first wave, case-data may not shed much light on reinfections. But it would likely still prove valuable,” he added. Sandeep Juneja, dean of the school of technology and computer science at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, who has also been running simulation models to understand the transmission of Covid-19, said, “Our own estimates are on the lower side. More of the order of 12-18% population got newly infected during the second wave. Although we need information on reinfections to be more certain. Also, it may well be that the current strain leads to a larger proportion of population being symptomatic and hence a larger proportion getting tested and getting detected. This is plausible but we lack the research to confirm this. Given that most infections are in non-slums, one in any case expects a higher detection rate. A higher detection rate would imply a lower percentage of the population affected in the calculations by Banaji.” While Banaji’s estimation suggests a significant number of reinfections, Juneja said it was difficult to project reinfection cases. “We need a different method to arrive at reinfection numbers. For example, seeing what percentage of the population tested positive this time while they had tested positive in the last wave as well,” said Juneja.Rahul Pandit, a city-based pulmonologist and part of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, said, “We are seeing some reinfections but not significant. Most cases are new ones. Mathematical models are based on various assumptions. So they may be accurate only when these assumptions are true.”“We know that prior infection and partial vaccination are likely to reduce severe disease. After an earlier Covid infection or single dose vaccination, people may still get infected and even transmit the disease – but they are less likely to fall severely ill, be hospitalised, and die. When we look at cases during this wave, it is clear that there were a significant number of infections in the slums; but reports have not described a surge in hospitalisations from the slums. This could be because a large number of the infections were reinfections - this would be consistent with serosurvey data which indicates high levels of infection in the slums by the end of 2020,” Banaji said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2045-of-mumbai-s-population-infected-in-second-wave-of-covid-19-mathematical-model-101622573579632.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||Students, teachers welcome end of uncertainty; CM says ‘big relief’||Students, teachers and parents on Tuesday welcomed the government’s decision to cancel the CBSE Class 12 board exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and demanded that the board should now come up with an “objective” criteria to evaluate students.The Centre on Tuesday cancelled CBSE Class 12 exams after discussions at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it is a “big relief” that the Class 12 board exams have been cancelled. “I am glad 12th exams have been cancelled. All of us were very worried about the health of our children. A big relief,” Kejriwal tweeted.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who had said that exams must not be conducted without vaccinating all students and teachers, tweeted, “I am happy that the never-ending Class 12 for 1.5 crore students of the country will finally end.”Darshan Pal, a Class 12 student at Bluebells School International, said that the exam cancellation brought “big relief” to him and his parents. “My parents were anxious and worried about my safety. The decision is in the wider interest of students and it would prevent turning schools into Covid hotspots. However, the CBSE should formulate a criterion that is suitable for all students. Considering classes 9 to 12 while for assessment would not be fair since the subjects we studied in classes 9 and 10 were very different from what we opted in classes 11 and 12. CBSE should give more importance to Class 12 internals only,” he said.Pratham Agarwal, 18, a Class 12 student who has got admission to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and has to submit his Class 12 results by August 1, said, “I am really happy with the decision to cancel the exams. The board now should speed up the assessment process and give us our results at the earliest.”Parents also welcomed the decision. Aprajita Gautam, whose daughter was going to appear for Class 12 boards this year, said parents were not in favour of children going for their exams. “We recently lost family members to Covid-19 and all of us were infected with Covid-19. My child could not have appeared for her papers in such a scenario. Every house has been affected and parents are scared and the decision will bring them some comfort.”Principals said that schools are now waiting for directions from the board on the compilation of results. Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School in Saket, said, “Parents have been calling us asking questions over college admissions. Those students who were going to pursue their higher education in other countries are also relieved because the results are expected to come out sooner than it would have if exams had taken place.”Vishnu Karthik, CEO, The Heritage Schools, said the decision brought clarity for both students and parents. “The challenge now is for CBSE to arrive at alternative criteria to determine Class 12 marks. Any delay or any confusion on the new grading criteria will lead to more confusion and stress among students. Clear directions should also be provided to universities to modify their admissions criteria to ensure fair play.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-12-exams-students-teachers-parents-welcome-cancellation-101622573519639.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||Exam cancellation leads to debate on scoring method||Following the cancellation of CBSE Class 12 board exams this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, stakeholders including school principals and education experts have suggested that scores in internal exams of Class 12 or the performance of the students in Class 11 and Class 10 board exams may be considered to devise an alternative assessment method.After a high-level review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government on Tuesday announced that Class 12 board exams will not be held this year and CBSE will compile the results as per a well-defined objective criteria that will be announced later.Like last year, the government has also directed the national board to provide an option for students to take the exams if they wish to do so but only when the situation becomes conducive.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the board can consider internal scores of classes 10 to 12 and Class 10 board exam marks for assessing Class 12 results. “These exams were conducted under the supervision of CBSE. They should trust their systems. Equal weightage should be given to all the components so that students are not left to the mercy of any one exam. An entrance test, to be conducted twice a year, should also be introduced for Class 12 students seeking admission to higher educational institutions,” she said.While experts suggested a combination of scores, principals across the capital said that including Class 11 results in the mix will not be helpful due to several reasons, including strict marking, online learning, and the “lax attitude of students” during Class 11.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales, Pusa Road, said, “Using Class 11 scores may not be very helpful. Generally, students in Class 11 engage in multiple extra-curricular activities to de-stress after appearing for their Class 10 boards and tend to focus more on those activities than academics,” she said.She added that the board will have to consider varying factors while coming up with the objective criteria for deciding Class 12 results. “Some schools may have already conducted Class 12 pre-board exams while other might not have been able to. In some cases, the exams or practicals may have been conducted online. Taking all these variations into account, the board can come up with a system of averages, predicted scores or percentile for assessment and allot marks,” Wattal said.Principals also said that considering only Class 12 pre-boards is not a suitable option as students tend to perform better in board exams than school pre-boards.Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said, “Many high-performing students focus more on their competitive exams during that period and only study for their final board exams later. These students could be at a disadvantage if we only look at Class 12 pre-boards. Similarly, considering only test scores of classes 10 to 12 will not be enough. The board could introduce a ’teachers’ recommendation’ criteria in the grading system as teachers know about each child.”Several government schools in the national capital said they were relieved over the cancellation of exams, and added that they were now waiting for CBSE’s directions on the matter. There are around 1,030 government schools in Delhi and all of them are affiliated to CBSE.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Sector-8 Rohini, said the board should only consider internal scores of Class 12 and board exam results of Class 10.“Teachers tend to do tight marking in Class 11 so that students prepare better for their Class 12 boards. So we cannot take Class 11 results into account while compiling Class 12 results. However, the board should give around 20-30% weightage to Class 10 board exams. The remaining can be divided between the pre-board and other internal exams of Class 12. The board should also introduce a moderation policy for schools so that the marking is standardised, similar to the one they introduced this year for Class 10 board results,” Jha added.According to an official press release, the Prime Minister said that the decision on Class 12 CBSE Exams has been taken in the interest of students. He stated that Covid-19 has affected the academic calendar and the issue of board exams has been causing immense anxiety among students, parents and teachers, which must be put to an end.PM said that the Covid situation is a dynamic situation across the country. While the number of cases are decreasing in the country and some states are managing the situation through effective micro-containment, some states have still opted for a lockdown, the release said.Students, parents and teachers are naturally worried about the health of the students in such a situation. The Prime Minister said that students should not be forced to appear for exams in such a stressful situation, the official release stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-12-exams-cancellation-leads-to-debate-over-assessment-method-101622573460232.html

You initially started the vaccination of 45-60. And now you have introduced (the vaccine) for the 18 years when there is actually no vaccine available... Why did you announce vaccination for them? Why did you have to make... wrong declaration?” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked.Emphasising on the need to invest in the future, the court said, “We have to invest in the future. Our future is the people who are 18, below 18, and above 18; the youth of this country and we are sidetracking them. We want to vaccinate people who are 60, 70, 80, 90. We are prioritising them when this wave has shown that it is the younger people who have suffered so badly.“… There are so many young bright people who have lost their lives. We have to actually protect the future. The younger lot which is the future is to be saved. We are on our way out. I don’t understand the policy at all,” the court remarked.The Supreme Court on Monday also questioned the Centre’s vaccine policy, saying the government needs to “smell the coffee” and modify its policy that requires states to pay more for Covid-19 vaccines.It also asked the Union government to ensure that the marginalised and rural population are not left out of the vaccination drive due to India’s digital divide.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, told the Supreme Court that the entire eligible population of the country would be vaccinated by the year-end.According to the HT dashboard, India had administered over 215 million coronavirus vaccine doses by Monday.During the day, 1,223,596 beneficiaries of the 18-45 age group received their first dose and 13,402 beneficiaries of the same age group received their second dose.Cumulatively, 20,210,889 persons across 37 states/UTs have received their first dose and 23,491 have received their second dose since the start of Phase-3 of the vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-pulls-up-centre-over-vaccines-for-18-45-yrs-group-101622573459584.html

The police have also suspended his arms licence and served a notice, asking him to surrender his firearm.“He was initially investigated for hoarding and black marketing of the medical supplies. But with victims coming forward, we are probing him for cheating and overcharging,” said a police officer with knowledge of the matter. The police have recorded the statements of the 17 buyers and are investigating allegations of cheating against the accused, the officer said, asking not to be named.The officer said that last month, the police sent at least four concentrators that Kalra allegedly sold at prices much higher than MRP to the Shriram Institute for Industrial Research. The institute confirmed that the output of the oxygen concentrator was below 30%. The police have attached the report from the institute with comments from experts that the output should have been at least 90%. More test results are awaited.Kalra, through his lawyers in court, denied allegations of cheating and said the concentrators were donated to Covid care centres too. He also informed the court that he had no intention of cheating and paid taxes for getting the concentrators. He also said that he submitted the invoices to the investigating officer.When contacted, Kalra’s counsel, Vineet Malhotra, said: “All the allegations raised by police are false.”Kalra, who is out on bail since May 29, has been directed by the court not to contact any person to whom he had sold the concentrator.Arms licence suspendedMeanwhile, the police have also suspended the arms licence of Kalra and served him a notice asking him to surrender his firearm, officials aware of the matter said.The licensing department of the city police has also initiated the process for cancellation of his gun licence. Confirming this, OP Mishra, joint commissioner of police (licensing), said: “We have suspended the arms licence as he (Kalra) was booked in a criminal case. The process for cancellation has been initiated. He has been served a notice seeking an explanation why it should not be cancelled permanently.”A senior police officer aware of the matter said the notice was served to Kalra on Monday and further action would be taken as per his reply. Kalra was issued an arms licence in 1998.Last month, the Delhi Police recovered at least 524 oxygen concentrators from Kalra’s three restaurants and from the office of a private company, Matrix Cellular, in Chhatarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-probing-cheating-allegations-against-businessman-navneet-kalra-101622573404677.html

The incident took place in village Gogawan Jalalpur under Babri police station of Shamli on Monday, police said. Superintendent of Police (SP), Shamli, Sukirti Madhav said a case of murder had been registered against the accused Murli, 45, who is absconding. “Raids are being conducted and the accused would be arrested soon,” the police official said. Police said Murli (goes by one name) had demanded salad for dinner on Monday. His wife Sudesh, 42, was busy in some work and the delay in serving salad led to an altercation between the couple after which Murli attacked his wife and 20-year-old son with a hoe and ran away, the police said. Hearing screams neighbours rushed to their house and alerted the police. Sudesh and her son were taken to the hospital where Sudesh was declared dead. Doctors said her son’s condition is critical.

02-06-2021||Delhi||SC stays HC order to cancel IGST on O2 devices as gifts||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a Delhi high court decision quashing a government notification to levy integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on the oxygen concentrators imported as gifts for personal use.The finance ministry approached the apex court challenging the May 21 order of the Delhi high court, pointing out that the decision was an entrenchment on a policy issue lying within the domain of the executive.Attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the Centre, told the court that on May 28, at the 43rd meeting of the GST Council, a decision was taken to constitute a Group of Ministers (GoM) to scrutinise the need for “further relief to Covid-19-related individual items immediately”, and its report will be submitted by June 8.The bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah issued a notice on the Centre’s plea, and stayed the Delhi high court order, stating: “Arguable questions are raised.” The matter was adjourned for four weeks.The high court order came on a petition filed by Gurcharan Singh, an 85-year-old who was infected with Covid-19 this April. His nephew, living in the US, sent him an oxygen concentrator as a gift, but it was subjected to IGST chargeable at 28% for personal use. In the wake of assisting import of Covid-19 medical devices, on May 1, the Union finance ministry issued a fresh notification bringing down the tax levy to 12% on the import of oxygen concentrators for personal use. This notification was challenged by Singh in a writ petition before the high court.The high court noted that this was a “rare petition” where a tax statute was challenged for being violative of a citizen’s fundamental right to life under Article 21. The petitioner claimed that, by a separate notification issued on May 3, the government gave a GST waiver till June 30 for oxygen concentrators imported by state governments or via any entity, relief agency, or statutory body authorised by the state government, even as those imported as gifts for personal use were charged at 12%. Even concentrators imported for commercial purposes were taxed 12%.A division bench of the high court struck down the May 1 notification, and said, “The courts and the state have to adopt a humanistic approach, which, in our view, is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. The failure to do so both, by the court and by the State, would lead to an unbridgeable chasm between law and justice, resulting in, disruption of social order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scstays-hc-order-to-cancel-igst-on-oxygen-concentrators-imported-for-personal-use-101622573403240.html

He added that efforts must be made to demobilise private hospitals requisitioned by the state government.Jai Ram said the strategy for testing, tracing and treatment along with effective surveillance should remain intact as the crisis is not over yet.He said that the health department should take effective steps to provide oxygen facilities in all hospitals having 50 or more beds.He said that proper inventory of oxygen cylinders and storage should be ensured. He added that about 11,000 people are still in home isolation, thus, it is vital to contact them to regularly monitor their health parameters.He said that it is impossible and illogical to continue the restrictions and the state may consider easing curbs in the Covid curfew if the dip in new cases continues.Chief secretary Anil Khachi said it is the need of the hour to ensure that all stakeholders be more vigilant and keep an eye on people with ILI symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gear-up-to-tackle-third-wave-of-covid-jai-ram-101622573402554.html

With the government allowing a maximum period of four months to register a sale after paying the stamp duty, buyers have not flocked to the registration office to conclude their deals. Many of the deals registered in May have been those that were concluded in the previous months when the stamp duty was lower,” he said.Anand Gupta, chairman, Builders Association of India (housing and Rera committee) blamed the negative sentiments for this slowdown. “The real estate sector works on sentiments and the second wave has significantly dampened the sentiments of the homebuyers. The whole economic activity has come to a standstill and buying a house is now a last priority for citizens,” said Gupta.The sector has been facing slowdown from several years and the pandemic has only made the situation worse.Last August, the government announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on the sale of properties to 2% from September 1 to December 31, 2020, and then reduced it further to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move had played a huge role in boosting the sales of both primary and secondary market. The state, however, refused to extend the cut despite several requests.Manju Yagnik, vice-chairperson of a leading realty company, Nahar Group, demanded that the stamp duty cut be reintroduced. “The present lockdown situation has slowed down the demand and affected the sales of new properties. The state government should introduce stamp duty cuts to bring back the momentum and help the realty sector to tide over the crisis,” said Yagnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/compared-to-april-realty-bookings-in-mumbai-down-47-in-may-101622573339638.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||Soon, restaurants can serve alcohol in open spaces||With the Delhi government notifying amendments to existing excise rules, restaurants and pubs in the city can soon serve liquor in open spaces, such as terrace, balcony, etc, inside their premises and can also have live music arrangements, such as performing bands, DJs, karaoke, etc, without hassle.The amendments – notified on Monday – also allow microbreweries in the city to start takeaway service for draught beer, serve in events and sell directly to restaurants and pubs.A senior government official clarified that this notification was meant to notify the changes made to the Delhi excise rules and the date of implementation of these rules will be notified separately.“The licensee may serve any Indian liquor or foreign liquor at any area within the premises of the restaurant, including open spaces viz. terrace/balcony/lower area of restaurant (same applies to hotels and pubs), if any, specified and endorsed on its licence subject to the condition that the liquor serving area shall be screened off from public view,” said the notification, a copy of which HT has seen.It further said, “Provided that the licensees holding license for consumption ‘on’ the premises may be permitted, subject to such terms and conditions as may be imposed by deputy commissioner by general or specific order, to play any type of entertainment/performance including music and musical instruments, dancing, or singing by professionals or DJ, live bands, and karaoke on its premises.”“The new notification would bring clarity... Earlier in the absence of these rules, civic agencies often used to impose their own regulations on restaurants and pubs,” said Manpreet Singh, a Delhi-based restaurateur and treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) which has more than 5,000 members across the country.The notification of the new amendments to the excise rules further said, “Microbrewery shall be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants… Draught beer shall be allowed to be taken away in bottles or ‘growlers’. However, wherever draught beer is being served as a take away, clear signage and information will be need (needed) to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly.”Pratekk Chaturvedi, COO of BrewDog India, said the initiative will help promote microbreweries in Delhi. “So far, breweries in Delhi had to operate in suboptimal capacity in the off-months (winters) because sales drop, but they got no relaxation in fees levied by the government. Now that microbreweries have been allowed to sell to restaurants and pubs and serve at events, it is expected to bring relief. Also, the provision for allowing breweries to start take-away service can be a major game-changer,” he saidDelhi currently has two functional microbreweries (Ministry of Beer and Connaught Club House). Five more have licenses and are likely to start functioning soon, said an excise department official.Some more provisions under the new excise policy – such as reducing legal drinking age from 25 to 21, gatekeeping, age gating of clients, reducing number of dry days to three in a year, and allowing restaurants and clubs to stay open till 3 am (from 1 am currently) – will need amendments to the Delhi Excise Act and have to be tabled in the Delhi assembly, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/soon-restaurants-and-pubs-in-delhi-to-serve-liquor-in-open-spaces-101622573340221.html

Our children who used to have many social interactions are now at home, they are unable to go to school or meet their friends. When the outside world has been a place for our children to fulfil their dreams, they have been made to sit at home because of this pandemic. In such a time, when children have been home for 1.5 years, parents have been facing new challenges in how to deal with situations at home.”“A nation which can pull off parenting in a progressive manner, especially in times of crisis and beyond, will emerge holistically successful. In India, approaches to parenting are still very archaic. Our ways of parenting need to change, we need to adopt approaches that will deal with the challenges of our current times,” he said.The webinar was attended by over 10,000 parents on various social media platforms. Sisodia said that parents should involve children in activities to ease out undue stress caused by the pandemic. “Considering our children have been home for a long period of time, we can see they have been going through some changes emotionally, mentally and physically. Children are more upset, they are irritable and there is no balance or equilibrium... In such times, we as parents need to be more understanding. In fact, mindfulness practices in Happiness Classes organised by Delhi government have played a big role in easing the mental stresses in our children and parents alike,” he said.Experts on children’s mental health, Dr Shelja Sen and Dr Amit Sen also participated in the webinar and gave suggestions on parenting in times of crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/adopt-progressive-parenting-methods-sisodia-to-parents-101622573281979.html

Dr Anil Nausran, is another cycling enthusiast who has decided to take a 376 kilometers ride to Rishikesh and Dehradun via Muzaffarnagar, Roorkee and back. “I will start on Wednesday evening and return next day,” he said. Both Dr Nausran and Pratap do cycling for physical and mental fitness. Pratap said cycling has helped him keep an effective control on his diabetes. “I believe that cycling can cure many illnesses and therefore it should be adopted by people,” he said. Dr Nausran has undertaken cycling expeditions to Kolkata, Mumbai, Ayodhya and other locations in past 3 years. “Cycling before sunrise increases ‘happy hormones’ in the body and eventually it helps in keeping illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and depression in check,” he said. These cycling enthusiasts have called upon the people to make cycling a part of their daily activities. Rashid (goes by one name) who participated in state level cycling championships, now runs one of the leading cycle stores in the city. His store Evancy Enterprise has cycles ranging from ₹7000 to ₹3.5 lakhs. “People are now more aware about their fitness therefore they are adopting cycling to keep themselves fit,” he said.

The airline began vaccinating its pilots for Covid-19 from May 15. “Factoring in the government policy, we request the partisans who made vaccination for the flying crew possible to extend the privilege of vaccinating the dependent family members of the flying crew. Limiting vaccination against Covid-19 only to employees is not going to help the process,” a letter by the pilots, dated June 1, read. Air India had lost five of its pilots to Covid-19 last month. The pilots in the letter said that they fear infecting their family members on returning home after operating the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights. “With this backdrop, we need support from the company to keep performing our duties and keep our families safe,” the letter concluded. “Pilots are getting quarantined, contracting the virus and succumbing to Covid-19 at an alarming frequency. Even their family members are suffering and dying of this deadly virus,” said a pilot.

We can also provide ration to workers,” said Khan.Welfare board officials didn’t comment on the matter.The proposals can be discussed and passed only once the board meets. Thaneshwar Adigaur, member of the board and secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, said they want the board to hold a meeting in this regard soon.Among the other proposals raised by board members are starting facilities for Covid-19 testing and vaccination, and providing protective gear such as masks, sanitisers, etc.Shweta Raj, a member of the board, said,: “Vaccination of migrant workers should be done on priority basis.”Some industrial areas have already set up or made arrangements for testing, with the help of district administrations.

02-06-2021||Mumbai||How did some wards wave down Covid-19 in Mumbai? Civic body to study pattern||Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a few civic wards in the city have recorded fewer Covid-19 cases compared to others, keeping the numbers low even during the second wave. Anticipating a third wave post September, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to conduct an epidemiological study of these wards. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, wards A (Fort), B (Dongri) and C (Kalbadevi) have been recording the lowest growth rate. On April 7, these three wards had fewer than seven cases each. On the same day, G-South (Elphinstone) ward followed by D (Nana Chowk), E (Byculla) and K-West (Andheri West) ward recorded 78, 59, 46 and 43 Covid-19 patients, respectively. The ward-wise difference is visible in the data shared by the BMC. For instance, till May 30, B ward recorded a total of 3,796 cases, the lowest in the city. It is followed by C and A wards, with 6,624 and 15,463 cases, respectively. On the other hand, K-W (Andheri West) has recorded 51,432 cases, the highest in the city. Similarly, R-Central (Borivali) and K-East (Andheri East) have registered 48,293 and 43,861 cases so far. The BMC plans to study the trend. Several educational institutions like Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and the University of Mumbai have tied up with the civic body for the study. “All the wards have implemented the same Covid-19 containment procedures and uniform policies. Despite this, some wards have recorded 10 times more cases. So, it is essential to study and understand the reasons behind it, which may help if we face a possible third wave in the near future,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. At present, the average seven-day growth rate of Mumbai stands at 0.15%. R-N ward that covers Kandivli has the highest growth rate (0.28%). A senior officer explained that the number of cases varied drastically between south Mumbai and suburban wards due to the variation in population. Citing an example, the officer said, for instance, B ward has a population of 1.5 lakh, while R-C has 6 lakh. “The infection rate is directly proportional to the size of the population. Wards with more people will have more infected patients, but this needs to be studied. As the cases have dipped, we can spend time on research to understand the epidemiological characteristics of the virus spread,” said the officer. Last year, the BMC conducted a sero-prevalence study in Mumbai in association with Niti Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). As per officials, the study will include topics such as ward-wise tests, ratio of contact tracing per patients, isolation of high-risk contacts, among others. “This is the first time we are conducting such a study,” said Kakani. Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state Covid-19 task force said, “The infection rate varies from place to place. There is a need for a study to understand the reason behind it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-did-some-wards-wave-down-covid-19-in-mumbai-civic-body-to-study-pattern-101622573220762.html
02-06-2021||Delhi||Another weather record: Coolest day in June ever||A dust storm and late-night rain brought Delhi’s minimum temperature on Tuesday down to 17.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest ever recorded in June, ensuring that the city continued the trend of breaking some historical weather record every month since August 2020.According to IMD data, the previous lowest minimum temperature recorded in Delhi in June was 18 degrees Celsius on June 17, 2006.HT reported last week that the Capital was on a weather barrier-breaking streak for at least the last nine months.In August 2020, the city recorded 236.5mm rainfall, the highest for the month since 2013. In September, it recorded the warmest month in almost two decades.The Capital’s average maximum temperature that month was 36.2 degrees Celsius, breaking the previous record of 36.1 degrees Celsius in 2015. The last time Delhi recorded higher average maximum temperature in September was in 2001, when the mercury soared to 36.3 degrees Celsius.In October, the city broke a 58-year-old record by clocking a mean minimum temperature of just 17.2 degrees Celsius. In November, it broke an even older record, with the month’s mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, a level last seen in 1949.In December, the city witnessed eight “cold wave” days, the highest since 1965, while January recorded the highest number of cold wave days since 2008 (at seven days) and also broke the record for the highest rainfall for the month in 21 years (56.6mm).Then, there was sudden change. February was the second warmest in 120 years, with the mean maximum temperature in the month touching 27.9 degrees Celsius, falling marginally short of the all-time record of 29.7 degrees Celsius in 2006. March recorded the hottest day in 76 years, with the mercury levels touching 40.1 degrees Celsius on March 29.After a sweltering February and March, the conditions changed again in April, and the lowest minimum temperature in at least a decade was recorded on April 4, at 11.7 degrees Celsius.In May, under the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, Delhi broke the record for the highest single-day rainfall for the month ever, with 119.3mm of precipitation on May 19-20.And now, a new record has been set on the first day of June.Early on Tuesday, between 1am and 2.30am, the Capital experienced moderate to heavy rain and gusty winds of 50-70 kmph, accompanied by thunder. As per IMD data, around 16mm of rainfall was recorded in the 24 hours beginning 8.30 am on Monday and 8.30 am Tuesday. Rainfall between 15 mm and 65 mm is considered “moderate”.Weather officials attributed the rain to “western disturbances and induced cyclonic circulations”.“Usually, pre-monsoon activities are triggered due to western disturbances and induced cyclonic circulations. These act as trigger mechanisms for the development of thunderclouds which further leads to pre-monsoon intense weather activities such as dust storms or thundershowers,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet weather services.Following the rain, the minimum temperature -- 17.9 degrees Celsius, as per the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered representative of Delhi -- was 10 degrees below “normal” for this time of the year, and nearly seven degrees below Monday’s 25 degrees Celsius.The maximum temperature was recorded at 33. 6 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below the normal temperature for this time of the year.Met officials and scientists said that while these extreme weather recordings are the immediate result of temporary atmospheric events in and around the Capital, the larger role of the climate crisis in the overall shifting of weather patterns is evident.“This time we have observed a relatively cooler summer. We are yet to record a heatwave, and according to our forecast, it is unlikely there will be any heatwave. Usually, in Delhi heatwave days are recorded till June 15, after which pre-monsoon activities start in this region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, the air quality improved on Tuesday on account of the rain, with Delhi recording an AQI of 115 (moderate) -- an improvement from Monday’s 135, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-records-another-weather-record-coolest-june-day-ever-101622573220211.html
02-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Sanitation worker electrocuted while cleaning road||Noida: A sanitation worker was allegedly electrocuted near an electric pole in Noida’s Sector 51 on Tuesday morning while cleaning the road. The worker was sent to a nearby hospital from where he was discharged in the evening after treatment, officials said.Locals said that the worker was electrocuted after coming in contact with a live wire which had snapped from the pole due to rains and winds late Monday night. “This is the first time that a person has been electrocuted in our area. In this case, a loosely hanged wire was touching the pole. However, all the poles are rusted with the bottom touching the ground directly and only a few have concrete base. The electricity department must look into this as the upcoming monsoon season may pose similar threats,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary, Sector 51 RWA.According to the electricity department, the cause of incident was a loose connection cable that has been fixed now. “The issue has been resolved. The incident happened as a loose cable was touching the pole. We will also look into if the incident accounts for compensation to the victim who is now out of danger,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL).The worker was an employee of a contractor working for the Noida authority. “This was the fault of electricity department. The contractor concerned will look after his treatment,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty, Noida Authority.The worker, who is yet to be identified, has been discharged from the hospital after treatment, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sanitation-worker-electrocuted-while-cleaning-road-101622573039574.html

02-06-2021||Noida||Pet dog raises alarm in nick of time, saves family in Greater Noida||A family in Greater Noida was saved from a fire in the nick of time thanks to their three-year-old dog Bravo.The incident happened on Sunday evening at a duplex villa in Greenwoods society in Omega 1.“I was irritated by Bravo’s constant barking and pounding at our bedroom door. When I opened to see what was wrong, I found the entire house was filled with smoke,” said the 38-year-old resident Shesh Sarangdhar who lives with his pregnant wife.The smoke was coming from their kitchen downstairs and found that their stove and woodwork were on fire.“There was so much smoke that I could not see anything. I started dousing the fire with some buckets of water,” said Sarangdhar who runs an IT company. “It was a narrow escape for us because if Bravo had not raised an alarm in the nick of time, the smoke would have crept into our rooms as well and hurt us in our sleep.”Bravo is an Indie dog who Sarangdhar had adopted in March.“We used to stay in Sector 119 where I used to feed the street dogs. In December, when we decided to moved here, we adopted four of them,” he said.“When we take a nap during the day, all four dogs like to snooze on the terrace. When the incident happened, only Bravo was awake and indoors,” said Shesh.He later got to know that his wife had left the stove with a pan full of oil before sleeping and forgot about it. That is how the kitchen caught fire.“We did not have to call the fire brigade as I was able to control the fire on my own,” said Shesh.Aparna Bose Dey, an adoption coordinator with NGO Dhyan Foundation that runs the animal shelter in Sector 94, said that the incident shows how alert and smart street dogs are.“In our society we often look down upon Indie street dogs but this heartfelt story shows how sensible and alert Indies are. Shesh is part of our animal lovers group on social media because of which we got to know about the incident. This story struck a chord with all animal lovers,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pet-dog-raises-alarm-in-nick-of-time-saves-family-in-greater-noida-101622572980304.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Global Covid-19 vaccine bids stuck in limbo||Even as the Maharashtra government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are scrutinising the responses they received for their respective global bids to purchase Covid-19 vaccine doses, state officials said they cannot proceed unless the Centre clarifies on dealing with intermediaries to procure vaccines. Both the state government and BMC are scrutinising documents, ascertaining links between the companies that have responded and the manufacturers. The BMC received two more proposals on Tuesday from bidders offering Indian vaccines, the last day set by the civic body to accept bids.The state government’s attempts to get foreign vaccines to boost its inoculation drive seem to have hit a roadblock. The application window for the state was closed on May 25, following which no extension was given, officials said. If the companies that have shown interest to supply vaccine doses are unable to establish connection with the manufacturing companies, it is curtains for the state’s tendering process. It will then primarily have to rely on stock from two Indian vaccine manufacturers, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.On Tuesday, BMC decided to close the application window for its global expression of interest it had floated for procuring 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses on May 12. The civic body added that it has got nine proposals to supply Covid-19 vaccines and will carry out a detailed scrutiny process in the next three days. Similarly, Maharashtra government, which got eight responses, is also seeking documents from the interested companies. Besides that, the state has also written to the Centre, seeking clarity on engaging with intermediaries. A senior bureaucrat said that so far, the government has not got any response from the Centre on the letter. “However, we have sought documents validating their (interested company’s) connection with the manufacturer. Pfizer and Moderna have said they have not appointed any agency. AstraZeneca cannot participate due to the tie up with Serum, Russian Direct Investment Fund has not responded to our letter seeking stock directly. Dr Reddy’ [Laboratories] can only supply, which again will be limited as it has to give 50% of its manufactured stock to the Central government, we will have to compete with other states for the remaining stock. This can be resolved to a large extent if the Centre formulates a policy and procures vaccines,” he said, requesting anonymity. Maharashtra government’s attempt to float global bids is also seen as political posturing with an aim to put the onus back on the Centre to provide vaccines. State health minister Rajesh Tope has already demanded a central policy on vaccine import as well as asked the Centre to procure doses and distribute among the states and Union territories. Despite repeated attempts, health minister Tope or chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who heads the state committee on global tenders, could not be reached for an official comment on the status of the tendering process.Meanwhile, the BMC received two proposals on Tuesday, taking the total tally of responses received to nine. Both the proposals received on Tuesday are from Indian suppliers, of which one has proposed to supply Sputnik and one has promised to supply any approved Covid vaccine. The other seven proposals, too, are for supplying Sputnik V and Sputnik Light.The BMC had floated the global bid on May 12 after which it gave extension on two dates of which the last one was on May 25. Post this, the BMC had announced receiving bids for supplying Russian Sputnik, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine. However, last week both Pfizer and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) in a joint statement with Dr Reddy’s denied giving authority to any other third party for selling, marketing or distributing its vaccine.On Tuesday, the BMC in a statement said, “Supply of Covid-19 preventive vaccine was earlier extended on 18 May 2021 and 25 May 2021. Proposals received by the deadline are now being scrutinised. This means that the expression of interest has not been extended. The scrutiny will take place as it is important to examine the business relationship between suppliers who are willing to supply vaccines and companies that actually produce vaccines.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, had last week told HT, “We will check the papers and validate the connection to manufacturers. If no proper connection is established, then we will not process further. We will check the shortlisted proposals through appropriate government channels.”Maharashtra administered 250,407 doses till 9 pm on Tuesday across 3,661 centres, according to the data on the CoWin portal. So far, the state has administered 22,848,402 doses since the vaccination drive commenced on January 16. The state has so far fully vaccinated 4,616,067 beneficiaries, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-global-covid-19-vaccine-bids-stuck-in-limbo-101622572979666.html

Police identified the suspect as Rajesh Mishra, who is from Ambedkar Nagar of Uttar Pradesh. He had previously guarded an ATM kiosk, they said. Sector 39 station house officer (SHO) Azad Singh Tomar said that a private company that refilled ATMs had filed a complaint on May 5 on the alleged tampering. “The company alleged that its two custodians – Vipendra Kumar and Suraj Singh – responsible for refilling ATMs, along with an accomplice Ayush tampered with the ATMs and stole ₹26 lakh,” he said. A case was registered against them under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Tomar said the three were soon arrested in connection with the case. “They revealed that the ATM security guard was also involved and that it was he who used to tamper with the machines. On Tuesday, we raided his residence in Salarpur village and arrested him,” he said. The police said they recovered ₹2.3 lakh and three debit cards from his possession.

The reason for the alleged murder-suicide is unknown, said police.The deaths were reported from their rented accommodation in Sorkha village. The man was a native of Firozabad district, while the woman was from Etawah and worked as a guard at a society. They had married about a year ago, said police. Additional commissioner of police (Gautam Budh Nagar) Love Kumar said that the body was discovered by the woman’s colleagues. “Her employer had tried reaching her over phone but she did not receive it. Her colleagues visited her home and found the two bodies. Then they informed police,” Kumar said. A countrymade gun was found at the spot, police said. Kumar said that, prima facie, it appeared that the man first shot the woman and then killed himself. “A police team and forensics experts have gathered evidence from the spot. We have informed their family and are investigating the matter,” he said. Police said that the couple had shifted to this rented accommodation last month. Deputy commissioner of police (Gautma Budh Nagar) Rajesh S said that the autopsy reports were awaited. “The exact reason for the incident is not known. Neighbours said that the couple used to fight frequently. Their families are on their way to Noida. We will register a case once they file a complaint,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-shoots-wife-dead-kills-self-in-noida-101622572920324.html

02-06-2021||Noida||Overnight rains bring mercury down by 7°C in Noida||Noida: The mercury fell by seven degrees Celsius on Tuesday in Noida due to rains and thunderstorm on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. The weather analysts said that the light rains may continue for another two days.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the thunder activities were due to the easterly winds, a low pressure line in the region meeting an active western disturbance.“It was a thunder activity and not a pre-monsoon activity. There is a low pressure trough line from Punjab to north-western Madhya Pradesh, and along with the western disturbance it led to the thunderstorm and rains. The maximum impact was observed on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. The light rains may continue for another two days. However, mercury will start rising from June 4 by four to five degrees,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.The average wind speed in the region is 30 kmph that kept the air quality under check, IMD said.According to IMD, Noida recorded maximum and minimum temperatures at 33.3 degrees Celsius (°C) and 20.4°C on Tuesday against 40.1 and 27.1°C a day earlier. The average rainfall in Noida was recorded at 0.5mm during the past 24 hours while the neighbouring Safdarjung recorded 15.6mm of rainfall. At Safdarjung, considered average for NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 33.6°C and 17.6°C, respectively.Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad improved slightly on Tuesday.

02-06-2021||Noida||Ineligible people book slots at camps meant for parents of kids under 12 years||The special vaccination camps for parents of children younger than 12 years saw many ineligible people arrive for the shot, including unmarried persons, in both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar on Tuesday, the first day of these camps.The camps are called “Abhibhavak” on the Co-WIN portal with the disclaimer that it is meant “exclusively for parents of children below 12 years of age”.Both districts had two such camps each and the turnout was relatively poor.The camps were at Kailash Manasarowar Bhawan in Indirapuram and Delhi Public School Ghaziabad, Meerut Road (DPSG). Only 75 out of the total 200 doses were used. “More than 50 people who arrived at DPSG did not have children. Many said they had booked the slots in haste to get the shot and overlooked the eligibility criteria. So, we turned them all away,” said an officer from health department deployed at the centre. An official at the Indirapuram centres said 10 to 12 people had been turned away over similar reasons.“Such issues crop up on the inaugural day. We ask those bookings slots to carefully check their respective categories,” said Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr N K Gupta. GB Nagar health department said they could vaccinate only 137 people out of the 300 they had expected at the Bisrakh primary health centre and JP International School centres. “Many ineligible people also booked their slots here,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar.The special camps were created on directions from the UP government. The government has been stressing on protecting children who could contract the virus in the event of a third wave of infections. “The staff deployed at the centre was very cooperative and they guided us through the entire process. Further, the arrangement at the school premises was also up to the mark with proper seating, drinking water and other arrangements. Otherwise, people expect they have to stand in long queues and face troubles at government centres,” said Sanjeev Kumar, a beneficiary from Shastri Nagar. Vaccination centres in schools: Several schools have also come forward and opted to provide their premises as vaccination centre. “We started as an isolation centre from April 5 to May 21 and it was also an oxygen aid centre. About 70 patients got benefitted. Now, we have taken a short break and preparing for a vaccination centre with 2000-3000 vaccination proposed in a day. This will be through a private hospital,” said Trilok Singh Bisht, principal of DPSG, Vasundhara. The other school of DPSG, Meerut Road started operations as vaccination centre from May 24. “Our overall target is about 500 vaccines per day, and we have also initiated session for parents from Tuesday. We have developed two adverse events following immunisation rooms and also a selfie point where people can take selfies when they come for vaccination. We have also allowed old-aged people to enter the premises in cars and even some of them were given the shots in cars. Proper arrangement of wheel-chairs and other basic facilities is also provided by the school,” said Yogesh Agarwal, admin officer of DPSG, Meerut Road. The members of federation of apartment owners said that they have tied up with Max Hospital at Vaishali for vaccination and they have decided that the process will be taken up at a nearby school which is walking distance. “Earlier we planned to get vaccination done at our highrises but now we have decided along with hospital authorities that it will be done at a nearby school, and it has proper facilities. So far, we have about 40 highrises in Indirapuram whose residents wish to take up vaccination. School premises will be convenient as people from other areas like Vasundhara, Vaishali and other can also come and take jabs,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. The officials from Max Hospital said that they will be going live with the vaccination process from Tuesday. “The first day will be a dry run during which we will also assess about the arrangements. The premises is decided at a school, and we plan to take up about 3000-4000 vaccination per day. At our hospital, we have a daily average of about 1000 doses. So, overall, we will take up about 5000 vaccination per day,” said an officer from Max Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ineligible-people-book-slots-at-camps-meant-for-parents-of-kids-under-12-years-101622572799601.html

We have decided to close oxygen banks at Gautam Budh Balak Inter College in Greater Noida West and the one in the primary school in Sirsa village. The other two - Mihir Bhoja City Park in Greater Noida East and Saini village primary school- will continue,” said Deep Chand additional chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority. “When we started there was a demand of around 40 cylinders at four centres on daily basis. But now the remaining two centres are filling only 7 to 8 cylinders daily.” The authority started the banks for patients in home isolation on May 8. The authority charges ₹500 for a 47-litre cylinder and ₹200 for a 10 litre one. The centres had supplied 700 cylinders till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-oxygen-banks-shut-as-demand-falls-for-covid-patients-101622572679538.html
02-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Only UP residents eligible for vaccination of 18-45 group||NOIDA: Many people in the 18-45 years age group, who visited the drive-through sites in Gautam Budh Nagar on Tuesday, had to return without getting their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine as they did not have a residence proof of Uttar Pradesh. They said that while booking their slots on Co-WIN app, there was no rider for essentially being a UP resident. The vaccination for the 18-45 age group started in GB Nagar on Tuesday. District administration officials said that only those having a state residence proof can avail the facility, citing an order by the state’s mission director of the National Health Mission (NHM). The officials said that residents of UP can show any documents like electricity bill and lease/rent agreement, among others, to prove their residency.Kailash Tyagi, a 28-year-old IT professional who is a resident of Yojna Vihar in Delhi, said that he had to return from the vaccination site at GIP mall in Noida, without getting the jab. “I had registered on Co-WIN app and was allotted a slot of 12pm to 2pm here. But as I am a Delhi resident, the vaccination staff straightaway refused to give me the dose, showing me a notification issued by the GB Nagar district administration,” he said. Thirty two-year-old Sandhya Singh, a resident of Shahdara in east Delhi, met the similar fate at her allotted inoculation booth in Pathways School in Noida Sector 100. “The vaccination officials showed me the door saying that the vaccine doses are only for permanent or temporary residents of UP,” she said. When contacted, Vandita Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance) who issued the notification recently, justified the administration’s address rider on vaccination drive for the 18+ group. “The cost of vaccine doses for people aged 45 years and above is being borne by the central government. But, as the UP government has procured vaccines for the 18-45 group using money from the state exchequer, our aim is to benefit maximum number of people from the state,” she said. Srivastava further said that the district administration is not denying vaccines even to the temporary residents in the state. “Eligible people can show any document that establishes UP as their temporary or permanent place of living and they’ll get the shots. We can’t give the valuable vaccines meant for the UP residents to the people from neighbouring states. We’ve asked the staff at all vaccination booths to strictly adhere to the orders issued by the district administration,” the ADM said.The officials made it clear that this rule doesn’t apply to Noida’s private hospitals where paid vaccination is being carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-only-up-residents-eligible-for-vaccination-of-18-45-group-101622572619568.html
02-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Domestic violence cases high amid pandemic||Even as Covid-19 ravaged Gautam Budh Nagar over the last two months, domestic violence against women did not stop.According to data from the 112 emergency number, 813 such cases were reported in April and May this year in the district. Although this was much lower than last year when 1,764 cases were recorded in the same period, it was similar to the pre-pandemic levels of 839 in 2019.The “decrease” from last year, however, has to be seen in perspective of lockdowns and the pandemic. While in 2020, the nation was under a strict lockdown during the period, this year it was a comparatively relaxed “partial curfew” imposed by the Uttar Pradesh government from April 29.“Since the complainants could not call their families for help because of restrictions in 2020, they had to report the incidents to the police,” said deputy commissioner of police (Women’s Safety, GB Nagar) Vrinda Shukla. “This year, there was no strict restriction and the woman’s social support was more easily available.”Cases reported through the 112 emergency number are referred to the Family Dispute Resolution Clinic (FDRC) located at the Knowledge Park police station in Greater Noida where psychological and legal assistance are provided. In those cases where physical abuse is evident, a case is registered. As per Dr Ritu Gautam, FDRC Coordinator and an assistant professor of law at Sharda University, Greater Noida: “This his year, the root cause of most cases reported to us was due to the man losing his job, took to drinking and then vented his frustration on the family.”Dr Gautam recalled one such case in April this year in which a man took to drinking more often and relied on his wife’s salary. “This eventually led to a dispute between the two and that escalated,” she said.Dr Gautam, who is also writing a research paper on the domestic violence in India, also noted that the drop in cases this year could be due to the severity of the second wave. “Almost every household was affected due to Covid and there were reports of people struggling for life. Amidst this, a person suffering from domestic abuse can feel that what they are going through is not worth reporting,” said Dr Gautam.DCP Shukla said that a case under Indian Penal Code sections 151 (preventive detention) and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) is registered in case of physical abuse.Mala Bhandari of Social And Development Research & Action Group (SADRAG) said “My interpretation of this data is that in 2021, we have been surrounded by death and despair all around due to the severe health emergency we were pushed into. As loss intensified for many, it may have led to low reporting of cases of domestic violence. However, incidents may still be happening inside the home”.“With a year of coronavirus, there have been many changes in life. Earlier, if reasons for domestic violence were just five-layered, Covid has added two more layers to it. This could be financial stress, job loss or even medical expenses. I believe the tremors of the second Covid wave are yet to come and there may be more cases reported in the future,” said Mala who is a Ph.D. in Sociology and her area of research has been Women, work and their quality of life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-domestic-violence-cases-high-amid-pandemic-101622572500273.html
02-06-2021||Noida||Noida to push vaccines into rural areas to achieve 1.5 mn shots in 2 months||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration targets 1.5 million vaccinations in two months - around 25,000 a day and the focus will be on rural areas. To do this, it had set out a blueprint: be aggressive and bridge the digital divide in rural areas. Taking cognisance of the difficulty in accessing the Co-WIN portal in rural areas to register for the vaccine, the district administration has tasked the common service centres (CSCs), which is under the Digital India mission, for an outreach programme.“The CSC staff are going door-to-door and compiling details of residents to share with the district vaccination department. On the basis of these reports, the department will set up vaccination centres in these areas. At present, we prefer community health centres, primary health centres, schools, panchayat buildings or any public place that have waiting, vaccination and observation rooms as vaccination booths ,” said district magistrate Suhas L Y. On Tuesday only 11,287 people were vaccinated, according to government data, and the district administration hopes that its push into rural areas will help increase the daily count. Over 590,000 people, more than a quarter of the district population, had been vaccinated at least once till date.“In terms of vaccination-population ratio, the GB Nagar district is one of the best performing districts in the state,” said Suhas. Dr Deepak Ohri, the chief medical officer, said that private hospitals will also play very important role in achieving the stipulated target. “While the private hospitals have procured vaccines directly from the manufacturers, there is no dearth of vaccines in the government hospitals. Even the rate of one dose of vaccine is less than its rate in Delhi and other places. The rate of one Covishield dose in private hospitals in GB Nagar is ₹850, while in Delhi and other places – the private hospitals are charging at least ₹100 more for the same shot,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-to-push-vaccines-into-rural-areas-to-achieve-1-5-mn-shots-in-2-months-101622572499633.html

This, however, has led to traffic congestion along the Sion-Panvel highway, near the Vashi toll naka on Tuesday. The traffic snarls stretched up to Vashi village, which is around a three-and-half kilometre away from the toll naka. The problem was further complicated by the nakabandis conducted by the Mumbai Police at Mankhurd, the police said. Bhanu Khatawkar, senior inspector of the Vashi traffic unit said, “The number of vehicles on the highway was more than usual on Tuesday, due to the lockdown relaxation. The Mumbai Police also conducted nakabadis at Mankhurd to check the vehicles entering their jurisdiction. The Vashi area saw traffic jams between 9.30am to 1pm. We deployed more officers to manage the traffic.” Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “Navi Mumbai has a positivity rate of 3%, hence we have allowed the limited relaxation of the norms, under Break the Chain order of the state government. The residents have to ensure that all the improvement in the situation does not go waste and that through responsible behaviour of the shopkeepers and the customers, the situation only improves further.” (Inputs by G.

02-06-2021||Mumbai||Justify overruling Maharashtra govt’s decision over SSC exams, HC asks petitioner||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the petitioner who challenged the state government’s decision to cancel the SSC board exams for the academic year 2020-21 to provide substantial grounds for them to pass orders contrary to the decision of the state government. The court also sought to know how it could pass such orders while there was an apprehension that the third Covid wave would affect children in the age group of 10-18 years.After the petitioner informed the court that he wanted to challenge the government resolution which announced the evaluation system for Class 10 students in lieu of exams not being held, the court directed the petitioner to amend the petition and include the challenge in it.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pune resident and retired professor Dhananjay Kulkarni, was informed by advocate Uday Warunjikar that as the situation had improved there was no harm in conducting the SSC board exams. He further stated that the formula for evaluation and assessment of Class 10 students which were announced by the state government on May 28 was not acceptable and hence wanted to challenge it too.On May 28, the state government had announced that students would be evaluated through an internal assessment formula for the academic year 2020-21 and class 11 admissions would be conducted through an optional Common Entrance Test (CET) based on class 10 syllabus and those unwilling to appear for CET would be admitted based on their Class 10 marks.The additional affidavit filed by the state government on Monday in response to the PIL stated that the SSC exams could not be compared with HSC exams as the latter were more important milestones for students. The affidavit justified the decision to cancel the Class 10 exams while postponing Class 12 exams by stating that students appearing for Class 12 exams were more mature, independent, socially aware, bodily and mentally fit.The affidavit also referred to the threat of a third wave in July or August which medical experts have said could affect children between 10 and 18 years of age and said that in light of that decisions pertaining to exams on a large scale would have to be taken with due consideration.After hearing the submissions the bench asked the petitioner, “You want exams to be held. Do you think the Covid situation this year is better than last year? The state has said that the current environment is not conducive for conducting examinations. Can we substitute the decision saying that the situation is fine and say that it is conducive to hold exams?”While setting aside the argument of Warunjikar that the situation had improved the bench said, “We are making our prima facie observations. There are certain decisions of the state government that may not be fair but we are also aware of how much to extend our powers.” The bench then allowed the petitioner to amend the petition to challenge the newly announced evaluation formula for Class 10 students and said that by the next hearing on June 3 the Supreme Court would have passed orders pertaining to cancellation of Class 12 exams as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/justify-overruling-maharashtra-govt-s-decision-over-ssc-exams-hc-asks-petitioner-101622572260197.html
02-06-2021||Pune||Non-essential shop owners in Pune get back to business||PUNE For Ramesh Kadam, it is a relief and new hope to return to his garment store in Sadashiv peth after two months of lockdown.“For the last two months, we are struggling for our survival. Our small shop of clothes and garments was closed and our entire savings got finished during the last lockdown. I had to borrow money from friends. Now business has started and we hope to earn something for our livelihood,” said Kadam.On Tuesday, thousands of non-essential shops and traders opened for business after two months, post the strict Covid restrictions imposed by the state government. As Covid cases were on the rise in the state, a lockdwon was imposed which impacted hundreds of thousands who work in this sector. On Tuesday, major markets like Tulshibaug, Laxmi road, the jewellery market at Sonya Maruti chowk, the mobile shops at Hatta Ganpati chowk and several other small markets across the city opened up. Gangadhar Kundan, owner of Kundan Collections, one of the oldest clothing shops on Laxmi road said, “Though our shops were closed for two months and we didn’t have business, there were heavy expenses going on. We had to pay full salaries to our entire staff, electricity bills, EMIs and other maintenance of the shop. So we are already going through losses and now that the shop is open, it will take time to gain business.”Nitin Pandit, president of the Tulshibaug market shop owners association, said, “All the shop owners and registered street vendors inside the Tulshibaug market were excited to open up after a long period of time. We welcomed our customers by giving them roses and also gave a social message of getting vaccination done. It is our responsibility to get vaccinated and follow all the Covid safety norms strictly.”On Tuesday morning there was a sizeable crowd at all these markets. Manjiri Kulkarni had come to buy a new smarphone. She said, “My phone broke down last month and I had to use an old phone during this period. The first thing I planned to do after non-essential shops opened is to buy a new phone. I have bought a smartphone and also there are many other household things which we are planning to purchase this week.”Another customer Rakesh Jethva said, “My brother’s wedding was planned in May and due to lockdown we postponed it to June. We have started our purchasing, as there are only 15 days left for the wedding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nonessential-shop-owners-breathe-a-sigh-of-relief-with-masks-on-as-they-get-back-to-business-101622568539219.html
02-06-2021||Pune||0.1 million kids aged 0-10 years reported Covid-19 positive in second wave; 18K under age 4||As per the state health department, an age analysis of confirmed Covid-19 cases shows that there has been a significant rise in the number of infections reported in the age group of 0-10 years in the second wave, compared to the first wave. Between January 1 and May 29, 2021, the state saw 0.1 million cases within the age group of 0-10 years, including 18,000 cases among those aged four-years and below. However, this rise in the number of cases among children is in proportion with the overall rise in the number of cases in the state. During both the waves, the age group of 31-40 years was the most affected.The age-wise analysis shows that there has been a drastic rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in all age groups in the second wave. In anticipation that the upcoming third wave would affect children the most, state officials have stated that while children have not been vaccinated, which may make them more vulnerable, this is just a theory and that there is no scientific proof as yet. Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer said, “The prediction that children will be more affected by the third wave has no solid scientific basis. The proportion of children of different ages has not changed much compared to the total number of Covid patients in the last six months. This means that the rate of infection in children has remained stable. There has been no increase. Most importantly, even though young children are infected with Covid, they have a much lower risk of complications and death, than adults. Even if you take the example of May, the under-18 mortality rate is 0.07. It is a common occurrence that one out of 10,000 children dies from this disease. Children who have other high-risk illnesses are more likely to have such complications.”However, city paediatricians have stated that the incidence of new borns being diagnosed with Covid-19 and the reported cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in Covid-19 positive children has also risen in the second wave. Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, a paediatrician with three city hospitals, said, “In the first wave we had not reported a single case of neonatal Covid-19. In the second wave, in just a month’s time, between March 25 and May 11, we saw 11 such cases. This rise in the number of such cases is worrisome as we anticipate that this could become even more severe in the third wave. In addition to vaccinating lactating women, which has now been approved, the government must also think about vaccinating pregnant women, as this has been proven beneficial in multiple studies.” Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital and a leading paediatrician said that until the government makes multi- inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) a notifiable disease, it is difficult to know the exact number. He said, “At our hospital we have treated around five cases of MISC in just the second week of May and after that, there have been no reported cases. The second wave has just gotten over and these inflammatory syndromes are post-Covid, so cases may come forward now.”Dr Awate also added that while some children may need an ICU, that incidence is not very high. He added, “Young children do not develop the specific receptors needed for the virus to enter the body and therefore, do not appear to develop very serious illnesses. It is not very desirable to create a climate of fear in parents with young children and in society as a whole. We have to be careful and make sure your children are vaccinated regularly with regular vaccines and on time. It is not right to impose unnecessary restrictions on the child for fear of the third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/01-million-kids-aged-0-10-years-reported-covid-19-positive-in-second-wave-18k-under-age-4-101622566318979.html
02-06-2021||Pune||Students studying abroad being vaccinated under PMC’s special provision||On Tuesday, the civic body began vaccinating students with confirmed admissions to universities abroad. On first day of this special drive, a total of 200 jabs were administered under the PMC’s special provision. This drive will continue on Wednesday as well. Kamala Nehru hospital is the only centre designated for this special drive. Earlier, the PMC allowed walk-in vaccinations for such students. The Pune civic body then shared a designated email ID for students to send in relevant documents to get a slot booked. A PMC official said, “Only those students who have received have received the email for June 1, 2021, with a token number/slot for a vaccination should visit the vaccination centre. The rest will also receive an email with a slot/ token details in due course.” Siddhant Yelwande, a 22-year-old student who has been admitted into the University of Minnesota, US, said he has to reach the university by August 23 and his second dose is assigned for August 24 on the CoWin app. “I have to join on August 23, which means I have to leave at least four to five days before that date. Also, I cannot leave immediately after the second shot and might have to wait for two-three days in case there is any adverse effect. If my second shot comes on August 24, I might miss my orientation and possibly miss out on courses I want to choose,” said Yelwande. The University of Minnesota, according to him, does offer vaccination for its students and only Pfizer and Moderna doses are currently available. “This means I have to ensure the second shot of Covishield here, before leaving,” said Yelwande. PMC has clarified that it will be writing to the Centre to minimise the interval between two doses of Covishield for students going abroad to study. “The World hHealth Organstion (WHO), has recommended Covishield internationally. So we will give Covishield to students planning to go abroad for studies. We will write to the central government to minimise the period between the two doses,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC said on Monday. Not all students though have such a strict deadline.Sneha Abhyankar has to reach the University of Michigan by August 21. She said, “My second shot is scheduled for August 24 which is fine. I might surely miss the earlier days, but it will not affect my course greatly. I have been admitted into an MBA course at the university and Covishield is approved at the university.” Edwise International, which offers a consultancy service for students wishing to study abroad, has been informing their clients about demands from universities regarding Covid vaccinations. Subhash Pol, business manager, Pune region, said, “While Australia and New Zealand are yet to open their universities for foreign students, many universities in Europe and USA require their students to undergo vaccinations. While universities have not put forward any preferences for specific vaccines, all approved vaccines, including Covishield, are permitted. Also some universities have a mandatory quarantine for 10 days in case students are not vaccinated. Most universities require the student to join by September and so if the second dose is given before that, it should not be a problem.” Currently, as per the ministry of health’s guidelines, the gap between the doses of Covishield is 12-15 weeks.PMC has 500 applications from such students as of date. Agarwal said, “Students who wish to get the vaccine under this special drive should send in details like admission confirmation letter, passport copy with valid visa and other documents to studentvaccination.pune@gmail.com. The special drive will continue on Wednesday and PMC will give appointments.” Covaxin vaccine second shot for 18-45 age group from WednesdayStarting Wednesday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will begin administering the second dose of the Covaxin vaccine for those who were administered the first shot on May 5. Also starting Wednesday, PMC will start vaccinating the second dose of Covaxin for all those who got their first shot on May 5. Agarwal said, “PMC will arrange Covaxin second dose from tomorrow for May 5 first- dose beneficiaries from the age group of 18-45.” As of Sunday, Pune district has vaccinated 93,909 beneficiaries since the vaccination began on May 1. Of these, 24,000 are from rural areas, 59,000 are from Pune city and 13,000 are from PCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-studying-abroad-being-vaccinated-under-pmc-s-special-provision-101622565419004.html
02-06-2021||Pune||Pre-monsoon showers keep Pune in the wet as monsoon beckons||PUNE Even as the monsoon is still a few days away, Pune’s rendezvous with the pre-monsoon rain continued on Tuesday, the 10th day in a row. Meteorologists said the onset of the Southwest Monsoon over Maharashtra can be forecast only once it reaches the Kerala coast. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), on Tuesday, released its second long-range forecast, with a 106% LPA (long period average) of rain for central India, which includes Maharashtra. On Tuesday, Pune reported 0.3 mm rainfall with IMD forecasting showers will continue in Pune city, along with thunderstorms and lightning for the next few days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, said that light to moderate rainfall is likely to continue in and around Pune and its adjoining areas for the next few days.“There are strong westerly winds along with a trough line which is incurring moisture from the Arabia Sea, from Central India to Madhya Maharashtra. Due to this we are seeing light to moderate rainfall in the city and four subdivisions of Maharashtra,” said Kashyapi.IMD officials noted that there is a cyclonic circulation over east central Arabian Sea off the Karnataka coast, which lies over the east-central Arabian Sea. A trough line runs from the cyclonic circulation over east- central Arabian Sea and the neighbourhood, to north Madhya Maharashtra, which is a reason for rainfall across Maharashtra.“We have forecasted that light to moderate rainfall is likely in Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of Konkan and Goa. These are pre-monsoon showers,” said Kashyapi.As per the forecast, all four subdivisions in Maharashtra will receive moderate rainfall at isolated places till June 4.“As per the latest meteorological indications, the southwesterly winds have strengthened, resulting in likely enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala. Hence, the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3,” said IMD officials.“After the onset of the Southwest Monsoon over Kerala, conditions will get clearer as to when the monsoon will reach Maharashtra and Pune. As of now, conditions are favourable for the onset over Kerala. On Tuesday, 12 of 14 stations in Kerala are reporting rainfall. When all 14 stations report widespread rainfall, we can say that the conditions are becoming more favourable,” said Kashyapi.The Second Long Range Forecast released by IMD suggests that the rainfall over the four homogeneous regions in India is most likely to be normal.“Seasonal rainfall is most likely to be above normal over Central India that includes Maharashtra. The southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall over the monsoon core zone, which consists of most of the rain-fed agriculture regions in the country, is most likely to be above normal,” said Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD Director General of Meteorology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/premonsoon-showers-keep-pune-in-the-wet-as-monsoon-beckons-101622563618825.html

Joginder was brought on a production warrant from Amritsar jail and during his interrogation, we came to know that he had accumulated huge amount of money by selling weapons and drugs. Our team raided the location revealed by Joginder and recovered ₹34 lakh,” said Batala senior superintendent of police Rashpal Singh.He said police have already frozen his assets worth ₹1.17 crore in Batala. “Joginder’s family members are also involved in the illegal trade. Earlier, his wife Amarjit Kaur was arrested with 1.3kg of heroin and a foreign-made pistol and his nephew Sarwan Singh was nabbed with 255 gms of heroin,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/batala-police-recover-rs-34-l-drug-money-from-smuggler-101622550957423.html

Police said they have also initiated the process to cancel the licence permanently.The firearm, for which licence was issued to Kumar in 2012, has already been seized by the crime branch team investigating Dhankad’s murder case. Police officers aware of the investigation said they have already arrested nine people, including Kumar, in the case.“We have suspended the arms licence of the arrested wrestler, Sushil Kumar, as he was booked in a criminal case. The process for cancellation of his licence has been initiated. He has been served a notice, seeking his explanation on why the cancellation of licence should not be done,” said joint commissioner of police (licencing) OP Mishra.Advocate Pradeep Rana, who is representing Kumar, said: “The suspension of Sushil’s arm’s license is not in accordance with the law and there is no cause of action for Delhi Police to act in such hasty and unconstitutional manner and the same is in stark violation of natural justice and right to be heard. The involvement of the said weapon in the alleged incident is a matter of trial but prima facie there were no alleged gun shot injuries. Therefore, it is apparent that the investigating agency is acting in a malafide manner and trying to malign the image of a two- time Olympic medallist.”Kumar is presently in the custody of the crime branch and will be produced before a Delhi court on Wednesday, when his four-day police custody ends. The team is likely to seek further extension of Kumar’s custody to recover his mobile phone and clothes that he was wearing at the time of the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arms-licences-of-wrestler-sushil-kumar-delhi-bizman-navneet-kalra-suspended-101622531515881.html
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: YouTuber arrested over death of his wife||A well-known YouTuber was arrested by Bhandup police on Sunday night after his wife’s family alleged that she had been killed by the accused.According to police, the victim, Komal Agarwal, was found dead at her house where she lived with her husband. The police had initially registered a case of accidental death, but following the complaint by Agarwal’s mother and sister, a case of abetment to suicide, culpable homicide not amounting to murder and assault along with intimidation against filed her husband Jitendra under sections 304, 323, 306 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.Agarwal had allegedly eloped with Jitendra, popularly known as Jeetu Jaan, on March 4 this year after knowing each other for around two months, which offended her parents and siblings. Her mother Sheela Pathak told the police that after her wedding, Agarwal was assaulted by Jitendra regularly over house work.The accused had allegedly told Agarwal to stop calling her sister Priya after finding out that she complained to her about the physical abuse.Agarwal allegedly complained of assault three times to her sister and her friend Meena and she once also left the house. “If Jitendra had physically abused Komal so many times, it is not difficult to imagine that he may have killed her,” said Priya.Pathak said that they learnt about the demise of Agarwal on May 27 when Bhandup police informed them that Agarwal had hanged herself. The family then approached the police saying they suspected Jitendra.“We have arrested Jitendra and are investigating the case. We are waiting for the post-mortem report to find out whether she was killed and then hanged or was forced to hang herself,” said Sham Shinde, senior inspector, Bhandup police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-youtuber-arrested-over-death-of-his-wife-101622487289545.html
02-06-2021||World||Beer is latest vaccine incentive for Biden 'month of action'||President Joe Biden is announcing a “month of action” Wednesday to urge more Americans to get vaccinated for Covid-19 before the July 4 holiday, with an early summer sprint of incentives, including free beer, childcare and sports tickets to convince Americans to roll up their sleeves.In an afternoon address from the White House, Biden will announce a slew of new initiatives to ease barriers to vaccinations and to make getting shots more appealing to those who haven't received a dose yet. It comes as he is closing in on his goal to get 70% of adults partially vaccinated by Independence Day — essential to his goal of returning the nation to a pre-pandemic sense of normalcy this summer.“We’re looking at June as a critical month in our path to normal and as a critical month in order to continue the progress we’re making in our vaccination campaign," Courtney Rowe, the director of strategic communications and engagement to the White House Covid-19 response team, told the AP.The White House said Biden’s “month of action” will continue to use public and private-sector partnerships to encourage Americans to get shots, mirroring the “whole of government” effort Biden deployed to make vaccines more widely available once he took office.Anheuser-Busch announced a promotional giveaway Wednesday morning, saying it would “buy Americans 21+ a round of beer” once Biden’s 70% goal is met.Additionally, the White House is partnering with early childhood centers such as KinderCare, Learning Care Group, Bright Horizons and more than 500 YMCAs to provide free childcare coverage for Americans looking for shots or needing assistance while recovering from side effects.They're the latest vaccine sweeteners, building on other incentives like cash giveaways, sports tickets or paid leave, to keep up the pace of vaccinations.“The fact remains that despite all the progress, those who are unvaccinated still remain at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading the disease to others," said Rowe.Aiming to make injections even more convenient, Biden is announcing that many pharmacies are extending their hours this month — and thousands will remain open overnight on Fridays. The White House is also stepping up its efforts to help employers run on-site vaccination clinics. It's launching a new partnership to bring vaccine education and even doses to more than a thousand Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons, building on a successful pilot program in Maryland.Biden will also announce that he is tapping Vice President Kamala Harris to lead a “We Can Do This” vaccination tour to encourage shots, that will include first lady Jill Biden, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Cabinet officials. Harris' travel will be focused on the South, where vaccination rates are among the lowest in the country, while other officials will travel to areas of the Midwest with below average rates.“As we think about these next four weeks, we are making sure we’re using a ‘whole of America’ approach,” said Rowe. "It’s the private sector, it’s mayors, it’s colleges, it’s celebrities and social influencers, it’s our own government officials, but it’s also everyday Americans. It’s going to take all of us being part of this to get more people vaccinated and to put the pandemic behind us and keep it there.”To date 62.8% of the adult U.S. population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 133.6 million are fully vaccinated. The rate of new vaccinations has slowed again to an average below 600,000 per day, down from more than 800,000 per day when incentives like lotteries were announced, and down from a peak of nearly 2 million per day in early April when demand for shots was much higher.The lengths to which the U.S. is resorting to convince Americans to take a life-saving shot stands in contrast to much of the world, where vaccines are far less plentiful. Facing a mounting U.S. surplus, the Biden administration is planning to begin sharing 80 million doses with the world this month.As part of the effort to drive Americans to get shots, the White House is borrowing some tools from political campaigns, including phone banks, door-knocking and text banking. The administration says more than 1,000 such events will be held this coming weekend alone. Additionally, it is organizing competitions between cities and colleges to drive up vaccination rates.Other new incentives include a $2 million commitment from DoorDash to provide gift cards to community health centers to be used to drive people to get vaccinated. CVS launched a sweepstakes with prizes including free cruises and Super Bowl tickets. Major League Baseball will host on-site vaccine clinics and ticket giveaways at games. And Kroger will give $1 million to a vaccinated person each week this month and dozens of people free groceries for the year.The fine print on the Anheuser-Busch promotion reveals the benefits to the sponsoring company, which will collect consumer data and photos through its website to register, and that it will only provide $5 credits to the first 200,000 people to respond once the nation reaches the vaccine threshold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beer-is-latest-vaccine-incentive-for-biden-month-of-action-101622647985669.html
02-06-2021||World||Palestine expresses concern at India abstaining from crucial UNHRC vote||Amid a perceptible shift in India’s Middle East policy, Palestine has expressed concern at India’s abstention during a vote at the UN Human Rights Council that resulted in the setting up of an inquiry into rights violations during the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Palestine’s concerns were conveyed by foreign minister Riad Malki in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on May 30. The letter, accessed by Hindustan Times, stated that India’s abstention during the vote on May 27 “stifles the important work of Human Rights Council at advancing human rights for all peoples, including those of the Palestinian people”. The development comes against the backdrop of India dropping its traditional reference to support for the “just Palestinian cause” in at least three recent statements at the UN Security Council, General Assembly and Human Rights Council. The statements, however, retained the usual reference to a two-state solution to be achieved through direct negotiations to ensure lasting peace between the people of Israel and Palestine. Malki’s unusually strongly worded letter stated: “I write to express our concern by the position taken by Republic of India in the Human Rights Council 30th special session of 27 May 2021, on the seminal resolution [titled] ‘Ensuring respect for international human rights law and humanitarian law in Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel’.” It added, “Republic of India missed an opportunity to join the international community at this turning point, both crucial and long overdue, on the path to accountability, justice, and peace.” Following the adoption of the resolution, presented by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Palestinian delegation, by 24 votes, the Human Rights Council established an international commission of inquiry into “violations of international humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law” during the Israel-Hamas conflict. The move was rejected by Israel. India, Brazil, France, Italy and Nepal were among the 14 countries that abstained during the vote. It was not immediately clear whether Malki had written similar letters to his counterparts in other countries that abstained. Malki further said in the letter that the resolution was “not an aberration to the Human Rights Council”, and it was the “by-product of extensive multilateral consultations” and “thorough investigations into and reporting on Israel’s grave violations by States, United Nations experts, Human Rights Treaty bodies, and international organizations”. He added that the Palestinian people had been “excluded from the applicability of the universal and the indispensable principle of accountability, a prerequisite to justice and peace”. Malki contended that the root causes of injustice suffered by the Palestinian people include “decades-long dispossession, displacement, colonization, oppression...and the denial and violation of their every human right by Israel”. Unless these root causes are addressed, Malki wrote, the “situation will not only remain volatile, but will continue deteriorating with far-reaching and grave repercussions”. Palestine is ready to “engage positively and seriously to achieve this goal and realize peace in the region”, he added. In its latest statement at the UN Security Council on May 27, India said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has “arrested the sharp deterioration of the security situation” though the “situation continues to be fragile”. India reiterated its call for all parties to observe “maximum restraint and avoid acts of violence, provocation, incitement and destruction” and also underlined the need to respect the historic status quo in Jerusalem. While focusing on rehabilitation and reconstruction in Gaza, India called for resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine for a two-state solution. “The absence of direct and meaningful negotiations between the two parties has only widened the trust deficit, which, in turn, increases the chances for similar escalations in the future,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestine-expresses-concern-at-india-abstaining-from-crucial-unhrc-vote-101622652846352.html
02-06-2021||World||US lawmakers take another shot at removing per-country cap of green cards||A pair of Democratic and Republican US lawmakers on Wednesday re-introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that proposes to remove a per-country limit on employment-based green cards, which, has created a massive backlog of applicants, specially from India.The ‘Equal Access to Green Cards for Legal Employment Act 2021’, also called the EAGLE Act, proposes the phasing out of a per-country limit of 7% on the roughly 1 million employment-based green cards issued annually, and raising the cap on family-based green cards from 7% to 15% of a total of about half a million.The bill, which was introduced by Democrat Zoe Lofgren and Republican John Curtis, is similar to the one that passed the House of Representatives in July 2020 with overwhelming bipartisan support (365-65 votes). The Senate passed a similar bill with some amendments with unanimous consent in December.But, the amended bill did not come up for a vote in the Democrat-led House; only a bill approved by both chambers of Congress go to president for enactment. Longtime observers and trackers of this legislative effort, which has been under way for years now, said they believe the Democrats probably did not want then president Donald Trump to get the credit for the bill. And, they added, some tech companies who are deeply invested in the future of the bill because they are frequent users of the green card programme, to attract foreign workers, who are recruited initially through the H-1B visa programme.The 7% per-country limit, which was enacted by US Congress in 1990, has led over time to backlogs that were “unimaginable” at the time, said Representative Lofgren, who also heads the House subcommittee on immigration and citizenship. She added, “The effect has been that countries with relatively small populations are allocated the same number of visas as a relatively large-population country. The result? A person from a large-population country with extraordinary qualifications who could contribute greatly to our economy and create jobs waits behind a person with lesser qualifications from a smaller country.”Lofgren did not name any “large-population” country. But, applicants from India are the worst hit by the per-country cap. There are more than 300,000 people from India in the queue, according to latest data made available by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. But Immigration Voice, an advocacy group campaigning for the removal of the country cap, estimates the number to be much higher at 1.5 million. The current waiting time for Indian applicants has been put at - a theoretical probability - at 150 years by the Cato Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. “In effect, there is a ban on Indian immigrants from getting a green card,” said Aman Kapoor of Immigration Voice. “India immigrants applying for a green card today are looking at the wait time of 150 years. It means there is practically a ban on Indian immigrants to ever get a green card. And, Eagle Act makes the system equal where every immigrant from every country will wait the same amount of time instead of the current system which condemns and bans immigrants from India. And the Congress must swiftly pass the Eagle Act to lift the ban on immigrants from India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-take-another-shot-at-removing-per-country-cap-of-green-cards-101622651046990.html

It is about peace in the whole region.”Qaem’s statement comes ahead of the fourth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue to be hosted via video link by Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi on Thursday.Wang will chair the meet to be attended by counterparts Shah Mahmood Qureshi from Pakistan and Mohammad Haneef Atmar from Afghanistan, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday.The three foreign ministers will have in-depth exchanges of views on the Afghan peace and reconciliation process, practical cooperation and counterterrorism and security cooperation, the ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.During his press interaction on Tuesday, Afghan envoy Qaem said that the advantage that China enjoys is that it has good relations with both Afghanistan and Pakistan and can play a critical role in building trust between these two neighbouring countries; trust is the real thing that will bring long-lasting peace in the region.He also expressed confidence that the Afghan army can deal with the Taliban after the US troop withdrawal. “Since 2014, we have been fighting by ourselves, except for some air support from the US for our national security forces,” Qaem added.He said around 1,500 Taliban fighters were killed by Afghan forces in May. “We have 350,000 national security forces, among whom there are special forces. We don’t have any fear of losing ground. I don’t see a lot of changes along with the withdrawal.“The withdrawal would be a surprise more to the Taliban than to us. There is no other way for the Taliban except to come back to the peace table. Therefore, we propose we should have a cease-fire and the international community should put pressure on the Taliban to accept that.”In May, Wang had said China hopes to see a “moderate Muslim” leadership in Afghanistan in the future and has assured the country of help in strengthening its anti-terrorism capacities as Kabul prepares for the departure of US troops later this year.In two separate phone calls to Afghanistan’s senior leadership on Monday, Wang laid out what Beijing sees on the road ahead for China-Afghanistan ties. “China hopes that Afghanistan’s future leadership will pursue a moderate Muslim policy, promote a foreign policy of peace, maintain friendship with neighbouring countries, and firmly combat all forms of terrorism. China will continue to play a constructive role in advancing the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan,” Wang told Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar.During another phone call the same day with Hamdullah Mohib, national security adviser to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Wang emphasised that China endorses the “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned” principle, adding that Beijing supports all parties in Afghanistan in finding a broad and inclusive political arrangement through peaceful means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stable-afghanistan-good-for-india-china-us-afghan-envoy-in-beijing-101622646965887.html

Nasa and the CSA first noticed the damage to Canadarm2 during a routine inspection on May 12. The experts from both space agencies took detailed images of the area and assessed the impact on one of Canadarm2's boom segments. They found that the damage was limited to a small section of the "arm boom and thermal blanket."“Despite the impact, results of the ongoing analysis indicate that the arm's performance remains unaffected. The damage is limited to a small section of the arm boom and thermal blanket. A hole approximately 5mm in diameter is visible,” the CSA said in a statement.The amount of orbital debris is continuously increasing as countries are launching space missions more than ever, according to a report jointly prepared by the European Space Agency and UN Office for Outer Space Affairs. The dramatic increase in the number of space launches in the past few years, especially from private companies, has compounded the problem of space junk.Also Read | China's rocket debris spurs calls for policies to mitigate space junkThousands of tons of debris - composed of defunct satellites, rocket bodies and parts of old satellites - pose risk to functional satellites, the ISS, and future missions. Nasa said in its January report that at least 26,000 pieces of space junk that are the size of a softball or larger could destroy a satellite on impact. It warned that over 500,000 pieces of debris are the size of a marble, big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites, and over “100 million the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit.”“The threat of collisions is taken very seriously. Nasa has a long-standing set of guidelines to ensure the safety of Station crew. The safety of astronauts on board the orbiting laboratory remains the top priority of all Station partners,” the CSA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/orbital-debris-hits-international-space-station-punches-hole-in-robotic-arm-101622645980012.html

Addressing a joint press interaction with Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon in Islamabad, Khan said the full potential of the region can be achieved only if the situation in Afghanistan stabilises and there are better ties between Pakistan and India. Following back-channel contacts facilitated by countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, the militaries of India and Pakistan recommitted themselves to the 2009 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. However, efforts initiated by Khan’s government to resume normal trade ties fell through because of opposition to the move within his government. “The challenge for Pakistan is that the full potential of the region will be realised if there is peace in the region,” Khan told the joint media interaction, speaking in Urdu. Referring to Pakistan’s strained relations with India, he said, “Unfortunately, since their unilateral decision on Kashmir on August 5, 2019, and because of the violation of international laws and UN Security Council resolutions, it is very difficult for us to normalise trade with [India] because it will be a betrayal of the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people.” He added, “So till India reverses [these steps], our relations can’t improve.” His remarks were a reiteration of his recent comments that Pakistan can’t normalise ties with India until it reverses its 2019 decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and to split the state into two union territories. India has dismissed Pakistan’s demands as interference in its internal affairs. Khan further said, “If the relations don’t improve, then it will be a loss for India, Pakistan and the whole of Central Asia because the whole region can be connected.” Noting that the Central Asian states can access Pakistan’s Gwadar port for trade, he said, “But if our ties improve [with India], China is one side and Pakistan is in a pivotal position to connect the whole region. But this is all dependent on India rolling back the unilateral steps they took in Kashmir on August 5, 2019. Till they move back, the whole matter is stuck here.” Khan said he and Rahmon had discussed trade and investment and challenges such as climate change and the security situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of the drawdown of US forces. “We need peace in Afghanistan. If the US leaves without a political settlement, like when the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, the resulting situation could lead to losses for Pakistan and Tajikistan. It could affect connectivity and trade and we [Pakistan and Tajikistan] fear that terrorism could increase,” he added. Pakistan and Tajikistan want a political settlement in Afghanistan that leads to stability and a government formed through consensus, and both countries will work with other nations for such a settlement, Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roll-back-2019-decision-on-kashmir-for-better-pakistan-india-ties-says-pm-imran-khan-101622643605678.html

Malaysia had earlier said it will summon the Chinese envoy to protest over an intrusion by 16 military aircraft into its airspace.On Monday, Malaysia’s armed forces said they had detected “suspicious” air activities over its administered area in the disputed South China Sea (SCS) region.Malaysia’s air force added that it had detected 16 Chinese planes - People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force - flying within 60 nautical miles off Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo on Monday, calling it a “suspicious” activity over the SCS and a “serious threat to national sovereignty and flight safety,” according to a Reuters report on Wednesday.Foreign minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he will summon the Chinese ambassador to explain “this breach of the Malaysian airspace and sovereignty”.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry dismissed the allegations. “To my knowledge, it was a routine training conducted by China’s air force over waters to the south of Nansha Islands. It doesn’t target any country,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a briefing.“During the training, China’s air force strictly complied with international law and didn’t enter the air space of any other country. The Chinese side has communicated with the Malaysian side over this,” Wang added.Chinese state media report said that the country’s air force “…reportedly dispatched 16 aircraft comprising strategic transport planes to the South China Sea for routine flight training on Monday, without violating the airspace of other countries”.“China and Malaysia are friendly neighbours, and China is willing to continue bilateral friendly consultations with Malaysia to jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” a Chinese embassy spokesperson in Kuala Lumpur was quoted as saying.China claims almost the entire South China Sea, citing historical records.Several countries including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have overlapping claims.Tensions in the maritime region have increased since China built several man-made islands and turned them into military outposts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-malaysia-locked-in-tense-stand-off-over-fighter-aircraft-intrusion-101622642825875.html
02-06-2021||World||Myocarditis: All you need to know about disease linked to Covid-19||Israel on Tuesday reported a small number of heart inflammation cases, known as myocarditis, mostly in young men who were given shots of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The country's health ministry said 275 such cases were reported out of 5 million people who were vaccinated from December 2020 to May 2021.A study commissioned by the Israeli health ministry said "there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30".The health ministry said 95% of the cases were mild and most patients spent no more than four days in the hospital. Israel has not put a pause on its vaccine roll-out; in fact, the Pfizer vaccine has been greenlighted for inoculating 12-15 year olds.Here’s all you need to know about the disease afflicting a minor population of young vaccine recipients:Myocarditis leads to an inflammation of the heart muscle. The inflammation weakens and enlarges the heart by creating scar tissue and forcing it to pump harder to circulate blood and oxygen throughout the body. Cardiovascular diseases are usually geriatric (related to old people) but myocarditis abide by no such age restrictions.According to Myocarditis Foundation, a body of physicians and researchers, the disease can affect anyone from young adults to kids and even infants. The high-risk population includes those who have reached puberty through their early 30’s. It affects males twice as often as females. It is also the third leading cause of sudden death in children and young adults.Viral infections can cause myocarditis and it starts with the invasion of the human body by a pathogen which replicates within and around myocardium causing myonecrosis. Myocarditis can also be triggered by natural toxins like snake venom.Patients with myocarditis experience symptoms of fatigue, chest pain, lightheadedness, swelling of feet and ankle, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. Many others likely have mild symptoms and are never diagnosed, according to researchers. However, a majority of patients exhibit no visible symptoms and hence this disease goes undiagnosed in large stretches of the population.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US too started to look into reports of Pfizer vaccine linked myocarditis in young recipients on May 22. The CDC said this condition was more prevalent among young males who had gotten their second dose. "Most cases appear to be mild, and follow-up of cases is ongoing," the CDC told reporters.Researchers have cautioned against pausing vaccination since Covid-19 itself can cause myocarditis and a plethora of other issues, adding that the benefits of vaccinating far outweighs the risk. A fact that Israel's pandemic-response coordinator Nachman Ash reiterated to Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myocarditis-all-you-need-to-know-about-disease-linked-to-covid19-101622640325008.html

State media reported 400 troops on board fled the vessel, with some 20 suffering injuries.The vessel sank near the Iranian port of Jask, some 1,270 kilometers (790 miles) southeast of Tehran on the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz — the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf. Satellite photos from Planet Labs Inc. analyzed by The Associated Press showed the Kharg off Jask with no sign of a fire as late as 11 a.m. Tuesday.Photos circulated on Iranian social media of sailors wearing life jackets evacuating the vessel as a fire burned behind them. Fars published video of thick, black smoke rising from the ship early Wednesday morning. Satellites from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that track fires from space detected a blaze near Jask that started just before the time of the fire reported by Fars.Iranian officials offered no cause for the fire aboard the Kharg, though they said an investigation had begun. It comes after a series of mysterious explosions that began in 2019 targeting commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. Navy later accused Iran of targeting the ships with limpet mines, timed explosives typically attached by divers to a vessel’s hull.Iran denied that, though U.S. Navy footage showed Revolutionary Guard members removing one unexploded limpet mine from a ship. The attacks came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Negotiations on saving the accord continue in Vienna.In April, an Iranian ship called the MV Saviz believed to be a Guard base and anchored for years in the Red Sea off Yemen was targeted in an attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel. It escalated a yearslong shadow war in the Mideast between the two countries, ranging from strikes in Syria, assaults on ships and attacks on Iran's nuclear program.The Israeli prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday regarding the Kharg.State TV and semiofficial news agencies on Wednesday referred to the Kharg, named after the island that serves as the main oil terminal for Iran, as a “training ship.” It was one of a few vessels in the Iranian navy capable of providing replenishment at sea for other ships. It also can lift heavy cargo and serve as a launch point for helicopters.Like much of Iran's major military hardware, the Kharg dated back to before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. The warship, built in Britain and launched in 1977, entered the Iranian navy in 1984 after lengthy negotiations. That aging military equipment has seen fatal accidents as recently as Tuesday, when a malfunction in the ejector seats of an Iranian F-5 dating back to before the revolution killed two pilots while the aircraft was parked in a hangar.In recent months, the navy launched a slightly larger commercial tanker called the Makran that it converted into serving a similar function as the Kharg.The sinking of the Kharg marks the latest naval disaster for Iran. In 2020, during an Iranian military training exercise, a missile mistakenly struck a naval vessel near Jask, killing 19 sailors and wounding 15. Also in 2018, an Iranian navy destroyer sank in the Caspian Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-largest-warship-kharg-catches-fire-sinks-in-gulf-of-oman-101622640059818.html
02-06-2021||World||Wuhan lab leak theory’s revival risks making US-China relations worse||Of all the issues that have roiled ties between China and the West since the pandemic emerged, none has been more sensitive in Beijing than questions about the origin of Covid-19.China last year responded to U.S. ally Australia’s initial push for an independent probe into where the virus came from with tariffs on exports of its barley and wine. Since then Beijing has repeatedly blasted calls for more transparency as politically motivated, and sought to deflect suggestions it came from a laboratory in Wuhan with alternative origin theories ranging from transmission via frozen-food imports to a release from U.S. bio-facilities.That made U.S. President Joe Biden’s revival of the lab theory last week -- by giving intelligence agencies 90 days to get closer to a definitive conclusion on the origin of the coronavirus -- all the more meaningful. The order came as political pressure increased following a series of reports suggesting the theory, which was prominently backed by Trump administration officials, had been prematurely disregarded. Even Facebook Inc. said it would stop taking down posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made or manufactured.The origin probe comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations, with both governments showing signs they want to move beyond the vitriol that marked the last year of Donald Trump’s presidency. While Biden has kept in place Trump’s tariffs and sanctions against Beijing, his administration has also started to open a dialogue: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held her first call with Vice Premier Liu He on Tuesday evening in Washington, following his conversation last week with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.But the results of the lab leak probe could tie the hands of Xi Jinping, particularly if comes just before he has an opportunity to meet Biden at the Group of 20 summit in October. While Xi realizes that China’s aggressive response has hurt its standing abroad -- this week he urged officials to create a “trustworthy, lovable and respectable” image for the country -- the Chinese Communist Party has little choice but to vigorously resist any suggestion it mishandled or covered up a virus that effectively shut down the world.“The issue of the origin of the virus is deeply connected to the legitimacy of the CCP, so I do not expect that China will become more transparent -- it will fight this relentlessly,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., a Washington-based policy research group.“That said, China is unlikely to use the forms of economic coercion against the U.S. that it is using against Australia, in part because it fears U.S. retaliation in the form of further restrictions on high-tech,” she added. “It also fears the downward spiral of the U.S.-China relationship to dangerous levels.”Also Read | China must hand over the keys to Wuhan lab for Covid-19 origins and global goodSince the early days of the pandemic, some U.S. intelligence officials have suggested SARS-CoV-2 -- the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 -- may have leaked either accidentally or deliberately from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Researchers at a high-tech lab there have studied other coronaviruses, including some that were isolated from bats.A World Health Organization report drafted with China earlier this year called the possibility of a lab leak “extremely unlikely” because no such virus was studied there before the outbreak and security protocols don’t appear to have been breached. The report, compiled with local researchers after Beijing finally allowed a group of WHO experts into Wuhan, said the most likely origin scenario was that the virus spread to humans from bats through an unspecified intermediary animal.Still, the White House criticized the report as incomplete, while WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it wasn’t “extensive enough” and that the lab-leak theory needed more investigation. Other prominent Western scientists have urged that hypotheses about natural and laboratory spillovers be taken seriously until there is sufficient data to say otherwise.While Biden’s move to publicly announce the virus probe appeared “purely political,” Tedros’s criticism of the WHO report is harder for China to dismiss “and it’s driving them crazy,” according to Christopher Johnson, a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Either way, he added, China is unlikely to allow anymore access that would shed further light on the origin.“Finding a smoking gun on this would be nearly impossible, so the only way you could deescalate is to actually be talking to each other,” Johnson said. “Without that, the potential to inflame the relationship further is there.”Chinese diplomats and senior officials at the Wuhan lab have repeatedly denied that the facility was the source of the coronavirus. Responding to the Biden probe, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian last week pointed to the WHO findings while questioning why U.S. intelligence agencies were getting involved.“How can anyone trust the findings from an ‘investigation’ conducted by such an intelligence organ with no credibility to speak of?” he said on May 27.Zhao also pointed to “suspicion-shrouded” Fort Detrick in Maryland, a base that is home to the American bio-defense agency. This was a repeat of a theory Zhao has long pushed that the virus may have originated in the U.S. Chinese officials have emphasized research showing evidence of coronavirus infections outside China in late 2019 and pointed to frozen food imports as a possible vector -- all part of efforts to cast doubt that the virus originated in or around Wuhan, the central Chinese city that saw the first known Covid-19 cases.Biden’s intelligence directive now ensures the discussion will continue for at least the next several months, and U.S.-China ties could get even worse if the probe ends up fingering Chinese officials, according to Hugo Brennan, an analyst at risk consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft.“If the U.S. intelligence community concludes that the ‘Wuhan lab leak’ theory is the most likely cause of the pandemic, it will see U.S.-China relations plummet to new lows,” he said. “Particularly if the consensus is that Beijing deliberately tried to cover up the leak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-leak-theory-s-revival-risks-making-us-china-relations-worse-101622635641598.html
02-06-2021||World||Israel finds possible link between Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and Myocarditis disease||Israel health officials have found a probable link between Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus vaccine and dozens of cases of heart inflammation in young men following the second dose of the vaccine, the Health Ministry said late Tuesday.The vaccine has been administered to more than 5 million people in the country, and the number of coronavirus cases has plummeted. The Health Ministry said on Wednesday that despite the possible link, it would expand its vaccination drive to 12-16 year olds. The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized its use for this age group.According to a study by health officials, there were 275 cases of myocarditis identified between December 2020, when the vaccination drive began, and May 2021, including 148 cases within a month after vaccination. Of these, 27 cases occurred after the first dose and 121 following the second dose. In both cases, about half were in people with previous medical conditions.At this time, there’s still no indication that the cases are due to the vaccine, Pfizer said in a statement. Myocarditis is often caused by viral infections, and Covid infections have been reported to cause the condition, the U.S. drugmaker said. BioNTech said more than 300 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the “benefit risk profile” of the vaccine remains positive.“A careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded,” the company said. “Adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, are being regularly and thoroughly reviewed by the companies as well as by regulatory authorities.”Most of the cases occurred in young men, especially those between 16 and 19 years old. In most cases, patients were hospitalized for four days or less, and in 95% of the cases were classified as mild, the ministry said.“The risks from contracting coronavirus are higher than the risks from getting the vaccine,” the Health Ministry said.

Increase the appeal and effectiveness of China’s international communication, Xi said.Xi made the remarks on Monday addressing a group study session of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) Central Committee.Xi’s remarks on the need to carefully mould China’s global image comes in the backdrop of a diplomatically more aggressive Beijing as it tries to counter western criticism on a range of issues including the origins of the Covid-19 virus, allegations of human rights abuses and territorial disputes.Under Xi, who took over the reins in 2012, China has cast aside the CPC’s famous “hide-and-bide” strategy of keeping a low international profile in favour of “big country diplomacy” especially with the US and its allies like Australia.China needed to develop an “international voice” to match its national strength and global status, official news agency Xinhua said, citing Xi’s speech at the meeting.It also needed to strengthen propaganda efforts to help foreigners understand the CPC and the way it “strives for the happiness of the Chinese people”.“He also emphasised the efforts to introduce the Chinese culture abroad and strive to shape a reliable, admirable and respectable image of China,” the Xinhua said.The country needed to create a team of professionals and adopt “precise communication methods” for different regions, he said.It’s the second time in a week that Xi has spoken about presenting a better picture of China to the world.In a letter to China’s flagship English newspaper, China Daily, on its 40th anniversary on June 1, Xi said, “It should also better introduce China’s development philosophy, path and achievements, better present a true, multidimensional and panoramic view of China and make new contributions to promoting exchanges and communication between China and the world.”Xi’s messages come amid frequent criticism of foreign journalists’ reportage on China by the government and the state media.Calling it a response to the way Chinese journalists were treated in the US, Beijing last year expelled several journalists working for US news organisations as relations between the two sides deteriorated over several problems.Separately, Beijing banned BBC World News from mainland Chinese television networks after criticising the British broadcaster’s coverage of human rights in the northwestern region of Xinjiang as well as the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-global-image-should-be-reliable-admirable-president-101622633825159.html
02-06-2021||World||‘Our society is totally nuts’: Fauci emails on public fascination with him||In the early days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci was seen by many as a reassuring voice of reason when the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic was deemed chaotic. Fauci’s stance on Covid response, contradictory to then-President Donald Trump, won him admirers to a point that various merchandise named after the respected scientist became a huge hit in the American market.But the latest trove of emails obtained by The Washington Post as part of a Freedom of Information Act request shows that the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was not pleased by the growing public fascination with him. On March 31, one of Fauci's colleagues sent him an article titled ‘Fauci socks, Fauci doughnuts, Fauci fan art: The coronavirus expert attracts a cult following.’“Truly surrealistic. Hopefully, this all stops soon,” Fauci replied, as per the emails published by the Post. In another note, he said, “It is not at all pleasant, that is for sure.”Also Read | When Fauci likened Trump supporters to 'crazy people in this world'A week later, Fauci received a Google News alert for his name, prompting the immunologist, who was then 79-years-old, to forward it to someone whose name and email address have been redacted in The Washington Post report. One of the articles was titled "‘Cuomo Crush' and ‘Fauci Fever’ — Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet". Urging the person to click on the link, Fauci wrote, “It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts.”Fauci’s security detail was also expanded to full time after he started receiving death threats from Trump supporters and, as recounted by him in a New York Times interview, even received a letter in the mail with a powdered substance in it. George Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote to Fauci saying, “I saw some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such a irrational situation.”“Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replied, as per the published correspondence. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-society-is-totally-nuts-fauci-emails-on-public-fascination-with-him-101622628426692.html

Rockets and missiles fired by Palestinian factions killed 13 people in Israel."What is really needed is political leadership on all sides to avoid that people yet again are in the line of fire because of yet again another round of escalation," Mardini said."Political leadership to find a sustainable solution that is more sustainable than what we have been witnessing over the past decade and more."Asked whether he would discuss the prospects of a new prisoners' swap deal while the region, Mardini said the ICRC stood ready to help the parties should there be a deal."We have repeatedly offered our services as a neutral intermediary, so we will be renewing this offer yet again," he said.Standing by the rubble of the houses of Kolak family, which lost 22 members in Israeli airstrikes, Mardini spoke to some survivors."My grandfather died, my father died, his (father's) son died, his grandchild died, a dynasty was martyred," said Wasim Al-Kolak, 31, urging international prosecution of Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-cross-chief-urges-israel-palestine-to-end-cycle-of-violence-101622628250916.html
02-06-2021||World||Labor veteran Isaac Herzog elected as Israel's president||Isaac Herzog, a veteran politician and the scion of a prominent Israeli family, was elected president Tuesday, a largely ceremonial role that is meant to serve as the nation’s moral compass and promote unity.The anonymous vote was held among the 120 members of the Knesset, or parliament. Herzog will be Israel's 11th president, succeeding Reuven Rivlin, who is set to leave office next month after seven years in office.Herzog, 60, is a former head of Israel’s Labor Party and opposition leader who unsuccessfully ran against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the 2013 parliamentary elections.He is scion of a prominent Zionist family. His father, Chaim Herzog, was Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations before being elected president. His uncle, Abba Eban, was Israel’s first foreign minister and ambassador to the United Nations and United States. His grandfather was the country’s first chief rabbi.Herzog defeated Miriam Peretz, an educator who is seen as a down-to-earth outsider. She was also seen as closer to the country's dominant conservative and nationalist political camp.Herzog has served as head of the Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that works closely with the government to promote immigration to Israel, for the past three years since resigning from parliament. He was widely seen as the favorite because of his deep ties to the political establishment. He will hold office for a single seven-year term starting July 9.The president, while largely a ceremonial head of state, is tasked with tapping a political party leader to form governing coalitions after parliamentary elections. Israel has held four national elections in the past two years amid a protracted political crisis.Netanyahu's opponents faced a midnight deadline Wednesday to put together a new coalition government. If they fail, the country could be plunged into another election campaign.The president also has the power to grant pardons — creating a potentially sensitive situation as Netanyahu stands trial for a series of corruption charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labor-veteran-isaac-herzog-elected-as-israel-s-president-101622627750649.html
02-06-2021||World||Russian upper house votes to exit from treaty allowing overflight surveillance||The Russian parliament's upper house voted Wednesday to withdraw from an international treaty allowing surveillance flights over military facilities following the US exit from the treaty.The vote comes after US officials told Moscow last month that President Joe Biden's administration had decided not to reenter the Open Skies Treaty, which had allowed surveillance flights over military facilities before President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact.As a presidential candidate, Biden had criticized Trump’s withdrawal as “short-sighted.” Moscow has signaled its readiness to reverse the withdrawal procedure and stay in the 1992 treaty if the United States returns to the agreement.After the Russian upper house voted to leave the treaty, it would now come to Russian President Vladimir Putin for signing. If Putin endorses the exit, it would take effect in six months.Putin and Biden are to have a summit in Geneva on June 16. The meeting comes as Russia-US ties have sunk to the lowest levels since the Cold War times after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the accusations of Moscow's interference in US elections, hacking attacks, and other irritants.The Open Skies Treaty was intended to build trust between Russia and the West by allowing the accord’s more than three dozen signatories to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other’s territories to collect information about military forces and activities. More than 1,500 flights have been conducted under the treaty since it took effect in 2002, aimed at fostering transparency and allowing for the monitoring of arms control and other agreements.Trump pulled out of the pact last year, arguing that Russian violations made it untenable for Washington to remain a party. Washington completed its withdrawal from the treaty in November.Moscow has deplored the US withdrawal, warning that it will erode global security by making it more difficult for governments to interpret the intentions of other nations, particularly amid heightened Russia-West tensions.The European Union has urged the US to reconsider its exit and called on Russia to stay in the pact and lift flight restrictions, notably over its westernmost Kaliningrad region, which lies between NATO allies Lithuania and Poland.Russia has insisted the restrictions on observation flights it imposed in the past were permissible under the treaty and noted that the US imposed more sweeping restrictions on observation flights over Alaska.As a condition for staying in the pact after the US pullout, Moscow has unsuccessfully pushed for guarantees from NATO allies that they wouldn’t hand over the data collected during their observation flights over Russia to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-upper-house-votes-to-exit-from-treaty-allowing-overflight-surveillance-101622625966072.html
02-06-2021||World||Why a herd of 15 elephants has Chinese enthralled and officials worried||A herd of 15 wild elephants has captured national attention in China after walking through forests, highways, and urban areas for 500km over weeks, reaching the outskirts of Kunming city in southern Yunnan on Wednesday afternoon.The herd was in Yuxi, about 20km from Kunming, a city of seven million, the state-run Xinhua news agency said.Officials were scampering to issue early warnings and evacuate citizens to minimise damage in inhabited areas at the city border.Images taken by drones show six female, three male adults, three juveniles and three calves. The herd of Asian elephants has been followed by hundreds of forest officials in vehicles attempting to divert them away from populated areas with food, and by putting up temporary blockades.Traffic had to be suspended on the roads the herd took. They passed through several counties and occasionally wandered into villages and towns, triggering both alarm and awe.Television journalists have pursued the elephants, streaming live footage of the animals’ marathon migration onto social media platforms.Hundreds of millions of online users in China have followed the journey as the animals moved from one location to the other, leaving behind a trail of frantic forest officials. So far, they have “…wreaked havoc in 412 cases, damaging 56 hectares of farmland in the counties of Yuanjiang and Shiping alone, incurring direct economic losses of about 6.8 million yuan ($1.1 million).”“On the evening of May 27, they came upon the town of E’shan and walked the streets for six hours after authorities evacuated pedestrians and vehicles and warned residents to stay indoors,” the Xinhua report said.Until Tuesday, more than 360 people, 76 police cars and dirt trucks and nine drones were mobilised while 18 tonnes of elephant food had been prepared to lure the elephants from populated areas.Chinese wildlife authorities have told Chinese state media they don’t know why the herd left a nature reserve last year near the city of Pu’er, a region famous for its tea in Yunnan.The group had 16 animals, but the government says two drifted away to return to the forest reserve and a baby was born during the walk.Scientists are scratching their heads about the possible reason behind the walk.Chen Mingyong, an Asian elephant expert cited by Xinhua, said the incident was the longest-distance migration of wild elephants recorded in China.Chen said it was possible their leader “lacks experience and led the whole group astray”.Elephant researcher Becky Shu Chen told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) that the herd might have become fearful and could now be driven by stress and panic.Chen, who researches on human-elephant interaction and works for the Zoological Society of London, said the last such movement of China’s elephants was probably about 400 years ago, when elephants roamed from the jungles of southern Yunnan to the waters of the Yellow River, thousands of kilometres north.“China has only about 1%, or about 300, of the world’s wild Asian elephants and their habitat is confined to the southernmost parts of Yunnan - the prefectures of Xishuangbanna, Lincang and Puer,” the SCMP report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-a-herd-of-15-elephants-has-chinese-enthralled-and-officials-worried-101622624824770.html
02-06-2021||World||Pride month: All you need to know about American gay rights activist Frank Kameny||As the world celebrates Pride Month in June, Google honoured American gay rights activist Franklin Edward Kameny with a doodle on Tuesday. Kameny, hailed as one of the most prominent figures of the LGBTQ+ rights movement in the United States, is credited for creating one of the first gay rights advocacy groups in the country's history.In 1957, the then 32-year-old Kameny was denied federal employment for being gay. After being dismissed from his position as an astronomer in the US army, he became the first gay rights activist to file an appeal in the US Supreme Court. He was also among the first to challenge the American Psychiatric Association's classification of homosexuality as a 'mental disorder' in the early 1970s.In celebration of Pride Month, today’s #GoogleDoodle honors astronomer, veteran, & gay rights activist, Dr. Frank Kameny—an influential figure in the LGBTQ rights movement 🔭🌈❤️→ https://t.co/7gcVY14Jdi pic.twitter.com/jprSZhKeN1Though his appeal to the SC was denied, from that point onwards began his lifelong struggle to fight the system that denied equal opportunities to homosexuals.Born in 1925 in Queens, New York, Kameny graduated from Harvard University with both a master's degree and a doctorate in astronomy in 1956 before becoming properly involved in activism. After being fired from the Army Map Service in 1957, he began launching spearheading against homosexuality from 1961 onwards.The landmark 1975 lifting of the ban on hiring LGBTQ employees in the Civil Service Commission is seen as a direct result of his efforts against the homosexual policies of the American government.The Pride Month, observed to pay homage to those who took part in protests against a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, is marked by the LGBTQ+ community showcasing support for the cause from across the world. The police raids, when they became violent, gave birth to the uprising by various lesbian and gay communities, eventually leading to the gay liberation movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pride-month-all-you-need-to-know-about-american-gay-rights-activist-frank-kameny-101622617082882.html
02-06-2021||World||Netanyahu rivals face midnight deadline to oust Israel's longest-serving leader||Rivals of Benjamin Netanyahu are up against a midnight Wednesday deadline to lock down a new government that would unseat Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.The camp led by the centrist Yair Lapid and the Jewish nationalist Naftali Bennett appeared to edge closer to its goal after two additional parties lined up on Tuesday behind the emerging coalition, including the United Arab List. Lapid, who was handed the mandate to form Israel’s next government last month after Netanyahu failed, is scrambling to finalize agreements with additional partners to approach a parliamentary majority.The rival bloc is made up of a factions with wildly different political views that have united in the effort to end Netanyahu’s 12-year run in power. The prime minister has been railing against the tie-up, claiming that the inclusion of left-wing and Arab parties presents a danger to the country, which has just come off an 11-day conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza and faces what he characterizes as an existential threat from Iran’s nuclear program.One of the remaining sticking points that his opponents need to overcome is a disagreement between Bennett’s Yamina party and one of the left-wing groups over the makeup of a committee to appoint judges, Israeli media reported. Yamina seeks to curb the powers of judges to overturn laws.The Bennett-Lapid bloc need a plurality of parliament’s 120 members to vote in favor of their government, otherwise their efforts collapse and Israel likely heads to a fifth election in 2 1/2 years. As things stand, they have locked up the support of 51 lawmakers and ultimately plan to rely on the backing of 61, the slimmest parliamentary majority.Israel’s political turmoil is rooted in Netanyahu’s corruption trial, which has divided the country and resulted in four rounds of inconclusive balloting. The prime minister maintains that he did nothing wrong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-rivals-face-midnight-deadline-to-oust-israel-s-longest-serving-leader-101622623185491.html
02-06-2021||World||Hong Kong coronavirus panel agrees to lower vaccination age to 12||Hong Kong’s expert advisory panel on Covid vaccinations has agreed to expand eligibility to children as young as 12, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the city works to boost lackluster inoculation rates.The younger group will be eligible to receive BioNTech SE vaccines, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal plans. Still, the move is subject to final approval by the government, the person added. The recommendation was earlier reported by Cable TV.Hong Kong’s government said it has received an application about lowering of the age limit for BioNTech vaccines to people as young as 12 and the relevant phase-three clinical trial data from Fosun Pharma, the distributor of BioNTech vaccine in Greater China, according to a statement on Tuesday.“The Secretary for Food and Health will consider the suggestions by the advisory panel,” it said. “It is expected that a decision on the application for lowering the age limit for vaccination can be reached in short time.”The government has routinely followed the panel’s vaccine recommendations, usually within days.That move follows approvals from the US and Canada, paving the way for the mass vaccination of students before the start of the next school year. Singapore also authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE for children as young as 12 years old earlier in May.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a campaign on Monday to accelerate the city’s slow inoculation rates by September, with measures such as paid leave for vaccinated civil servants and possible additional restrictions for unvaccinated citizens. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority urged all financial institutions to “strongly encourage” staff in client-facing roles or support functions to get vaccinated.Hong Kong is increasingly looking to enlist businesses in the vaccination rollout, which has been impeded by a lack of trust in the Beijing-backed government and concerns about rare side-effects. The government has been ramping up efforts to encourage citizens to receive vaccines by providing policy incentives like reopening bars and shortening the quarantine period for vaccinated people.In April, the government opened up vaccines to residents aged 16 and older. People 16 and above are allowed to receive BioNTech vaccines, while those older than 18 can opt for shots made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Those under 18 need parental consent to be vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-coronavirus-panel-agrees-to-lower-vaccination-age-to-12-101622615716482.html
02-06-2021||World||A third child? No, thanks, say young Chinese||China wants its women to have more children but for many young people, the government's big promises of support mean little because of soaring living costs and changing mindsets about families.On Monday, the world's most populous nation further relaxed its strict family planning controls, allowing couples to have three children after just 12 million Chinese were born last year -- a record low.But high costs, limited space and social norms shaped by decades of limits on family size will impede efforts to boost China's 1.41 billion population, experts warn."A lot of the women around me are quite repulsed by the idea of having children," 22-year-old masters student Yan Jiaqi told AFP in Beijing."So don't even talk about having three," she said.In 2016, China relaxed its "one-child policy" -- one of the world's strictest family planning regulations -- allowing couples to have two children as concerns mounted over an ageing workforce and economic stagnation.The latest easing is part of an increasingly desperate effort to stir a demographic boom before China's remarkable growth story is bogged down by the healthcare and pension bills for hundreds of millions of elderly.For the country's Communist leadership to be successful, it will have to persuade people like Yang Shengyi, a 29-year-old father of two, to have one more child.As he visited a Beijing toy store with his family, Yang said two young sons were already more than enough in the competitive squeeze of China's capital."We don't have that much money and there's not enough space at home, so I don't think there's any reason to have a third child," he told AFP."When our second child was born, there was suddenly only half of everything, and where we could originally give each child 100 percent we can now only give 50 percent."PAYING FOR THE PASTFor others, the thought of having any children at all or even marriage is off the table, as urban life takes its toll -- long working hours, expensive housing, and a punishing ladder into decent education.Young people today "might not have any thoughts of carrying on the family name, and feel that their own quality of life is more important," Yan Jiaqi said.This increasingly pervasive attitude has alarmed China's leaders, prompting Monday's policy pivot.But the vague pledges to support couples -- and women in particular -- with work-life balance if they have more kids did not make fast friends on Chinese social media.Instead, the new policy prompted derision among young Chinese already struggling with intense workplace competition and the pressure of supporting elderly parents without siblings to share the costs, thanks to the "one-child" edict.Social media users circulated memes making light of the idea of having children -- including an image of a discount-price triple-decker bunk bed -- and celebrating the relative financial freedom of childlessness.Others made raunchy jokes about boosting population growth.TOO LATE AND TOO LITTLEExperts say changing socio-economic conditions -- including the intense educational investments families make in their children and women wanting more say in their careers and family lives -- mean the government will need to do more than simply easing the rules."Having just one child or no children has become the social norm in China," Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told AFP.China's fertility rate stands at 1.3 -- below the level needed to maintain a stable population, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Other countries in East Asia have also struggled to boost birth rates, with families shrinking in South Korea, Japan and Singapore despite government incentives.Yi said the relaxed birth policy was "too late and too little", and that China's best hope was to model its policies after Japan, "for example, providing free childcare, free education, housing subsidies for young couples"."Young people are under a lot of pressure," a woman visiting the Bund in Shanghai with her only child, who did not give her name, told AFP."They have no time to take care of kids at home because of work, and if they take care of kids full time, that means no work."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-third-child-no-thanks-say-young-chinese-101622614938374.html
02-06-2021||World||Covid variant found in India threatens to rapidly spread in sub-region: UNHCR||The highly-infectious Covid-19 variant first detected in India “threatens” to rapidly spread in the sub-region, including among refugees, the UN refugee agency has said as it warned of vaccine shortages in the Asia-Pacific region, including for asylum-seekers.United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Andrej Mahecic, at a press briefing in Geneva on Tuesday, said that the fragile health systems in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region have struggled to cope with the recent surge of coronavirus cases.“We are particularly worried about the situation in the Asia and Pacific region, which in the past two months has experienced the largest increase in the number of cases globally,” he said.Over this period, there have been some 38 million recorded Covid-19 cases and more than half a million deaths, the UNHCR spokesperson said.“The lack of hospital beds, oxygen supplies, limited Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacities and scarce health facilities and services have worsened outcomes for those infected with Covid-19, particularly in India and Nepal. The highly infectious variant of the virus which first emerged in India threatens to rapidly spread in the sub-region, including among refugee populations,” Mahecic said.The B.1.617 Covid-19 variant, first detected in India, is divided in three lineages -- B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that only B.1.617.2 is now a “variant of concern,” observing that lower rates of transmission have been observed for the other two lineages, making them no longer variants of concern.The B.1.617.2 is now labelled variant Delta and has been reported in 62 countries as of June 1.With Covid-19 raging in many parts of the world, the UNHCR warned of shortages of vaccines in the Asia-Pacific region, including for refugees and asylum-seekers.UNHCR spokesperson Mahecic said: “We urge an immediate and stronger support for the COVAX initiative, a worldwide effort aimed at achieving equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines."This is critical to save lives and curb the impact of the virus, particularly in developing nations. These countries host the vast majority of more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Yet so far, they have benefited from only a fraction of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines”.The UNHCR stressed that no one can be left behind in the global effort against the coronavirus."The pandemic will be defeated only when vaccinations become available everywhere on an equitable basis,” the agency said.It said that the current delays in vaccine shipments, brought about by limited supplies to COVAX, mean that some of the world’s most vulnerable people remain susceptible to the virus.“The UNHCR is adding its voice to the calls for countries with surplus doses to donate to COVAX, and for manufacturers to boost supplies to the COVAX facility,” Mahecic said.The UN refugee agency said that refugees remain especially vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19 as overcrowded settings, coupled with limited water and sanitation facilities, can contribute to increased infection rates and an exponential spread of the virus.It said that in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, where almost 900,000 Rohingya refugees are living in the single largest and most densely populated cluster of refugee camps in the world, the number of cases has increased considerably in the last two months.As of May 31, there have been over 1,188 cases among the refugees, with more than half of these cases recorded in May alone.There is also a “worrying increase” in the number of Covid-19 cases among refugees and asylum-seekers in Nepal, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.Some refugees, including in Nepal, have already received their first vaccine dose with COVAX-provided supplies while among the Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh, not a single vaccine has been administered yet, given the scarcity of supplies in the country, the UN refugee agency added.On Wednesday, India reported 1,32,788 new coronavirus infections, taking the country's tally to 2,83,07,832, according to the Union Health Ministry.The Covid-19 death toll climbed to 3,35,102 with 3,207 fresh deaths, it said, adding that the active cases were recorded below 20 lakh for the second consecutive day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-found-in-india-threatens-to-rapidly-spread-in-sub-region-unhcr-101622614355390.html

The development comes days after a report in Financial Times claimed the majority of Nestlé's mainstream food and drinks portfolio failed to meet recognised standards of health and nutrition.The Financial Times report on Monday quoted from a Nestle document to say the company has acknowledged that more than 60 per cent of its mainstream food and drinks products do not meet a "recognised definition of health".On Tuesday, Nestle said it has launched a company-wide project to update its nutrition and health strategy. "It is looking at its entire portfolio to ensure that its products are helping meet their nutritional needs and supporting a balanced diet," a Nestle SA spokesperson said.For example, Nestle has reduced the sugar and sodium content in its products significantly in the past two decades, about 14-15 per cent in the past 7 years alone, the spokesperson added. "In recent years, we have launched thousands of products for kids and families that meet external nutrition yardsticks," he said.According to Nestle, it believes that a healthy diet means finding a balance between well-being and enjoyment."This includes having some space for indulgent foods, consumed in moderation. Our direction of travel has not changed and is clear: we will continue to make our portfolio tastier and healthier," the company said.Nestle is the maker of KitKat, Maggi and Nescafe - some of the popular food brands.The Financial Times said that it has seen a presentation circulated among top executives this year which said that only 37 per cent of Nestle's food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system."Within its overall food and drink portfolio, about 70 per cent of Nestle’s food products failed to meet that threshold, the presentation said, along with 96 per cent of beverages - excluding pure coffee - and 99 per cent of Nestle’s confectionery and ice cream portfolio," the media report further stated.Systems like the health star rating and nutri-score are useful in this regard and enable consumers to make informed choices.In India, Nestle is one of the leading players into the packaged food category. It presently operates eight production units in India and had reported net sales of ₹13,290.16 crore for 2020.The Indian market was ranked at number 11 in terms of contribution to Nestle’s global revenue in 2020.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maggi-kitkat-maker-nestle-reviews-strategy-after-damning-report-about-its-food-portfolio-101622613045078.html

Even if they are currently serving sentences in the criminal justice system, all people have a constitutionally protected right to practice their faith.Q: What has been the reaction of the prison authorities and how are you going to deal with what you term as an "egregious incident"?Amrith Kaur: The Arizona Department of Corrections has refused to put in place a policy that will keep them from violating the rights of other people who maintain religiously-mandated hair, even though they are required to do so under US law (namely, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act or RLUIPA). On May 24, 2021, the Sikh Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, and WilmerHale LLP filed a complaint with the US department of justice seeking an investigation of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry for egregious religious freedom violations. Through this complaint filed with the US Department of Justice, we ask that the Arizona Department of Corrections implement a policy that will keep them from violating religious rights in the future.Q: You said ADCRR's arbitrary policies should not violate anyone's religious rights. Can you elaborate on it?Amrith Kaur: Like I said earlier, what happened to Mr Singh at ADCRR was a violation of his religious rights. I want to add that Mr Singh’s faith requires him to maintain unshorn hair, including facial hair. The policies set forth by the Arizona Department of Corrections should not violate his or anyone else’s religious rights.Q: In the case of religious beliefs and the law of the land, what according to you should gain primacy?Amrith Kaur: The freedom of religion is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. These are not mutually exclusive protections; religious freedom is part of US law and the two go hand-in-hand.Q: Don't you think that granting special rights keeping religious sentiments in consideration will open a Pandora's Box considering the prevalent emotionally charged atmosphere across the globe and in the US?Amrith Kaur: The freedom of religion is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, and this freedom extends to all persons even if they are or have been incarcerated. Moreover, incarcerated individuals’ religious freedom is specifically further protected under RLUIPA. Thus, our complaint to the US Department of Justice underscores the need for the Arizona Department of Corrections to implement a policy, as well as a pattern and practice, in line with this constitutionally protected right on behalf of Mr Singh and all other similarly situated persons.Q: Does the prison manual offer Mr Singh any counselling facility? Has he been extended such a facility?Amrith Kaur: Not that we are aware of.Q: Do you think it's time for the state government run law enforcement agencies in the US to undergo a comprehensive race sensitization programme considering the string of such incidents around the country?Amrith Kaur: One of the biggest challenges that we face is the inherent biases that are present within our existing structures and policies. It is important that all government agencies complete a thorough review and analysis of the cultural competency of their policies and practices. Where these policies and practices are treating some religious or racial groups differently from others, agencies should critically review why and whether those policies and practices are violative. Further, agencies should consider updating those policies and practices to be more inclusive, which would be an important step towards protecting all of our civil rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inherent-biases-a-challenge-advocacy-group-on-sikh-man-s-forced-beard-shaving-101622611560958.html
02-06-2021||World||Only one strain of Covid-19 variant found in India now of concern, says WHO||The WHO said Tuesday that only one strain of the Covid-19 Delta variant first detected in India was now considered "of concern", while two other strains had been downgraded.The B.1.617 variant of the virus, which has in part been blamed for India's explosive outbreak, has been dubbed a triple mutant variant since it is split into three lineages.The UN health agency last month declared the entire strain a "variant of concern", or VOC, but on Tuesday, it said only one of the sub-lineages deserved that label.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"It has become evident that greater public health risks are currently associated with B.1.617.2, while lower rates of transmission of other lineages have been observed," the World Health Organization said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic.The B.1.617.2 variant remains a VOC, along with three other variants of the virus that are seen as more dangerous than the original version because they are more transmissible, deadly or have the potential to get past some vaccine protections.In line with a decision announced Monday to refer to the variants using Greek letters, in a bid to avoid the possible stigmatisation associated with referring to them with the name of the countries where they were first detected, that variant has now been dubbed Delta."We continue to observe significantly increased transmissibility and a growing number of countries reporting outbreaks associated with this variant," the UN agency said."Further studies into the impact of this variant remain a high priority for WHO."In fact, a new hybrid variant announced by Vietnam's health authorities on Saturday appears to be a variation of Delta."What we understand is that it is this B.1.617.2 variant with one additional deletion in the location of the spike protein," WHO's technical lead on Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters Tuesday."We know that the B.1.617.2, the Delta variant, does have increased transmissibility, which means it can spread easier between people," she added.The B.1.617.1 sub-lineage has meanwhile been downgraded to a "variant of interest," and dubbed Kappa.And the B.1.617.3 is now not even considered of interest, WHO said, since "relatively few reports of this variant have been submitted to date."It has not been attributed a Greek letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-one-strain-of-covid-19-variant-found-in-india-now-of-concern-says-who-101622604317243.html
02-06-2021||World||China must hand over the keys to Wuhan lab for Covid-19 origins and global good||The ongoing debates on the possible origins of the pandemic are important in their own right. But, no matter where the needle eventually points the debate needs to acknowledge the dragon in the room. No objective, de-politicised discussion on the subject is feasible because of the depth and reach of China’s influence.The debate on the pandemic’s origins can be simply stated. Over thousands of years, viruses, bacteria and parasites that infect other animals sometimes ‘spillover’ to infect humans in close contact. These spillover events most often result in fever or more severe symptoms and usually do not result in human-to-human transmission.One reason why human-to-human transmission is rare is because of the ‘key’ that a virus uses to open the ‘lock’ on the surface of our cells. This key has good fit to open locks on other animals where it has incubated and evolved, but has a poor fit to open locks in humans, which may have similarities but also have substantial differences.Coronaviruses can infect bats but not cause them any significant ill-effect. They grow and multiply in their host and sometimes accumulate mutations that change the genetic code of the key. This randomly happens over decades. Rarely again, you have a new key which has a good fit to the lock in the bats cells but now also has a reasonable fit to the lock on the human cell. This new virus would have never seen a human, yet has the ability to infect one, and cause human-to-human transmission. This is the way natural evolution works.Now, should a human come in close contact — in a bat cave or a wet-market, with such a bat; they could be infected. And then transmit the disease to other humans. This is the natural ‘spillover’ hypothesis.Scientists all over the world research viruses. Such research brings basic knowledge and also gives us the understanding and tools to fight disease. When dealing with known or likely pathogens strict safety rules are required to be observed. Lab-leaks are not unknown but are rare, compared to the huge work on infectious diseases all over the world. Yet, they are not unknown. The smallpox virus has leaked from a lab in the UK, anthrax from the US and SARS-1 may have had a few lab leaks after its natural spillover. The H1N1 virus example is unusual. In a recent piece, The Economist reiterates a lab-leak origin of an engineered virus.ALSO READ: 'There's going to be Covid-26 and Covid-32 unless...': Experts warnCould Sars-CoV2 have emerged from a lab-leak, through an accident? The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is one of the top virology labs in the world and research on corona viruses is intensely conducted there. One kind of research that is alleged to have been conducted is the culturing of coronavirus to enhance its infectivity to human cells or on mice containing a ‘humanised’ receptor for the virus.There are many technical debates, in addition to those in the popular press, on the relative likelihood of the two theories being correct. The animal ‘spillover’ is like buying a winning lottery ticket in a very big lottery. A very rare event for any single person, but still, it happens (only in this case, it is a big loss and not a big win). The lab-leak is akin to rigging the lottery.If the animal-to-human spillover is valid, then there will be animals in the wild, bats or pangolins, that harbour a virus identical to that found on the first cases in Wuhan. This has not been found yet, unlikely to be found soon and there is no indication that the Chinese are on a mission to find such an animal. We, therefore, do not have any proof of wild origin yet, and may not have one ever. The search is difficult in itself, even if it were to be conducted.ALSO READ: Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsPeople have tried to look at the virus’s genome sequence or the kind of experiments conducted at WIV to garner evidence for the lab-leak theory. Just as circumstantial evidence is present to support the wild spillover theory, there is circumstantial evidence to support the lab-leak theory.Normally, the most parsimonious explanation would support a wild spillover. But, for this pandemic, WIV and China need to explain a lot. The lab-spillover can be easily ruled out if WIV opened its books to the WHO team and allowed lab-members to be interviewed. This kind of openness can easily dispel the critics, even as the difficult search for the wild animal that caused the spillover continues. Such an openness is most unlikely from China.The dragon's influence on US scientific researchChina’s lack of openness in this matter only fuels speculation that harms research and collaboration globally on important matters of planetary security and safety. This attitude, sadly, is expected. China has also, over the past few decades steadily established a stranglehold on global research that makes this lack of openness both global and worrisome. Science and technology thrives in an atmosphere of openness, criticism, debate, and competition. The rise of the United States and Europe in the 20th century are examples. Yet, China has risen even though it is a totalitarian state. China’s rise has happened by linking its economic progress to the welcoming of high-tech industry at Faustian and predatory terms. Its stellar scientific progress has happened by investing in western scientists and institutions at extraordinary attractive levels, in a similar Faustian bargain. China has beautifully used the strengths of an open system to build a science and tech economy in the shortest possible time.The West has been sleeping with eyes wide open as China cleverly exploited collaborative routes. This strategy has also made the global economy and global leaders in science, recipients of Chinese largesse in difficult times, unable to be objective about China. Global institutions—banks, trade bodies and health regulators— all moderate their criticism, if at all they criticise. It is not that they do not want to. They cannot. For example, the WHO has asked for a de-politicised environment so an investigation can be done fairly, it is clear that this is a futile statement.The debate on the pandemic’s origins will play its course and the truth will out. It may well be that the wild animal spillover is what occurred. But, this pandemic starkly tells us how dangerous it is for the world to be so dependent on every aspect of the planet’s future on what one big player with a stranglehold on the global economy and technology does. A strong pushback is needed, through an alliance of open and democratic forces who are willing to take the lead. It is a long journey that will take decades to complete. But, as a Chinese saying goes, the time to start is now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-must-hand-over-the-keys-to-wuhan-lab-for-covid-19-origins-and-global-good-101622596751207.html

It also needed to strengthen propaganda efforts to help foreigners understand the Chinese Communist Party and the way it "strives for the happiness of the Chinese people".The country needed to create a team of professionals and adopt "precise communication methods" for different regions, he said.China's relationship with foreign media has become increasingly tense in recent years, with local news outlets such as the Global Times often singling out foreign reporters for what it says is biased and unfair coverage.Several journalists working for U.S. news organisations were expelled last year as relations between the two sides deteriorated.China has also banned BBC World News from mainland Chinese television networks following criticism of the British broadcaster's coverage of human rights in the northwestern region of Xinjiang as well as the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-calls-for-greater-global-media-reach-101622594968245.html
02-06-2021||World||Amazon backs marijuana legalisation, drops weed testing for some jobs||Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it supports a proposed U.S. legislation to legalize cannabis at the federal level, and would drop weed-testing requirements for some recruitments.The e-commerce company's public policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act), which seeks to legalize marijuana at the federal level, its consumer boss Dave Clark said in a blog post.Amazon will also no longer screen its job applicants for marijuana use for any positions not regulated by the Department of Transportation, Clark added.While many U.S. states have legalized marijuana use, employers have so far largely refused to work with the industry as cannabis is still a classified substance at the federal level."In the past, like many employers, we've disqualified people from working at Amazon if they tested positive for marijuana use," Clark said. "However, given where state laws are moving across the U.S., we've changed course."Amazon was hit with a proposed class action suit, which claimed that the company was violating a New York City law by testing applicants for jobs at local facilities for marijuana, according to a Westlaw report. The company does not allow marijuana sales on its platform.Amazon also said it is tweaking its worker productivity tracking tool, "Time off Task.""Starting today, we're now averaging Time off Task over a longer period to ensure that there's more signal and less noise—reinforcing the original intent of the program," Clark said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-backs-marijuana-legalisation-drops-weed-testing-for-some-jobs-101622594508602.html
02-06-2021||World||Finland PM to pay back meal expenses after uproar||Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin is pledging to pay back thousands of euros in meal expenses in a bid to contain the fallout from revelations about her family's taxpayer-subsidised breakfasts.The 35-year-old leader made clear on Tuesday she would no longer claim such expenses after pledging over the weekend to pay back over 14,000 euros ($17,000) she has received in reimbursements for breakfast and cold meals at her residence since taking office a year and a half ago."Because there are open questions regarding the meal allowance, I will pay the related costs myself," she said on Twitter on Saturday, adding that she will make sure the issue is looked into and guidance updated if necessary.On Tuesday she added that "I don't intend to use the meal allowance in future, even if it is ruled to be in line with the regulations," in an interview with broadcaster MTV3.She called for officials to swiftly determine whether the allowance is legal and whether the repayments should be taxed, and said: "I have other work duties to get on with than spending days on end looking into things like my family's food."Marin found herself in hot water a week ago when the tabloid Iltalehti reported that she has been claiming back about 300 euros ($365) per month for her family's breakfasts while living at her official residence, Kesaranta.Upcoming local elections After police and tax officials in the Nordic country pledged to look into the payments, the prime minister's office announced that the bill for breakfast and other cold meals at the residence was in fact 845 euros ($1,033) a week."As prime minister I have not asked for this benefit nor been involved in deciding on it," Marin said on Twitter at the time.Opposition figures have lined up to paint Marin as out of touch for making use of the meals perk, hoping that the revelations will leave a bitter taste in voters' mouths at the local elections in two weeks' time.Finland's low levels of inequality are a source of national pride, and leaders are typically valued for being down to earth and egalitarian.But figures from Marin's own centre-left government coalition, including her predecessor as prime minster Antti Rinne, have expressed their support for the PM.Marin, leader of Finland's Social Democrats, has enjoyed relatively high levels of public support since coming to office in December 2019, and her coalition has been credited with helping Finland maintain some of Europe's lowest coronavirus infection rates.Nonetheless her party currently lags in the polls behind the opposition, while the far-right Finns Party has been predicted to make record gains at municipal ballot boxes on June 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-pm-to-pay-back-meal-expenses-after-uproar-101622593268064.html

02-06-2021||World||US President Joe Biden to suspend oil leases in Alaska's Arctic refuge||The Biden administration is suspending oil and gas leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as it reviews environmental impacts of drilling in the remote region that has been the focus of a political fight for decades, according to two people who have been briefed on the administration's plan.The Interior Department order was set to be announced later Tuesday. It follows a temporary moratorium on oil and gas lease activities imposed by President Joe Biden on his first day in office. Biden’s Jan. 20 executive order suggested a new environmental review was needed to address possible legal flaws in a drilling program approved by the Trump administration under a 2017 law approved by Congress.The people briefed on the plan requested anonymity because the plan had not been officially released.The remote, 19.6 million-acre refuge is home to polar bears, caribou, snowy owls and other wildlife, including migrating birds from six continents. Republicans and the oil industry have long been trying to open the wildlife refuge, considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich’in, for drilling. Democrats, environmental groups and some Alaska Native tribes have been trying to block it.The US Bureau of Land Management, an Interior Department agency, held a lease sale for the refuge’s coastal plain on Jan. 6, two weeks before Biden took office. Eight days later the agency signed leases for nine tracts totaling nearly 685 square miles (1,770 square kilometers). However, the issuance of the leases was not announced publicly until Jan. 19, former President Donald Trump’s last full day in office.Biden has opposed drilling in the region, and environmental groups have been pushing permanent protections, which Biden called for during the presidential campaign.The administration's action to suspend the leases comes after officials disappointed environmental groups last week by defending a Trump administration decision to approve a major oil project on Alaska’s North Slope. Critics say the action flies in the face of Biden’s pledges to address climate change.The Justice Department said in a court filing that opponents of the Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska were seeking to stop development by “cherry-picking” the records of federal agencies to claim environmental review law violations. The filing defends the reviews underpinning last fall’s decision approving project plans.A coalition of groups has sued to invalidate the Trump-era approval. An appeals court earlier this year halted certain construction activities, and parties in the case later agreed to keep in place construction activity limits until Dec. 1 while the underlying case continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-suspend-oil-leases-in-alaska-s-arctic-refuge-101622577992185.html
02-06-2021||World||US to drop charges against man accused in Capitol riot||The Justice Department plans to drop charges against one of the more than 400 Trump supporters it has accused of participating in the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.US prosecutors asked a judge on Tuesday to dismiss all charges against accused rioter Christopher Kelly. It’s the first time the government has given up on a case in the far-reaching criminal investigation of the riot, which led to five deaths. Kelly was accused of unlawful entry and obstruction of an official proceeding, among other offenses.A spokesman for the Justice Department, Marc Raimondi, said the US was dropping the case because the charges against Kelly were “not consistent with what has been the standard across the other investigations.” Unlike other people who were arrested for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Kelly was not accused of committing serious crimes like damaging camera equipment or assaulting police officers.“This one was kind of an anomaly,” Raimondi said. “Most folks that were charged just for being on the grounds were charged if there were additional offenses, or some other serious charge.”Kelly’s lawyer, Edward MacMahon, declined to comment.In an arrest affidavit filed by the government in January, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation laid out a series of social media posts in which Kelly discussed the Jan. 6 protests and circulated a photograph that appeared to show rioters inside the Capitol.Since the storming of the Capitol, federal prosecutors have charged alleged participants with a range of crimes, from disorderly conduct to conspiracy to block the certification of the election results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-drop-charges-against-man-accused-in-capitol-riot-101622577588990.html

His predecessor, Republican President Donald Trump, pulled the US out of the accord in 2018 and imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.The deal places curbs on Iranian nuclear activities in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions.Netanyahu staunchly opposes the agreement, arguing that it does not have enough safeguards to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Israel also says the deal must address Iran's support for militant groups, its military actions across the region and its development of long-range missiles capable of striking Israel.Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only and says the nuclear deal should be reinstated without any changes.Netanyahu spoke about Iran on Tuesday as his rivals in the Knesset huddled to try to form a coalition government that would end Netanyahu's 12-year rule.The developments come amid a fragile truce between Israel and Hamas' militant rulers in the Gaza Strip after a brutal 11-day war that killed more than 250 people, most of them Palestinian.Hamas, which opposes Israel's right to exist and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US and other Western countries, receives millions of dollars of military aid from Iran each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-hope-it-doesn-t-happen-benjamin-netanyahu-says-ready-to-risk-friction-with-us-over-iran-101622572532531.html
02-06-2021||World||US says ransomware attack on meatpacker JBS likely from Russia||The White House said on Tuesday that Brazil's JBS SA has informed the US government that a ransomware attack against the company that has disrupted meat production in North America and Australia originated from a criminal organization likely based in Russia.JBS is the world's largest meatpacker and the incident caused its Australian operations to shut down on Monday and has stopped livestock slaughter at its plants in several US states.The ransomware attack follows one last month by a group with ties to Russia on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, that crippled fuel delivery for several days in the US Southeast.White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States has contacted Russia's government about the matter and that the FBI is investigating."The White House has offered assistance to JBS and our team at the Department of Agriculture have spoken to their leadership several times in the last day," Jean-Pierre said."JBS notified the administration that the ransom demand came from a criminal organization likely based in Russia. The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals," Jean-Pierre added.If the outages continue, consumers could see higher meat prices during summer grilling season in the United States and meat exports could be disrupted at a time of strong demand from China.JBS said it suspended all affected systems and notified authorities. It said its backup servers were not affected."On Sunday, May 30, JBS USA determined that it was the target of an organised cybersecurity attack, affecting some of the servers supporting its North American and Australian IT systems," the company said in a Monday statement."Resolution of the incident will take time, which may delay certain transactions with customers and suppliers," the company's statement said.The company, which has its North American operations headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, controls about 20% of the slaughtering capacity for US cattle and hogs, according to industry estimates.US beef and pork prices are already rising as China increases imports, animal feed costs rise and slaughterhouses face a dearth of workers.The cyberattack on JBS could push US beef prices even higher by tightening supplies, said Brad Lyle, chief financial officer for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture.Any impact on consumers would depend on how long production is down, said Matthew Wiegand, a risk management consultant and commodity broker at FuturesOne in Nebraska."If it lingers for multiple days, you see some food service shortages," Wiegand added.Two kill and fabrication shifts were canceled at JBS's beef plant in Greeley due to the cyberattack, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 said in an email.

Qiu’s Weibo account was also suspended,” the Global Times report said.On March 1, Qiu publicly apologised for the post during a prime-time national news broadcast on China’s state broadcaster, CCTV. “I feel extremely ashamed of myself, and I’m very sorry,” Qiu had said. “My behaviour was an annihilation of conscience.”China has been sensitive about comments perceived to be slanderous about the four PLA soldiers who died and one who was injured in the Galwan Valley clash.At least eight persons in China have so far been arrested, detained or have had proceedings initiated against them for insulting “PLA heroes and martyrs” online.Last week, a permanent resident of the US, Wang Jingyu, 19, wanted by China under similar charges, was freed by Dubai and boarded a flight to Turkey after spending weeks in detention.Beijing, according to The Associated Press, had sought Wang over his comments on the deadly clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers.Wang, a resident of Chongqing city, had questioned on social media why the Chinese government waited six months to release information about PLA casualty figures, sparking a harassment campaign that saw him flee to Istanbul, the AP report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-blogger-sent-to-jail-for-slanderous-comments-on-galwan-valley-clash-101622540094939.html

02-06-2021||India||Nearly 600 doctors died of Covid-19 in India’s deadly second wave||Nearly 600 doctors across India have died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the second wave of the pandemic, according to data compiled by the Indian Medical Association (IMA). Over a sixth of the total 594 deaths so far have happened in Delhi, which experienced one of the worst surges of the viral infection with as many as 28,000 cases being reported in a day at the peak of the second wave. The toll has increased by 174 in two weeks to a total of 594 till Tuesday. This, despite 89% of the healthcare workers receiving at least one shot of the vaccine against Covid-19 so far. In the last wave of the pandemic, 753 doctors had lost their lives, according to the registry maintained by IMA. The highest number of deaths among doctors has been reported in Delhi-NCR, where 107 doctors have succumbed to the infection. The toll includes the deaths of eminent cardiologist Dr KK Agarwal and the senior gastroenterologist who died due to lack of oxygen at Batra Hospital-- Dr RK Himthani. Delhi is followed by Bihar where 96 doctors have died and Uttar Pradesh where 67 doctors have died. Only 17 doctors have died in Maharashtra, which has been consistently reporting a high number of cases, according to the IMA data. The data comes amidst the ongoing controversy with self-styled yoga guru Ramdev calling allopathy a “stupid science”, claiming that 10,000 doctors died despite receiving the shot, and stating that he did not need the Covid-19 shot as he had the dual protection of Ayurveda and Yoga. The doctors have been protesting stating that it insults those who died in the line of duty and creates vaccine hesitancy. “Indian doctors, nurses and healthcare workers have fought tirelessly. 1300 doctors have sacrificed their lives for the nation. Countless children and family members of doctors have been infected. To trivialise these martyrs and warriors is a sacrilege,” said IMA in an open letter to Indians on June 1, which the doctors termed as Black Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-600-doctors-died-of-covid-19-in-india-s-deadly-second-wave-101622657106876.html

The court has also sent him to nine days of judicial custody, rejecting the police’s plea for three more days of custodial interrogation.The two-time Olympic medalist was produced before Metropolitan Magistrate Rashmi Gupta at the end of his four-day police custody and was ordered to be sent to judicial custody for nine days. “As per the settled law, PC [police custody] remand should not be granted in a mechanical manner. It should be granted only when the situation warrants and it is justified,” PTI quoted magistrate Gupta as saying.Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, the co-accused in the case, has also been sent to nine-day judicial custody by the court.Meanwhile, additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the Delhi Police, told the court that Kumar was not cooperating in the investigation. He further said that the police custody was needed to recover his mobile phone and weapon of offence. The prosecutor also asked for the CCTV camera recordings at Kumar’s residence, his clothes during the incident need to be recovered and Kumar to be confronted with his associates, who were also arrested.However, Sushil Kumar’s advocate Pradeep Rana said that he had already been taken to Bhatinda for the recovery of the mobile phone and to Haridwar for the recovery of the video and his clothes.Kumar was arrested earlier on May 23 after which the court ordered six-day police custody and further extended it by four more days. He is currently facing charges of murder, culpable homicide and kidnapping, for the assault of Sagar Dhankar and his friends Sonu Mahal and Amit Kumar regarding a property dispute. Dhankar, 23, eventually succumbed to his injuries. The police have termed Kumar as the ‘mastermind’ of the alleged murder. Police have also said that electronic evidence is available of Kumar and his associates assaulting Dhankar with sticks.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-sends-olympian-sushil-kumar-to-judicial-custody-rejects-police-plea-for-extending-custodial-interrogation-101622655169638.html

Whatever help is needed by them, must be made available forthwith," it said.As on May 29 this year, the number of patients suffering from mucormycosis in Nagpur city was 1,584 and out of these patients 830 have been operated upon so far, the court said, adding that it means that more than 50 per cent of the affected patients have undergone surgery as part of the treatment given to them.The data further shows that out of 1,584 patients, surgical removal of eyeball has taken place in 74 cases and so far 69 patients have succumbed to the disease, it said."It appears from these figures that in Nagpur city this is no longer a rare fungal infection, that it has already become common, and it has assumed a form of an epidemic," it said.The court said that the Centre as well as the state government has to ensure at all cost that Amphotericin B (Lipid Complex) and Amphotericin B (Liposomal) and Echinocandian, which are presently considered to be effective in mucormycosis treatment, remain in adequate supply.The court was informed by the Centre that the expected production of Amphotericin B from the existing five manufacturers is likely to increase in June to 2,55,114 vials, and 1,02,000 more vials are expected to be produced in June."However, it is not known as to how many and how these allocations have been made, whether randomly or by considering the caseload in Maharashtra," the court said.Whatever be the method adopted for making allocations, the fact remains that Maharashtra, in particular Nagpur city, having very high prevalence of mucormycosis infection remain in crying state for Amphotericin B.In spite of having so many patients in the state, major part of it is in Nagpur, patients are not getting enough number of vials per day for the treatment because of deficit allocation and short supply of Amphotericin B to Maharashtra, it said."We hope that these entreaties would be positively answered by the Central government and if not, further loss of lives of a few more patients, unfortunate as it may be, may be a fait accompli," court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mucormycosis-no-more-rare-disease-in-nagpur-ensure-supply-of-medicines-bombay-hc-to-maharashtra-government-101622651657550.html

Wouldn’t that amount to institutional breakdown?” the sources questioned further.Citing India’s three-tier structure of centre, state and panchayati raj, sources said there would be “anarchy” if district magistrates or other officers in a district or block where a rival party is heading the district council or the panchayat refuse to coordinate with the chief secretary or other designated officers.Also Read | Centre stuns Mamata Banerjee, transfers top Bengal official to Delhi after rowJust hours after the May 28 episode, the Centre’s department of personnel and training (DoPT) transferred Bandyopadhyay to Delhi, asking him to report to duty at 10am on May 31. However, the West Bengal government refused to relieve him. Bandyopadhyay retired as chief secretary on May 31 and was appointed by CM Mamata Banerjee as her special advisor. Bandyopadhyay, who was scheduled to retire on this date but was on a three-month extension, was issued a show-cause notice for not reporting to duty as directed by the DoPT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caused-severe-dent-to-ias-govt-sources-on-former-bengal-chief-secretary-bandyopadhyay-101622649129269.html
02-06-2021||India||SC says constitution doesn't envisage courts to be silent spectators when citizens' rights infringed||The Indian Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when rights of citizens are infringed upon by executive policies, the Supreme Court has said while dealing with the Centre's submission that courts should not interfere with its decisions on management of Covid-19.The apex court said that in grappling with the second wave of the Covid pandemic, it does not intend to second-guess the wisdom of the executive when it chooses between two competing and efficacious policy measures.The court said it will however continue to exercise jurisdiction to determine "if the chosen policy conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons".A special bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said that it is trite to state that separation of powers is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and policy-making continues to be in the sole domain of the executive.“Our Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies. Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform”, the bench said in its May 31 order uploaded on Wednesday.The top court said that it is presently assuming a dialogic jurisdiction where various stakeholders are provided a forum to raise constitutional grievances with respect to the management of the pandemic. “Hence, this Court would, under the auspices of an open court judicial process, conduct deliberations with the executive where justifications for existing policies would be elicited and evaluated to assess whether they survive constitutional scrutiny”, it said.The bench, which passed its order in the suo motu case on Covid management, said that it had clarified in its order of April 30, 2021, that in the context of the public health emergency with which the country is currently grappling, this Court appreciates the dynamic nature of the measures. “The judiciary does not possess the authority or competence to assume the role of the executive, which is democratically accountable for its actions and has access to the resources which are instrumental to policy formulation. However, this separation of powers does not result in courts lacking jurisdiction in conducting a judicial review of these policies”, the bench said.It said that across the globe, the executive has been given a wider margin in enacting measures which ordinarily may have violated the liberty of individuals, but are now incumbent to curb the pandemic.“Historically, the judiciary has also recognized that constitutional scrutiny is transformed during such public health emergencies, where the executive functions in rapid consultation with scientists and other experts,” the bench said and referred to a 1905 verdict of US Supreme Court on the issue.The bench said that similarly, courts across the globe have responded to Constitutional challenges to executive policies that have directly or indirectly violated rights and liberties of citizens.“Courts have often reiterated the expertise of the executive in managing a public health crisis, but have also warned against arbitrary and irrational policies being excused in the garb of the “wide latitude” to the executive that is necessitated to battle a pandemic,” it said.On May 9, in an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre had justified its Covid-19 vaccination policy saying that its response and strategy is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion which leaves little room for judicial interference and emphasised that citizens of all age groups will get free vaccination throughout the country.In view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the “wisdom of the executive should be trusted”, it had said.In a global pandemic, where the response and strategy of the nation is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion, "any overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention, may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences", the government had said.In 218-page affidavit filed in the top court's suo motu case on Covid-19 management, the Centre had said, this policy "conforms to mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, state government and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by this Court as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the executive does have a room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-says-constitution-doesn-t-envisage-courts-to-be-silent-spectators-when-citizens-rights-infringed-101622647866959.html

Calling her husband’s disappearance a ‘hostage situation’, Priti Choksi said the Antiguan government should be focussing on bringing its citizen back. “We, as a family, are deeply anguished by PM Gaston Browne’s statements. My husband is treated as a criminal here (in Antigua) because of the statements that Mr Gaston Browne has made in the past of calling him a ‘crook’, etc. etc; and on what basis I have no idea. A man who was trying to live his life quietly is being targeted in this manner,” Priti Choksi said over the phone from Saint John’s. She also discarded Browne’s statements that Mehul Choksi had political connections within the opposition parties and had bribed them. “My husband is not in touch with any political party.” Asked about the sequence of events from May 23, Priti Choksi said that her husband had gone for dinner and met this woman, Barbara. “When he reached her house to pick her up, she asked him to come inside saying she wanted to show him something. It was daytime so my husband went inside. As soon as he entered, he was accosted by men with Indian and Antiguan accents, they tased him, gagged his mouth, tied him in a wheelchair and put him in a boat. Then he was transferred to another boat. His last seen image is from 5.11 pm on Sunday (May 23) and his phone was last on at 5.16 pm.” She added that all the CCTV cameras of Jolly Harbour were off around that time. Choksi went missing on May 23 and was taken into custody by Dominica police two days later. His lawyers have filed a habeas corpus in Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court at Roseau, which has stayed his removal from Dominica for now. Indian government officials have reached there to seek his deportation. Priti Choksi said – “A crime has been committed. My husband has been taken hostage. It’s an international crime and Interpol should take note of it. And I think that the entire focus of the Antiguan government should be to bring its citizen back. I also want to ask why the Dominican police hasn’t registered an offence of kidnapping.” On Indian officials’ claim that Choksi continues to be an Indian citizen, she said – “The Indian Constitution says that the moment you take citizenship of another country, you cease to be an Indian citizen. And his Indian passport was suspended in February. So there is no question of dual nationality.” She said that if the Indian government gets custody of Mehul Choksi, he will become a hostage there. “After seeing the pictures of his torture, don’t you think we have every right to fear for his life if he is sent to India?” she asked. She added that Indian agencies till date have refused to take statements from him even though he has offered to give his statement many times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-s-wife-priti-says-his-life-may-be-in-danger-if-he-is-sent-to-india-101622648166221.html
02-06-2021||India||Not to restrict: Govt clarifies new rules for retired intel, security officers||The Centre on Wednesday clarified that the amendments to the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 is not meant, in any way, to bar retired intelligence or security-related officials from expressing their views. "In fact, it makes it easier for them to do so, given that they can now contact the head of their former employer organisation and seek clarification on whether the proposed material is sensitive or non-sensitive," government sources said.Several reports are trying to create an erroneous and misleading narrative, the government said adding that the intention is to safeguard the national interest, always."In the past, a few intelligence and government officials, who have worked in Intelligence or Security-related organisations, have publicly expressed themselves, by means of writing or speaking, revealing specific knowledge and sensitive information gained by virtue of having worked in that organisation," it said.The Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules, 2021, dated May 31 and notified late Tuesday, states if a retired official of the intelligence department wants to publish something, then they will have to take prior permission from the “head of the organisation”, while in the earlier 2007 rules, permission from the head of the department was adequate.“No government servant, who, having worked in any intelligence or security-related organization…shall, without prior clearance from the head of the organisation, make any publication after retirement, of any material relating to and including the domain of the organisation, including any reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organization," the amended rule said.The rules apply to ex-employees of Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, Directorate of Enforcement (ED), Aviation Research Centre, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, National Security Guards, Central Industrial Security Force and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police among others.The Narcotics Control Bureau, Special Frontier Force, Special Protection Group and Financial Intelligence Unit also come under the purview of these rules.The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, which have been amended to make way for 2007 and 2021 rules, however, don’t apply to officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) among others. The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 apply to those appointed on or before December 31, 2003, news agency PTI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-to-restrict-govt-clarifies-new-rules-for-retired-intel-security-officers-101622646946268.html

This can hardly be a relevant consideration," the judges said.The AINRC-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which the BJP is a part, had won the April 6 Assembly polls in the union territory, securing majority in the 30-member House. With the nominated members, the strength goes up to 33.Among other things, the petitioner contended that the three BJP candidates were not suitable for the post and found fault with the timing of their nomination.Turning it down, the bench observed that unless the allegation of unsuitability goes to the very fundamentals of the matter and the candidate nominated is shown to be ex-facie and patently unsuitable, such that his/her nomination would rebel against one's conscience, the question of the court reviewing their suitability does not arise.The term 'suitability' is difficult of precise definition and there is an element of subjectivity that is involved in assessing the same.In the present case, the bench pointed out, the nominees admittedly do not attract the specific statutory disqualifications and their alleged unsuitability is in general and non-specific terms.Undue haste has been ascribed to the nomination, seeing as the Chief Minister N Rangasamy had tested positive for Covid-19 and had been admitted in the hospital and the Legislative Assembly and cabinet had not been sworn in/constituted at the time when the nominations were made.This contention is more a challenge to the propriety rather than one of law, the judges said."In law, we do not find any specification in the statute stipulating the timing of the nomination and the candidates, once nominated, would take their seats in the Legislative Assembly as and when the Assembly is sworn-in."On all fronts, therefore, we find no merit in this writ petition and dismiss the same," the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-upholds-nomination-of-three-bjp-members-in-puducherry-assembly-101622642064384.html
02-06-2021||India||'Come to consensus': Naveen Patnaik writes to chief ministers, says vaccine procurement can't be state vs state battle||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday wrote a letter to the chief ministers of other states and pitched for the central procurement of Covid-19 vaccines. He called for other states to execute the vaccination on “war footing” and also commented that states needed more flexibility to ensure universal vaccination.“Wrote to all CMs for a consensus on centralised procurement of vaccines by GOI in view of the challenges faced by states. Spoke to some CMs who shared my views,” the chief minister tweeted earlier in the day, along with his letter.Wrote to all CMs for a consensus on centralised procurement of vaccines by GOI in view of the challenges faced by states. Spoke to some CMs who shared my views. No State is safe unless all States adopt vaccination as a top priority & execute it on war-footing. pic.twitter.com/lMkpjDeYRgIn his letter, Patnaik argued that the global manufacturers of the vaccine are looking forward to the Union government for “clearances and assurances” and the local manufacturers have supply constraints. Hence, the states couldn’t get any response on the global tenders they have floated. Based on this, he urged the Union government to procure the vaccines centrally and distribute them among the states. He also mentioned that the Odisha government had already written to the centre in this regard.“No state is safe unless all the states adopt vaccination as the topmost priority and execute it on war-footing. But this cannot be a battle among the states to compete against each other to procure vaccines,” Patnaik wrote to the chief ministers.Also read | ‘Unite. Centre trying to absolve itself’: Vijayan to 11 non-NDA CMs on vaccineHe said that the states needed more flexibility to determine their own mechanism to ensure universal vaccination and called for the process to be more decentralised. He urged his counterparts in the other states to reach a consensus soon on the issue to avoid the advent of the third wave of Covid-19 in the country.“I am sure that we will set aside whatever differences we have either political or otherwise and come together in the true spirit of Cooperative Federalism for saving precious lives and hard-earned livelihoods. I look forward to a productive way forward to pull our country out of this unprecedented crisis and we as a team owe it to our citizens,” he further wrote.Meanwhile, the Union government has been facing a lot of requests lately for the centralised procurement of the vaccine. Among others, the supreme court on Monday called for the centre to procure vaccines and distribute them. “There is a vital issue. Article 1 of the Constitution says that India, that is Bharat, is a Union of States. When the Constitution says that, we have to follow the federal rule. Then Government of India has to procure vaccines and distribute them. Individual states cannot be left in a lurch,” news agency PTI quoted a special bench of the apex court headed by Justice DY Chandrachud as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/come-to-consensus-naveen-patnaik-writes-to-chief-ministers-says-vaccine-procurement-can-t-be-state-vs-state-battle-101622642840404.html
02-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi's wife breaks silence on husband's 'rumoured girlfriend' Barbara||As a Dominica court is hearing the case of Indian-born fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi, who was apprehended by Dominical police last week, Choksi's wife Priti Choksi on Wednesday said the woman who is rumoured to be Mehul's girlfriend is known to her husband and to his other acquaintances. "The woman was known to my husband and to his other acquaintances. She walked with my husband periodically when she was visiting Antigua. From what I have understood from people who have met her, the woman shown on media channels is not the same woman that they knew as Barbara," Priti Choksi said to news agency ANI.Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne last week claimed that Mehul Choksi may have taken his girlfriend on a romantic trip to Dominica, from where he was apprehended.Mehul Choksi: What happens today and what we know so farAntiguan media released photographs of the woman, identified as Barbara Jarabica, with details of her education and employment. Choksi's lawyer in India Vijay Aggarwal issued a statement on Tuesday and said the woman in question was part of the team deployed to abduct him. Since the beginning, Choksi's lawyers have been claiming that what was being projected as an attempt to flee Antigua might be a case of kidnapping as Choksi was also beaten up. Aggarwal on Tuesday said that woman got friendly with the whole family and also shifted to a house near Choksi's residence in Antigua. On May 23, when Choksi disappeared, he was called by the woman at her house and was thrown in a yacht by a group of men, Aggarwal said earlier.Choksi's wife Priti expressed anguish over the reports of physical torture and said, "If someone really wanted him back alive, why did they need to torture and abuse him physically and mentally? My husband has many health issues."Meanwhile, the issue of Choksi's extradition has kicked up a political storm in Antigua where Choksi has been staying for the last three years as a legal citizen. Antiguan Prime Minister who has been pitching for Choksi's extradition straight to India from Dominica accused Antigua's opposition party of receiving fund from Choksi. The prime minister told ANI that Choksi changed his lawyer to a "well-known member" of the United Progressive Party (UPP), the opposition party.According to local media reports, Mehul Choksi's brother Chetan Chinu Bhai Choksi met Dominica's Leader of the Opposition Lennox Linton on May 30 where some sort of agreement has been reached that Linton, in exchange for election funding, will press the matter in Parliament and push the kidnap theory. Reports also said that Linton received a token amount of US$ 200,000.Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal refuted the reports though he confirmed that his brother has arrived in Dominica, but only to meet him and take care of him.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-s-wife-breaks-silence-on-husband-s-rumoured-girlfriend-barbara-101622640726224.html
02-06-2021||India||Explained: What is indemnity for vaccine makers? What Pfizer, Govt say about it||Amid reports that the Indian government may grant indemnity to Pfizer and Moderna so that they export their vaccines to India, Pfizer on Wednesday said consultations with the Indian government is going on and the US pharma company will not be able to divulge more details at this point."Pfizer continues to remain engaged with the Government of India towards making its COVID-19 vaccine available for use in the Government immunisation programme in the country. As these discussions are ongoing, we are unable to share any additional details at this time," a Pfizer spokesperson told ANI.What is indemnity?Indemnity is protection to vaccine-makers from legal proceedings, which means that they can't be sued in India. No other vaccine maker in India enjoys this clause. But Pfizer said it will export to India only if the transaction is with the central government and the company will be protected from legal cases.Can GOI grant indemnity to Pfizer?Since no vaccine maker in India has this immunity, others may also raise the demand if the government of India grants indemnity to Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer has indemnity in all the countries it has exported its vaccines. So the government of India can extend indemnity on the lines of what other countries did, reports said.Foreign-approved vaccines no longer need bridging trials in India: DCGI"They have requested indemnity to all the nations, including the country of origin. We are examining this request and will take a decision in the larger interest of people and on merit. This is under discussion and there is no decision as of now," Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said in May. While reports on Wednesday indicated progress on that front and a likely development that the government is expected to extend the indemnity to Pfizer, the final decision has not been yet taken.'Be assured, everyone will get Covid-19 vaccine', says Union ministerWaiver for foreign vaccinesVaccines which have been approved by the appropriate agencies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan will not require bridging trials in India, the Drug Controller General of India has said. vaccines listed in the emergency use listing of the World Health Organization too are exempt from the bridging trials, it said. Earlier, foreign vaccines needed to undergo specific trial in India so that the effect on the Indian population could be understood. For example, Dr Reddy's Laboratories conducted a trial for Sputnik V in India.Pfizer has indicated that it has five crore vaccine doses which it can send to India in several phases — one crore in July, one crore in August, two crore in September and 1 crore in October. Moderna, on the other hand, said it won't be able to supply vaccines to India this year even if an agreement is reached as it does not have surplus stock.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-indemnity-for-vaccine-makers-what-pfizer-govt-say-about-it-101622638336579.html
02-06-2021||India||Former Bengal CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee released from hospital||Former Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, 77, who was admitted to a private hospital in south Kolkata on May 25 with Covid-19, was released on Wednesday afternoon. CEO of Woodlands Hospital Dr Rupali Basu said Bhattacharjee’s condition improved during treatment and he was asked to stay in isolation for a week. “He is on oral medications and oral steroids in limited doses and other supportive measures. His cough has reduced,” said Dr Basu. Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders said since Bhattacharjee lives in a small two-room government apartment it would be difficult to keep him in isolation there. He was taken to a private nursing home at CIT Road in central Kolkata so that he can be kept under observation. His wife and daughter will also stay with him. Bhattacharjee was on intermittent BiPAP support and required less oxygen than before. The oxygen saturation level in his blood stood at 96% on Wednesday. Bhattacharjee, one of the most senior leaders of the CPI(M), is a patient of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He could rarely leave home in the last few years. “He is conscious, alert and talking sensibly. His blood pressure is stable. He is taking food orally and his blood sugar levels are normal,” Woodlands Hospital said in a bulletin. The former chief minister and his wife Mira Bhattacharjee, 71, tested positive for Covid-19 on May 18. Mira Bhattacharya was admitted at Woodlands Hospital on that day but her husband was treated at home till his oxygen saturation level dropped below 90%. A panel of seven doctors was formed for his treatment. In October last year, Bhattacharjee was in the same hospital for six days. He was admitted in a critical condition with symptoms such as breathlessness and low oxygen count in blood. However, his condition improved in less than a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bengal-cm-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-released-from-hospital-101622639225550.html

In a release, the state government said that Uttar Pradesh is the first state to cross the milestone.It also said that on an average, three lakh Covid-19 tests are being conducted across the state daily.The state government said that 3,31,511 said were tested in the last 24 hours, out of which nearly 1,500 tested positive. The share of RT-PCR test - considered the gold standard - in the testing is 1.5 lakh every day, the UP government further said.The state credited its aggressive ‘Test, Trace and Treat’ strategy for achieving the milestone. "A widely deployed and efficient testing strategy in Uttar Pradesh has helped in limiting the spread of new cases as it significantly reduced the chance of individuals with undetected virus exposure from roaming freely among unexposed individuals," the government said in the release.Further, the state government said that the number of active cases of Covid-19 has come down by 93 per cent from its peak on April 30. In a state with population of 240 million, the count of active cases stands at 28,694, said the release. In April, this number had reached 3,10,783.The state's recovery rate is above 97 per cent, and number of containment zones are down to 13,702, according to government data.The daily positivity rate - the number of positive cases against the total tests done - on Tuesday dipped to 0.45 per cent in Uttar Pradesh. It has been below 1 per cent for more than a week now, according to the government.This rate was at its highest at 16.84 per cent on April 24.On Tuesday, the Uttar Pradesh government launched an ambitious vaccination campaign, in which the administration aims to inoculate 1 crore people in a month. Claimed by a government's spokesman as the world's biggest vaccination campaign, two special vaccination centres have been set up in rural areas and three in urban areas for vaccinating the age group of 18 to 44 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-achieves-milestone-of-5-crore-covid-19-tests-101622637372287.html

02-06-2021||India||Third Covid wave could be as severe as second, but deaths to be less: SBI report||The impact of any possible third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic could be significantly minimised by rigorous vaccination and providing better health infrastructure, according to a State Bank of India (SBI) research document. India’s largest public sector bank, in its five-page-long report, said that the average duration of the third wave of the pandemic in the worst-hit countries is 98 days as against 108 days during the second wave. Citing international experience, the report further suggested that the intensity of the third wave has been as severe as the second wave.“However it is also observed that in third wave, if we are better prepared, the decline in serious case rate will lead to less number of deaths,” SBI research document read.As per the official data, around 162,000 people in India had lost their lives to Covid-19 till March-end. Within two months, the death toll more than doubled, taking the total number of Covid-related fatalities to over 330,000. The exponential rise in Covid cases during the second wave overwhelmed the country's health infrastructure, leading to massive oxygen shortage in hospitals.Also Read | India lost 594 doctors during Covid second wave; most deaths in Delhi: IMAWhile the daily new coronavirus cases have been on a decline for the past few weeks, experts have warned about a possible third wave, given that only around 3.2 per cent of the Indian population has been fully vaccinated against the infection so far. According to the SBI report, better health infrastructure and rigorous vaccination could lead to a decline in serious Covid cases from 20 per cent to five per cent during the third wave, subsequently reducing coronavirus-related deaths to 40,000 “as compared to current deaths of more than 1.7 lakh.”“So vaccination should be the key priority, especially for the children who could be the next vulnerable group. With around 15-17 crore children in the 12-18 age bracket, India should go for an advanced procurement strategy like that adopted by developed nations to inoculate this age-group," the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-wave-could-be-as-severe-as-second-but-deaths-to-be-less-sbi-report-101622633572523.html
02-06-2021||India||Over 8,700 people died on railway tracks during lockdown, many of them migrants||Over 8,700 people were mowed down on railway tracks in 2020 even though passenger train services were severely curtailed due to the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, with officials saying many of the victims were migrant workers.The Railway Board shared the data on such deaths for the period between January and December 2020 in its reply to a question by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur under the Right to Information Act."Based on the information received from the State Police, 805 people suffered injuries and 8,733 people died on the railway track between January 2020 and December 2020," the Railway Board has said.Officials separately said that many of those dead were migrant workers who chose to walk home along the tracks because train routes are considered shorter than roads or highways.They said these workers also chose the tracks as this way they could evade police for violating lockdown norms, and also had the belief they would not get lost midway."They also assumed that no trains would be running because of the lockdown," one of the officials said.While the fatalities during 2020 were fewer compared to four years immediately before that, the numbers are still significant given the fact that the passenger services were restricted after the coronavirus lockdown was announced on March 25.Only freight trains were in operation during the lockdown and before the railways started Shramik Special trains from May 1 to ferry migrant workers home.The passenger services have been reopening in phases, and by December, around 1,100 special trains were in operation along with 110 regular passenger trains.The services have now been restored to 70 per cent of the pre-Covid period.While many fatalities on tracks last year could not be registered for some reason or the other, the deaths of 16 migrant workers after being run over by a freight train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad last May rattled many as they were killed while resting on the tracks thinking no train would be coming due to the Covid suspension.According to Railways figures, compiled from state governments, 56,271 people died and 5,938 were injured in such incidents between 2016 and 2019, registering an increasing trend, with 2017 being an exception.As many 14,032 people died in such accidents in 2016, 12,838 in 2017, 14,197 in 2018 and 15,204 in 2019, the figures showed.However, the Railways do not consider these deaths "railway accidents".Railway’s death statistics are maintained in three forms --consequential accidents, trespassing and untoward incidents.These deaths come under the category of "untoward incidents" or "trespassing", and are investigated by state police and the victims are also compensated by state governments concerned.The Railways has carried out massive campaigns to reduce such deaths and also paid ex gratia to the kin of the victim on sympathetic grounds in some cases.The measures taken by the Railways include elimination of unmanned-level crossings over the broad gauge network, signal modernisation, the use of modern machines in maintenance, among others.

"Consistent reforms and strong fundamentals have ensured India had a swift rebound from a contraction of 24.4 % in the 1st quarter of FY 2020-21 to a growth of 1.6 per cent in the 4th quarter of FY 2020-21," Thakur said."While you doubt the resilience of Indian entrepreneurs, small businesses, traders and MSMEs to revive themselves; various international agencies project India to grow by 12.5% in FY 2021-22 making us the only major economy to have a projected double-digit growth," the minister said.Only an Ostrich would deny this graph is V shaped. pic.twitter.com/2njNojUsGkChidambaram on Tuesday said most Indians are poorer than they were two years ago and for this, the government must admit its "errors of commission and omission, reverse its policies and heed the advice of economists and the opposition".In a reply, Anurag Thakur asked whether all other major economies of the world remained insulated from the impact of the pandemic. "Is the Indian economy an island in isolation; have other major economies not faced a GDP contraction? Are you not aware that France, Germany, Italy, UK contracted by 8.2%, 4.9%, 8.9% and 9.9% respectively? Canada, Russia, South Africa, USA too have seen a contraction in their GDP in the past year. Despite the disruptions in the globalised world, India has remained resilient," he said.Rebutting Chidambaram's claim that not much progress has been made on the issue of ash transfers, Anurag Thakur said the Congress misled the farmers on the issue of agri laws and engaged in protests. " Today the farmers are happy and have differentiated the truth from the false narrative of congress leaders," he said."The NDA government procured 306.9 million tonnes of paddy and 162.7 million tonnes of wheat in last 5 years Vs the period 2009-13 during the UPA tenure wherein only 176.8 million tonnes of paddy and 139.5 million tonnes of wheat was procured," he said.Chidambaram on Tuesday said the predictions of the V-shaped economic recovery was a false story. "When the first wave of the pandemic appeared to subside last year, the Finance Minister and her Chief Economic Adviser began to sell the story of a recovery. They saw 'green shoots' when no one else did. They predicted a V-shaped recovery. It was a false story and we had expressed our strong reservations and warned there were no signs of a recovery. We had pointed out that what the economy needed was a strong dose of stimulus, including increased government expenditure, direct transfers of cash to the poor and liberal distribution of free rations. Our pleas fell on deaf ears, and the result is a negative growth of (-) 7.3 per cent," he said.Citing the graph of the Central Statistics Office, the finance minister said only an ostrich would deny the shape of the graph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ostrich-reading-economic-data-anurag-thakur-replies-to-chidambaram-on-gdp-101622633517911.html
02-06-2021||India||'Hoax': Mamata Banerjee on ICMR chief's 'Covid-19 doses to all by December' remark||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that the statement made by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Dr Balram Bhargava about giving Covid-19 vaccine to the whole country by December is a hoax. Banerjee lashed out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre, saying it only finds temporary solution to a problem."That (vaccinating all citizens before December 2021) is just a hoax. They just say baseless things," Banerjee said at a press conference in Kolkata while replying to a question.Also Read: 238 mn doses per month needed to meet Dec target"If we try to vaccinate all the people of the country, it will automatically take six months to one year. India has a population of 140 crore, it is not a small matter to give vaccine to everyone," she further said.The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief then highlighted the procedural issues involved in inoculating the people."There are other factors too. If someone recovers form Covid-19, he/she will have to wait for getting a vaccine shot. Also, there is a gap between two doses of the vaccine. So, it is not possible to inoculate everyone by December," said Banerjee.Targeting the BJP, she said, "They promised before Bihar elections that they will give free vaccines to everyone after the elections. But they still haven't done anything."The Bengal chief minister said that the Centre should procure Covid-19 vaccines and provide them to states for free."State governments cannot do it. The central government should send the vaccine to the states for free," said Banerjee, adding, "The state government don't have enough vaccines, and the Centre supplies very less shots. West Bengal has a popoulation of 10 crore. Our government spent ₹150 crore from its own funds for the vaccine and got 1.4 crore shots.""If you don't have commitment, you only raise the issue to satisfy the people temporarily. But temporary solution is not the solution, it's pollution. It is easy for bhashan," said the TMC chief.Banerjee said many chief ministers like Arvind Kejriwal, Navin Patnaik and Pinarayin Vijayan have raised similar issues.On Tuesday, Dr Balram Bhargava said India's vaccination is being ramped up. He mentioned that India is one of the five countries which are producing vaccines and asserted that "there is no shortage of vaccines"."Shortage is what you feel if you want to vaccinate the country within a month. The total number of vaccinations done in the country is nearly equivalent to the total number done in the United States and our population is four times the population of the USA. We have to have some patience," he said at a press conference.Dr Bhargava said by mid-July or early August, India will have more than enough doses to vaccinate up to 1 crore people per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hoax-mamata-on-icmr-chief-s-covid-19-doses-to-all-by-december-remark-101622633030714.html

Hence, the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place during the same period," the IMD said.The normal date for arrival for monsoon over Kerala is June 1. The IMD had predicted that monsoon would hit Kerala on May 31 with an error margin of plus or minus four days. But on May 30, it said conditions were not ripe for the monsoon to hit Kerala the next day.Monsoon is expected to be normal this year, the IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conditions-ripe-for-onset-of-monsoon-over-kerela-on-june-3-imd-101622630836890.html

02-06-2021||India||Brands take an innovative route to raise vaccine awareness||In a bid to create awareness and encourage people to get inoculated, brands are focusing on how the jab is cool. While 2020 was all about ‘stay home, stay safe’ and social distancing campaigns, in 2021 the focus is on Covid-19 vaccination, especially for the 18-44 age group. And brands are taking an innovative route, opting for social media campaigns to remove vaccine hesitancy.From food and hospitality, automobile and apparel to consumer goods, brands such as OYO Rooms, Domino’s Pizza, Hero MotoCorp, Durex and many more are actively promoting the drive to increase confidence in masses and support the campaigns. Explaining the strategy behind the narrative, brand specialist Harish Bijoor says it’s called moment marketing. “This kind of marketing makes the best of the moment. And the moment of time is vaccination. There’s a craving for it and there’s a shortage. And everybody understands that when the entire nation is vaccinated it is a safe nation. In a way, these campaigns also hint at subliminal promotion to show what the brand offers,” he says.Echoing similar sentiments and pinning the hope on vaccine for a ‘new normal’ once again, ad film director Sudip Bandyopadhyay says, “Scenario is such that vaccine is a hope and brands are coming up with creatives to encourage masses.” However, he also points out that it’s not only companies that are referred to as brands. Celebrities too make for a ‘brand’ and when they post pictures of a getting a jab, that is in a way inspiration as well. “Brand is a name – it could be an eminent personality and they’re are also taking vaccine and showing which sends the message that it is a necessity to go and get vaccinated,” he says adding that it’s not only the responsibility of government to spread awareness on these initiatives but also of large organisations, advertising and production houses.Catchy and creative ads can go a long way in clearing out vaccine hesitancy. Brand guru, Jagdeep Kapoor says, “Ever since the vaccination drive kicked off for 18+, brands jumped on the bandwagon and have been trying to represent trendy, fashionable voices by sending out the message that ‘vaccine is in’ because the younger generation follows the trends. These messages can help overcome the resistance.” He also points out that not many brands took the initiative to come up with digital campaigns when the vaccination started for people above 60 years of age and those over 45 with comorbidities.This highlights the fact that specific group of consumer plays a key role for deciding campaigns as for many brands, 18-44 is the age bracket for their target audience, which is also most active on social media platforms. Advertising veteran Ajay Gahlaut says, “18-44 is a sweet spot for most brands. And social media is the right territory for the brands to get in and build their messaging around it. Also, in today’s time, it is a powerful tool for communication that needs to be lot more real-time, based on on-ground events, which is the case for vaccination encouragement.”Compared to television, it’s easier to find the target audience on social media as, Gahlaut highlights, “The cost of a television campaign is expensive, so brands go for the space where major bulk of audience is going to watch it and get more eyeballs.”Ad film director Prahlad Kakkar believes that a lot of brands took advantage of being the ‘good guy’ and are inspired from the move of the Biden administration partnering with McDonald’s and introducing We Can Do This campaign. He says, “There was a lot resistance to vaccine in America and it [campaign] became very successful and it all kicked off from there. Brands thought if a fast-food chain which is a great family place can promote, why can’t we? It was a reaction to American campaign.” However, he says for brands to encourage the masses here is ‘too little, too late’ as he states, “There was some resistance earlier [in March], but the momentum picked up when the second wave hit us. Masses registered, queued up at centers to get the jab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brands-take-an-innovative-route-to-raise-vaccine-awareness-101622629804775.html

This is an issue is of general importance and therefore requires serious consideration, the court noted and posted the matter to be heard again on June 4."When Maharashtra did not have the vaccine, they stopped the process because they knew that it would not have the second dose and the vaccine will lose its effect," the judge noted.Additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, advocate Anuj Aggarwal, told that he would seek instructions on the matter and urged that the matter be taken up on Friday.In the instant petition, in which both the Delhi government and the Centre have been made parties, the petitioner mentioned that while Covaxin is made available in other states, Delhi is being deprived of Covaxin doses. Hence, people who got their first shot in Delhi have to travel to other cities to get the second doses. No steps were taken to ensure that the second doses are administered on time while the first doses were given to beneficiaries in Delhi.The plea said that while Covaxin is made available in other states, Delhi is being deprived of Covaxin doses."Hence, people who got their first shot in Delhi have to travel to other cities to get the second doses.

02-06-2021||India||The politics of Twitter: Why did Rahul Gandhi stop following his aides?||Former Congress president and Wayanad member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi unfollowed all his core team members on Twitter on Tuesday, in what appears to be a signal to the broader party, and also the latest episode in a long-running young-vs-old feud.Hindustan Times has learnt that this action was in response to certain party members complaining that Gandhi was following people selectively, and not all party leaders.The persons that Gandhi with 18.8 million followers unfollowed on Tuesday, include his key aides KB Byju, Nikhil and Nivedith Alva, Kaushal Vidyarthee and Alankar Sawai. While Gandhi followed 281 persons till Tuesday, by the end of the day the number was reduced to 228. On Wednesday morning, this further dipped to 219.Among the accounts he still follows are those of fellow MPs Manickam Tagore and key office bearers such as Shaktisinh Gohil and Oomen Chandy; important spokespersons of the party including Abhishek Manusinghvi and Pawan Khera; and opposition leaders such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC)’s Derek O’Brien and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s Kanimozhi.Also Read | It is not just WhatsApp. Digital media rules face multiple legal challenges“I am not aware why Mr Gandhi has done this or whether it is genuine or not,” said KC Venugopal. However, at least two members of his office who are no longer followed by Gandhi confirmed that they were aware of the development.“Many people were unhappy that he was following us. So he decided that he won’t follow anyone in his office. They are also trying to have a uniform policy on who Rahul Gandhi will follow,’’ said one member of his office who asked not to be named. Gandhi also unfollowed some journalists and fact checkers who he previously followed on twitter.“It’s only fair. Does Prime Minister Modi follow the people who run his account like Hiren Joshi?” asked a second Congress leader who too asked not to be named. However, that comparison may not stand because Joshi who heads communications and IT in the Prime Minister's office, does not have a Twitter account. Gandhi’s Twitter account used to be handled by Nikhil Alva but is now handled by Alankar Sawai. HT reached out to Sawai for a comment but there was no response.While some in the party called it a non-issue, social media norms now dictate that a public person is judged by who they follow. As of Wednesday morning, Gandhi was following 219 people and being followed by 18.8 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-politics-of-twitter-why-did-rahul-gandhi-stop-following-his-aides-101622625484445.html

The situation in the Bhadrak special sub-jail is particularly acute where against the capacity of 166 there are over 430 prisoners. In a time of Covid-19 Pandemic, this can also pose a serious risk to the health and safety of the prisoners as well as the jail staff,” the court said.As per the high power committee of Odisha State Legal Service Authority, formed to look into release of inmates from jails owing to Covid-19, at least 816 inmates were found to be positive in May and 71 other inmates and 4 employees of Gunupur sub-jail in Koraput district tested positive for the disease on Tuesday.A decongestion drive was recently carried out in state’s prisons which reduced the number of inmates in the state’s 87 jails to 18,580 against the full capacity of 19,824. The director general (DG) of prisons Santosh Upadhyay said the capacity of jails was being raised by 3,000. However, 53 of the 87 jails in the state are yet to report any Covid cases.The court order by the division bench of chief justice Dr S Muralidhar and justice Savitri Ratho comes at a time when former Biju Janata Dal (BJD) minister and Gopalpur MLA Pradip Panigrahi and former Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Abhay Pathak, arrested in Tata Motor job scam and disproportionate assets cases, tested Covid positive in Jharpada special jail of Bhubaneswar. Both Panigrahi and Pathak are yet to get bail.The court said prisoners in excess of the holding capacity of jails should be shifted in a phased manner in other safe and secure premises. “This could be [done] by upgrading other state buildings/facilities to meet the requirements of prisons,” the HC said. It also directed the state government to submit a detailed action plan for dealing with the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-high-court-orders-state-buildings-to-be-converted-into-jails-101622625424602.html
02-06-2021||India||'Be assured, everyone will get Covid-19 vaccine', says Union minister||Union minister G Kishan Reddy on Wednesday said that the Centre has made plans to vaccinate all the people of the country against Covid-19 by December after speaking to pharmaceutical companies. He also assured that everyone will get vaccine."The government has made action plans to vaccinate all by end of December (2021) and for production of 250 crore vaccine doses after speaking to several pharma companies. Sputnik arrived in Hyderabad yesterday, discussions are on to get Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson too," Reddy, the minister of state for home, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: Aarogya Setu app to now show vaccination status"India stands third compared to other countries, in terms of vaccinating its citizens. We have simplified import rules so private hospitals can import vaccines. Vaccination drive will run for the next 7-8 months. Be assured that everyone will get vaccine," he added.The minister's statement came on a day when the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) said it has done away with specific trials of Covid-19 vaccines that have been approved by other international regulatory bodies. The big move is likely to clear the way for foreign vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna for the country's urgent requirement.In a letter, DCGI chief VG Somani said that this will be applicable for vaccines that have already been approved for restricted use by the US FDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or listed for Emergency Use by the World Health Organisation.Top government official had said on Tuesday that India will vaccinate 10 million (1 crore) people every day by July of early August, rubbishing reports that there is a shortage of vaccines in the country. Dr Balram Bhargava, the director general of Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR), said that the total number of vaccinations done in the country is nearly equivalent to the total number done in the United States despite India's population being four times the population of the US."We have to have some patience. By the mid of year, mid-July or early August, we will have more than enough doses to vaccinate up to a crore (10 million) per day," he said at a press conference.But the government's ambitious plan will require 1.88 billion doses to be administered by the end of this year. An analysis of the data of ongoing vaccination drive and supply of jabs by Hindustan shows that 1.67 billion or 89% of these expected doses are yet to be administered.This means that the country needs to deliver 238 million doses every month from June or risk falling behind target.In May, India delivered an average of 1.93 million doses a day and several states ran out of supplies by the fourth week of the month for at least some groups of recipients. For June alone, the number of doses required has been pegged at 120 million.The government, meanwhile, said the reports about consumption of Covid-19 vaccine doses in various media reports are "incorrect and without any basis". The reports said that only around 58 million doses were administered of the 79 million doses available in May.According to Union health ministry's data at 7am on June 1, between May 1-31, a total of 61.06 million vaccine doses were administered by the states and Union territories.A total of 16.22 million balance and unutilised doses were available with the states. The total number of vaccine shots available from May 1-31 was 79.45 million, the ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-assured-everyone-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-says-union-minister-101622624539176.html
02-06-2021||India||Know how Centre's X-Ray Setu on WhatsApp can detect Covid-19||A new AI-driven platform will now help early intervention through rapid screening of coronavirus disease cases with the help of chest X-ray interpretation over WhatsApp for doctors who have access to X-ray machines. The solution called X-Ray Setu can work with low-resolution images sent via mobiles, is quick and easy to use, and can facilitate detection in rural areas.Artificial intelligence-based X-Ray Setu, which operates through Whatsapp, plans to onboard 10,000 doctors in small towns and rural areas where RT-PCR tests and CT-scans are not available to detect the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a senior official of AI and robotics foundation Artpark said on Tuesday.Click here for latest updates on Covid-19Non-profit organisation Artpark CEO Umakant Soni told news agency PTI that X-Ray Setu, developed in collaboration with start-up Niramai and Indian Institute of Science (IISc), detects Covid-19 with the help of simple X-ray which is processed using an AI system in the backend without charging any fee at present.The chest X-ray of a person is uploaded by the doctor or radiologist on WhatsApp bot of X-Ray Setu which analyses the image and generates a report in 10-15 minutes.How to conduct the test?To conduct the health check, any doctor simply needs to visit www.xraysetu.com and click on the ‘Try the Free X-Ray Setu Beta’ button. The platform will then redirect the person to another page, wherein he or she can choose to engage with the WhatsApp-based chatbot via web or smartphone application. Or the doctor can simply send a WhatsApp message to the phone number +91 8046163838 to start the X-Ray Setu service.Then they just need to click the picture of the patient’s X-ray and obtain the 2-page automated diagnostics with annotated images in a few minutes. While extending the probability of the Covid-19 contraction, the report also highlights a localised heatmap for a quick perusal of the doctor.Tested and validated with over 1,25 000 X-ray images from National Institute of Health, UK, as well as over 1000+ Indian coronavirus patients from, X-Ray Setu, has shown excellent performance with Sensitivity: 98.86%, and Specificity: 74.74%Soni said that the technology has been operational since last one week and 500 doctors have come on board to use it."We are planning to create a strong network of 10,000 doctors in the next 15 days who are trained in leveraging XraySetu, so that when the third COVID wave comes, we are ready with solutions that can reach doctors in rural areas," Soni said.ALSO READ: India lost 594 doctors during Covid second wave; most deaths in Delhi: IMAHe said that India had 5,335 rural community health centres as of March 31, 2019 that can be used and private estimates indicate that two-third of them have a working X-Ray machine and a technician to operate it."We are making our best effort to reach all places where X-ray machines are installed. We will not charge any fee for the next 6-8 months. Even on a paid basis, it will be less than ₹100 per test," Soni said.IISc promoted Artpark has received support of ₹230 crore from department of science and technology under National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems and the Karnataka government, to develop AI and robotics facilities to support technology innovations.Niramai founder, CEO and CTO Geetha Manjunath said X-Ray Setu aims at creating an ecosystem for affordable and rapid screening in rural areas, for lung infections like coronavirus, pneumonia, tuberculosis etc."We believe X-Ray Setu can play an important role to address the delays and false negatives in the RT PCR test. CT Scan leads to heavy exposure to radiation compared to an X-Ray. X-Ray Setu can be a supplement to RT PCR and CT Scan," Manjunath said.ALSO READ: Only one strain of Covid-19 variant found in India now of concern, says WHOArtpark (AI and Robotics Technologies Park) co-founder and chief information officer Subhashis Banerjee said X-Ray Setu intervention can help in early treatment of patients which in case of an RT-PCR test takes over 24 hours and in some cases it has been 3-4 days long wait."Release of patients from hospitals has been on the basis of quantitative parameters. With X-Ray Setu we can add some qualitative parameters because it is harmful to expose a person to CT Scan radiation in a short time," Banerjee said.As Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the rural heartlands of India, it has become critical to drive rapid testing, contact tracing, and create dedicated containment zones. At a time when such tests are taking more than a week across some cities, the challenge is even more for rural areas. Easy alternative tests are necessary as RT-PCR tests also give a ‘false negative’ for some variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/know-how-centre-s-x-ray-setu-on-whatsapp-can-detect-covid19-101622624422305.html
02-06-2021||India||Google says India's new IT rules not applicable to its search engine; Centre to respond by July 25||American technology giant Google Inc on Wednesday contended that India's information technology rules for digital media are not applicable to its search engine and asked the Delhi high court to set aside an earlier order, passed by a single-judge bench, which applied to the company in relation to certain offending content posted on an internet pornography website. Google said that the judge had "mischaracterised" its search engine as a 'social media intermediary' or 'significant social media intermediary' as provided under the new rules.Also Read: Standoff on IT rules as Twitter flags concernsWhat is the case about?The case in question relates to a matter in which a woman's photographs were uploaded on the pornography website without her consent by a few "unknow persons". Despite court orders instructing the removal of the content, the photograph could not completely be removed in its entirety from the internet. Moreover, some "errant parties merrily continued" to repost and redirect the content to other sites, the court noted.What did the court say?In light of these observations, the single-judge bench of the Delhi high court had on April 20 framed a template wherein it said that an appropriate direction may be issued to the website where the objectional material is hosted to remove the same forthwith and maximum within 24 hours of receiving the judicial order.The court also said that additional directions must be issued to the search engine to disable access to the offending content by 'de-indexing' and 'dereferencing'' it in their listed search results. Considering Google's search engine to be an intermediary, the court said that it must "endeavour to employ pro-active monitoring by using automated tools, to identify and remove or disable access to any content which is exactly identical to the offending content that is the subject matter of the court order."The search engine must also block search results across the world pertaining to the content, the order said, since a direction to remove or disable access to an offending content will hardly be effective even within India if it has no realistic prospect of preventing irreparable harm to a litigant.If the intermediary fails to meet these conditions, it was liable to forfeit its privilege of exemption under the Information Technology (IT) Act, the court noted.Google's objection to the court orderGoogle noted that although it was an intermediary, the Delhi high court judge had "mischaracterised" its search engine as a 'social media intermediary' or 'significant social media intermediary' as provided under the new rules.Also Read: Google respects legislative processes but pushes back when needed: Sundar Pichai on new social media rules"Additionally, the single judge has conflated various sections of the IT Act and separate rules prescribed thereunder, and has passed template orders combining all such offences and provisions, which is bad in law," Google said in its appeal against the April 20 judgement.In view of this, Google contended that the new IT rules framed under these guidelines are not applicable to its search engine and sought the removal of the observation by the judge that it was a 'social media intermediary'. With the aforementioned plea, Google further sought protection against any coercive action for non-compliance with the template or guidelines laid down by the single judge.Where does the case stand now?Following Google's plea, a Delhi high court bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said that any interim order will not be issued at this stage.The court has issued a notice to the central government, the Delhi government, the Internet Service Providers Association of India, Facebook, the pornographic site and the woman, on whose plea the single judge's ruling had come, to submit their responses to Google's plea by July 25.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-says-india-s-new-it-rules-not-applicable-to-its-search-engine-centre-to-respond-by-july-25-101622619717281.html

Many of them are under attack from the TMC-supported stormtroopers - their properties vandalised and livelihoods destroyed,” the statement read.The signatories, mostly comprising professors, vie-chancellors, directors and deans of various universities, said quoted reports to highlight that dozens of people, including women, have been killed in post-poll violence in Bengal while thousand others have migrated to the adjoining states of Assam, Odisha and Jharkhand fearing persecution by the ruling Trinamool Congress. They accused the police, local administration, civil society and the media of being “hand in gloves with the perpetrators.”“We are deeply anxious and worried about the people who exercised their democratic right to free and fair vote, thus incurring the wrath of the ruling party in Bengal. We are deeply concerned about the weak and vulnerable sections of the society whose rights as citizens of India are being suppressed by the state government merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association,” the statement further read.The Calcutta high court had on Monday ordered the setting up of a three-member panel to ensure that those displaced by the post-poll violence in the state are able to return to their houses.Meanwhile, the BJP said it will hold public programmes between June 1 and June 3 to discuss upon the prevalent issues pertaining to the alleged post-poll violence. It will be the party's first outreach programme after the assembly elections the state.Stressing the acts of violence and politics of terror undermine the constitution and destroy the basic building blocks of democracy, the signatories of the petition also sought for the formation of a SIT to probe into the alleged violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/academicians-sign-joint-letter-seeking-probe-into-post-poll-violence-in-bengal-101622621155972.html

02-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi: What happens today and what we know so far||The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) will on Wednesday hear the habeas corpus petition filed by Mehul Choksi’s attorneys last week seeking answers from Dominica on the circumstances under which the fugitive reached or was found in the country on May 23. Choksi’s lawyers have alleged the businessman was abducted from Antigua and Barbuda, where he is a citizen, and brought to Dominica in a vessel and then tortured in custody.People familiar with the matter told HT that the Dominica government and police have filed multiple affidavits in the court, detailing how Choksi was found inside their territory. The court has jurisdiction over six independent states including Antigua and Barbuda and DominicaIndia, not a party yetIndia is not a party to the ECSC proceedings in the habeas corpus, or writ that seeks to bring a prisoner or other detainee before the court to determine if the person’s imprisonment or detention is lawful. Legal experts said for India to seek Choksi’s deportation directly, a separate plea will have to be filed through Dominican prosecutors. Indian officials have travelled to Dominica to seek his deportation on the grounds that Choksi is still an Indian citizen and he cheated public sector banks of $2 billion and needs to face the courts of India. But the process may take time and it is believed that Choksi may have to stay in Dominica for a few weeks.What has Dominica said so farIn a statement last week, the country’s interior ministry said it will repatriate Choksi to Antigua once details on his citizenship are ascertained. Dominican authorities have been tight-lipped about any backchannel or diplomatic talks with India.Vocal Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston BrowneBrowne has maintained he will not accept Choksi back in his country. He has spoken about how an Indian plane reached Dominica to get Choksi. On Monday, he said that “Choksi left the island [Antigua] on May 23 with his girlfriend” and in doing so, “made a monumental error”. Browne has denied allegations of Choksi’s lawyers and opposition parties that the fugitive was abducted by the country’s police along with Indian agents. Antigua and Barbuda’s opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) has accused Browne of disregarding the law of the land by saying that Choksi should be sent directly to India because “he enjoys constitutional and legal protection in Antigua”. “The alleged abduction and beating of Mr. Choksi already paints an unflattering picture of the country. Browne’s deliberate attempt to subvert and corrupt the rule of law makes us look even worse,” the UPP said in a statement.Also Read | ‘Choksi still Indian citizen’: ED’s likely line of argument in courtBrowne has accused UPP of taking campaign funds from Choksi.Politics in DominicaOn Tuesday, Dominica’s leader of the opposition, Lennox Linton, in an interview with HT, targeted Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit over the alleged abduction of Choksi. He accused Skerrit of being part of a plot that undermines the protections guaranteed to citizens of the region under the ECSC’s jurisdiction.Bribery allegationsAssociates Times, a Caribbean news portal, reported on Tuesday that Choksi’s brother, Chetan, flew in from Antwerp to Dominica, Linton and allegedly gave him $200,000 for the election campaign and making statements in the Parliament in favour of the fugitive.Also Watch | Mehul Choksi’s mystery woman, abduction claims spark Caribbean controversyThe jet and the Indian silenceAuthorities in New Delhi have been silent over reports of a private jet sent last Friday along with a team of 7-8 officials and case files and documents to prove that Choksi is one of the top white-collar criminals wanted in India. India has not also denied allegations that he was abducted by Indian and Antiguan officials.The mystery womanBrowne said on Monday that Choksi left the country with his girlfriend, who has not been traced since. The media in Antigua reported that the woman had been meeting Choksi for a long time. Choksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said the mystery woman got friendly with the Choksis during her evening walks. He added later on she even invited Choksi to her house. Aggarwal has claimed other members of the alleged abduction team were waiting at her house to pick Choksi.“They grabbed him, threw him in a yacht, and took him to Dominica. As Mehul Choksi was not carrying his passport and that lady has vanished, this is sufficient to vindicate the stand that he was abducted,” Aggarwal said.What nextAfter India applies for Choksi’s deportation, the matter will be heard in the court during which it will be decided whether he should be sent to India or Antigua. A lot will depend on Dominica’s stand and whether it is keen to send him to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-what-happens-today-and-what-we-know-so-far-101622619064166.html
02-06-2021||India||Peak crossed; Covid transmission stabilising, says Centre||Nearly half of India is reporting a less than 5% test positivity rate, the Centre said on Tuesday, suggesting the peak of the second Covid-19 wave has been crossed, and the disease transmission has largely stabilised.“Today, at least 350 districts, which is nearly half of India, has less than 5% case positivity rate; and 145 districts are currently hovering on between 5 and 10% positivity rate. However, there are still 239 districts with more than 10% positivity,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Test positivity is the percentage of total positive tests from all Covid-19 tests that have been conducted. It helps determine the levels of disease transmission within the community. As per the World Health Organisation recommendations, transmission during an infectious disease outbreak can be said to be stabilizing if the test positivity rate remains under 5% for at least two weeks consecutively.Also Read | Aarogya Setu to display vaccination statusThe Centre has said the data in the first week of April showed India had less than 200 districts with more than 10% positivity. By the end of April, the number had jumped to nearly 600 districts. “...we are moving in the right direction... testing that has been ramped up as well as containment that has worked at the district level... However, it is not a sustainable solution; we have to find a mechanism for how we ease our containment, the lockdown, and that has to be done very gradually, and very slowly,” Bhargava said.VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said the peak went up beyond estimates driven by very highly transmissible variants. “But now it has been a few weeks since we crossed the peak, and there is an overall downward trend. However, we cannot afford to drop our guard and have to continue taking precautions including wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peak-crossed-covid-transmission-stabilising-says-centre-101622618284672.html

02-06-2021||India||Foreign-approved vaccines no longer need bridging trials in India: DCGI||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Dr VG Soman on Wednesday announced that vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) approved by specific countries and the World Health Organisation (WHO) no longer require post-approval bridging trials and batch testing in India. If the vaccine has been certified and released by the national control laboratory of certain countries or if it is listed in the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL), it can be exempted from the aforementioned requirement, stated a letter issued by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).Also Read: Covid vaccination drive: 238 mn doses per month needed to meet Dec target'Bridging trials', so called because they "bridge" the gap between studies conducted in several regions, are localised clinical trials that generate data in an India-specific context, thereby assessing the efficacy of a certain vaccine in Indian participants. This is important since certain pharmaceutical products react differently to Indian genetic makeup than how they might in American or European populations.Also Read: 'Will have enough Covid-19 vaccines by July to inoculate 1 crore people a day': ICMR chiefThe decision, it was said, had been taken because of the "huge vaccination requirements in India in the wake of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases". The drug regulatory body noted that although the "domestic manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines is getting augmented", the earlier order was being partially modified "to meet the national requirements".India's national drug regulatory body, the CDSCO, functions under the Directorate General of Health Services of the central government and, in essence, serves a similar function to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (PMDA) of Japan, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom.Also Read: WHO approves China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for global useThe letter issued by the DCGI on Wednesday modified its earlier guidelines regarding restricted emergency use approval in India of Covid-19 vaccines already approved for restricted use by the US FDA, the UK MHRA, the EMA, or the PMDA Japan. If the vaccine has been approved by the aforementioned top regulatory authorities in these specified foreign countries or if it has been listed in WHO EUL, the vaccine can be exempted from the requirement of conducting post-approval bridging clinical trials and the requirement of testing every batch of the vaccine by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) in Kasauli, the letter noted.The DCGI has also made an exemption from the requirements for "well-established vaccines from the standpoint that millions of individuals have already been vaccinated with the said vaccines".However, additional scrutiny and review shall continue, the DCGI said, and further analysis of the Covid-19 vaccines shall be undertaken by CDL Kasauli for batch release as per the standard procedures. Before the vaccine is rolled out for further immunisation programmes, the first 100 beneficiaries shall also be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes, along with other procedures for the filing of applications and timelines, it was said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreignapproved-vaccines-no-longer-need-bridging-trials-in-india-dcgi-101622611412866.html
02-06-2021||India||Explained: As Dominican top court hears Choksi’s extradition case, India faces legal issues in bringing fugitive home||The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court is set to hear fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi's extradition case on Wednesday. The jeweller mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, of which he is a citizen, and was arrested from Dominica last week on charges of illegally entering the island. Choksi's lawyer claimed that he did not flee Antigua, but was 'abducted' from the islands and honey-trapped by a woman.Choksi faces multiple charges of embezzling funds from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) in India to the tune of ₹13,500 crore. He had acquired citizenship of Antigua under its Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017, weeks before investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the PNB scam started.After he was arrested, India, which has no extradition arrangements with Dominica, sent a team of eight officials to the Caribbean country in an attempt to bring him back to the country. The Eastern Caribbean SC stayed the businessman's movement out of the country based on his lawyers’ appeal, and scheduled the hearing for Wednesday.A team of four seasoned lawyers from London that would represent Choksi in the court to prevent his deportation in court alleged that the businessman was honey-trapped by a woman he had known for six months and was abducted from her house, where she had called him for a meeting, by a group of men and taken on a yacht to Dominica. The legal team also claims that Choksi is not an Indian citizen anymore and has surrendered his Indian passport.An official familiar with the developments told HT that Choksi’s Indian citizenship had not been cancelled yet, even after he acquired Antigua's, and this could help India's case as it seeks his deportation from Dominica. India has not issued a certificate of surrender of passport to Choksi yet. However, India does not allow dual citizenship. According to Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, after Choksi was granted the citizenship of Antigua, he ceased to be an Indian citizen.“Any citizen of India who by naturalisation, registration, otherwise voluntarily acquires, or has at any time between the 26th January, 1950 and the commencement of this Act, voluntarily acquired the citizenship of another country shall, upon such acquisition or, as the case may be, such commencement, cease to be a citizen of India,” Section 9 says.However, the Interpol has issued a Red Notice against Choksi for financial crimes committed in India, and this could help India's case. For this to work, India would need to convince the Dominican court that he is a fugitive and the country has a strong legal case against him."As per Interpol Red Corner Notice, Dominica can deport Mehul Choksi at any time as he has no legal rights there. But, If Dominican court found that Choksi was kidnapped and forcibly taken to Dominica, he'd be deported to Antigua as his country of origin," former CBI director AP Singh told news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-as-dominican-top-court-hears-choksi-s-extradition-case-india-faces-legal-issues-in-bringing-fugitive-home-101622613236559.html
02-06-2021||India||Bhupesh Baghel questions absence of Congress state minister in a GST panel||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has accused the Centre of violating the principle of cooperative federalism by not including any minister from a Congress-ruled state in the panel formed to consider Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemptions and concessions on essentials needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.The (GST) Council on Saturday constituted an eight-member panel led by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma. The other members are state ministers from Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. While Kerala, Odisha and Telangana are ruled by opposition parties such as the Left, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Maharashtra is ruled by a coalition of Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress.Baghel has argued that ministers from Congress-ruled states, who are part of the GST Council, should be included in the Group of Ministers (GoM) formed to discuss the GST rates on Covid relief material, as their exclusion is against the spirit of cooperative federalism. For the last several days, opposition-ruled states including Congress-ruled Punjab were demanding GST exemption on vaccines, medicines and other devices used to fight the pandemic. Baghel alleged that Congress was deliberately left out of the panel to ignore this demand.The panel will consider GST exemptions or concessions for Covid vaccines, drugs, testing kits, medical grade oxygen, pulse oximeters, hand sanitisers, oxygen therapy instruments including concentrators, generators and ventilators, PPE kits, N95 masks, surgical masks, thermometers and any other items required for Covid relief. Currently, vaccines and cotton masks attract 5% GST, but most other items fall in the 12% tax slab, while alcohol-based sanitisers, hand wash gels, disinfectants and thermometers attract 18% GST.The GoM, which includes Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal, Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari, Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao and UP finance minister Suresh Kr Khanna, will submit its recommendations to the GST Council on or before June 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-questions-absence-of-congress-state-minister-in-a-gst-panel-101622610663561.html

02-06-2021||India||India lost 594 doctors during Covid second wave; most deaths in Delhi: IMA||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Wednesday said that 594 doctors died during the more infectious second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in the country. A chart showing the state-wise distribution of the fatalities in India was published by the organisation, and shared by news agency ANI on social media.Of the 594 doctors who died of Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, the most were in the national capital, Delhi, which became one of the worst-hit hotspots in India during this phase, the data showed. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand were close on their heels, with all of these states witnessing the deaths of scores of doctors during the second wave of Covid-19.The data shared by IMA showed that as many as 107 doctors had died in Delhi during the second wave. Bihar saw the deaths of 96 doctors, while 67 died in Uttar Pradesh, 43 in Rajasthan, and 39 in Jharkhand, too. However, the IMA being a voluntary organisation of physicians in India, it is possible that the actual number of fatalities far exceeds these statistics, since the association only keeps a record of its 3.5 lakh members, out of the 12-lakh-odd doctors in the country.The IMA data, however, provides a reliable approximation of the physician community's plight in India, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The five states which saw the highest number of deaths of doctors during this phase, according to the IMA, are:1. Delhi (107)2. Bihar (96)3. Uttar Pradesh (67)4. Jharkhand (39)5. Andhra Pradesh (32)The entire IMA Covid registry pertaining to the doctors' deaths can be found here:On a related note, the IMA has also recently raised its voice against violent incidents directed against doctors, healthcare staff, and healthcare establishments with or without reason. These incidents of healthcare violence have increased over the years and have become widespread and pose threat to the medical practice, it said.The IMA has urged Union home minister Amit Shah to consider its appeal on an emergency basis and implement an effective and strong law "against healthcare violence", to safeguard the healthcare professionals of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lost-594-doctors-during-covid-19-second-wave-most-deaths-in-delhi-ima-101622600603549.html
02-06-2021||India||Will begin distributing Nellore medicine in 4 days: Andhra govt||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government will take up the decentralised distribution of Krishnapatnam medicine prepared by ayurveda practitioner Bonige Anandaiah for Covid-19 treatment in another four to five days, officials said on Tuesday. Nellore district collector K V Chakradhar Babu held a meeting with Anandaiah along with superintendent of police Bhaskar Bhushan and YSR Congress Party MLA from Sarvepalli Kakani Goverdhan Reddy at his camp office in the afternoon to discuss the distribution of the herbal medicine. Last week, the state government had declared the medicine as “safe and harmless” and on Monday, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy allowed the distribution of the same in the form of oral supplements. The government, however, did not permit Anandaiah to administer the eye drops that were found to enhance the oxygen levels within a few minutes. After the meeting on Tuesday, the collector told reporters that the medicine would be distributed at different centres, instead of at Krishnapatnam alone, to avoid the gathering of a large number of people. “There is no need for the people to come in large numbers to Krishnapatnam. We shall send the medicine wherever it is required. We are also contemplating distribution of the medicine online,” he said. Babu added that Anandaiah required four to five days for the preparation of the medicine on a large scale as he had to collect the ingredients. “We shall follow all Covid-19 guidelines and take up the distribution of medicine in the places suggested by the revenue and police department,” the collector said. Anandaiah also appealed to the people not to come to Krishnapatnam immediately, as it would take some time for the preparation of the medicine. “We shall make an announcement well in advance over the distribution of the medicine,” he said. YSRCP MLA Kakani Goverdhan Reddy said authorities were planning to create a mobile application so that people from faraway places could place an order for the medicine without any trouble. On Monday, the chief minister gave his nod for the distribution of Krishnapatnam medicine by Anandaiah as a remedy for Covid-19. The decision was taken following a report by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Department of Ayush, Government of India. Jagan, however, refused permission for the eye drops since the reports on its efficacy were still awaited. “All the other reports of various labs revealed that there is no harm with the medicine being distributed by Anandaiah,” an official release from the CMO said. The officials told the chief minister that CCRAS had conducted trials to know whether these supplements cure Covid-19 and had not found any such evidence. No other lab or committee had given any certification that Krishnapatnam medicine is an effective cure for Covid-19, the CMO release said. “However, the CCRAS report confirmed that there is no harm with the ingredients used in the herbal preparations, but these cannot be recognized as Ayurvedic. If Anandaiah applies for its recognition as an Ayurvedic preparation, we shall consider it,” state Ayush commissioner Ramulu said. The official release also clarified that just because a person uses the Nellore medicine, he should not stop taking other Allopathic medicines prescribed for Covid-19. “One has to continue the medicines prescribed by the doctors for the virus. Taking Anandaiah’s medicine is only optional,” it said. Anandaiah said he did not intend to sell the drug, developed by him, commercially and would only distribute it to the public free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-begin-distributing-nellore-medicine-in-4-days-andhra-govt-101622576699965.html
02-06-2021||India||Man-animal conflicts claim 14 lives in Kerala this year||Thiruvananthapuram: Last week, a herd of wild elephants had strayed into the land of a small farmer P Vijayan in Kanjikode (Palakkad) town and it took authorities nearly three hours to force the jumbos back into the forests. But a lot of damage was already done by then as the farmer lost at least 500 fully-grown bananas among other plants. On Monday, Vijayan lost his cow in a leopard attack, prompting forest officials to set a cage to trap the strayed animal. At least 15 kms away from the farm, a tribal woman, Anjala Devi (42), was trampled to death on Friday while she had gone to the fringe areas of the forest to collect firewood. While 20 people were killed in various elephant attacks in the state last year, 14 were killed in a period of five months this year, forest officials said, admitting that the man-animal conflict was on the rise amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Thousands of farmers, especially those living close to the forest areas, have quit farming in the last five years due to frequent raids by elephants, wild boars, monkeys and other animals. During the lockdown, the absence of humans has only made the fields a favourite ground of the wild animals. “What is really heart-breaking is that they attack the farm when it is ready for harvest. Every year, we face huge losses and finally, we decided to stop farming,” one P Velayudhan in Wayanad in north Kerala said, adding that old techniques to ward off wild animals are no longer fruitful and that they have to abide by instructions from forest officials too. “There are conflicting reports about wild elephants but only a few of them are trouble makers. Animals in musth will be aggressive. Rogue ones... we radio collar them and track their movement quite often,” Palakkad divisional forest officer Kurra Srinivas said, adding that a healthy co-existence is must for both animals and humans for a healthy environment. In the hill destination of Munnar in Idukki district, a herd of jumbos often raid closed vegetable shops among others every evening. Feeling hassled, locals have started keeping bananas and other vegetables outside their shops to avert any damage to their shops. Keeping in mind that these jumbos have started freely moving around the town, even in the urban pockets during the lockdown, authorities have begun deploying forest guards as a precautionary measure to avoid any conflict with humans.These guards, however, admitted that fire crackers or fire balls are not enough to scare the animals.Officials also admitted that measures such as building trenches, solar fences and rail segregations have failed to prevent these animals from crossing over to areas of human settlement. Elephants often use dry branches to break solar fences, they added. According to wildlife experts, jumbo straying can be contained by keeping the elephant corridors intact. They believe that one of the main reasons for elephant attack in Idukki district is encroachment along the Anamalai-Periyar tiger reserve elephant corridor. Shrinking of their habitat and corridors force these jumbos to stray into human settlements, they said.“We need a healthy co-existence of both. If we respect the needs of both, we can lower the tension between them,” Dr P S Esa, a leading wildlife expert, said. Kerala has a robust forest cover of 29% of the total area and also has a healthy wildlife population with 190 tigers and 5,706 elephants. However, increasing forest encroachment in several parts of the state is becoming a source of concern for forest officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mananimal-conflicts-claim-14-lives-in-kerala-this-year-101622576640601.html
02-06-2021||India||Senior TRS minister set to join BJP||Hyderabad: Senior Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) legislator and former health minister Eatala Rajender, who was sacked form the state cabinet on May 2 following allegations of land encroachments, is all set to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in a day or two, a person aware of the development said. Rajender, who left for New Delhi on Sunday evening, met BJP national president JP Nadda along with state BJP president Bandi Sanjay and party in-charge of Telangana affairs Tarun Chugh on Monday night. The 57-year-old leader held discussions with Nadda for more than an hour over the recent developments in the state. “Rajender raised certain clarifications from the BJP chief, who assured him that he would get the due respect and recognition in the BJP. Nadda asked him to take an early decision on joining the party,” a senior BJP leader familiar with the development said. In the meeting, Rajender reportedly expressed doubts over the possibility of the BJP adopting a soft corner towards the TRS, citing TRS president and chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s friendly relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “However, Nadda told Rajender that the BJP would go all out against the TRS in the state as it had done in West Bengal. Our aim is to capture power in Telangana in the next elections and there is no doubt about it,” the BJP leader said. Rajender is expected to return to Hyderabad on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning and announce his decision to join the BJP. But before that, he will have to resign from the primary membership of the TRS and also his assembly seat. Another senior TRS leader and former MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, who also accompanied Rajender to Delhi, is likely to join the BJP, the person cited above said. Senior TRS leader and member of legislative council Palla Rajeshwar Reddy said Rajender has “dug his own grave” by deciding to join the BJP. “He came from a Communist background. Now, he is mortgaging his Communism with the saffron party,” Reddy criticised. Stating that the TRS had groomed several leaders in the last 20 years, Reddy said nobody in the party enjoyed so many positions like Rajender. “He was never without any position or post. He has betrayed the party and ridiculed the government schemes. You will pay heavy penalty for the same,” the TRS leader said. Rajender, who represents Huzurabad assembly constituency in northern Telangana, has been associated with the TRS since 2003 and held several important positions including party floor leader in the assembly, besides being the first finance minister of Telangana. During the second term of the TRS, Rajender was given the medical and health portfolio. According to political analysts, though Rajender has been loyal to the party for the last 18 years, there have been reports of serious differences between him and the party leadership on several issues. On multiple occasions, Rajender expressed his displeasure over the alleged humiliation meted out to him and other ministers by the chief minister. The cold war between Rajender and the TRS leadership culminated in stripping of his medical and health portfolio on May 1, when reports of his alleged land grabbing in Medak district surfaced in a section of local media. A day later, Rajender was sacked from the cabinet, following a report submitted by Medak collector confirming the allegations. Rajender has alleged that the TRS leadership unleashed a smear campaign against him and resorted to his character assassination. He said he was ready to face an investigation by a sitting judge or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In the last few weeks, Rajender met several leaders from different parties, including working chief of state Congress A Revanth Reddy and Congress Legislature Party floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, besides former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy, who was formerly with the Congress and is now an Independent, and Telangana Jana Samithi leader M Kodandaram, seeking their support to fight against the KCR government. He also met state BJP president Bandi Sanjay, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and others to discuss his future options.Union minister G Kishan Reddy said all party leaders will welcome Rajender’s entry into the BJP. “He had gone to Delhi only after consulting me and other senior BJP leaders. We shall hold a meeting with all the state BJP leaders and take them into confidence before Rajender joins the BJP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-trs-minister-set-to-join-bjp-101622576639975.html
02-06-2021||India||TN promotes Class 1 to 8 students without exams||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu directorate of elementary education on Tuesday promoted students of classes 1 to 8 in state board schools without the conduction of final exams. The decision was taken in view of the Covid-19 situation in the state. A circular to this effect was passed by the directorate on Tuesday, instructing chief educational officers of all districts to inform government, government-aided and private state board schools to declare classes 1 to 8 students all pass. Director of elementary education M Palanisamy in the circular said the decision was taken based on clause 2, Section 16 of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. “As per section 16 of the RTE Act, no student should be held back or expelled till the completion of elementary education. All students should be declared pass,” the circular said. Students of classes 9 to 11 had already been declared ‘all pass’ due to the pandemic situation. However, exams will be conducted for class 12 students. The circular added that the date of reopening of schools will be announced after the end of the ongoing lockdown. Chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday held a review meeting with school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi and other officials on class 12 board exam. “We will take a decision based on CBSE’s announcement on conducting class 12 examinations, which is expected soon,” Poyyamozhi told reporters after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-promotes-class-1-to-8-students-without-exams-101622576579939.html
02-06-2021||India||Illegal assets case: Did not threaten or influence any witnesses, Jagan tells CBI court||Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSR Congress Party president Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday told a special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Hyderabad that he had not threatened or influenced any witness directly or indirectly in an alleged disproportionate assets case being probed against him. Jagan’s remarks were in response to a petition filed by rebel YSR Congress Party MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju on April 29, seeking cancellation of the bail granted to Reddy in 2013.In a 98-page counter affidavit filed in the CBI court, the chief minister asserted that he had never violated the conditions imposed by the court nor did he, in any manner, threaten or influence any witness directly or indirectly. All the allegations made by the petitioner are baseless and do not warrant any consideration by the court, he added. Jagan said the petition seeking his bail cancellation was purportedly filed by Raju in the capacity of a third party. “It was misconceived in law and not maintainable, as Raju was trying to bring in personal political issues and personal vendetta into the criminal justice administration,” he said. The YSR Congress Party chief pointed out that the CBI, a central government agency, was investigating the case and Raju, being a third party, had no locus standi in seeking cancellation of his bail. Raju did not show any overwhelming circumstances to review the procedure of granting bail, he argued. “The Supreme Court has stated in several cases that any criminal process is between the state and the accused and no third party can intervene in such a process,” he said.Jagan alleged that Raju had filed a false affidavit before the court, stating that the rebel MP had no questionable antecedents whatsoever in nature. Raju is an accused in two crimes registered by the CBI in relation to fraudulent dealings with banks and siphoning of over ₹900 crore. Both the cases are under investigation. Jagan pointed out that his party had already made an appeal to the Lok Sabha Speaker, seeking disqualification of Raju from the Lower House for various misdeeds and acts of misconduct. “Raju’s petition clearly shows he is seeking to use criminal justice machinery for personal abusive purposes,” he said, and requested the court to dismiss the petition in the interest of justice. Responding to Jagan’s remarks, Raju told reporters in Delhi that the counter affidavit filed by Jagan in the CBI court lacked substance. “The allegations levelled by him against me are all baseless. I am confident that the court will go by the merit of the arguments,” he said. Meanwhile, the CBI also filed a separate counter affidavit, saying that it was leaving it to the court to decide on whether to continue or revoke the bail granted to Jagan. The court posted the next hearing for June 14. The YSR Congress Party chief, who has been facing the CBI case since 2011, had been in jail for 16 months between May 2012 to September 2013 before coming out on bail in 2013.The CBI has accused Jagan of getting investments running into several crores from various individuals and firms into his businesses as “quid pro quo” for favours bestowed on them during the tenure of his father Y S Rajasekhara Reddy as chief minister between 2004 and 2009.The CBI had filed a total of 11 chargesheet against Jagan and 12 others accused in the disproportionate assets and quid pro quo cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-assets-case-did-not-threaten-or-influence-any-witnesses-jagan-tells-cbi-court-101622576520427.html
02-06-2021||India||No law for husbands to act against wives in marital cases: Madras HC||Chennai: There is no law like the Domestic Violence Act which allows a husband to proceed against a wife in cases relating to marital disputes, the Madras high court has said.Justice S Vaidyanathan made this observation while hearing a case on a plea moved by a government veterinarian, Dr P Sasikumar, against the criminal proceedings initiated against him by his wife. Sasikumar had sought reinstatement in his job from which he was suspended based on a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife four days prior to the grant of divorce by a family court. The court observed that it appeared as though the respondent (wife) was unnecessarily harassing the petitioner anticipating a divorce order. In its order dated March 21, which was made available on Tuesday, the court quashed the suspension and ordered that the petitioner be reinstated in service. “Unfortunately, there is no provision like the Domestic Violence Act, to proceed against the wife by the husband,” the court said in its orders. Besides this, the court observed that it is important that such couples leave their ‘ego’ and ‘intolerance’ like footwear outside the house to ensure a child does not lead a miserable life. “The present generation must understand that marriage is not a contract, but a sacramental one. Of course, the word ‘sacrament’ has no meaning after coming into effect of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, that, approves live-in-relationship,” the court said. In this case, the petitioner in 2015 had moved a divorce petition contending cruelty and voluntary desertion by his wife, which was accepted by a family court. The court added that whether the petitioner is guilty or not of the allegations made against him by the wife in her complaint would have to be decided by the appropriate forum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-law-for-husbands-to-act-against-wives-in-marital-cases-madras-hc-101622576459905.html
02-06-2021||India||Black fungus toll in Karnataka jumps to 51||Bengaluru As many as 51 people have died due to Mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, so far in Karnataka. The state has so far reported 1,370 cases of black fungus, of which 27 patients have been discharged, while 1,292 are undergoing treatment, according to data shared by the state health department on Tuesday. Dharwad, about 430 km from Bengaluru, accounted for 14 deaths so far, according to data, indicating that the disease has spread to most districts in Karnataka, which continues to remain in the grip of the raging Covid-19 pandemic. The Karnataka government has formed a task force for black fungus besides initiating a death audit to determine the cause of the spike in infections. However, there is a shortage of medicines to treat the disease, which has so far claimed 51 lives and infected hundreds more, including a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old in the mineral-rich district of Ballari, about 320 km from Bengaluru, news agency PTI reported. Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Tuesday said though the state is getting supply of medicines (Amphotericin–B), but it is not adequate. “We are getting medicines, but it is not in proportion to our needs. Today also they have given us 1,400 vials but that is not enough,” Sudhakar added. He said a multi-disciplinary approach is required to treat the ailment. According to doctors and experts, a patient requires anywhere between 20-80 vials of this medicine. “With sudden rise in demand for #Amphotericin–B, used in the treatment of #Mucormycosis, domestic production was ramped up immediately. Over 1.63 lakh vials are available from existing domestic manufacturers in May which is about 260% higher than production in April,” DV Sadananada Gowda, Union minister for chemicals and fertilizers said in a post on Twitter. In another post on Twitter, he said over 270,000 vials of Amphotericin B have been allocated to states, union territories and central institutions from May 11-30. He added this was in addition to the supplies of 81,651 vials to states in the first week of May. Bengaluru accounted for 557 of the total 1,370 cases of black fungus in the state followed by Dharwad (156 cases) and Kalabuargi with 104 infections, state health department data shows. The Covid-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an increasing number of black fungus cases in several states of the country, adding to the challenges of spiralling health crisis in India. The cause of white and black fungus, both distinguished by their pigmentation, has been attributed, among other reasons, to the possibility of contamination either due to low-quality cylinders or low-quality piping systems at intensive care units of the hospital. Authorities are even trying to see if there has been contamination at the industry level from where the oxygen is being supplied due to improper sterilisation or any other reasons. According to officials, the usage of ordinary tap water in ventilators could also be a possible reason for improper sterilisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-toll-in-karnataka-jumps-to-51-101622576341345.html
02-06-2021||India||Karnataka minister signals at extending lockdown||Bengaluru: Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Tuesday said stringent measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 would remain in place in the state till daily new cases fall below the 5,000 mark or the case positivity rate drops below 5%. Sudhakar’s statement comes a day after the state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) made a similar recommendation to the government. Talking to reporters in Bengaluru, the health minister said: “I have submitted the report (to chief minister B S Yediyurappa). He (chief minister) has said that it (positivity rate) has to come down to 5% and (new cases) 5,000 cases per day, only then we can relax (the lockdown). Until then, it would be good to continue with these stringent restrictions. Whenever we unlock, we have to do it in a phased manner. It (daily cases) has come down as much as TAC wanted. We have to be cautious.” On Monday, TAC in its recommendation to the government had said that the lockdown should continue till the test positivity rate falls below 5%. The committee prepared a report in which it suggested that the lockdown should be observed for two more weeks after June 7 until the daily new cases fall below 5,000 and the case fatality rate falls below 1%. The committee unanimously drafted the recommendations with its chairman M K Sudarshan saying that the panel is “placing lives before livelihoods”. The daily Covid-19 case count in Karnataka fell to less than 20,000 in the state and to less than 5,000 in Bengaluru Urban district on Monday with around 1.2 lakh to 1.3 lakh tests being conducted every day. The test positivity rate recorded on Monday was 13.57% and the case fatality rate was 2.47%.Deputy chief minister and state Covid task force head Dr Ashwath Narayan also echoed similar views as the health minister, saying that the government would take a feasible decision with regard to the continuation or easing of lockdown restrictions based on experts’ opinion and facts and figures. “There is a possibility of the positivity rate dropping down if testing is done in 1:10 ratio (for each positive case, 10 contacts to be tested). But whatever the case, the decision with regard to lockdown will be taken by the government after considering experts’ opinions and thorough discussion,” he said. Meanwhile, left-wing parties in Karnataka organised a state-wide protest on Tuesday, demanding better policies from the state government to ensure the livelihood of the unorganised sector is not hampered in case of an extension of the lockdown. “The state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee on Monday had recommended that Karnataka continue the lockdown in a stricter form, thus ‘placing lives before livelihoods’. While the state government has to strengthen public health systems and ensure the people of Karnataka overcome the toll that the pandemic is having, it is also equally important that livelihoods are protected. People should not be left at the mercy of the state and their dignity must be upheld,” read a statement by CPI(M) Liberation. Workers from the unorganised sector, including street vendors, construction workers, pourakarmikas, sanitation workers and rural landless labourers, participated in the protest across Karnataka, including Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Ballari. The CPI(M) statement also demanded that treatment and medicines for Covid-19 patients and vaccination be made free for workers in the unorganised sector. They also demanded a direct cash transfer of ₹10,000 and free rations and “special protection for frontline and healthcare workers” and an employment guarantee for 200 days in the cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-signals-at-extending-lockdown-101622576220519.html
02-06-2021||India||10 million jabs a day by July-Aug: Centre||India will be in a position to vaccinate 10 million people every day by July or August, top officials said on Tuesday, backing statements made by the government’s representative in the Supreme Court that the country will deliver doses to all eligible individuals by the end of the year -- although it wasn’t immediately clear where the doses would come from.In May, India delivered an average of 1.93 million doses a day and several states ran out of supplies by the fourth week of the month for at least some groups of recipients. Experts say the government’s target will depend on availability of doses, which for June has been pegged at 120 million.“Shortage is what you feel if you want to vaccinate the country within a month. The total number of vaccinations done in the country is nearly equivalent to the total number done in the United States and our population is four times the population of the US. We have to have some patience. By the mid of year, mid-July or early August, we will have more than enough doses to vaccinate up to a crore (10 million) per day,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, the director general of Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR).“By December we hope to have the whole country vaccinated,” he said, while asserting that “there is no shortage”.The highest number of doses administered in a single day across the country was a little under 4 million in the second week of April. As on June 1, India has delivered 214.2 million of the 1.9 billion doses it needs to give to 940 million adults who are eligible for vaccines at present.Bhargava’s comments are in line with the government’s projections that it will have supplies of 2.16 billion vaccines between August and December alone. But 710 million of these are vaccines that are yet to be approved in India. Reuters said in a report that Serum Institute of India will likely miss its target of 750 million doses in these five months by 27% (or 200 million), and Bharat Biotech’s scale-up to 550 million doses is clouded in ambiguity with the company saying last week that there is a lag between production and availability, which means doses made in April will only be availablein July.Bhargava was speaking at the government’s routine briefing on Covid-19, where he also said states should follow a yardstick including test positivity rate and vaccination coverage to determine if they should lift lockdowns.“The opening up revolves on three pillars, the test positivity rate in that particular district has to be less than 5% for over a week, at least 70% of vulnerable population should be vaccinated, and ownership for Covid-19-appropriate behaviour as well as care should be taken up by the community in a big way,” he said.Vulnerable population includes anyone above the age of 60 or people older than 45 but with some existing illnesses that raise their susceptibility to severe Covid-19.Bhargava said that India was among few countries globally that are producing Covid-19 vaccines. “There’s Pfizer and Moderna being produced by the USA, Sputnik V produced by Russia, Covishield produced by the UK and India, Sinovac by China, and Covaxin produced from India. So, India is one of the five countries which are producing Covid vaccines. Imagine where we would be, if we were not producing vaccines. There is no shortage of vaccine; shortage is what you feel if you want to vaccinate the whole country within a month,” Bhargava said. To be sure, India will likely miss its original target of vaccinating 300 million people by the end of July, one set before the vaccine drive was expanded and opened up.Experts said it is possible to vaccinate all adults within that time provided the supplies are ramped up and more focus is put on states with weak health care delivery system.“It is doable to vaccinate adults by the end of this year if the supplies increase. However, more focus would be needed on states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh etc where health infrastructure is not as good as the southern or western states. In such states it could take longer to vaccinate people,” said Dr Sakthivel Selvaraj, director, health economics, financing and policy, Public Health Foundation of India.During the briefing, the officials also clarified some aspects of the government’s plans to study different combinations of vaccine doses.“Rumours are being floated that now we will only be giving single shot of Covishield vaccine; I would like to clarify on behalf of the government that Covishield schedule approved for use in India is a two-dose schedule: first dose and then 12 weeks later you are supposed to take the second dose. There is absolutely no change in that,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.Covaxin too will be given in a two-dose schedule, he added. “This is the schedule that India is following and there should be no misunderstanding or confusion about it,” he added.“The question being speculated is that if one has taken vaccine A as first dose, then can the second dose be with vaccine B? There are two possibilities: one is that a body may react adversely with such mixing of doses (it is under scientific consideration, especially for a vaccine that is developed using a different platform); and another possibility is that immunity enhances after taking second shot of a different vaccine. But severe reaction and harm cannot be ruled out; therefore, there’s research going on in other countries,” said Paul.The government representatives also said that infections data showed that in the first week of April, fewer than 200 districts had more than 10% positivity, and by the end of the month, the number had jumped to nearly 600 districts where more than 10% of samples were turning up positive.“Today, there are still 239 districts with more than 10% positivity; 145 districts are between 5 and 10% positivity rate; and 350 districts, which is nearly half of India, is less than 5% case positivity rate,” said Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-million-jabs-a-day-by-july-aug-centre-101622575130896.html
02-06-2021||India||Goa moves HC against Tejpal order||Panaji: The Goa government has called a verdict acquitting journalist Tarun Tejpal of rape and sexual assault by additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi as “perverse” and “influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies”, and filed an appeal filed before the Bombay high court at Goa.The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21. The Goa government filed an appeal against the verdict in the Bombay high court last Tuesday. In its amended appeal against the judgment, the Goa Police have said that the verdict was “shocking in its apparent legal bias against the prosecutrix” and that the judgement was “unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy” and that “much of the impugned judgment has been consumed by sexual gossip and alleged sexual fantasies related to the prosecutrix which were legally prohibited”.The appeal is scheduled for hearing on Wednesday. “The trial court, in its 527-page-judgment, has been influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies, graphic details of the past sexual history of the victim, prohibited by law, and has used the same for purposes of censuring her character, and discrediting her evidence. The entire judgment focusses on indicting the complainant witness rather than trying to ascertain the culpable role of the respondent accused (Tejpal),” the appeal stated. Goa Police also contended that the trial court completely discarded the testimony of the survivor despite the fact that “her statement given in court, gave a clear and cogent account of the incidents of sexual harassment, rape, sexual assault, outraging of modesty, use of criminal force, and wrongful restraint and confinement”.“When it suggests that it is unsafe to rely on her testimony as she is well educated, a good writer, proficient in English and above all conversant with the rape law, and was a capable, intelligent, independent person, the Trial Court, unfortunately, deploys the prosecutrix’s strengths and accomplishments to dispute her testimony,” the appeal said.The state has sought that the judgment be set aside and Tejpal be convicted on the offences he was charged off since “the court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted”.The state has also argued that the victim was subjected to a rigorous cross examination extending to almost 700 pages, spread over eighteen dates of hearing but which was “nothing short of a brutal attack on her character and alleged past sexual history designed to shame and humiliate her.” “Not only should these questions have been disallowed while recording evidence, but the trial court has gone so far as to use these very questions and materials to discredit her, although they were neither relevant to the case, nor could they have been put to her under law,” the state has argued. Tejpal, who was relieved at being acquitted, had thanked judge Kshama Joshi after his acquittal. “In November 2013 I was falsely accused of sexual assault by a colleague. Today the Hon’ble Trial Court of Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi, in Goa, has honourably acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age, where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth,” he said.The verdict, among other points, suggested that the woman did not behave in a manner consistent with a victim of sexual assault after the alleged incidents. “The printouts of photographs clearly proves that the prosecutrix was absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal and smiling at the time she… did not look distressed or traumatized in any manner whatsoever though this was immediately a few minutes after she claims to have been sexually assaulted by the accused putting her in a state of panic and trauma,” the court said.Experts, however, contend that there is no template of correct behaviour after or even during an incident of sexual assault, rape and harassment, and that survivors often feel the need to appear “normal” out of fear of retribution by the assailant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-moves-hc-against-tejpal-order-101622575980534.html
02-06-2021||India||Darkest year in four decades: Chidambaram on economy||New Delhi: Former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday slammed the Union government for its handling of the country’s finances and urged it to borrow or print money and spend it aggressively without worrying about the fiscal deficit. He was reacting at a virtual press conference to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) figures showing a negative growth of 7.3% in the 2020-21 fiscal and called it “the darkest year of the economy in four decades” that left “most Indians poorer than they were two years ago”. “This is not the time to worry about the fiscal deficit. We can’t lose another year like we lost the last year. But the way the government is reacting, we are going to lose another year. My advice to the government is (to) act boldly and spend. Borrow or print money and spend,” he said at the press conference, adding that India has the sovereign right to print money.Chidambaram said in his opening remarks that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and chief economic adviser K Subramanian “began to sell the story of a recovery” after the first wave of Covid-19 seemed to ebb. “They saw ‘green shoots’ when no one else did. They predicted a V-shaped recovery. It was a false story,” he said, accusing the government of misleading the people. To be sure, the economy did recover sharply -- from a contraction of 24.4 in the first quarter of the fiscal to a growth of 1.6% in the last. But the second wave of the pandemic has roiled the economy again in April and May.The former finance minister also said that the per capita GDP falling below ₹1 lakh to ₹99,694 has been “the most worrying” development. “In percentage terms it is a decline of (-) 8.2% over the previous year. It is lower than the level achieved in 2018-19 (and maybe even 2017-18). The deeply worrying conclusion is that most Indians are poorer than they were two years ago,” Chidambaram said.In multiple interviews last week, CMIE chief Mahesh Vyas has said that the household income of 97% of India’s households have declined on account of the pandemic. The Congress leader also shared his apprehension that the fiscal pinch felt by the states due to the Centre not paying them their GST revenue share will impact the vaccination programme, while the overall economic situation has pushed millions of people back to below the poverty line. He also pitched for direct cash transfers and said, “The PM said, we give free ration. It translates to ₹32 per head. More and more economists are supporting cash transfers to the needy.” Chidambaram also criticised Sitharaman for not doing enough to stop the downward slide of the economy. “Unless you take steps now, how can you tackle the third or fourth wave? The finance minister said budget proposals will kick in. The budget was placed on February 1. Today is June 1. How long will it take for the budget proposals to kick in?” ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darkest-year-in-four-decades-chidambaram-on-economy-101622575979895.html
02-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi saga sparks row across Caribbean islands||Antigua and Barbuda prime minister Gaston Browne on Tuesday denied his government’s involvement in fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi’s disappearance from his country, even as a political row erupted in Dominica, where the 62-year-old has been apprehended, with allegations of the island’s government being part of a plot along with Antigua.Indian-born Choksi mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, whose citizenship he holds, last Sunday, but was detained by Dominican police on Tuesday night on charges of illegally entering the island. The two islands are roughly 100 nautical miles apart.Dominica’s leader of opposition, Lennox Linton, in an interview with HT, targeted PM Roosevelt Skerrit over the alleged abduction of Choksi, accusing him of being part of a plot that undermines the protection guaranteed to citizens of the region under the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC).Linton, leader of Dominica’s United Workers’ Party (UWP), demanded full investigation into the conduct of the police. “There has to be an investigation as to ‘who knew’, ‘who did what’, ‘why they did it’ and ‘how did we find ourselves in this situation where we appear to be facilitating this very unfortunate set of circumstances,” Linton said.Browne, speaking with local media in Antigua, denied his government’s involvement in Choksi’s disappearance. “Let me state here that even though Choksi’s citizenship was unsettled, we respected his legal and constitutional rights as a citizen, and we did nothing to abridge those rights whilst he was on Antiguan and Barbudan soil,” he said. He has been attacked by the political opposition in the country for allegedly not providing protection to Choksi as a citizen of the island nation.Meanwhile, Caribbean-based Associates Times reported on Tuesday that Mehul Choksi’s younger brother Chetan Chinubhai Choksi, who landed in Dominica on May 29, met Linton for two hours and promised to pay for election campaign in return for his support. Reacting to the report, the family’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “It is another one in the series of cock and bull stories being planted. Indeed Mr Chetan Choksi has arrived in Dominica to ensure medical attention to his brother. But he is in under mandatory quarantine and he cannot move out of his hotel quarantine facility. So all these stories are desperate attempts to malign my clients.”The Mehul Choksi saga took a sensational turn on Monday with people familiar with the matter saying that a woman, who had become friendly with him over the past six months, played a part in his disappearance.In New Delhi, an official said that a team that flew to Dominica last Friday to seek Choksi’s deportation includes two officers from the CBI, including a DIG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-saga-sparks-row-across-carribean-islands-101622575559755.html
02-06-2021||India||Brics backs Covid-19 vaccine patent waivers||The Brics grouping on Tuesday endorsed an India-South Africa proposal for patent waivers for Covid-19 vaccines and called for sharing of doses, transfer of technology, and development of vaccine production capacities in order to turn the tide in the fight against the coronavirus disease.Against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, members of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping reaffirmed the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and the need to resolve problems through peaceful means.A virtual meeting of foreign ministers of Brics states, which was chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, also resolved to combat all forms of terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists, terror financing networks, and safe havens.Jaishankar and his counterparts from the four other countries – China’s Wang Yi, Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco França, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor – focused on the response to the Covid-19 crisis and equitable access to vaccines during their deliberations.India and South Africa have been pushing for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since last year, and all the Brics members agreed on Tuesday to support this measure as part of efforts to ensure timely, affordable and equitable access to diagnostics, vaccines and essential health products and technologies and their components to combat the pandemic.“The ministers reaffirmed the need to use all relevant measures...including supporting ongoing consideration in WTO on a Covid-19 vaccine intellectual property rights waiver and the use of flexibilities of the TRIPS agreement and the Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health,” said a joint statement on reforming the multilateral system that was adopted at the meeting.The ministers reiterated the need for sharing vaccine doses, transfer of technology, development of local production capacities and supply chains for medical products, and promotion of price transparency, and sought “due restraint in the implementation of measures that could hinder the flow of vaccines, health products and essential inputs”. They also called for timely operationalisation of the Brics vaccine research and development centre.This was the first time the Brics foreign ministers agreed on a stand-alone joint statement on strengthening and reforming the multilateral system. They agreed that such reforms have to cover all key multilateral institutions, including the UN and its organs such as the Security Council and General Assembly, global financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, the multilateral trading system including WTO, and the global health system with the WHO at its core.The foreign ministers also agreed on six principles that should guide such reforms, including making instruments of global governance more inclusive and representative, changes based on inclusive consultations while respecting sovereign independence, making multilateral organisations more responsive and transparent, and strengthening countries and global organisations to better respond to emerging and non- traditional challenges such as terrorism, cybersecurity and fake news.Though there was no official word on whether the India-China standoff figured in the discussions, Jaishankar said in his opening remarks that Brics strives for an inclusive and equitable multipolar international system that respects the territorial integrity of all states.Such a multipolar system is “based on international law and the UN Charter, that recognises the sovereign equality of all states, and respects their territorial integrity while displaying mutual respect for interests and concerns of all”, he said.Asked about the India-China differences at a press conference after the meeting, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said the Brics members reaffirmed the principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and the need to “resolve any problems with peaceful means”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side was able to get Brics members to agree to strong language on counterterror cooperation, including the reference in a joint media statement to “cross-border movement of terrorists, terror financing networks and safe havens”.The Brics members referred to the counterterrorism strategy adopted at the grouping’s summit last year, and reiterated their commitment to finalise a “result-oriented action plan” by the Counter-Terrorism Working Group in 2021.The statement on reforming the multilateral system said the foreign ministers reaffirmed the sole authority of the UN Security Council for imposing sanctions and called for “further consolidation and strengthening of the working methods of UN Security Council sanctions committees to ensure their effectiveness, responsiveness and transparency”.On the issue of Afghanistan, the other Brics states echoed India’s consistent stand and underline the need to preserve gains made over the past 20 years in the war-torn country. They stressed the need to protect the rights of all Afghan nationals, especially women, children and minorities, and called for an immediate ceasefire. They also stressed the “urgent necessity of the elimination of the threat of UNSC proscribed terrorist groups to lasting peace in Afghanistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-backs-vaccine-patent-waivers-101622574659675.html

All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP Jai Prakash Agarwal are the other members of the committee.After the meeting, Sidhu said he was there at the high command’s invitation. “My stand was the same, is the same and will be the same that the democratic power of people that goes to the government in the form of taxes should go back to the people... each citizen must be made shareholder in progress. The truth may be punished but it cannot be defeated. We have to make the truth victorious and defeat anti-Punjab forces,” the cricketer-turned-politician told reporters.Between June and October in 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib took place in Faridkot district, leading to huge resentment and protests in the state. On October 14 that year, two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan. On the same day, police also opened fire on protesters in Kotkapura. The chief minister had promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and police firing.On April 9 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation carried out by the state police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The state government has constituted a new SIT in accordance with the court order.Though the Amritsar East MLA made a brief statement after the meeting but did not take any questions from the media. Later, Pargat Singh, who is considered close to Sidhu, is learnt to have raised questions over the chief minister’s working style, his failure to deliver on key poll promises and the public perception about Captain and the Badals being close.During his one-on-one meeting, the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA also handed over to the committee members copies of a letter that he wrote to the CM around 18 months ago, expressing displeasure over the state government’s performance. “Though there has been no issue regarding the flow to funds for development works, there are several promises that are still to be kept,” the former India hockey captain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-stand-on-cm-still-same-sidhu-to-cong-panel-101622574482324.html
02-06-2021||India||MHA allows use of Liquid O2 in some industries as cases drop||New Delhi: The ministry of home affairs (MHA) allowed the supply of oxygen to certain industries on a temporary basis subject to ensuring an adequate supply of medical oxygen to hospitals and other medical purposes as number of Covid-19 cases are coming down and demand for medical oxygen easing.The government had, in April last week, diverted all the liquid oxygen meant for all non-medical purposes and manufacturing industry for medical use as the number of cases were skyrocketing and several states had reported a shortage of oxygen to treat critically-ill coronavirus disease patients amid rising deaths.. Only sectors exempted at that time were defence, ampules and vials making industry and pharmaceuticals. In its order on Monday, the MHA decided to exempt more industries for use of liquid oxygen, which include - continuous process industries/ plants such as furnaces, refineries, steel, aluminum, copper processing plants, etc. which require continuous power supply; infrastructure projects and plants; Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); exporters of manufacturing sector requiring oxygen for production, and food processing units. The ministry said that “the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) may allow usage of liquid oxygen to the above-mentioned industries/ projects/ units on a temporary basis subject to ensuring an adequate supply of liquid medical oxygen to hospitals and other medical purposes as per demands of states/ Union Territories as well as adequate supply to industries/sectors such as ampules and vials, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing of oxygen cylinders and PSA plants, neutral glass tubing and defence forces”. The industries had approached the DPIIT in this regard.

02-06-2021||India||‘In every single case, treat virus early and treat it hard’: Steve Kirsch||More than a year after Covid-19 turned into a pandemic, there are few therapies that have proven to work. Scientists and clinicians are studying a host of drugs and therapeutics to create a new line of defence against the virus but clinical trials are yet to lead to conclusive evidence on any of these. The Covid-19 Early Treatment Fund (CETF) takes a different approach to this by funding outpatient clinical trials for effective early treatments. In an interview to HT, the fund’s founder Steve Kirsch says India must focus on ensuring people begin treatment for Covid-19 early. Edited excerpts:In your advocacy, you focus on early treatment of Covid-19. How important is it?Every virus, without exception, should be treated early. And this one, in particular, is devastating. So we’re talking about using repurposed drugs for Covid-19. It’s an advice that we have for other diseases and for other viruses. Dr David Ho (known for key research on HIV and AIDS) wrote a famous editorial years ago on how to treat HIV. And it said that you treat it early and hard. For Ebola, the advice from the World Health Organization was, don’t wait for treatments to be proven; take risks, make mistakes, but treat it... The two arguments we can repurpose... is that in every single case, you must treat it early and you must treat it hard – that way you‘ll get better results.There are two particular drugs you suggest should be used for early treatment – ivermectin and fluvoxamine. Tell us a little about the case for using these.There are 23 studies that have been done from hundreds of researchers all over the world. And every single one of them, except for one, shows that ivermectin always had a positive effect. And it was a large positive effect, like 65%, or 75%, or more...For fluvoxamine, people say you only have two studies -- a double blind randomised control trial and a real-world evidence trial, where the patients got to choose. In the second one, 125 patients at Golden Gate Fields hospital (in US) who were treated recovered with full marks. None of them were hospitalised versus 12.5% of the patients who chose not to.How does early treatment make a difference?If instead of treating people in four days after symptoms, they treat people five days after symptoms..it’s set up for failure. And this happened before in sepsis, where a doctor, Paul Merrick, discovered that if you get vitamin C within four hours, every single person can be saved.What’s your assessment of drugs and therapeutics that are on the horizon?I think proxalutamide is very interesting. I’m impressed with the results...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-every-single-case-treat-virus-early-and-treat-it-hard-steve-kirsch-101622574299654.html
02-06-2021||India||9,346 kids orphaned by pandemic, SC told||The tally of children who lost a parent or were orphaned during the pandemic could be much higher than the figure of 9,346 provided by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to the Supreme Court in an affidavit on Monday. This came to light as the Supreme Court heard the state and Union territory administrations in a suo motu petition on Tuesday and found differences in the data uploaded on the NCPCR website, Bal Swaraj.In a note supplied to amicus curiae in the case, Gaurav Agrawal, the Maharashtra government stated that since March 2020, 140 children became orphans due to the pandemic while 4,451 children lost a parent. But the data provided by NCPCR in its affidavit showed that Maharashtra had 80 orphans and 716 children who lost a parent.Maharashtra told the court that the discrepancy was on account of technical glitches faced in uploading the data on the NCPCR website. Maharashtra counsel Sachin Patil informed the court that data entry happens in six stages, but the district child protection officers found it difficult to enter data as information about the children wasn’t available.Rajasthan also reported the same problem.NCPCR counsel Swarupama Chaturvedi informed the court that the information on the portal need not be complete as the respective districts can just fill in the basic information. The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Anirudhha Bose extended the time for the states to upload the data to June 5.HT on Monday reported that, as per NCPCR’s affidavit, between March 2020 and May 29, a total of 1,742 children became orphans while 140 were abandoned due to Covid; 7,464 children lost a parent. This data was uploaded by 25 states and five union territories and added up to 9,346.The court also directed additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to file an affidavit explaining the ‘PM CARES for Children’ scheme: how it works, how the beneficiaries are identified, and how it will be monitored.The next hearing will be held on June 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9347-kids-orphaned-by-pandemic-sc-told-101622574300265.html
02-06-2021||India||SC calls for early release of eligible convicts||To curb the spread of Covid-19 in overcrowded Indian jails, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered probation boards to reconvene and consider the early release of eligible prisoners. It relied on its May 7 order for the release of prisoners serving light sentences on the grounds of right to life.An application filed by lawyer Sachin Yadav drew the court’s attention to the fact that many such prisoners were languishing in prison as these boards had not convened during the pandemic.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose felt it appropriate to direct the boards to continue working and consider remission pleas of prisoners entitled for premature release under the CrPC.Yadav was represented by advocate Shoeb Alam, who referred to a May 7 order of the top court aimed at decongesting prisons during the pandemic that said prisoners charged with non-heinous crimes be granted interim bail or parole for 90 days.“Though there is no mention of release of prisoners entitled to premature release under Section 432 and 433A of CrPC, it is directed that the competent authority — probation boards shall continue to proceed with the release of those prisoners who are entitled for premature release,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-calls-for-early-release-of-eligible-convicts-101622573221369.html
02-06-2021||India||Centre to focus on covid among children amid concerns over 3rd wave: Paul||The Centre on Tuesday announced that it is focusing on coronavirus disease among children and is preparing operational guidelines for the same, a move aimed at countering concerns that have been raised about the third Covid-19 wave impacting children who are not vaccinated.“Childhood Covid-19 disease is gaining our attention. We have said earlier that paediatric population is generally asymptomatic; they get infection but their symptoms are minimal, almost nil. It often does not take serious enough shape to require hospitalisation. But the situation can change in paediatric population also if the virus happens to change its behaviour, or epidemiological dynamics see a change in future, then there is a possibility that in children Covid-19 disease severity may also increase,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The government has been systematically looking at all related scientific developments on the subject. “About 2-3% of children currently require hospitalisation but we are preparing to handle at least two-and-a-half times more patient load as suggested by the expert panel. The government will act on the recommendations that include revised clinical management. We are working very systematically, comprehensively to address the problem of paediatric Covid-19 disease,” said Paul. “...we are keeping a tab at all sorts of scenarios, and pushing preparedness measures accordingly.”The Centre has created a dedicated group of experts to look at childhood Covid-19 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-focus-on-covid-among-children-amid-concerns-over-3rd-wave-paul-101622573219585.html
02-06-2021||India||Mucormycosis | 'Save younger patients first': HC to Centre||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the central government to prioritise younger people over older ones to give Amphotericin-B, a last-line drug used to treat mucormycosis that is in acute shortage across the country due to an unprecedented spike in cases.Covid-19 vaccination drive: 238mn doses per month needed to meet Dec targetThe court said that the young are the “future of the country” and need to be saved, while the elderly have “lived their life”, and that the government should learn from foreign countries such as Italy that adopted a similar policy to treat the coronavirus disease when cases were spiraling.“You have to make a policy decision because everyone can’t be catered to. We need to protect our future, the youth. That is where our promise is. That is the age group which is going to build the country... It is not an area where God will be able to help us if we don’t help ourselves because facts and figures are all before us,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh.Mucormycosis is a secondary infection being reported in increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients. Of the 848 cases recorded in the second wave, 41 have recovered while 59 have succumbed to it. The remaining are still in hospital. Treatment has been hobbled by the scarcity of the only drug that helps.The bench noted that supply of Amphotericin-B was about a third of the requirement, and said: “The administration of the drug to the patients who have better chances of survival may have to be prioritised. Similarly, the patients who are younger and who hold promise for our nation in the future, may have to be prioritised in comparison to the older generation which has lived its life and on whom others will not be as dependent.”At the same time, however, the bench clarified that it was not for a moment discounting the emotional and psychological support that the older generation provides to the families, particularly Indian families that are so closely bonded. But, it added, that difficult choices will have to be made in difficult times.“We therefore direct the Union of India to frame a policy with regard to distribution of Amphotericin-B among the patients, and once the policy is made, allocation should be made on the basis of that policy,” said the bench.Citing an example of other countries, the court remarked: “Why are you feeling shy? It is the duty of the government to lay down the way forward...In Italy, they said `Sorry for old people we don’t have beds’.. and rightly so.”It, however, said that while carving out such a policy, exceptions should be made for older people who are serving the nation in high positions.The court asked the Centre to file its status report on Friday.Central government standing counsels Amit Mahajan and Kirtiman Singh told the court that the issue was being considered by the government, and a decision would be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-hc-tells-centre-to-save-younger-patients-first-101622573159615.html
02-06-2021||India||Covid vaccination drive: 238 mn doses per month needed to meet Dec target||For India to meet its target of vaccinating its entire adult population by the end of 2021, the country needs to administer 1.88 billion doses in total, of which 1.67 billion or 89% are yet to be administered. This means that the country needs to deliver 238 million doses every month from June or risk falling behind target, shows data analysed by HT.To vaccinate everyone, including those below 18 years of age by the end of 2021, India needs to administer 2.51 billion doses from June to December, or 359 million doses every month from June.In the race for vaccination, as is the case in a run chase in cricket, a slower run rate at the beginning of an innings requires slogging as the inning progresses. This concept may play a crucial role in India meeting its target, as if it falls behind in its initial months, the year-end target may get more and more difficult to meet.Till May 31, the country has administered over 215 million doses, the third highest number of total doses delivered in any country (behind only China and the US).According to the Co-WIN dashboard, the fastest rate at which India has vaccinated so far is 3.8 million doses per day (based on rolling seven-day average).For June, the 120 million doses the government says will be available work out to four million doses a day, and administering these should not require any enhancement in existing infrastructure and manpower. However,at this rate, it will take until July 23, 2022, to vaccinate just the country’s adult population, leave alone the entire population (which would take till February 2022).The required rateAccording to a press briefing by Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday, India plans to vaccinate its entire eligible population by December. As against the 238 million doses per month needed for this from June onwards, India appears to be beginning this chase with a slower rate next month with only 120 million doses likely to be available. This means a higher required rate from July: 258 million doses per month for adult vaccination, and 398 million doses per month for universal vaccination.What are the possible scenarios going forward? In May, 79.4 million doses were available, which is to increase to 120 million in June. This amounts to a 51% month-on-month growth in supply. Assuming the country is able to replicate this result in the coming months, India will have 181 million doses in July, 274 million in August, 414 million in September, and 626 million in October.All of this would require a massive increase in infrastructure and manpower.However, once the required rate matches the rate of supply (or scoring rate to use the cricket analogy), one can assume that the pace will be sufficient to meet the December target. This analysis shows that if the supply increases to 274 million per month by August – and stops there – then the adult population will be vaccinated by December. To vaccinate everyone by December, supply will have to keep growing at least until October at 51% per month.How does this compare with rates so far?To be sure, the government said on Tuesday it may have as many as 10 million doses available per day (translating to 300 million a month) in July and August – this is twice the highest single day doses administered in India till date (around 5 million). It isn’t clear how the government arrived at this number.However, even at the rate of 5 million doses a day, it will take till April 27 next year for the country to cover adults and till October 2022 for the entire population.As stated above, to vaccinate all adults by December, India needs to increase monthly supply to 274 million by August or daily doses to 9.13 million; and to vaccinate everyone,it needs to increase monthly supply to 626 million by October, or daily doses to 20.9 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/238mn-doses-per-month-needed-to-meet-dec-target-101622573040319.html
02-06-2021||India||Some states begin special vaccination for students going abroad||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have started vaccination of students with confirmed admission in foreign universities, HT has learnt. The move comes a few days after state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray announced the special drive.“My friends managed to get a slot on the first two days itself, and even though the system can act as a hindrance whenever we try to confirm slots, I finally managed to get my shot on Tuesday," said 25-year old Akriti Pandya, who works in a Mumbai MNC and has confirmed admission for MBA in an Australian University.Maharashtra government's directive to give the second dose of Covid-19 within six weeks would help Pune-based Siddhant Yelwande, a 22-year-old student, who has been admitted into the University of Minnesota, USA. “My second dose on CoWin app was assigned for August 24 even though I was supposed to reach the university on August 23,” he said.Kerala, Karnataka and Telangana have also followed Maharashtra's footsteps by allowing priority vaccination to students going abroad for studies. While Kerala has a special portal for students, Karnataka has provided an email id for the same.Last week, the Kerala government decided to give the second dose of Covishield vaccine to students who are travelling abroad for studies after four to six weeks of the first jab as against the 12-16 week gap recommended by the Union health ministry.The Kerala government has also decided to issue vaccine certificates carrying passport numbers and other details. It has also opened a special portal for those who want the second dose of vaccine on priority. The applicants need to produce documents supporting immediate travel and once the application is approved they will be given the second dose as well as the vaccination certificate.According to the state health ministry, at least 2,000 students have applied for the preferential vaccine so far. Before the onset of the pandemic, an average of 20,000 students went abroad for higher education from the state.Also read: China and BRICS stand with India in its fight against the pandemic - Chinese FMKarnataka has also come up with similar guidelines with a special vaccination drive starting from Tuesday. The drive aims to vaccinate around 300 students going abroad for higher education.“Vaccination confirmation was not attached to the passport but with the PAN card and Aadhar card. But now, to facilitate the students and employees going abroad, it has been linked to passports,” Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, deputy chief minister of Karnataka and head of the state’s task force on Covid-19 said in a statement.Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments have announced a special drive for vaccinating students going abroad but haven't begun the process yet. The officials in the two states said the process would start in a few days after the guidelines are issued.Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO of Leverage Edu, an AI-based startup that helps students with their study-abroad process, said the move is a big relief for students. “In times like these, state governments need to empathise with the fact that students invest a lot of time and resources to get into their dream universities,” he said.In a recent survey of 5,000 students registered on its platform, Leverage Edu found that 94% were keener to travel and study abroad this year compared to last year. Of those surveyed, 58% said they made their plans within the last three months and 36% said they had these plans in place for much but are able to execute them only now.Leap, another platform and education-centric neo bank that facilitates end-to-end solutions for study-abroad aspirants, said the vaccination drive will allow students to reach their universities for the fall semester. “Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, international students have been dealing with a lot of uncertainty with regards to their classes, whether they would be able to fly or not. Many students who were supposed to start their classes last year deferred their degree to this year, hoping to be able to attend offline classes,” said Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Leap.No such special vaccination drives have been announced in several other states such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, among others.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-begin-special-vaccination-for-students-going-abroad-101622572706270.html

In addition, it is important to understand the drivers of vaccine hesitancy and reduced uptake, clinical spectrum of the disease and its progression. Also there is a need to formulate the clinical management protocols in line with the emerging global evidence," the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.It had it has initiated research on COVID-19 in 'task force and intramural mode'. These projects were formulated to address the most pressing research questions in the following domains -- clinical research, diagnostics and biomarkers, epidemiology and surveillance and operations research, it added."ICMR now invites independent researchers all across the country to contribute to the scientific knowledge related to COVID-19 by submitting their innovative research ideas as brief concept proposals in the following identified priority areas,” the apex research body said.All concept proposals have to be submitted online at https://epms.icmr.org.in as a brief 3-4 page concept note on/before June 30, the ICMR said.All concept proposals will be screened at ICMR.If approved by the screening committee, selected investigators will be requested to submit full proposals. The full proposals will be thoroughly reviewed by Project Review Committees and decision will be made accordingly, the apex research body said.The priority areas include epidemiological and surveillance studies to assess the impact on development of variants between those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in a limited geographic area, seroprevalence studies to determine susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2, as well as follow up seroprevalence studies at sites covered earlier to measure the impact of vaccination/herd immunity level, the IMCR said.It also includes surveillance of COVID-19 reinfections in previously infected individuals with same/different SARSCoV-2 strains, effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission, developing an appropriate model for surveillance of COVID-19 in schools and colleges.The priority areas also includes studying immune escape of variant SARS-CoV-2 strains in vaccinated individuals, immunological aspect and vaccine efficacy research to study immunological response to the COVID-19 vaccines in different populations/population sub-groups in the country , duration of protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines, and factors affecting it (age, sex, comorbid status, ethnicity, the ICMR said.It also includes studies on correlates of immune protection (in vaccinated as well as naturally infected individuals), assessment of antibody and antigen-specific responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected and naïve individuals immunised with COVID-19 vaccines, efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in previously infected individuals, and potential scope of single-dose vaccination in such individuals to boost immune response, determining the need and timing of a third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose by measuring antibody titres and their persistence in vaccinees after the second dose of the vaccine and interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccine among others.Besides, priority areas include clinical research to study changes in COVID-19 mortality/ severity/ hospitalisation after vaccination, research on post COVID syndrome/Long COVID, and assessing differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, if any, clinical trials of repurposed and new drugs and studies to assess the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and breastfeeding women in programmatic mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-icmr-asks-independent-researchers-to-share-scientific-knowledge-101622569623049.html

02-06-2021||India||China creates combined air defence system along LAC||China’s People Liberation Army (PLA) has integrated elements of the air force and army to create a combined air defence system for its western theatre command that is responsible for operations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the latest in a series of moves indicating a strengthening of its positions in the region.The move follows numerous reports of China moving in new military equipment and formations into Tibet and Xinjiang, and bolstering air defence and missile positions and airports on its side of the LAC amid a border standoff with India that began more than a year ago.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that PLA had, for the first time, integrated army air defence units in the air force’s chain of command in the western theatre command to create a combined air defence control system.This new system was put through its paces during a recent exercise at an unknown location under the western theatre command, which saw army elements jointly training with the air force while command and control was exercised by the air force, the people said.“At least 10 PLA army units under the western theatre command are believed to have been integrated in the reporting chain for sharing inputs on early warning, combined readiness status and exercise participation as part of this new joint air defence set up,” one of the people cited above said.“It appears that PLA air force is controlling all the air defence network assets along the LAC, and it appears the Chinese side has felt an urgent need to put all such assets of the army and air force under a central control to avoid any fratricide and to ensure their optimum use,” the person added.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur, a defence commentator who closely tracks developments on the LAC, said such a development in normal times would be seen as part of routine steps by a country to ensure military preparedness. “But since we have a confrontation, we must view it in that context and make plans accordingly,” he said.The Chinese side appears to be bringing all air defence assets into one grid and plugging gaps that can be exploited by the Indian Air Force (IAF), he said. “There have been reports of additional radar stations and other set-ups being created and the Chinese side seems to be in for the long run. Their aim would be to blunt the strike potential of the IAF, which they know will spearhead any Indian response,” he added.Disengagement of Indian and Chinese frontline troops along the LAC stalled following a drawdown of forces and armoured units on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. Diplomatic and military talks have not led to a breakthrough at other friction points on the LAC such as Depsang Plains, Gogra and Hot Springs.Ties between the two sides plunged to an all-time low following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley in June last year that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and several Chinese troops – the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has made it clear that restoration of peace and tranquillity on the LAC through disengagement and de-escalation alone can be the basis for restoring normal ties in other areas such as trade and investment.Satellite imagery from last month showed that after withdrawing its forces from around Pangong Lake, China relocated a large section of troops and equipment to nearby Rutog County, where new military barracks have been built since 2019.The open-source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter said the new structures at Rutog include a large motor pool that includes support and offensive units, troop accommodation including prefabricated heated units and tents, camouflaged positions believed to hold supplies and weapons, and munitions storage facilities.The scale and proximity of the deployment in Rutog suggests the PLA is continuing to hold itself in depth areas near the LAC, experts said.A steady stream of satellite imagery and reports in recent months have shown that China is strengthening its position all along the LAC, building villages in previously uninhabited areas and building and reinforcing highways and airports to facilitate the speedy deployment of troops.A report issued by Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy, last September had said China has more than doubled the number of airbases, air defence positions and heliports near the LAC since 2017. China began building at least 13 new military facilities near the LAC after the 2017 standoff at Doklam, and work on four heliports began after tensions erupted in Ladakh, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-creates-combined-air-defence-system-along-lac-101622544473501.html
02-06-2021||India||Normal monsoon likely this year: IMD||Monsoon rainfall, a key variable in the health of the rural economy, is likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its second-stage long-range forecast on Tuesday. There is a 40% probability that is likely to be 96% to 104% of LPA, or the average rainfall (88cm) recorded from 1961 to 2010. In its first-stage monsoon forecast in April, IMD said the rainfall was likely to be 98% of LPA after two years of above-average rainfall.The monsoon arrives first in Kerala around June 1. It is expected to cover the rest of the country by July 5. The monsoon onset has been delayed by two days, IMD said in its revised forecast on Sunday. IMD previously said that the start of the monsoon would be on May 31, a day ahead of schedule.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the four-month season that is crucial for the country’s farm-dependent economy and for rice, soybeans, and cotton cultivation. A normal monsoon this year will significantly help the agriculture sector. Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the pandemic. India has over 150 million farmers and nearly half of Indians are dependent on a farm-based income. As much as 60% of India’s net-sown area does not have access to irrigation.Also Read | Monsoon progress slow but IMD hopeful that it will reach Kerala on June 3Agriculture is one of the mainstays of its economy. Monsoon spurs farm produce and improves rural spending. The monsoon impacts inflation, jobs, and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and help inject demand into the economy. Nearly half of India’s population depends on a farm-based livelihood. The monsoon also replenishes 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.M Mohapatra, IMD director-general, said they use multi-model ensemble forecasting which considers projections from the best models and that the forecasts are better and more accurate closer to monsoon. “The first stage forecast was issued in April and then we monitored the conditions for entire May and found that monsoon is likely to normal and spatially well distributed,” he said.Northwest India is likely to record normal rain at 92 to 108% of LPA. Central India is likely to record above-normal rain of over 106% of LPA. Southern Peninsula is likely to record between 93 to 107%. Northeast India is expected to record below normal rain at less than 95% of LPA.For the first time, IMD has issued a special monsoon forecast for the monsoon core zone stretching from Odisha to Maharashtra and Gujarat, where agriculture is largely rainfed. In the monsoon core zone, monsoon rain is likely to be above normal over 106%.IMD said the monsoon is likely to be well distributed spatially across the country. “Most parts of the country are expected to receive normal to above-normal rainfall during the season,” IMD said in a statement.Normal to above normal rain is likely in June at 92% to 108% of LPA. The spatial distribution for June suggests above normal rainfall probability over most areas of eastern parts of central India, along the planes of the Himalayas and east India. Below normal probability is likely in northwest India and southern parts of the peninsula and some areas of northeast India.IMD said La Niña conditions, which are associated in India with strong monsoon and above-average rains and colder winters, turned neutral in April end. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, is neutral. It is likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific Ocean through the monsoon.ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures. In India, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon.The 2020-2021 La Niña event has ended and neutral conditions (neither El Niño nor La Niña) are likely to dominate the tropical Pacific in the next few months, World Meteorological Organization said on Tuesday. Air temperatures are expected to be above average between June and August, especially in the northern hemisphere. There is very little chance of El Niño conditions developing now.Mohapatra said ENSO neutral conditions are associated with normal monsoon years. “We are also expecting above average rains in the core monsoon zone and over central India. This happens when the monsoon trough is active and low-pressure areas develop over the Bay of Bengal. We have to see if that is happening. From models, it appears to be a good year.”He said the monsoon is a dynamic system. “On May 15, we had said its onset is likely around the normal date of June 1. But the criteria for declaring monsoon were not fulfilled. Now conditions are very gradually becoming favourable, and we are expecting the onset of monsoon around June 3.”G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad, said good rains in the Kharif season are good news. He added but because of the lockdown and the second pandemic wave of the pandemic getting labour and inputs for sowing has become difficult. “We have also seen prices of various farm produce have come down in many rural areas. Health costs have increased because of Covid-19. Farmers will need support to repay loans. It is a good sign that at least rains will be normal during this distressing period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-across-the-country-imd-101622533674177.html
